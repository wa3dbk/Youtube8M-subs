00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
a moment to launch and then here we go

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.540

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.540 
USB flash drive some of the quad-channel
ones<00:02:10.140> will<00:02:10.290> do<00:02:10.410> up<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.649> about<00:02:10.800> 25<00:02:11.220> megabytes

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
ones will do up to about 25 megabytes

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.190 
ones will do up to about 25 megabytes
per<00:02:11.700> second<00:02:12.180> so<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> assume<00:02:12.690> this<00:02:12.780> one's<00:02:13.020> a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
per second so I assume this one's a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.240 
per second so I assume this one's a
dual-channel<00:02:13.470> one<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.860> should<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.070> done

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
dual-channel one this should be done

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.890 
dual-channel one this should be done
fairly<00:02:17.489> shortly<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.209> guess<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.630> could<00:02:18.810> have

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
fairly shortly I guess I could have

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.630 
fairly shortly I guess I could have
chosen<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.290> smaller<00:02:19.410> video<00:02:19.890> file<00:02:20.130> if<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.430> really

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
chosen a smaller video file if I really

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.940 
chosen a smaller video file if I really
wanted<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:21.120> anyway<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.320> advantage<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:22.800> you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
wanted to anyway the advantage that you

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.440 
wanted to anyway the advantage that you
get<00:02:23.190> with<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> locker<00:02:23.670> plus<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.209> you

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
get with the locker plus is that you

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.949 
get with the locker plus is that you
have<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.040> data<00:02:26.040> encryption<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.060> what<00:02:27.870> I'm

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
have the data encryption so what I'm

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.690 
have the data encryption so what I'm
going<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.170> do<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:28.470> once<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:29.010> file<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.459> on<00:02:29.550> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
going to do is once this file is on the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.430 
going to do is once this file is on the
drive<00:02:29.880> I'm<00:02:30.060> going<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.270> take<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.510> out<00:02:30.600> put<00:02:31.320> it

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
drive I'm going to take it out put it

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.350 
drive I'm going to take it out put it
back<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> computer<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.610> then<00:02:32.820> we'll<00:02:33.239> see

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
back in the computer and then we'll see

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.030 
back in the computer and then we'll see
the<00:02:33.480> little<00:02:33.570> prompt<00:02:34.110> where<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.350> should<00:02:34.590> ask

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
the little prompt where it should ask

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.920 
the little prompt where it should ask
for<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> password<00:02:35.489> before<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.269> can<00:02:36.570> actually

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
for a password before I can actually

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.320 
for a password before I can actually
access<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.440> drive

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:54.040 

that's<00:02:43.930> cool<00:02:44.110> one<00:02:44.350> patient

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.970 

almost<00:02:55.040> done

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.360 

and<00:02:59.069> there<00:03:00.000> we<00:03:00.239> go<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.140> file<00:03:01.319> is<00:03:01.530> copied<00:03:01.739> so

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
and there we go so the file is copied so

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.589 
and there we go so the file is copied so
I'm<00:03:02.430> gonna<00:03:02.550> go<00:03:02.730> ahead<00:03:02.849> and<00:03:03.000> pull<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.330> out<00:03:03.450> of

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
I'm gonna go ahead and pull it out of

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.070 
I'm gonna go ahead and pull it out of
the<00:03:03.720> computer<00:03:03.989> now<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:05.360> can<00:03:06.360> find<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.750> there<00:03:06.989> it

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
the computer now I can find it there it

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.740 
the computer now I can find it there it
is<00:03:07.200> okay<00:03:08.099> we<00:03:08.370> have<00:03:08.489> removed<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.879> now<00:03:09.360> let's<00:03:09.599> try

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
is okay we have removed it now let's try

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.130 
is okay we have removed it now let's try
again

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
again

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.710 
again
plug<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.810> let's<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:12.900> what<00:03:12.989> happens

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
plug it in and let's see what happens

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.160 
plug it in and let's see what happens
here<00:03:15.720> we<00:03:15.840> go

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
here we go

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.949 
here we go
so<00:03:16.440> can<00:03:16.800> I<00:03:16.860> just<00:03:17.069> open<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.400> folder<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:18.630> view<00:03:18.810> that

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
so can I just open a folder to view that

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.870 
so can I just open a folder to view that
oh<00:03:20.000> no<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.300> cannot<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:22.739> have<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.160> actually<00:03:23.310> run

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
oh no I cannot so I have to actually run

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.410 
oh no I cannot so I have to actually run
the<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.690> autorun<00:03:25.110> okay<00:03:25.590> open<00:03:25.890> autoplay<00:03:26.420> run

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
the the autorun okay open autoplay run

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.140 
the the autorun okay open autoplay run
the<00:03:27.569> launcher<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:29.040> now<00:03:29.220> hopefully<00:03:29.549> it'll<00:03:29.970> give

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
the launcher so now hopefully it'll give

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.400 
the launcher so now hopefully it'll give
me<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:31.459> choice<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.910> just<00:03:33.299> put<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.200> password

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
me a choice to just put in the password

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.710 
me a choice to just put in the password
and<00:03:34.830> access<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.519> data<00:03:35.760> yeah<00:03:36.120> there<00:03:36.330> we<00:03:36.450> go

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.910 

I've<00:03:39.720> never<00:03:39.930> actually<00:03:40.110> used<00:03:40.319> an<00:03:40.620> encrypted

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
I've never actually used an encrypted

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.460 
I've never actually used an encrypted
USB<00:03:41.160> before<00:03:41.790> okay<00:03:42.000> there's<00:03:42.209> my<00:03:42.360> hint<00:03:42.599> so<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.260> can

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
USB before okay there's my hint so I can

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.539 
USB before okay there's my hint so I can
log<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.840> there<00:03:46.590> we<00:03:46.680> go<00:03:46.829> there's<00:03:47.069> my<00:03:47.190> data

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
log in and there we go there's my data

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.589 
log in and there we go there's my data
so<00:03:47.940> if<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.269> copy<00:03:49.140> this<00:03:49.470> into<00:03:49.769> here<00:03:50.329> yeah<00:03:51.329> copy

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
so if I copy this into here yeah copy

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.680 
so if I copy this into here yeah copy
and<00:03:51.780> replace<00:03:52.370> we<00:03:53.370> can<00:03:53.519> see<00:03:53.670> how<00:03:53.819> quickly<00:03:54.480> we

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
and replace we can see how quickly we

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.270 
and replace we can see how quickly we
can<00:03:54.870> read<00:03:55.110> off<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.410> drive<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:55.980> can<00:03:56.130> see

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
can read off the drive so you can see

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.710 
can read off the drive so you can see
the<00:03:56.400> reads<00:03:56.579> are<00:03:56.760> quite<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:56.970> bit<00:03:57.060> faster<00:03:57.360> than

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
the reads are quite a bit faster than

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.020 
the reads are quite a bit faster than
the<00:03:57.780> writes

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
the writes

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.069 
the writes
bear<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.150> mind<00:04:00.180> you're<00:04:00.480> gonna<00:04:00.569> get<00:04:00.750> slower

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
bear in mind you're gonna get slower

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.839 
bear in mind you're gonna get slower
results<00:04:01.680> if<00:04:01.799> you're<00:04:01.950> using<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.400> number<00:04:02.730> of

results if you're using a number of

results if you're using a number of
small<00:04:03.120> files<00:04:03.389> versus<00:04:03.900> one<00:04:04.049> large<00:04:04.380> file<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.760> I'm

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
small files versus one large file so I'm

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.000 
small files versus one large file so I'm
