quite this smooth it is worth mentioning

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.400 
quite this smooth it is worth mentioning

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
there's going to be an update to it

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.569 
there's going to be an update to it
because<00:02:54.150> color<00:02:54.420> OS<00:02:55.109> 2.1<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.129> still<00:02:56.430> the
