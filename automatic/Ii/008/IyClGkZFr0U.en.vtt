okay then we're back with with lesson

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.350 
okay then we're back with with lesson
number<00:00:06.540> two<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:07.049> now<00:00:07.799> it's<00:00:08.160> about<00:00:08.490> making<00:00:08.970> an

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
number two and now it's about making an

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.970 
number two and now it's about making an
basic<00:00:10.290> animation<00:00:11.540> will<00:00:12.540> use<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.469> same<00:00:13.500> tool

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
basic animation will use the same tool

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.099 
basic animation will use the same tool
as<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.370> did<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.030> previous<00:00:15.179> lesson<00:00:15.809> and

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
as we did in the previous lesson and

keyboard you hold shift down and you
drag<00:00:26.099> try<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:29.340> first<00:00:29.550> thing<00:00:29.820> you

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
drag try it out and the first thing you

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.840 
drag try it out and the first thing you
need<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.179> know<00:00:30.269> about<00:00:31.070> animation<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.250> it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
need to know about animation is it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.380 
need to know about animation is it
requires<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.260> object<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.950> be<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.340> symbol<00:00:36.030> to

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
requires the object to be a symbol to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.700 
requires the object to be a symbol to
make<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.590> symbol<00:00:37.800> we<00:00:38.129> press<00:00:38.370> F<00:00:38.610> F<00:00:39.320> F<00:00:40.320> eight

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
make it a symbol we press F F F eight

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.180 
make it a symbol we press F F F eight
and<00:00:41.180> we<00:00:42.180> open<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> menu<00:00:42.899> convert<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:44.010> symbol

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
and we open the menu convert to symbol

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.760 
and we open the menu convert to symbol
we<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.270> call<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.829> Paul<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:49.079> make<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
we can call it Paul and make it a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.209 
we can call it Paul and make it a
graphic<00:00:50.870> there<00:00:51.870> are<00:00:52.050> also<00:00:52.350> movie<00:00:52.829> clip<00:00:53.010> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
graphic there are also movie clip and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.670 
graphic there are also movie clip and
button<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.449> use<00:00:54.629> graphic<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:57.320> as<00:00:58.320> we

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
button but we use graphic now and as we

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
button but we use graphic now and as we
see<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.449> that<00:01:00.449> frame<00:01:00.870> rate<00:01:01.109> are<00:01:01.350> 24<00:01:02.010> frame<00:01:02.850> when

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
see in that frame rate are 24 frame when

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.340 
see in that frame rate are 24 frame when
frames<00:01:03.989> per<00:01:04.290> second<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.519> therefore<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.390> go<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
frames per second so therefore we go to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.450 
frames per second so therefore we go to
and<00:01:07.860> square<00:01:08.610> when<00:01:09.210> number<00:01:09.869> 24<00:01:10.350> s<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:11.159> press

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and square when number 24 s and we press

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
and square when number 24 s and we press
f6<00:01:12.500> this<00:01:13.500> makes<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.159> new<00:01:14.460> black<00:01:15.030> key<00:01:15.479> frame<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
f6 this makes a new black key frame and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.020 
f6 this makes a new black key frame and
a<00:01:16.290> black<00:01:16.530> key<00:01:16.830> frame<00:01:17.100> means<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.729> there's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
a black key frame means that there's

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.289 
a black key frame means that there's
something<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.590> you<00:01:19.590> see<00:01:19.799> here<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.189> blank<00:01:20.939> key

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
something in it you see here a blank key

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.690 
something in it you see here a blank key
frame<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.930> something<00:01:22.439> which<00:01:22.830> doesn't<00:01:23.250> have

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
frame is something which doesn't have

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.770 
frame is something which doesn't have
anything<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:25.520> then<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.540> gray

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
anything in it and then and the gray

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.420 
anything in it and then and the gray
between<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.439> just<00:01:28.829> normal<00:01:29.280> frames<00:01:29.700> which

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
between is just normal frames which

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.810 
between is just normal frames which
contains<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.880> same<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.540> black<00:01:34.759> now<00:01:35.759> we

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
contains the same as the black now we

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.550 
contains the same as the black now we
make<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:38.250> bigger<00:01:38.880> by<00:01:39.390> pressing<00:01:39.780> Q<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:42.560> we

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
make this a bigger by pressing Q and we

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.810 
make this a bigger by pressing Q and we
can<00:01:43.770> also<00:01:44.310> move<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.909> bit<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:46.189> now<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.610> have

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
can also move it a bit and now we have

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.590 
can also move it a bit and now we have
the<00:01:48.299> start<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> beginning<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.130> movie

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
the start and the beginning of the movie

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.230 
the start and the beginning of the movie
instead<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.899> drawing<00:01:52.350> every<00:01:53.250> circle<00:01:53.850> in

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
instead of drawing every circle in

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.280 
instead of drawing every circle in
between<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:56.189> make<00:01:56.520> flash<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.719> we

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
between we just make flash to it so we

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.690 
between we just make flash to it so we
right<00:01:58.770> click<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.280> gray<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.079> select<00:02:01.079> create

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
animation and with some fancy you can

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.120 
animation and with some fancy you can
make<00:02:20.000> something<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.180> bit<00:02:21.720> cool<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.709> made

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
make something a bit cool like I made

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.900 
make something a bit cool like I made
here<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:25.020> took<00:02:25.200> me<00:02:25.260> about<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.980> don't<00:02:26.489> know<00:02:26.550> 30

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
here it took me about I don't know 30

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.640 
here it took me about I don't know 30
seconds<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:29.450> yes<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.690> show<00:02:30.870> what<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.620> can

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
seconds and it yes to show what you can

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.130 
seconds and it yes to show what you can
do<00:02:31.860> with<00:02:32.160> with<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.180> techniques<00:02:33.959> i

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
do with with just the techniques i

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.750 
do with with just the techniques i
showed<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.440> now<00:02:34.680> see<00:02:35.190> black<00:02:35.970> key<00:02:36.150> frame<00:02:36.450> and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
showed you now see black key frame and

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.100 
showed you now see black key frame and
there's<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.880> difference<00:02:39.330> between<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.780> lot<00:02:40.050> of

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
there's a difference between a lot of

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.979 
there's a difference between a lot of
them<00:02:44.420> let's<00:02:45.420> make<00:02:45.690> another<00:02:45.930> object<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.769> we'll

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
them let's make another object and we'll

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.530 
them let's make another object and we'll
with<00:02:48.989> animated<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.620> one<00:02:49.890> too<00:02:52.580> we'll<00:02:53.580> just

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
with animated this one too we'll just
