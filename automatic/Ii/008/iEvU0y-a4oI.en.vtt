 called in the world and both of scandar 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.280
 they rest on the bottom of the sea but 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.960
 second nothing was known until now 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.780
 group of researchers led by

 Microsoft have finally found it 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.800
 the remains of the mus like this 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.600
 between the 30s and 40s the navy 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.050
 Japanese imperial built two huge 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.940
 battleships Yamato twins and muses and they were 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.100
 so big that the third one in project 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.770
 it was altered halfway but for 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.630
 turn it into an aircraft carrier the two 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.010
 only members of the legendary class 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:30.280

 of sleeve and weighed 73 thousand tons 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.610

 go down to the battleship on a nearby island 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.910
 to avoid its loss the boat finished 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.880
 sinking and nothing was heard from him 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.350
 for 71 years the team of paul allen 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.230
 has been the first to find the 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.360
