convincingly I think I written very well
so<00:00:23.060> at<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> beginning<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.630> knew<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:25.050> he<00:00:25.529> he<00:00:26.279> he

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
so at the beginning I knew that he he he

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.300 
so at the beginning I knew that he he he
played<00:00:27.150> very<00:00:27.480> well<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.779> his<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.410> his<00:00:28.710> game<00:00:28.949> when

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
played very well on his of his game when

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.639 
played very well on his of his game when
he's<00:00:29.670> serving<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.820> written<00:00:32.820> very<00:00:33.030> well<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
he's serving so I written very well and

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.860 
he's serving so I written very well and
all<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.860> opportunities<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> have

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
all the opportunities that I that I have

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.889 
all the opportunities that I that I have
I<00:00:37.140> think<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.739> play<00:00:38.460> really<00:00:38.850> concentrate<00:00:39.660> focus

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
I think I play really concentrate focus

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.500 
I think I play really concentrate focus
aggressive<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.040> then<00:00:41.219> when<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.270> serve

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
aggressive and then when I have to serve

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.930 
aggressive and then when I have to serve
I<00:00:42.750> serve<00:00:42.989> pretty<00:00:43.290> well<00:00:43.440> also<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.980> take<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
I serve pretty well also so take a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.540 
I serve pretty well also so take a
little<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:45.809> advantage<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
little but advantage of this then in the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.369 
little but advantage of this then in the
second<00:00:47.820> set<00:00:48.000> i<00:00:48.030> play<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.809> believe<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.140> guess
