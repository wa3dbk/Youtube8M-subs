genuine<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.379> honest<00:03:47.680> looking<00:03:47.980> because<00:03:48.220> it

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
genuine and honest looking because it

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.750 
genuine and honest looking because it
looks<00:03:49.510> like<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.930> permanent<00:03:50.410> kin<00:03:50.590> that's<00:03:51.519> the

looks like a permanent kin that's the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.849 
looks like a permanent kin that's the

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
reason why the internet loves it but I

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.470 
reason why the internet loves it but I
think<00:03:53.949> really<00:03:54.340> why<00:03:54.579> people<00:03:54.879> resonate<00:03:55.120> with

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
think really why people resonate with

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.449 
think really why people resonate with
her<00:03:55.629> is<00:03:55.870> because<00:03:56.199> she's<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.709> survivor

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
her is because she's a survivor

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.580 
her is because she's a survivor
the<00:03:57.730> way<00:03:57.849> she's<00:03:58.090> overcoming<00:03:58.629> disabilities

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
the way she's overcoming disabilities

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.589 
the way she's overcoming disabilities

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
she is a disabled cat that typically

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.750 
she is a disabled cat that typically
wouldn't<00:04:01.900> have<00:04:02.109> had<00:04:02.620> much<00:04:02.889> of<00:04:02.949> the<00:04:03.129> lunch<00:04:03.340> just

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
wouldn't have had much of the lunch just

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.780
