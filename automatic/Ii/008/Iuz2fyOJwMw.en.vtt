works and how does the equipment works

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.970 
works and how does the equipment works
all<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.490> way<00:00:11.610> long<00:00:11.929> so<00:00:12.929> let's<00:00:13.259> go<00:00:13.469> equipment

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
all the way long so let's go equipment

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.150 
all the way long so let's go equipment
first<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:15.109> as<00:00:16.109> far<00:00:16.320> as<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.560> can<00:00:16.710> see<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.980> have

first and as far as you can see you have

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.060 
first and as far as you can see you have
three<00:00:17.460> tabs<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.940> top<00:00:18.170> weapon<00:00:19.170> protection<00:00:19.920> and

three tabs on top weapon protection and

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.689 
three tabs on top weapon protection and
vehicles<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.420> there<00:00:22.260> are<00:00:22.289> weapons<00:00:23.160> for

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
vehicles so there are weapons for

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.689 
vehicles so there are weapons for
protection<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.099> of<00:00:26.099> course<00:00:26.580> attack<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:28.699> take

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
protection and of course attack so take

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.910 
protection and of course attack so take
a<00:00:29.730> look<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.720> way<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.869> bottom<00:00:31.230> scroll

higher attack of all equipment offered
so<00:01:04.280> what<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.600> enough<00:01:06.869> money

have enough supply and buildings to

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.670 
have enough supply and buildings to
support<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:11.820> may<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.210> two<00:01:12.900> kinds<00:01:13.470> of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.070 
weapon and play both attack and defense
some<00:01:17.340> people<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.700> play<00:01:18.150> defense<00:01:18.600> because

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
some people just play defense because

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.380 
some people just play defense because
they<00:01:19.259> simply<00:01:19.500> collecting<00:01:20.310> money<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.939> build<00:01:21.150> up

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
they simply collecting money to build up

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.039 
they simply collecting money to build up
that's<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.930> good<00:01:22.080> strategy<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.680> well<00:01:24.049> same

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that's a good strategy as well same

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.230 
that's a good strategy as well same
thing<00:01:25.320> works<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.920> protection<00:01:26.549> there<00:01:27.150> is

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
thing works with protection there is

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.950 
thing works with protection there is
protection<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:28.080> attack<00:01:29.040> power<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.960> would

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
protection with attack power I would

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.319 
protection with attack power I would
call<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.320> if<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.430> scroll<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.000> way<00:01:33.240> down

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
call it if you scroll all the way down

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.140 
call it if you scroll all the way down
here<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:34.560> will<00:01:34.740> find<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.159> guy's<00:01:35.400> oh<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
here you will find this guy's oh I

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.200 
here you will find this guy's oh I
haven't<00:01:36.900> noticed<00:01:37.380> yet<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.369> corrupt<00:01:38.909> cop

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
haven't noticed yet that corrupt cop

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.460 
haven't noticed yet that corrupt cop
asked<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.680> about<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:43.350> can

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
asked for it just about to as you can

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.539 
asked for it just about to as you can
see<00:01:43.710> there<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.399> bomb<00:01:44.939> squad<00:01:45.270> suit<00:01:46.159> 67<00:01:47.159> defense

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
see there are bomb squad suit 67 defense

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.960 
see there are bomb squad suit 67 defense
but<00:01:48.149> they<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.420> 27<00:01:49.110> attack<00:01:49.579> which<00:01:50.579> means<00:01:50.850> that

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
but they have 27 attack which means that

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.300 
but they have 27 attack which means that
they<00:01:51.299> also<00:01:51.810> personal<00:01:52.470> bodyguards<00:01:53.040> who<00:01:53.159> have

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
they also personal bodyguards who have

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.520 
they also personal bodyguards who have
lower<00:01:53.670> rate<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.450> defense<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.259> they<00:01:55.350> have

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
lower rate of defense but they have

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.249 
lower rate of defense but they have
higher<00:01:56.070> attack<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.240> probably<00:01:57.479> want<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
higher attack so you probably want to

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.030 
higher attack so you probably want to
maintain<00:01:58.439> both<00:01:59.369> if<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.700> play<00:01:59.939> attack<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.689> well

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
maintain both if you play attack as well

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.010 
maintain both if you play attack as well
but<00:02:02.040> right<00:02:02.369> now<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:02.610> have<00:02:03.210> corrupted<00:02:03.630> cups

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
but right now we have corrupted cups

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.210 
but right now we have corrupted cups
which<00:02:04.380> exceed<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.549> amount<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:06.290> previous<00:02:07.290> bomb

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
which exceed the amount of previous bomb

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.740 
which exceed the amount of previous bomb
squad<00:02:08.580> suit

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
squad suit

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.100 
squad suit
it's<00:02:10.710> 32<00:02:11.340> attack<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.820> 78<00:02:12.240> defense<00:02:12.600> so<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> would

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
it's 32 attack and 78 defense so I would

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.170 
it's 32 attack and 78 defense so I would
rather<00:02:13.290> go<00:02:13.560> with<00:02:13.770> these<00:02:13.920> guys<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:15.120> will

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
rather go with these guys and I will

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.310 
rather go with these guys and I will
solve<00:02:15.540> 46<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.560> rest<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.090> usually<00:02:18.480> buy<00:02:18.660> 50

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
solve 46 of the rest so I usually buy 50

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.100 
solve 46 of the rest so I usually buy 50
because<00:02:19.920> sometimes<00:02:20.370> they<00:02:20.550> get<00:02:20.670> nuked<00:02:21.120> killed

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
because sometimes they get nuked killed

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.810 
because sometimes they get nuked killed
or<00:02:22.410> whatever<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.070> have<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.340> fulfil<00:02:23.730> it

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
or whatever so you have to fulfil it

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.610 
or whatever so you have to fulfil it
again<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.990> spend<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.500> extra<00:02:26.100> millions

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
again so you spend the extra millions

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.730 
again so you spend the extra millions
and<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:29.400> course<00:02:29.700> all<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.600> 46<00:02:31.230> previous

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
and of course all of the 46 previous

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.970 
and of course all of the 46 previous
ones<00:02:34.400> well<00:02:35.400> now<00:02:35.700> let's<00:02:35.970> go<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.810> last<00:02:37.020> tab

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
ones well now let's go to the last tab

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.370 
ones well now let's go to the last tab
which<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.610> vehicles<00:02:39.090> all<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.810> machinery<00:02:40.140> in

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
which is vehicles all the machinery in

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.420 
which is vehicles all the machinery in
half<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:42.180> it's<00:02:42.959> works<00:02:43.470> pretty<00:02:43.830> much<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.100> same

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
half and it's works pretty much the same

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:52.190 
half and it's works pretty much the same
well<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.480> same<00:02:45.690> way<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.860> might<00:02:47.010> have<00:02:47.250> oh<00:02:51.200> now

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
well the same way you might have oh now

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.470 
well the same way you might have oh now
you<00:02:52.560> see<00:02:52.739> they<00:02:52.860> changed<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.700> highest<00:02:54.090> its

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
you see they changed the highest its

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.440 
you see they changed the highest its
private<00:02:54.930> jet<00:02:55.170> they<00:02:55.320> have<00:02:55.470> 62<00:02:56.160> attack<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.850> 40

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
private jet they have 62 attack and 40

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.449 
private jet they have 62 attack and 40
defense<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.170> it's<00:02:58.410> better<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.890> maintain<00:02:59.250> just

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
defense so it's better to maintain just

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.750 
defense so it's better to maintain just
50<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.880> this<00:03:00.060> actually<00:03:00.750> they<00:03:01.739> don't<00:03:02.100> kind<00:03:02.580> of

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
50 of this actually they don't kind of

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.540 
50 of this actually they don't kind of
died<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.900> game<00:03:04.140> if<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.709> play<00:03:04.950> at<00:03:05.070> a<00:03:05.280> quarry

died in the game if you play at a quarry
who<00:03:05.730> defense<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.420> they<00:03:06.540> cannot<00:03:06.870> be<00:03:06.930> killed<00:03:07.320> and

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070
