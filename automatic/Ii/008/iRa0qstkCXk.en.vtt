00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 actually feeding the pig in 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.170
 the last 10 years has changed 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.370
 radically then the composition 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.830
 let's say its fat content has been 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.839
 notably modified traditionally 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.840
 it was said that the consumption of meat from 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.699
 pork was more harmful to health 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.220
 that paradigm has been changing with the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.410
 time and today the professionals argue 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.960
 that the fat of pork meats are 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.390
 less harmful than before and that does not have 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.850
 intramuscular fat which facilitates your 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.360
 removal and its cooking due to just 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.450
 the balanced diet that you have in 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.239
 this moment or mixed but with a great 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.390
 contribution of corn or soybean which is what 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.670
 it brings fats and noble or healthy 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.620
 what was not contained before 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.000
 also the fat percentage of the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.019
 animal has decreased considerably 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.879
 we talk about 30% less total fat 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.800
 in regards to 10 10 years ago 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.600
 back when the feed was 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.210
 different of course it's always going to 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.740
 depend on the type of animal the race the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.080
 sex and so forth is not to say there are many 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.909
 factors that influence the pig 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.700
 contains more or less content of 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.100
 fat but what we can say is 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.080
 what kind of fat they contain today are 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.240
 healthier fats and those that 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.030
 contained previously 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.950
 also the pig is an animal that its 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.450
 meat is seen visible thanks is to say 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.679
 is between the muscle mass and the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.350
 skin then very easy to detect for 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.450
 remove it before deciding to cook for 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.509
 solitude carignano licensed in 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.649
 nutrition of laureano mutual Maradona 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.630
 explained that the issue lies in the 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.420
 feeding the animals that 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.250
 make them healthier for human consumption 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.770
 this feeding condition also 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.440
 reaches the beef meats ie 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.849
 cow but the striking thing is that at 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.190
 contrary to everything we think 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:58.070
 always today for those who 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.040
 high cholesterol chicken meat is such 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.630
 once the most harmful we can say that the 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.080
 feeding of the two animals 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.290
 equated enough but if there are studies 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.350
 that are proving let's say the 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.450
 type of pork fat is a little more 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.160
 healthy than the type of fat the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.900
 cow animal 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.390
 and precisely because of this composition 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.640
 of the fat that has the most amount of 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.400
 monounsaturated fatty acids that are 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.060
 healthy similar to those of oil 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.160
 olive what we try to advise is 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.750
 this to remove the fat from the animal 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.610
 because it is true that they have a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.610
 important cholesterol content 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.730
 by the type of food we can 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.980
 say that this has diminished a lot 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.190
 percentage of cholesterol but does not stop 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.190
 exist
