00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.670
 hi to lovers of secrets and easter eggs 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.370
 this is the second edition of easter watch 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.300
 dogs night perhaps the most 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.130
 interesting of such a grandiose reference 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.800
 maybe it's Easter eggs and maybe not me 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.330
 it seems this easter egg 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.599
 shorter assassin was such a dude 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.689
 ender where elder don't remember what 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:33.739
 called he instructed us to collect some 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:37.010
 part of the apple here on a t-shirt has a 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.219
 something like this apple don't know well 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.300
 at least I think so can 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.910
 be sending you can not okay this 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.469
 issue will be saturated in terms of 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:54.109
 Easter eggs go further here this 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.890
 the place is very very interesting in terms of 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:02.179
 Paschalocks here is put a slender 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.100
 and fatal fatal error icon i 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:07.040
 I think that sender should not be shown 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.890
 more likely they will not show them 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.960
 very much they are scattered throughout the map 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.720
 almost site is a very interesting place 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.799
 like i said this badge like me 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:23.270
 it seems very similar to the star wars helmet 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:25.520
 some I have forgotten his name can 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.340
 remember and write in the comments here 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.890
 such a mouse and interestingly done 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.829
 watch dogs are all computer related 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.729
 smartphones phones phones can 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.700
 everything broke 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.890
 interesting here are these three easter eggs 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.650
 proceeds we go further 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.100
 and again slender as I said them 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.500
 very much and they are scattered around the map 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.750
 maybe it's like I said that too 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.300
 this is the last sender who would you be 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.090
 see if you want me to 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.410
 showed slender write in the comments not 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.390
 let us know the next I easter eggs on 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:09.090
 this place we can discover very 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:13.380
 interesting bar here it is beer 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:17.760
 there are interesting ones here 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.760
 Talking Loss Key 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:32.329
 here we have a bar here also 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:34.689
 There is a video that I already showed in 1 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.689
 series 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:46.040
 in my opinion the most interesting here on 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.040
 my opinion is fish listen 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.689
 Here is such a fish 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:17.319
 we go further arriving at these coordinates 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:20.260
 we can see an interesting monument here 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.440
 such a monument here I do not know whether sending 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.420
 this is on a real hero america not 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.790

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.489
 write about this in the comments 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.150
 speculate 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:43.569
 okay the following in this part of the city there are 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.670
 very interesting inscription it could and 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:52.049
 mesh smog 10 translates to 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:56.049
 smog poisoned full of smoke and fog 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:59.379
 there may be a city filled with smoke 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.209
 here is easter little girl secretary yubisoft of course 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.829

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.129
 Now I will show another one over 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:11.099

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:15.599

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:18.970

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.110
 some company or something like that 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.400
 Okay, more of these inscriptions 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.889
 met drove on here it is still 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.300
 one sign was probably stupid when i 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:40.720
 did not notice for the first time and that one 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.510
 I have already shown to be found here 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.050
 these two inscriptions about here and then 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.659
 the inscription is located which did not show you 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.880
 also on the map in this area in the area 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:56.460
 The next Easter eggs 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:10.350
 on the streets of the city you can meet such 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:12.570
 here rappers listen to bisoft well 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:17.370
 tried over people very well their 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:22.650
 painted gave them some action they 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:24.900
 sing rap hip hop beats beatbox not familiar 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.500
 called not interested play on 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:33.270
 guitar on a pipe then synthesizers all 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.220
 I will show you this last 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.470
 Easter eggs 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.410
 in short one of the game developers in 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:43.590
 one interview said the world in 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.950
 assassin agitation related 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.770
 so loyal fans thought 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.140
 assassin may notice that iden 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.860
 about running also very very 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.870
 his style of clothes is similar too 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.410
 same as the assassin around and hiding 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.760
 he kind of 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:05.450
 equally here I thought he was a hacker 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:10.380
 the plane did not press there and got into the past 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:11.910
 This is my opinion Well Well come in here already
