00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.670
 beauty talks, beauty is not doing any more 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.969
 one video lesson syndicated here comes 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.210
 It's the guys who are in doubt about the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.630
 acceleration of the car in the indicator 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.550
 it only accelerates up to half pedal 66 accelerates 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.189
 6 acceleration 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.340
 let's show here let's go to settings on 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.579
 main menu of the city stay here 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.530
 option that there is today I'm moving the mouse 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.140
 is that the staff is also asking 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.780
 rather than that when she is 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.840
 enabled when you turn the person 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.170
 left hand drive camera moves 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.450
 together you leave disabled is the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.370
 camera is fixed in place even to turn the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.370
 left-hand drive or all to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.629
 right on the camera does not move 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.870
 together 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.649
 now let's head against some c'mon 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.489
 in here on these options we have 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.780
 on here 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:10.049
 Let's see who 's hammoud board 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.549
 this last option that was not enough 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.930
 letting go by default as soon as you see 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.810
 in the young in the middle 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.930
 only according to maximum acceleration 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.030
 Let's hit the accelerator button. 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.640
 if we let sleep in the car, we'll go 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.399
 more left in the middle is half 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.540
 celebration is the standard is that the game is 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:36.600
 leaving at most he gets the machine 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.789
 acceleration you step on pressing the button 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.830
 accelerating is like stepping on 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:47.729
 background on the pedal ready we made aa 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:53.990
 yes we will change back go here 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.990
 test here put here to test 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.660
 only go there now test 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.890
 Ah you can see acceleration now 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.350
 aleam here in our indicator of the deal 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.490
 clutch pedal pressure 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.500
 accelerator 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.850
 now do not stay until halfway evaluate 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.850
 will accelerate everything 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:49.660
 already has another type of acceleration already 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.660
 stay there already, the car gets stronger 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.300
 This is it people, I hope that now you 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.709
 solve the problems there. 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.900
 accelerator and the camera in the city car there 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.769
 so that's it until the next video 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.769
