00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.859
 honestly liked the smell 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.099
 nice but somehow they are so 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.090
 so not boring and very long this one 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.180
 I have been using it for half a year already 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.250
 ca n't end the smell tired for them 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:48.180

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:54.480

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:08.130
 type invaded constantly use them 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.369
 still looking 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:18.560
 a lot will be pretty not burning 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:25.460
 pretty tight paper doesn't break 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:29.420
 well, then throw it away 1 time 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.420
 also in this movie shaft 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:49.490
 which cupcake is very convenient they are light and 60 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:50.780
 here such it is possible to throw for weight it is worth 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.600
 Of course I'm not mistaken 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.770
 home alone deodorant in the fridge 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.680
 air freshener probably even in 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.080
 refrigerator odor absorber on site 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.450
 from the time you buy it small 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:11.650
 I have a crystal because he probably already 5 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.330
 months is constantly increasing when 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.940
 came opened monica this packaging 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.860
 crystal and gradually here in five 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.230
 months they have not increased to such 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.700
 sizes 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.970
 buying constantly it costs in 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.310
 the refrigerator seems to me that it works 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:35.000
 its task copes smells what 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:37.880
 I do not feel took the gelding to scatter pepper 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.970
 for weight decided to try about what pepper 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.769
 there the only thing to smell than 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.080
 fresh pepper and smell add dishes well 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:53.620
 probably it makes no sense to buy there when 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.769
 there are quite a lot of reviews 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.050
 positive 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:03.050
 on the sites of other girls is pink 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:07.060
 Himalayan pink salt I don't know 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.060
 I like some special ones 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.980
 for merit and and I did not notice but 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:19.799

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.969
 salads 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:28.019
 but the only thing is that it is not so salty 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:31.200
 that is, for example, the soup with this is not 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.569
 I will date meat there is something else like salt 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.459
 or oculus salads or something here on top 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.459

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.980
 will post buy constantly do not know 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.629
 it helps it does not help me it seems 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.629
 much tastier and healthier 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:04:02.430
 bought napkins such they 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:08.010

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.090
 napkins 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.019
 they are soaked in antibacterial liquid 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.539
 you can wipe the table gay 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:21.359
 can i wipe the plumbing there what else 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.250
 then there is such a very pleased smell 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.220
 a strong smell seems to me that it is straight 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.220
 I do not remember the smell of tea tree 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:34.580
 lemongrass probably this tea tree 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.710
 can be used for children 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.060
 art director basically by swipe 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.650

 hands and legs do not know will end 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.020
 probably will not take more because 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.790
 basically 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:02.610

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.610
 worth quad he is a stranger this is pampering 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.630
 such a programmer 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:14.320
 I read lavender somewhere lavender 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:18.670
 I read that girls splash there 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.820
 wrote pillows before bed and good as 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.160
 lavender allows soothing and 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.870
 I fall asleep if I honestly did not notice if 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.920
 I ca nâ€™t not even lavender 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.610
 I will also no longer be buying and 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.020
 here I have even he remained whole 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.700
 because it makes no sense I do not use 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.640
 so he is self-indulgence 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:46.530
 so and the last is the mineral 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.910
 starting powder it is priceless 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.850
 dries very well if 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.710
 whatever i have a rash on my face i 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.660

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:04.140
 usual brush shaded in the morning 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.820
 by dried and the more often used 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:10.090
 really night while it 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.340
 disinfects dries and I think 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.410
 someone wrote that and use it as 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.120
 finishing powder seems to me that she is all 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.370
 still give some white bloom 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.350
 probably will not really eat such a face 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:28.330
