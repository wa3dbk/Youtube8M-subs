you're borrowing the second fret on the

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.950 
you're borrowing the second fret on the
E<00:01:07.600> na<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:09.310> there's<00:01:09.940> something<00:01:10.270> going<00:01:10.450> on<00:01:10.540> I'll

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
explain it in a second there's an effect

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.420 
explain it in a second there's an effect
being<00:01:13.390> used<00:01:13.630> but<00:01:13.870> it's<00:01:14.380> in<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.710> next<00:01:15.010> part

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
being used but it's in the next part

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.109 
being used but it's in the next part
so<00:01:18.540> say<00:01:19.540> you'll<00:01:19.690> go<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:19.900> two<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:22.030> you're

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
so say you'll go to two and then you're

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.880 
so say you'll go to two and then you're
gonna<00:01:22.210> go<00:01:22.390> open<00:01:22.600> open<00:01:23.170> on<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.500> top<00:01:23.680> two

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
gonna go open open on the top two

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.820 
gonna go open open on the top two
strings<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.050> fourth<00:01:26.500> fret<00:01:26.740> G<00:01:27.040> and<00:01:27.790> then

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
strings then a fourth fret G and then

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.660 
strings then a fourth fret G and then
shut<00:01:29.830> this<00:01:29.979> light<00:01:30.250> down

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
shut this light down

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.249 
shut this light down
I<00:01:30.700> think<00:01:31.060> it's<00:01:31.180> putting<00:01:31.420> too<00:01:31.630> bad<00:01:31.810> of<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:32.020> glare

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
I think it's putting too bad of a glare

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.219 
I think it's putting too bad of a glare
or<00:01:32.830> maybe<00:01:33.009> not<00:01:33.220> maybe<00:01:33.580> it's<00:01:33.820> helping<00:01:37.229> fourth

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
or maybe not maybe it's helping fourth

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.260 
or maybe not maybe it's helping fourth
fret<00:01:38.440> G<00:01:38.649> one<00:01:38.979> two<00:01:39.009> three<00:01:39.520> four<00:01:40.500> one<00:01:41.500> one<00:01:42.369> and

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
fret G one two three four one one and

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.380 
fret G one two three four one one and
then<00:01:43.539> fourth<00:01:43.840> fret<00:01:44.080> D<00:01:44.289> pinch<00:01:44.710> harmonic

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
then fourth fret D pinch harmonic

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.820 
then fourth fret D pinch harmonic
half-step<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:46.660> so<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.390> then<00:01:53.229> back<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.649> two

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
half-step in so and then back to the two

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.160 
half-step in so and then back to the two
to<00:01:54.399> EA<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:56.080> then<00:01:56.229> open<00:01:56.530> open<00:01:56.800> E<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.039> a<00:01:57.130> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to EA and then open open E and a and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.310 
to EA and then open open E and a and
then<00:01:59.170> go<00:01:59.350> seven<00:01:59.890> seven<00:02:00.369> five<00:02:01.000> five<00:02:01.330> seven

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
then go seven seven five five seven

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.910 
then go seven seven five five seven
seven<00:02:02.530> five<00:02:02.950> five<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:04.649> then<00:02:05.649> five<00:02:05.679> five<00:02:06.130> so

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
seven five five and then five five so

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.970 
seven five five and then five five so
and<00:02:08.920> then<00:02:09.039> slide<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.880> around<00:02:10.890> when<00:02:11.890> you

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
and then slide that to around when you

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.530 
and then slide that to around when you
hover<00:02:12.280> over<00:02:12.370> fret<00:02:12.760> one<00:02:12.970> you're<00:02:13.150> done<00:02:13.330> and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
hover over fret one you're done and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.830 
hover over fret one you're done and
you're<00:02:13.660> back<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.019> starting<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.410> over<00:02:14.620> again<00:02:14.739> so

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.470 

actually<00:02:21.830> slide<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.430> around<00:02:22.819> second<00:02:23.300> fret

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
actually slide it to around second fret

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.640 
actually slide it to around second fret
because<00:02:23.569> that's<00:02:23.780> where<00:02:23.930> we're<00:02:24.080> starting<00:02:24.170> and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
because that's where we're starting and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:35.809 
because that's where we're starting and
then<00:02:24.709> just<00:02:24.920> stop<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.340> here

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.869 

okay<00:02:36.750> then<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.049> next<00:02:37.079> part<00:02:37.500> comes<00:02:37.769> in<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.250> to

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
okay then the next part comes in and to

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.140 
okay then the next part comes in and to
me<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.180> sounds<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.599> whammy<00:02:40.049> pedal<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:41.640> also

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
me it sounds like a whammy pedal it also

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.990 
me it sounds like a whammy pedal it also
sounds<00:02:42.569> like<00:02:42.689> a<00:02:42.799> whammy<00:02:43.799> bar<00:02:44.129> but<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:44.790> think

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
sounds like a whammy bar but I think

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.809 
sounds like a whammy bar but I think
it's<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.269> pedal<00:02:45.890> dropping<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.010> an<00:02:47.129> octave<00:02:47.640> or

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
it's the pedal dropping it an octave or

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.780 
it's the pedal dropping it an octave or
two<00:02:47.969> down<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.590> emulate<00:02:50.219> that<00:02:50.250> all<00:02:50.670> you

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
two down you so to emulate that all you

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.460 
two down you so to emulate that all you
got<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.329> bar<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.810> second<00:02:52.170> fret<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.319> the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
got to do is bar the second fret on the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.130 
got to do is bar the second fret on the
ena<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.099> do<00:02:53.790> like<00:02:53.939> this<00:02:54.090> exaggerated<00:02:54.750> slide

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
ena and do like this exaggerated slide

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.380 
ena and do like this exaggerated slide
till<00:02:55.409> you<00:02:55.530> get<00:02:55.680> over<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.980> first<00:02:56.220> fret<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:57.239> it's

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
till you get over the first fret so it's

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:06.729 
till you get over the first fret so it's
like<00:02:58.879> okay<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.000> then<00:03:00.150> just<00:03:00.180> stop<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:00.870> then

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.160 

they<00:03:07.739> go<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.099> second<00:03:08.489> fret<00:03:08.609> ena<00:03:09.030> palm<00:03:09.450> mute

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.649 

four<00:03:13.170> times<00:03:13.639> and<00:03:14.639> then<00:03:14.879> first<00:03:15.150> fret<00:03:15.389> e<00:03:15.419> na<00:03:16.370> so
