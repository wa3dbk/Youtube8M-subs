00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.669
 wo the people that you are waiting for 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:05.470
 well I am not to believe and we are in 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.880
 a new gta 5 video online this time 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.530
 a video in which I will teach them to 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.120
 how to get the submarine worth guys 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.530
 well before I start telling you what 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.599
 I better go a little late because many 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.400
 of you will know how to get this 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.359
 vehicle in gt5 online 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.699
 but good guys, I honestly 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.679
 tell you that I was interested in this victim 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.480
 Yesterday a subscriber told me that in gt5 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.160
 online there is her husband and the truth that I 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.900
 I was quite blown away because I did not 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.160
 I had no idea that it had gone up if 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.740
 I went into stores to buy 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.359
 I would have boats or helicopters or car 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.160
 not in the stores that there are if you get in 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.390
 the mobile on the internet because there are different 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.770
 stores in which you can buy 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.539
 vehicles and I did not see for any 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.530
 submarine in video games then it's 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.570
 that you will not be able to get 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.340
 submarines but I sincerely 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.320
 I learned just yesterday that it did change 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.820
 nothing a location in which he is 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.320
 well underwater and good guys then now 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.730
 same bringing that location on screen 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.800
 It's worth it if you want to go to the 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.079
 submarine and nothing for that I sincerely 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.609
 I found out yesterday I was shocked that is 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.350
 the word and nothing because we say that 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:57.969
 when you get to that location that is 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.050
 right on the beach on the coast of 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.710
 the saints just up to the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.640
 right 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.769
 Nothing the only thing you have to do 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.089
 is to look towards the horizon towards 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.740
 beach to the sea of ​​data 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.430
 you will take it back and right there 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.930
 talking 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.380
 a kind of yellow platform the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.880
 which protrudes from the water and ss well 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.290
 will be the submarine obviously then 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.360
 nothing because I go there and you ride 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.560
 they're going to put us a star or anything like that 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.270
 It's not like it's a girl and she's there to 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.740
 that people take it and good after 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.840
 also for nothing that the video is not 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.760
 so short I wanted to add a data and that is 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.320
 one from here I send a statement to 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.090
 those of rockstar who are not going to see this 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.830
 video this video or coña but good 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.090
 nothing I just wanted to say so that in case 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.950
 you give me the reason that surely gives me 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.110
 the reason to say that good as you see the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.790
 same 300 images of submarine by the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.020
 bottom of the sea that by the way I picked it 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.060
 when it was night and you could not 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.860
 appreciate the background graphics of the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.869
 sea that marketed when it is day 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.280
 then the light enters the sea and you see 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.229
 better not what is the seabed 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.880
 then nothing to say to you that is 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.399
 super curred or I rarely 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.530
 stuck in the water and is super cured 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.869
 the graphics the textures the details 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.780
 from the sea with the algae the rocks all 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.250
 the little flowers those aquatic flowers 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.740
 they are not corals but they are called 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.330
 something nothing can say is super 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.800
 Cured SuperColor super colors 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.149
 striking and the truth is that you can 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.470
 there are enough mysteries down there 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.239
 not sure that we still do not 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.310
 we have realized then good I 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.300
 Sincerely, I wanted to send him a 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.890
 communicated to rockstar 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.350
 and tell them that I think they've screwed up 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.480
 a little bit by putting so few means to 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.650
 to be able to go to the bottom of brothers you know 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.690
 how good the only means are 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.040
 getting a submarine or getting 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.470
 an oxygen pump I do not think it 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.700
 call then then when at last and 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.200
 out the best way is getting a 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.580
 submarine since it goes faster and the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.780
 truth is that going more line had to 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.280
 can I know even more submarines 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.230
 distributed throughout the map so that the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.810
 people could enjoy that of that 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.000
 piece of enjoying contemplation 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.950
 of what the seabed is and that 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.270
 put me I know more submarines by 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.250
 all sides not so that people could 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.600
 enjoy it but the truth have put 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.100
 only only one submarine on gt5 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.390
 online thing that I thought was pretty bad 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.590
 not if both the seabed Curran 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.720
 well that I know that they put more 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.250
 submarines by dispensed by the map 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.140
 so people like to say 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.670
 Enjoy seeing the seabed but 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.840
 well that's rockstar thing I 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.820
 they will have thought like that and they have done it 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.050
 but for genius in vision is a shit 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.670
 for the only one to be able to see what you think 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.590
 of this in the comments to see that 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.610
 I want to know your opinion assigned on 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.870
 next state this video that I am 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.880
 deviating from the theme that I always go 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.110
 by the branches so nothing then profit 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.520
