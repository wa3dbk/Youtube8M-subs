00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 one of the most labor intensive options 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.360
 crossed loops it braided 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.280
 and honeycomb now we'll try 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.940
 make honeycomb 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.660
 i see on density 7 before 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.449
 Coast 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.010
 cross loops last row I'll 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.000
 knit on density 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.750
 9 to make the loops easy enough 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.750
 transferred and so bound density 7 and 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:38.520
 4 on the density of 9 immediately return 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.520
 density back not to forget and you 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:48.149
 see that the size of the loops clearly increased 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.360
 we start moving loops doing it 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.219
 we will be two 2 coal deckers two 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.219
 extreme loops we will not touch 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:17.080
 first move the next two to the right 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:19.540
 shifting left to the meeting again 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.660
 you see that in the transfer of loops 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.660
 all needles without exception are involved and 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:39.280
 meet well if honeycomb 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.700
 fit only on some small 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.700
 section of our product 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.510
 but sometimes it is necessary to tie 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.600
 some kind of horizontal stripe pattern 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:01.500
 honeycomb very beautiful 100 looks on 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:11.010
 belts in jackets because they give a clear 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:11.010
 bending not to meet 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.060
 quite tight tolerated loop 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.720
 so the next time I need 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.610
 will carry all the loops 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.680
 density, I do not have add nine and then 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.870
 tens 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:52.540
 although of course you can, and so knit all 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:55.710
 I was able to transfer loops by 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.710
 all pattern 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:06.670
 Well, of course it will be more convenient to transfer if 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:10.240
 ctos knit on dozens of last row 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.890
 see how curved loops are enough 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.690
 tense and so three rows on the seven 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.600
 We look to the lever of partial knitting 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:31.060
 stood at position 2 or 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:31.750
 and amy dozens come back immediately to 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.140
 seven 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.050
 we transfer the same loops that is 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.350
 retreat 2 loops from the edge but 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.620
 we will transfer to the other side 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:50.820
 if here we had the first carry 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.820
 on the right, now 1 carry will be to the left 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:47.289
 and now everyone knows the carry left 8 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:50.610
 any angle here to us 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:54.999
 tens to carry much easier 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:59.649
 Of course very nicely such a pattern fits 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:05:03.990
 from stretch yarn with not very big 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:07.599
 adding lycra or elastane 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.659
 now our steel makers 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:13.119
 produce a lot of yarn with elastic 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:15.999
 cool for example beach people 

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:20.949
 Camtex manufacturer she is amazing 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:24.520
 suitable for such goats because yarn 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:28.680
 very elastic very soft and pleasant 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:32.139
 in work and wear this yarn composition 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.689
 because the eucalyptus code and it, and by 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:38.469
 Milona apparently creates such an effect 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:47.459
 meeting wai yarn but we continue 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:50.409
 knit cashmere 4 4 row on tens and 

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:53.939
 a couple of times we will repeat this 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:57.360
 operation and we will already look at samples 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:06:04.559
 now for the first time 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.559
 first shift to the right 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:29.069
 Of course the number of rows 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:33.419
 maybe more if you have a soft and 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:37.830
 elastic yarn you can make honeycomb 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:44.339
 not two by two and three by three but of course 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:45.870
 again it all depends on the yarn when 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:49.740
 you want to tie 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:54.180
 braid and braid yarn selection 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:07:00.270
 in my opinion is extremely 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:04.310
 important because it is from yarn 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:17.699
 It depends on how it will look this 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:21.080
 drawing and you see that enough 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:21.080
 it turns out quickly 

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:48.379
 from above it seems that we have one huge 

00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:51.319
 hole 

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:54.739
 but when we remove the product from 

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:55.759
 cars let him lie down a little 

00:07:54.739 --> 00:08:00.129
 pull him 

00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:04.249
 so that the holes and stretched by increasing 

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:06.309
 loops you will see what beauty we have with 

00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:06.309
 you
