 I read it quite recently 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.350
 completely different than a goal on such 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.410
 like an angel and a demon and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.960
 or yes vinci code 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.690
 it is a completely different subject this book 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.280
 tells us about the greatest discovery 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.299
 which was committed by one of 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.700
 special services in america there was a meteorite 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.549
 who argued that there is life on 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.729
 other planets 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:22.650
 but this is all secret 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.189
 it is all covered with secrets a lie very 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.310
 interesting book very interesting how 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.380
 native people relate to each other in 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.750
 all sorts of situations like a father can 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.850
 step over daughter like meet 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.409
 completely two people not having between 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.329
 no interest 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.490
 how do they help each other how are they 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.939
 fall in love in general this is an adventure 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.390
 book a little again with a scientific and hint 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.310
 fits like guys like girls probably 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.399
 this book is not having sex i will say this 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.649
 The next book will be on the flag of Delphi 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.040
 through and this was my first book 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.320
 which I read from novels and not a flag 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.840
 do not see that there is some kind of childish 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.660
 name dizisi wonders god what 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.850
 miracles in our time right but 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.530
 you don't fleck such a writer who 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:19.290
 touches the most pressing most 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.270
 the secret secrets of our souls I read this 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.340
 book and smiled I did not want her 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.140
 throw as happens with some books 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.560
 I wanted to read and read so that she would not 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.580
 ended up with her a bit like 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.200
 autobiography tells about 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.980
 little girl who becomes 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.100
 a girl woman like her some kind she 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.560
 is growing up becoming oneself 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.380
 personalities are generally very interesting and 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.320
 after this book I read all the novels 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.390
 which come out the background of the flight is amazing 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.760
 writer surprisingly tells 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.530
 about the life of ordinary people people completely 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.010
 not mediocre such a situation can 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.560
 happen to your next house at all 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.480
 Loved it for easy reading like 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.440
 time the next book will come up 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.750
 function for sagan is her one of 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.120
 guardian angel works like this 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.390
 thin little book completely by accident 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.390
 I thought at the station that I read it after 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.430
 this I began to read more books books 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:27.390
 tells of a couple that 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.250
 accidentally meets a young boy his 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.500
 brings you home 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.330
 start to help him some guy 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:39.810
 falls in love with a lady in one go further 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:44.000
 tragic events that are poured into 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:47.600
 love but for me this book was 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.620
 some kind of inspiration after that i 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.239
 looked differently at life 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.000
 looked differently at love 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:58.050
 looked another at it all 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.390
 magic praised read it very much 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.270
 fast literally one day honest 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.340
 I was shocked by this book I think 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.280
 that this writer feels deeply 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.160
 the world deeply feels the people of nature 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.470
 In general, I really liked the relationship 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.230
 book I strongly advise if you can not 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.960
 you may not understand where to start 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.250
 read read thin book 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.290
 little but 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.790
 I think that inspire you too 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.430
 next book 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.920
 I think you heard about this piece 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.020
 it or even baby rosemary 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.830
 Now comes a lot of film adaptation 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.300
 book adaptation 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:42.540
 but always a book is better than a movie in a million 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.670
 once read with gusto honestly when it 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.060
 Grandmother read to finish an hour from her 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.730
 this next i'm in line very 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.360
 I advise you to read interesting not at all 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.419
 scared i really liked it think you 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.480
 know the plot but I will remind the girl 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:04.320
 which which is all home apartment 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:07.680
 the family lacked everything that they wanted 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.340
 only one child and she is family 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.850
 this married couple met 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:17.070
 their neighbors and neighbors seemed 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:23.030
 not easy if you are interested and you don’t 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:28.200
 you know what to expect next, so to speak 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:30.210
 horrors of the last century like this but not a book 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.460
 must be regarded as a horror book very 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.640
 interesting classics of world literature 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.550
 I think there may be no one 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.140
 thinks differently but I am so and I would 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.229
 recommended reading 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.540
 latest fifth book in general I 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.729
 I was very surprised to know the authors 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.010
 quite by chance to the door drazer 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.880
 jenny gerhardt 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:56.690
 I am a family romance about a girl from 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.250
 very poor family like her 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.880
 selflessness gives itself for 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.250
 assistance to the family as she falls for the fate of 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.140
 she is very tragic i read myself 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.270
 the novel and that's because it is a scrap lies 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.130
 here are two more stories 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.680
 I can't tell you anything 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.870
 say while I think that I also 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:22.970
 like in general really love america in 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.870
 1800s in general from 1830 to 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.630
 Great Patriotic War 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.760
 I love this time and perhaps stranded que j'ai 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.450

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.570
 and I love these books in Russia at this time 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.340
 written at that time 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:41.690
 describing that time from chic 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:44.810
 ideally want to plunge there book 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.900
 just a little novel like that 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:51.020
 but very very very interesting very 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.120
 sympathized with the girl is very tragic 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.980
 fate 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.850
 but here it’s about the real 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.440
 love real devotion 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.970
 dedication in general so here 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.700
 read the book 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:07.850
 I really liked it because of these 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:10.610
 I would not recommend books at all 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:14.150
 highlight but I would advise all the same 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:16.310
