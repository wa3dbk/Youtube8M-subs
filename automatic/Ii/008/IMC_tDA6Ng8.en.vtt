work with the magic adjustable ring
there<00:00:23.519> are<00:00:23.640> different<00:00:24.090> methods<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.510> do<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
there are different methods to do the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.870 
there are different methods to do the
ring<00:00:25.050> I've<00:00:25.260> seen<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.010> lot<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.340> people<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.730> it

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
ring I've seen a lot of people do it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.259 
ring I've seen a lot of people do it
with<00:00:28.099> wrapping<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> string<00:00:29.250> around<00:00:29.609> once<00:00:29.939> and

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
with wrapping the string around once and

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.740 
with wrapping the string around once and
then<00:00:30.740> putting<00:00:31.740> their<00:00:31.859> stitches<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.369> there<00:00:32.750> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
then putting their stitches in there the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.720 
then putting their stitches in there the
problem<00:00:34.170> with<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.500> find<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.640> it

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
problem with that I find is if you do it

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.350 
problem with that I find is if you do it
like<00:00:35.850> that

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
like that

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.110 
like that
you're<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.440> can<00:00:37.620> tighten<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.399> really<00:00:38.969> well

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
you're you can tighten it really well

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.580 
you're you can tighten it really well
and<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.510> won't<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.960> hole<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> middle

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and you won't have a hole in the middle

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.979 
and you won't have a hole in the middle
but<00:00:41.309> if<00:00:41.460> you're<00:00:41.579> working<00:00:41.760> on<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.570> open

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
but if you're working on it it can open

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.740 
but if you're working on it it can open
again<00:00:43.110> through<00:00:43.980> pulling<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.850> because<00:00:45.629> you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
again through pulling on it because you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.010 
again through pulling on it because you
only<00:00:45.870> have<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.170> string<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.770> work<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:48.020> so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
only have one string you work with so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.450 
only have one string you work with so
I'm<00:00:49.140> going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.410> show<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.710> method<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.250> will

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
I'm going to show you a method that will

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.100 
I'm going to show you a method that will
eliminate<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.420> will<00:00:51.570> definitely<00:00:51.989> have

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
eliminate that you will definitely have

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.900 
eliminate that you will definitely have
a<00:00:52.140> hole<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.500> will<00:00:52.590> stay<00:00:52.890> closed<00:00:55.910> different

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
a hole that will stay closed different

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.610 
a hole that will stay closed different
people<00:00:57.120> wrap<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.809> yarn<00:00:57.840> around<00:00:58.109> their<00:00:58.410> hands

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
people wrap the yarn around their hands

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.970 
people wrap the yarn around their hands
differently<00:00:59.100> I<00:01:00.059> when<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.079> crochet<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.620> always

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
differently I when I crochet I always

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.880 
differently I when I crochet I always
wrap<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> around<00:01:02.399> my<00:01:02.640> pinkie<00:01:03.439> you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.589> hold<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
wrap it around my pinkie you can hold it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.509 
wrap it around my pinkie you can hold it
however<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.220> want

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
however you want

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.070 
however you want
the<00:01:05.640> only<00:01:05.820> thing<00:01:06.060> important<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.720> method

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the only thing important for this method

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.600 
the only thing important for this method
is<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.590> need<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.860> wrap<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> around<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
is that you need to wrap it around a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.100 
is that you need to wrap it around a
finger<00:01:09.000> twice<00:01:11.030> some<00:01:12.030> people<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> wrap<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
finger twice some people like to wrap it

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.670 
finger twice some people like to wrap it
around<00:01:13.170> two<00:01:13.680> fingers<00:01:14.990> then<00:01:15.990> hold<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> yarn<00:01:16.470> at

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
around two fingers then hold the yarn at

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920 
around two fingers then hold the yarn at
the<00:01:16.740> bottom<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.310> work<00:01:17.970> right<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.689> some<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the bottom and work right here some of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.080 
the bottom and work right here some of
the<00:01:19.020> fingers<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.530> find<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.310> easier<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.790> use

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the fingers I find it easier to just use

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.520 
the fingers I find it easier to just use
one<00:01:21.119> finger<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.630> that's<00:01:21.960> what<00:01:22.080> I'm<00:01:22.170> gonna<00:01:22.320> do

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
one finger so that's what I'm gonna do

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.899 
one finger so that's what I'm gonna do
you<00:01:22.770> use<00:01:22.979> whatever<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:23.759> more

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
you use whatever you are more

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.390 
you use whatever you are more
comfortable<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.479> important<00:01:25.290> thing<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.619> wrap

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
comfortable with important thing is wrap

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700 
comfortable with important thing is wrap
it<00:01:26.580> around<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.909> finger<00:01:27.180> twice<00:01:27.450> hold<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
it around a finger twice hold on to the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.179 
it around a finger twice hold on to the
tail<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.810> two<00:01:31.049> loops<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.040> your

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
tail so you have two loops here on your

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.929 
tail so you have two loops here on your
finger<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:34.020> insert<00:01:34.380> your<00:01:34.500> hook<00:01:34.909> under<00:01:35.909> both

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
finger you insert your hook under both

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.870 
finger you insert your hook under both
loops<00:01:36.530> grab<00:01:37.530> your<00:01:37.770> yarn<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.369> pull<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> through

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
loops grab your yarn and pull it through

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.770 
loops grab your yarn and pull it through
and<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.990> anchor<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.680> chain<00:01:41.720> this<00:01:42.720> is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and you anchor it with a chain this is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.149 
and you anchor it with a chain this is
how<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.200> started<00:01:43.439> at<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.829> point<00:01:44.100> you

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
how you get started at that point you

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.469 
how you get started at that point you
can<00:01:44.310> let<00:01:44.430> go<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> tail<00:01:44.970> because<00:01:45.329> it's

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
can let go of the tail because it's

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.020 
can let go of the tail because it's
anchored<00:01:46.100> you're<00:01:47.100> working<00:01:47.399> yarns<00:01:47.610> anchored
