myself<00:00:45.559> for<00:00:46.559> some<00:00:46.649> reason<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:46.980> no<00:00:47.190> one

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370

spawned<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.059> hallway<00:00:48.329> right<00:00:48.660> there<00:00:48.870> so

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
spawned in that hallway right there so

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.490 
spawned in that hallway right there so
I'm<00:00:50.100> sorry<00:00:50.370> about<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:51.260> it's<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.410> going

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
I'm sorry about that but it's not going

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.130 
I'm sorry about that but it's not going
to<00:00:52.590> make<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> big<00:00:52.920> difference<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.370> understand

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
to make a big difference you understand

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.110 
to make a big difference you understand
so<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.530> reason<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:56.430> only<00:00:56.789> going<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> be

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so the reason I'm only going to be

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.510 
so the reason I'm only going to be
pulling<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.899> center<00:00:58.379> hallway<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:59.129> because

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
pulling the center hallway is because

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.070 
pulling the center hallway is because
the<00:00:59.640> left<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.239> right<00:01:00.539> are<00:01:01.379> either<00:01:02.250> stuns

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
the left and the right are either stuns

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.570 
the left and the right are either stuns
more<00:01:04.080> elementals<00:01:04.769> I'm<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.280> interested

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
more elementals I'm not interested

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.390 
more elementals I'm not interested
elementals<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:07.500> really<00:01:07.979> don't<00:01:08.159> want<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
elementals and I really don't want to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.640 
elementals and I really don't want to
waste<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.790> time<00:01:09.030> getting<00:01:09.270> stunned<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.260> netted

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
waste my time getting stunned and netted

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.090 
waste my time getting stunned and netted
over<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.490> over<00:01:11.549> again<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.560> pick<00:01:13.950> them

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
over and over again so you can pick them

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
over and over again so you can pick them
up<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.400> want<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:14.820> realize<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.960> will

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
up if you want but realize that it will

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.950 
up if you want but realize that it will
change<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.860> time<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.630> with<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> amount<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
change the time and with the amount of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.870 
change the time and with the amount of
time<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.560> takes<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.189> gather<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.700> kill

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
time that it takes to gather and kill

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.690 
time that it takes to gather and kill
it's<00:01:21.810> really<00:01:22.080> not<00:01:22.200> worth<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> mean<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
it's really not worth it so I mean it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.550 
it's really not worth it so I mean it
took<00:01:23.820> me<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> minute<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> gather<00:01:24.479> them<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:24.990> I'm

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
took me a minute to gather them and I'm

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.550 
took me a minute to gather them and I'm
telling<00:01:25.830> them<00:01:25.920> currently<00:01:26.430> um<00:01:27.020> I'm<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
telling them currently um I'm a

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.260 
telling them currently um I'm a
polyvalent<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.579> once<00:01:29.759> again<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.000> don't<00:01:30.180> have

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
polyvalent so once again I don't have

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.859 
polyvalent so once again I don't have
any<00:01:30.390> AOE<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.930> little<00:01:31.710> air<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.280> mage<00:01:33.119> would<00:01:33.390> be

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
any AOE a little air we a mage would be

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.249 
any AOE a little air we a mage would be
a<00:01:33.900> phenomenal<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.220> instance<00:01:36.259> probably

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
a phenomenal in this instance probably

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.560 
a phenomenal in this instance probably
i'm<00:01:37.380> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> say<00:01:37.740> 45<00:01:38.189> second<00:01:38.610> gather<00:01:39.329> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
i'm going to say 45 second gather and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.130 
i'm going to say 45 second gather and
kill<00:01:40.880> ballooning<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.299> really<00:01:42.630> takes<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> most

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
kill ballooning it really takes the most

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.010 
kill ballooning it really takes the most
amount<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.439> time<00:01:43.619> out<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.040> um<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.750> also

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
amount of time out of this um it's also

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.530 
amount of time out of this um it's also
nice<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> any<00:01:47.610> level<00:01:48.329> there's<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
nice to have a any level there's a

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.889 
nice to have a any level there's a
chance<00:01:48.780> 25<00:01:49.290> or<00:01:49.470> more<00:01:49.500> um<00:01:50.299> just<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.479> disenchant

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
chance 25 or more um just to disenchant

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.230 
chance 25 or more um just to disenchant
the<00:01:52.200> blues<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.070> get<00:01:53.220> from<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.549> this

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
boss and the Greens that you get

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.120 
boss and the Greens that you get
randomly<00:01:56.280> from<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> mobs<00:01:56.759> um<00:01:57.829> so<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.009> time
