corner to the opposite corner from here
to<00:00:35.570> here<00:00:35.809> now<00:00:36.500> use<00:00:36.830> this<00:00:37.100> as<00:00:37.309> your<00:00:37.370> pattern<00:00:38.239> for

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
to here now use this as your pattern for

to here now use this as your pattern for
your<00:00:38.690> tree<00:00:39.050> you<00:00:39.739> could<00:00:40.010> just<00:00:40.280> keep<00:00:40.580> the

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
your tree you could just keep the

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.840 
your tree you could just keep the
triangle<00:00:41.690> like<00:00:41.870> that<00:00:42.220> but<00:00:43.220> we're<00:00:43.460> going<00:00:43.670> to

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
triangle like that but we're going to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.380 
triangle like that but we're going to
make<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:44.239> stylized<00:00:44.870> tree<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.850> we're<00:00:47.059> going<00:00:47.300> to

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
make a stylized tree and we're going to

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:59.290 
make a stylized tree and we're going to
follow<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.960> shape<00:00:50.230> cut<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:51.350> out<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:58.300> that's

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
follow the shape cut it out and that's

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.520 
follow the shape cut it out and that's
the<00:00:59.660> pattern<00:00:59.870> for<00:01:00.530> their<00:01:00.739> tree

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.360 

both<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:07.280> pieces<00:01:07.549> of<00:01:07.909> cardstock

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
both to pieces of cardstock

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.700 
both to pieces of cardstock
jannat<00:01:09.610> will<00:01:09.910> accommodate<00:01:10.510> your<00:01:10.690> tree<00:01:11.050> in

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
jannat will accommodate your tree in

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.000 
jannat will accommodate your tree in
half<00:01:14.850> place<00:01:15.850> your<00:01:16.120> tree<00:01:16.390> pattern<00:01:16.690> on<00:01:17.170> the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
half place your tree pattern on the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:33.700 
half place your tree pattern on the
cardstock<00:01:18.370> and<00:01:19.110> trace<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:25.000> cut<00:01:25.300> it<00:01:25.330> out

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.700 

separate<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.950> true<00:01:38.930> now<00:01:39.930> cut<00:01:40.230> this<00:01:40.440> one

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
separate the true now cut this one

00:01:40.710 --> 00:02:09.160 
separate the true now cut this one
slightly<00:01:41.190> smaller<00:01:43.910> using<00:01:44.910> the<00:01:45.060> cut<00:01:45.380> as<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.970> guy

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.559 

so<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.560> where<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.950> cut<00:02:10.979> away<00:02:11.510> now<00:02:12.510> you

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
so this is where it cut away now you

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.559 
so this is where it cut away now you
have<00:02:12.840> one<00:02:12.890> tree<00:02:13.890> slightly<00:02:14.700> smaller<00:02:15.090> than<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
have one tree slightly smaller than the

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.350 
have one tree slightly smaller than the
other<00:02:15.780> punch<00:02:16.620> circles<00:02:17.220> from<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.700> scraps<00:02:18.090> of
