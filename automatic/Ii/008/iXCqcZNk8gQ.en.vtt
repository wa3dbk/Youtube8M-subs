00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
rear tire and we're gonna look at the

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.690 
rear tire and we're gonna look at the
brake<00:01:16.110> calipers<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.830> pretty<00:01:17.100> sure<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.490> time

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
brake calipers I'm pretty sure it's time

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.260 
brake calipers I'm pretty sure it's time
for<00:01:17.850> brakes

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
for brakes

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.430 
for brakes
so<00:01:19.020> let's<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.440> to<00:01:19.590> work<00:01:20.899> so<00:01:21.899> I<00:01:21.960> got<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> front

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
so let's get to work so I got the front

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.930 
so let's get to work so I got the front
tire<00:01:22.710> off<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.369> side<00:01:23.700> see<00:01:24.270> right<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:25.940> it

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
tire off the one side see right there it

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.190 
tire off the one side see right there it
looks<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.240> there's<00:01:27.420> quite<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.720> bit<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.960> brake

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
looks like there's quite a bit of brake

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.040 
looks like there's quite a bit of brake
pad<00:01:28.470> left<00:01:31.789> you<00:01:32.789> can<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.630> them<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.899> their

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
pad left you can see them with their

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.020 
pad left you can see them with their
pads<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:35.100> get<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> light<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.789> hold<00:01:36.270> on

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
pads you get the light in there hold on

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.480 
pads you get the light in there hold on
there's<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.240> rear<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:39.750> there<00:01:40.490> so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
there's the rear right there so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.419 
there's the rear right there so
proximity<00:01:42.119> sensor<00:01:42.479> isn't<00:01:42.780> touching<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.429> the

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
proximity sensor isn't touching the the

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.490 
proximity sensor isn't touching the the
rotor<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.330> front<00:01:45.660> brake<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.050> this<00:01:46.140> side<00:01:46.380> is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
rotor so the front brake on this side is

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.199 
rotor so the front brake on this side is
good<00:01:46.649> at<00:01:46.800> least<00:01:46.950> anyways<00:01:47.429> so<00:01:47.700> we're<00:01:47.940> gonna<00:01:48.030> put

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
good at least anyways so we're gonna put

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:51.370 
good at least anyways so we're gonna put
this<00:01:48.300> tire<00:01:48.509> back<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.050> check<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.350> rear<00:01:49.560> one

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
this tire back on and check the rear one

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.580 
this tire back on and check the rear one
maybe<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.590> rear<00:01:52.860> brakes

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
maybe it's just rear brakes

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.510 
maybe it's just rear brakes
alright<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.709> even<00:01:55.920> looking<00:01:56.130> at<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.310> brake

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
alright so even looking at the brake

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.660 
alright so even looking at the brake

pads on this side I get my little pin

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.330 
pads on this side I get my little pin
light<00:01:59.849> on<00:01:59.970> there's<00:02:00.209> lots<00:02:00.539> brake<00:02:00.869> pad<00:02:01.340> there's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
light on there's lots brake pad there's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.400

alright<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:22.830> could<00:02:22.980> see<00:02:23.220> right<00:02:23.400> here<00:02:23.580> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
alright so you could see right here the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.790 
alright so you could see right here the
wheel<00:02:23.940> sensor<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.630> opposite<00:02:24.989> side<00:02:25.260> it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
wheel sensor on the opposite side it

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.470 
wheel sensor on the opposite side it
kind<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.370> got<00:02:26.489> caught<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:26.849> something<00:02:27.060> and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
kind of got caught on something and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.839 
kind of got caught on something and
splits<00:02:27.870> this<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.860> issue<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:29.400> now<00:02:29.640> so

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
splits this is the issue we have now so

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.160 
splits this is the issue we have now so
I'm<00:02:29.910> gonna<00:02:30.000> have<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.180> order<00:02:30.390> new<00:02:30.630> sensor<00:02:31.020> but

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
I'm gonna have to order new sensor but

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.130 
I'm gonna have to order new sensor but
in<00:02:31.260> meantime<00:02:32.300> I'm<00:02:33.300> gonna<00:02:33.510> see<00:02:33.780> if<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.959> can

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
in meantime I'm gonna see if I can

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.809 
in meantime I'm gonna see if I can
solder<00:02:34.410> them<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.890> heat<00:02:35.010> shrink<00:02:35.340> them<00:02:35.489> see<00:02:35.730> if

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
solder them and heat shrink them see if

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.300 
solder them and heat shrink them see if
I<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:36.120> fix<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.599> up<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.930> get<00:02:37.800> her<00:02:37.890> go<00:02:38.040> until<00:02:38.160> I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
I can fix it up and get her go until I

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.780 
I can fix it up and get her go until I
get<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.459> replacement<00:02:38.730> one<00:02:40.340> alright<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.580> did

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
get a replacement one alright so I did

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.820 
get a replacement one alright so I did
right<00:02:42.000> here<00:02:42.300> is<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.020> soldered<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.800> wires

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
right here is that I soldered the wires

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.370 
right here is that I soldered the wires
I<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:45.720> got<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> heat<00:02:46.110> shrink<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.590> on

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
I just got a heat shrink that on

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.960 
I just got a heat shrink that on
I'll<00:02:48.950> give<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.280> some<00:02:49.430> protection<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.240> then

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
I'll give it some protection and then

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.940 
I'll give it some protection and then
tape<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.120> up<00:02:53.300> put<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:53.960> back<00:02:54.110> in<00:02:56.650> all<00:02:57.650> right<00:02:57.710> so

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
tape it up put it back in all right so

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.710 
tape it up put it back in all right so
we've<00:02:58.160> got<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.430> all<00:02:58.490> taped<00:02:58.910> up<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.300> back<00:02:59.510> in

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
we've got that all taped up and back in

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.410 
we've got that all taped up and back in
place<00:03:00.020> and<00:03:00.700> now<00:03:01.700> we're<00:03:01.790> gonna<00:03:01.940> put<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.180> tire

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
place and now we're gonna put the tire

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.240 
place and now we're gonna put the tire
back<00:03:02.450> on<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.170> see<00:03:03.440> if<00:03:03.470> that<00:03:03.740> temporary

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
back on and see if that temporary

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.920 
back on and see if that temporary
relieves<00:03:04.820> our<00:03:05.060> issue<00:03:06.670> all<00:03:07.670> right<00:03:07.930> 50-50

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
relieves our issue all right 50-50

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.670 
relieves our issue all right 50-50
chance<00:03:08.960> of<00:03:09.410> this<00:03:09.530> working<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:14.290> know<00:03:15.290> that

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
chance of this working I know that

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.030 
chance of this working I know that
sounds<00:03:15.980> toast<00:03:16.400> even<00:03:16.790> though<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:16.910> soldered<00:03:17.450> it

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
sounds toast even though I soldered it

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.670 
sounds toast even though I soldered it
she's<00:03:19.040> no<00:03:19.220> frickin<00:03:19.610> good<00:03:20.350> worth<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.470> shot

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
she's no frickin good worth the shot

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.130 
she's no frickin good worth the shot
though<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:23.000> that<00:03:23.150> pretty<00:03:23.450> much<00:03:23.540> ends<00:03:23.930> this

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
though so that pretty much ends this

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.320 
though so that pretty much ends this
video<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.800> thought<00:03:25.430> maybe<00:03:25.670> doing<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.150> brake

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
video I thought maybe doing a brake

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.150 
video I thought maybe doing a brake
inspection<00:03:26.600> most<00:03:27.290> likely<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.800> would<00:03:27.950> be<00:03:28.040> the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
inspection most likely it would be the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.920 
inspection most likely it would be the
brakes<00:03:28.430> it's<00:03:28.670> very<00:03:28.880> rare<00:03:29.240> at<00:03:29.510> least<00:03:29.660> in<00:03:29.810> my

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
brakes it's very rare at least in my

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.910 
brakes it's very rare at least in my
cases<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.650> see<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:33.230> brake<00:03:33.470> sensor<00:03:33.710> is

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
cases to see that the brake sensor is

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.650 
cases to see that the brake sensor is
gone<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.430> front<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:34.940> rear<00:03:35.060> sensor<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.480> don't

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
gone a front and rear sensor I don't

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.850 
gone a front and rear sensor I don't
really<00:03:35.810> need<00:03:35.960> the<00:03:36.050> front<00:03:36.290> one<00:03:36.410> but<00:03:36.560> they<00:03:36.680> come

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
really need the front one but they come

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.950 
really need the front one but they come

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
plus bucks for brakes which I don't I

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
plus bucks for brakes which I don't I
won't<00:03:43.850> be<00:03:44.000> needing<00:03:44.180> brakes<00:03:44.390> for<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.600> while

easy<00:04:04.430> projects<00:04:05.030> again<00:04:05.300> that<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.630> can

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
easy projects again that you can

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.120 
easy projects again that you can
troubleshoot<00:04:06.110> yourself<00:04:06.560> you<00:04:06.680> get<00:04:06.770> you<00:04:07.010> can

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
troubleshoot yourself you get you can

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.310 
troubleshoot yourself you get you can
identify<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:07.970> look<00:04:08.240> at<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.630> brake<00:04:08.810> pads<00:04:09.050> and

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
identify and look at the brake pads and

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.950 
identify and look at the brake pads and
see<00:04:09.440> how<00:04:09.590> much<00:04:09.770> pad<00:04:10.160> is<00:04:10.400> left<00:04:10.640> you<00:04:11.420> can<00:04:11.570> look<00:04:11.750> on

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
see how much pad is left you can look on

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.920 
see how much pad is left you can look on
the<00:04:12.020> side<00:04:12.710> what<00:04:13.610> it<00:04:13.760> is<00:04:13.880> is<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.270> proximity

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
the side what it is is a proximity

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.650 
the side what it is is a proximity
sensor<00:04:15.350> so<00:04:15.830> as<00:04:16.070> your<00:04:16.549> brake<00:04:16.730> pad<00:04:17.000> wears<00:04:17.330> and

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
sensor so as your brake pad wears and

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.240 
sensor so as your brake pad wears and
your<00:04:17.750> sensor<00:04:18.080> gets<00:04:18.170> close<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.620> the<00:04:18.739> rotor<00:04:18.980> once

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
your sensor gets close to the rotor once

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.710 
your sensor gets close to the rotor once
it<00:04:19.370> gets<00:04:19.670> close<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.030> rotor<00:04:20.210> touches<00:04:20.630> the

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
it gets close the rotor touches the

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.210 
it gets close the rotor touches the
rotor<00:04:20.930> that's<00:04:21.440> when<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:21.799> brake<00:04:22.010> lights

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
rotor that's when that brake lights

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.130 
rotor that's when that brake lights
gotta<00:04:22.460> come<00:04:22.670> on<00:04:22.820> but<00:04:23.000> unfortunately<00:04:23.570> mine<00:04:23.840> got

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
gotta come on but unfortunately mine got

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.650 
gotta come on but unfortunately mine got
caught<00:04:24.410> on<00:04:24.590> something<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:25.340> torch<00:04:26.150> that's<00:04:26.450> why

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
caught on something and torch that's why

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.630 
caught on something and torch that's why
my<00:04:26.870> lights<00:04:27.110> on<00:04:27.350> like<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.100> said<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.370> just<00:04:28.520> got<00:04:28.610> a

my lights on like I said I just got a

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.030 
my lights on like I said I just got a
new<00:04:28.880> sensor<00:04:29.530> really<00:04:30.530> could<00:04:30.680> use<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.830> beer

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
new sensor really could use a beer

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.190 
new sensor really could use a beer

make another video on replacing the

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.970 
make another video on replacing the
wheel<00:04:38.390> sensor<00:04:38.840> and<00:04:39.170> getting<00:04:39.500> rid<00:04:39.680> of<00:04:39.800> that

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
wheel sensor and getting rid of that
