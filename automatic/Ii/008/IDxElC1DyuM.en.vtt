00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
so today's video worked out pretty good

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.200 
so today's video worked out pretty good
for<00:00:04.319> me<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:06.200> was<00:00:07.200> wanting<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.560> try<00:00:07.770> the

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
for me I was wanting to try the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.990 
for me I was wanting to try the
quadrocopter<00:00:09.210> out<00:00:09.780> again<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.730> when<00:00:11.730> was

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
quadrocopter out again and when was

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.930 
quadrocopter out again and when was
blowing<00:00:12.679> sustained<00:00:13.679> twenty<00:00:14.309> miles<00:00:14.519> an<00:00:14.759> hour

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
blowing sustained twenty miles an hour

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.410 
blowing sustained twenty miles an hour
and<00:00:15.890> gusting<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.949> little<00:00:17.160> bit<00:00:17.250> more<00:00:17.460> than<00:00:18.210> that

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
and gusting a little bit more than that

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.260 
and gusting a little bit more than that
at<00:00:18.600> time<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.199> today<00:00:19.320> was<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> good<00:00:19.830> day<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.270> see

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
at time so today was a good day to see

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.290 
at time so today was a good day to see
how<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.779> would<00:00:21.900> hold<00:00:22.080> its<00:00:22.380> GPS<00:00:22.650> lock<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.760> all

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
how it would hold its GPS lock and all

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.200 
how it would hold its GPS lock and all
that<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:26.039> happened<00:00:26.519> Derek<00:00:26.939> was

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
that so just so happened Derek was

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.390 
that so just so happened Derek was
finishing<00:00:27.630> up<00:00:27.869> cutting<00:00:28.199> right<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:29.099> really

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
finishing up cutting right here really

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.429 
finishing up cutting right here really
close<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:30.269> where<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> loader<00:00:30.779> was<00:00:31.050> setting

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
close to where the loader was setting

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.310 
close to where the loader was setting
that<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.000> he<00:00:33.000> had<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.180> few<00:00:33.420> trees<00:00:33.719> left<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.290> I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that so he had a few trees left so I

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.630 
that so he had a few trees left so I
jumped<00:00:34.710> down<00:00:34.739> right<00:00:35.100> quick<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
jumped down right quick out of the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.290 
jumped down right quick out of the
loader<00:00:35.910> all<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.450> had<00:00:36.690> some<00:00:36.870> time<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:38.030> got<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
loader all I had some time and got the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.979 
loader all I had some time and got the
quad<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.350> lock<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.420> satellites<00:00:42.420> pretty

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
quad to lock on the satellites pretty

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.330 
quad to lock on the satellites pretty
quick<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:44.180> sent<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.270> up<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.750> air<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
quick and I sent it up in the air and

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.979 
quick and I sent it up in the air and
just<00:00:47.340> kind<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> started<00:00:47.969> hovering<00:00:48.390> around<00:00:48.510> him

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
just kind of started hovering around him

tilt right now almost full tilt on the
l830<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.320> cutting<00:01:08.189> these<00:01:08.250> last<00:01:08.549> she<00:01:08.880> trees<00:01:09.210> on

l830 and cutting these last she trees on
this<00:01:09.630> rim<00:01:09.960> right<00:01:10.350> here

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
this rim right here

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.859 
this rim right here
I<00:01:10.909> turned<00:01:11.909> into<00:01:12.119> my<00:01:12.330> log<00:01:12.570> pile<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:14.490> he

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
I turned into my log pile and then he

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.340 
I turned into my log pile and then he
tracks<00:01:15.869> all<00:01:16.170> off<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.460> edge<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.689> line<00:01:18.930> is

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
tracks all off the edge and the line is

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.109 
tracks all off the edge and the line is
just<00:01:19.590> right<00:01:20.070> there<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> other<00:01:20.670> side<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
just right there on the other side of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.969 
just right there on the other side of
that<00:01:21.270> clearing<00:01:21.840> right<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.470> from<00:01:22.770> where

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that clearing right there from where

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.490 
that clearing right there from where
he's<00:01:23.939> cutting<00:01:24.299> right<00:01:24.390> now<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.810> he<00:01:24.930> cuts<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.259> few

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
he's cutting right now so he cuts a few

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.350 
he's cutting right now so he cuts a few
more<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.189> line<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> I'll<00:01:26.790> get<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.060> above

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
more on that line and I'll get up above

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.960 
more on that line and I'll get up above
him<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.320> look<00:01:28.560> right<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.280> you

see<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> rubber<00:01:30.479> tire<00:01:30.840> cutter<00:01:31.229> I'm<00:01:31.590> actually

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
see the rubber tire cutter I'm actually

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.080 
see the rubber tire cutter I'm actually
standing<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.640> top<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.210> cab<00:01:33.890> I<00:01:34.890> climbed<00:01:35.820> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
standing on top of the cab I climbed a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.760 
standing on top of the cab I climbed a
parallel<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.509> top<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> where<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.290> could<00:01:37.560> kind

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
parallel on top of it where I could kind

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.310 
parallel on top of it where I could kind
of<00:01:37.860> overlook<00:01:38.280> him<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.610> little<00:01:38.850> bit<00:01:38.939> better<00:01:39.320> to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
of overlook him a little bit better to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
of overlook him a little bit better to
where<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.979> could<00:01:41.790> see<00:01:42.060> him<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.500> what<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
where I could see him and the what the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.810 
where I could see him and the what the
quad<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.909> doing<00:01:45.360> pretty<00:01:46.200> good<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.560> know<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.490> I

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
quad was doing pretty good you know so I

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.030 
quad was doing pretty good you know so I
would<00:01:48.659> had<00:01:48.930> no<00:01:49.079> catastrophe<00:01:49.770> or<00:01:49.799> anything

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
would had no catastrophe or anything

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.280 
would had no catastrophe or anything
like<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.210> far<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.720> good<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
like that so so far so good with the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.830 
like that so so far so good with the
quad<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:53.030> really<00:01:54.030> hadn't<00:01:54.240> had<00:01:54.270> any<00:01:54.509> trouble

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
quad I really hadn't had any trouble

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.709 
quad I really hadn't had any trouble
because<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.500> spent<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:57.360> know<00:01:57.390> last<00:01:57.780> six<00:01:58.140> months

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
because I spent you know last six months

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.179 
because I spent you know last six months
consistently<00:02:00.719> flying<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.350> other<00:02:01.380> quad<00:02:01.890> but

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
consistently flying the other quad but

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.359 
consistently flying the other quad but
it<00:02:02.369> didn't<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.210> camera<00:02:03.840> on<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.219> you<00:02:05.219> know

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it didn't have a camera on it you know
