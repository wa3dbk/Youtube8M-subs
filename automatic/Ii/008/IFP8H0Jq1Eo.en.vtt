off if you need to now these mirrors
come<00:01:13.690> in<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:13.900> 5<00:01:14.170> inch<00:01:14.410> and<00:01:14.620> a<00:01:14.740> 7<00:01:15.100> inch<00:01:15.250> they<00:01:15.820> also

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
come in a 5 inch and a 7 inch they also

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.790 
come in a 5 inch and a 7 inch they also
come<00:01:16.360> with<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.690> without<00:01:16.780> bluetooth<00:01:17.320> so

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
come with and without bluetooth so

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.920 
come with and without bluetooth so
what's<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.040> 5<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.400> 1/2<00:01:18.520> 7<00:01:18.760> well<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.510> 5<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.870> the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
what's a 5 and 1/2 7 well the 5 and the

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.150 
what's a 5 and 1/2 7 well the 5 and the
7<00:01:20.080> they<00:01:20.260> look<00:01:20.410> the<00:01:20.530> same<00:01:20.560> they're<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.920> same

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
7 they look the same they're the same

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.240 
7 they look the same they're the same
size<00:01:21.400> but<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.180> monitor<00:01:22.690> within<00:01:23.470> is<00:01:23.680> smaller

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
size but the monitor within is smaller

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.730 
size but the monitor within is smaller
so<00:01:24.820> most<00:01:25.420> people<00:01:25.600> go<00:01:25.870> with<00:01:25.900> a<00:01:26.080> 7<00:01:26.290> because<00:01:26.500> it

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
so most people go with a 7 because it

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.290 
so most people go with a 7 because it
makes<00:01:26.920> more<00:01:27.100> sense<00:01:27.160> because<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.670> outside<00:01:28.060> all

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
makes more sense because the outside all

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.850 
makes more sense because the outside all
looks<00:01:28.480> exactly<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.930> same<00:01:29.020> as<00:01:29.350> far<00:01:29.800> as

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
looks exactly the same as far as

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.860 
looks exactly the same as far as
Bluetooth<00:01:30.400> with<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.030> refers<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.420> is<00:01:31.630> your

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
Bluetooth with that refers to is your

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.080 
Bluetooth with that refers to is your
phone<00:01:32.110> a<00:01:32.380> bluetooth<00:01:33.220> mirror<00:01:33.550> you<00:01:33.670> can<00:01:33.820> use<00:01:33.970> as

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
phone a bluetooth mirror you can use as

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.640 
phone a bluetooth mirror you can use as
a<00:01:34.120> speakerphone<00:01:34.600> so<00:01:34.930> when<00:01:35.020> someone<00:01:35.260> calls<00:01:35.500> you

bluetooth you don't need that but the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.350 
bluetooth you don't need that but the
Bluetooth<00:01:45.040> has<00:01:45.190> nothing<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:45.580> do<00:01:45.850> with<00:01:46.300> a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
Bluetooth has nothing to do with a

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.600 
Bluetooth has nothing to do with a
wireless<00:01:46.659> camera<00:01:47.140> so<00:01:48.040> let's<00:01:48.250> talk<00:01:48.340> about<00:01:48.460> the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
wireless camera so let's talk about the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.920 
wireless camera so let's talk about the
camera<00:01:48.940> a<00:01:48.970> little<00:01:49.120> bit<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.420> how<00:01:49.510> that<00:01:49.720> works

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
camera a little bit and how that works

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.540 
camera a little bit and how that works
well<00:01:50.409> basically<00:01:50.800> this<00:01:50.920> amounts<00:01:51.250> at<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.400> back

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
well basically this amounts at the back

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.610 
well basically this amounts at the back
of<00:01:51.670> your<00:01:51.820> RV<00:01:51.940> or<00:01:52.180> vehicle<00:01:52.570> mounted<00:01:53.230> at<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.440> top

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
of your RV or vehicle mounted at the top

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.020 
of your RV or vehicle mounted at the top
and<00:01:53.830> you<00:01:53.890> can<00:01:54.010> angle<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.310> down<00:01:54.490> you've<00:01:54.760> got<00:01:54.909> the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
and you can angle it down you've got the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.010 
and you can angle it down you've got the
Sun<00:01:55.240> shield<00:01:55.510> as<00:01:55.659> well

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
Sun shield as well

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.540 
Sun shield as well
as<00:01:56.290> I<00:01:56.500> said<00:01:56.680> before<00:01:56.710> it's<00:01:57.070> got<00:01:57.220> night<00:01:57.460> vision

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
as I said before it's got night vision

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.219 
as I said before it's got night vision
got<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.210> LEDs<00:01:58.510> for<00:01:58.630> night<00:01:58.780> vision<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:59.110> it's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
got the LEDs for night vision and it's

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.320 
got the LEDs for night vision and it's
full<00:01:59.409> color<00:01:59.650> so<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.520> do<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:01.000> you'd<00:02:01.180> melt

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
full color so you do this you'd melt

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.899 
full color so you do this you'd melt
this<00:02:01.479> right<00:02:01.690> here<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:02.380> back<00:02:02.500> of<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.710> vehicle

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
this right here the back of the vehicle

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.610 
this right here the back of the vehicle
you<00:02:03.909> use<00:02:03.940> this<00:02:04.360> cable<00:02:04.720> here<00:02:04.870> we've<00:02:05.320> got<00:02:05.470> our

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
you use this cable here we've got our

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.059 
you use this cable here we've got our
power<00:02:05.830> upgrade<00:02:06.370> which<00:02:06.880> basically<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.510> means

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
power upgrade which basically that means

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.529
