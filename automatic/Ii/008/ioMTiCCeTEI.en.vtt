00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 uy 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.250
 what I need here I bring you a life 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.830
 of this which is now operation of 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.900
 knee we are in a new surgery 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.310
 let's see how it goes this time I think 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.580
 that all of us have been not 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.869
 has died is easy to water the truth already 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.090
 I know that this is more than anything 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.380
 miniseries of mini-games but then the 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.780
 It's true that I loved it, I loved it. 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.820
 they love surgery very much I do not know why 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.290
 Maybe one day I'll be a doctor but 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.150
 some do it I love you touch me 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.330
 knee 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.710
 but if I do not have a doctor to x-rays and I 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.460
 I think it's here sorry forgiveness is that 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.890
 I had not read it 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.480
 maybe I'm not a doctor after all 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.309
 see let's click here 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.830
 apparently we are going to see what is inside 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.629
 that knee the former king now that he 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.089
 suppose that I have to that I had to 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.710
 click on the knee and good and according to 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.229
 I think what I'm seeing is that 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.360
 here this part is not separated or that 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:03.309
 I think at least by the way it has 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.900
 sound also because do not forget to put me 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.730
 the headphones 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.170
 and I do not know if you have to put them 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.670
 if I find them here good 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.590
 they are not here if they were here 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.090
 near me because you put them but we 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.730
 they will listen to nothing like me 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.050
 now I do believe that it is here and so I do not 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.940
 I'll put a little house as background 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.080
 so that it does not feel so pleasant, not that 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:27.000
 it feels more enjoyable the thing 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.000
 we need a knife 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.850
 we need creampie we need creampie 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.420
 I think that to take away the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.340
 little hair 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.100
 although I think it's more than anything 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.770
 cut him there I do not know if it's to take him 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.690
 the hairs and not peak see bayshore picop 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.670
 of beige is now or if it were made to 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.550
 remove the hairs I think I think 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.979
 that no one can cut your skin 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.830
 yes yes you have it like that 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.090
 except that I think good son at least I 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.500
 I think if one day I broke the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.080
 leg first I'm going to restore the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.210
 leg not before I go to the doctor 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.400
 so to one we need now yes I think 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.980
 that something about the good knife does not 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.800
 do not 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:12.530
 this is sterilizing the area to put 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.520
 the wing adrenaline 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.520
 5 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.740
 we are the pickup of so many tourists 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.630
 Now I think we need the cotton 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.130
 let's see it here this is what 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.370
 we had done on somebody some 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.370
 surgery 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.840
 and I say I think we already left coffee to see 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.030
 we need an anesthesia 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.190
 when we do not need a pick-up of 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.050
 anesthetic that hurts the anesthesia that 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.580
 is that there are the needles and those little things 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.290
 they always give me things when it comes to 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.970
 inject the I do not know why but good 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.489
 let's give it to continue by the way 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.170
 happy new year I think this happened 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.700
 I'm recording on December 30 but 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.069
 you know that all the videos were recorded 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.780
 followed but good this video 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.250
 obviously it will go up after 31 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.530
 I think I 'm going to upload it on 2 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.360
 December if everything goes well and well 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.310
 happy happy new year but to be 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.900
 have gone well and well no way I think 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.730
 that it's about time that we enter 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.290
 the school some people I know that already 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.120
 there are several people who go in 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.099
 February but there are other people who 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.200
 they come in January and I'm one of those me 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.209
 I entered on January 6 and then I think that 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.959
 I'm going to have to slow down the 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.959
 videos because really 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.970
 this with which I am I believe that low 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.610
 the rhythm of the videos when I heard that a 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.600
 gas with that his leg swelled I do not know 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.020
 what I lied about there air or know it's 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.760
 I'm going to mix down the pace to the 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.710
 videos more than anything because I'm going to 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.900
 go back to school I will have to 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.730
 do homework and all those things already 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.650
 amusements are not over 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.770
 totally but I'm going to have to 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.500
 lower a bit of rhythm then for 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:53.380
 attend my studies more than anything 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.460
 I need some to altres pp this is not 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.200
 they wanted to win they did not go back to 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.870
 inflate more the knee to is not for 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.840
 Huiqui look inside the image thingy 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:07.660
 reset it also installed we need 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:11.000
 adjust the focus because I already know 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.580
 I have to see it 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.970
 this is forgiveness forgiveness almost killed 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:21.620
 by type you are fooling around now 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.320
 we need less insightec in the wind 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.420
 the cut off from the helicopter if 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.160
 we request the isos we are going to have to 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.260
 apparently cut something around here 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.210
 uu and I think that was the bone that was 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.310
 the soft bone hurt if you do not have this 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.040
 next site more of the pain now 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.260
 we need a gray eps i think they are 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.270
 we're going to have to take the little bone 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.669
 and take it out for me I think it's so that 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.280
 no longer feel pain the time and we are 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.990
 I think it's called scraping at best 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.930
 over the palms or yes yes we need 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.970
 scrape this area today I understand those 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.490
 little things and well I think the pain that 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.940
 I had was because I was half knows 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.860
 as weird in there and it fits 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.740
 is that good now I am a 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.910
 substitute goalie who burns my 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.910
 English is very good 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.930
 this track that is here is for 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:14.279
 meet us to know what is here 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.279
 learning English with me 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.789
 and what I obviously can not know without 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.889
 and we're going to take things from these 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.169
 little things did not leave much mark that 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.150
 I see so I think nothing happens 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.620
 I believe that this is one of the best and 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.900
 I am the best doctor because he did not leave 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.389
 brands more than anything now we need to 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.740
 say strips we're going to prices over here 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.050
 these are little things are the ones that you put on 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.089
 on your forehead when you tear you 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.110
 I go out and once I broke my eyebrow 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:45.610
 totally for a cockroach because 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.830
 I thought he was chasing me 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.150
 good a guy I'm sorry I thought that if 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.430
 I was sorry, obviously I had not 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.050
 fanned nothing I opened the door and by average 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.479
 in the face or I did not look in the door 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.430
 when I had opened it and then 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.020
 just that I broke my eyebrow 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.249
 I totally get a lot of blood 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.490
 you made us in the w 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:05.199
 wv but when it comes if you guys saw 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.389
 the old chapters because you can 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.219
 see more than anything points in perfect that 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.050
 he bleeds all over his face like this with these 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:14.759
 capsules that are put in the eyes in the 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.759
 face and so I looked practically 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:25.479
 I think that this kind of video was like that 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.219
 in their like that they reflect that really 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.800
 that more of these videos I do not know if they want 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:31.539
 more surgeries of things or want better 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.800
 let me go to another type of minimum 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.780
 because this page is full and 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.310
 video games remember that this mini 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.719
 game especially I'll leave them in 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.330
 the description that you want to spend 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:42.129
 and I do not know how to play for a while also to see if 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.810
 is to surpass my record I think yes they are 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:45.909
 to overcome because I was wrong twice 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.740
 almost killed him for not focusing it well or 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:49.569
 who kills a person for not focusing 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.949
 well in good lens that's me so 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.020
 I can be the best and worst doctor to 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.439
 same time see you in the next bye 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.439
 bye friends
