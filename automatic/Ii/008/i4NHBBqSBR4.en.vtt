yay ok I think for every movie you buy

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.179 
yay ok I think for every movie you buy
it<00:02:00.389> comes<00:02:00.600> with<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.079> opening<00:02:01.499> beginning

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
it comes with the opening beginning

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.889 
it comes with the opening beginning
that's<00:02:02.700> why<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.880> wanted<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.359> one<00:02:03.509> because<00:02:03.810> it
