00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
is all about but yeah the reason I chose

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.340 
is all about but yeah the reason I chose
this<00:04:14.269> game<00:04:14.599> played<00:04:14.810> by<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:14.959> way

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
this game played by the way

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.720 
this game played by the way
is<00:04:15.410> not<00:04:15.560> actually<00:04:15.710> a<00:04:15.950> particularly<00:04:16.550> good

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
is not actually a particularly good

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.880 
is not actually a particularly good
gameplay<00:04:17.240> it's<00:04:18.050> just<00:04:18.320> there's<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.500> couple<00:04:18.680> of

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
gameplay it's just there's a couple of

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.070 
gameplay it's just there's a couple of
shots<00:04:19.130> which<00:04:19.370> I<00:04:19.520> made<00:04:19.730> which<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.300> kind<00:04:20.840> of<00:04:20.900> like

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
shots which I made which I kind of like

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.580 
shots which I made which I kind of like
I<00:04:21.350> think<00:04:21.950> it's<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.100> first<00:04:22.370> time<00:04:22.550> i<00:04:22.610> got<00:04:22.880> the

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
I think it's the first time i got the

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.810 
I think it's the first time i got the
collateral<00:04:24.590> thing<00:04:24.770> as<00:04:24.920> well<00:04:25.070> what's<00:04:25.700> it

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
collateral thing as well what's it

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.260 
collateral thing as well what's it
called<00:04:26.000> in<00:04:26.090> this<00:04:26.180> game<00:04:26.770> efficiency<00:04:27.770> i<00:04:27.800> think

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
called in this game efficiency i think

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.760 
called in this game efficiency i think
but<00:04:29.270> yeah<00:04:29.390> I<00:04:29.420> kind<00:04:29.840> of<00:04:29.870> like<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.140> gameplay<00:04:30.530> and

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
but yeah I kind of like the gameplay and

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.560 
but yeah I kind of like the gameplay and
even<00:04:31.220> though<00:04:31.280> it's<00:04:31.400> not<00:04:31.580> that<00:04:31.730> great<00:04:31.760> score<00:04:32.360> I

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
even though it's not that great score I

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.420 
even though it's not that great score I
thought<00:04:33.380> would<00:04:33.500> be<00:04:33.530> pretty<00:04:33.800> entertaining<00:04:34.250> to

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
thought would be pretty entertaining to

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.080 
thought would be pretty entertaining to
watch<00:04:35.380> now<00:04:36.380> end<00:04:36.650> of<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:36.860> world<00:04:37.090> Christmas

as<00:05:56.240> it<00:05:56.390> is<00:05:56.510> now<00:05:56.720> but<00:05:56.960> I<00:05:57.350> figure<00:05:58.070> I<00:05:58.100> may<00:05:58.340> as<00:05:58.370> well

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
as it is now but I figure I may as well

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.000 
as it is now but I figure I may as well
take<00:05:58.700> it<00:05:58.760> to<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.030> next<00:05:59.150> stage<00:05:59.590> get<00:06:00.590> more<00:06:00.800> buff

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
take it to the next stage get more buff

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.400 
take it to the next stage get more buff
get<00:06:01.400> more<00:06:01.580> weight<00:06:01.790> whatever<00:06:02.270> just<00:06:02.630> hit<00:06:03.320> the

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
get more weight whatever just hit the

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.770 
get more weight whatever just hit the
gym<00:06:03.560> some<00:06:03.800> more<00:06:03.980> and<00:06:04.240> the<00:06:05.240> reason<00:06:05.480> is<00:06:05.600> because

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
gym some more and the reason is because

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.940 
gym some more and the reason is because
I<00:06:05.990> was<00:06:06.050> kind<00:06:06.320> of<00:06:06.350> held<00:06:06.560> back<00:06:06.800> by<00:06:07.100> that<00:06:07.940> drug<00:06:08.300> and

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
I was kind of held back by that drug and

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.230 
I was kind of held back by that drug and
you<00:06:09.950> know<00:06:10.070> now<00:06:10.370> I<00:06:10.400> have<00:06:10.610> the<00:06:10.700> opportunity<00:06:11.210> I

bit<00:06:22.910> here<00:06:22.940> this<00:06:23.300> bit<00:06:23.450> is<00:06:23.479> one<00:06:23.660> of<00:06:23.720> my<00:06:23.810> favorites

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
bit here this bit is one of my favorites

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.469 
bit here this bit is one of my favorites
take<00:06:25.190> up<00:06:25.310> two<00:06:25.430> guys<00:06:25.610> then<00:06:25.880> move<00:06:26.150> up<00:06:26.270> with<00:06:26.450> a

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
take up two guys then move up with a

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:27.610 
take up two guys then move up with a
teammate<00:06:26.900> up<00:06:27.050> front

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
teammate up front

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.409 
teammate up front
but<00:06:28.520> it's<00:06:28.610> definitely<00:06:28.790> something<00:06:29.090> you<00:06:29.180> want

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
but it's definitely something you want

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.480 
but it's definitely something you want
when<00:06:29.660> you're<00:06:29.780> sniping<00:06:30.250> you<00:06:31.250> want<00:06:31.400> the

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
when you're sniping you want the

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.159 
when you're sniping you want the
teammate<00:06:31.790> up<00:06:31.910> there<00:06:32.120> just<00:06:32.479> to<00:06:32.570> cover<00:06:33.020> your

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
teammate up there just to cover your

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.680 
teammate up there just to cover your
back<00:06:33.380> wall<00:06:33.860> bang<00:06:34.070> I<00:06:34.340> think<00:06:35.150> the<00:06:35.210> collateral<00:06:35.630> is

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:35.690 
back wall bang I think the collateral is

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.260 
back wall bang I think the collateral is
coming<00:06:35.990> up<00:06:36.080> in<00:06:36.139> a<00:06:36.229> sec<00:06:36.470> as<00:06:36.650> well<00:06:37.000> no<00:06:38.000> maybe

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
coming up in a sec as well no maybe

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.500 
coming up in a sec as well no maybe
that's<00:06:38.449> later<00:06:38.510> on<00:06:38.750> who<00:06:39.650> knows<00:06:39.889> but<00:06:40.360> black<00:06:41.360> ops

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
that's later on who knows but black ops

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.030 
that's later on who knows but black ops
2<00:06:41.690> of<00:06:41.810> course<00:06:42.020> I<00:06:42.199> am<00:06:42.380> definitely<00:06:42.770> going<00:06:42.919> to

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.040 
2 of course I am definitely going to

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.280 
2 of course I am definitely going to
begin<00:06:43.850> some<00:06:44.090> more<00:06:44.210> sniper<00:06:44.510> gameplay<00:06:44.780> fairly

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
begin some more sniper gameplay fairly

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.370 
begin some more sniper gameplay fairly
soon<00:06:45.470> because<00:06:45.860> I<00:06:46.100> have<00:06:46.580> to<00:06:46.639> say<00:06:46.880> this<00:06:47.630> is<00:06:47.960> the

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
soon because I have to say this is the

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.670 
soon because I have to say this is the
game<00:06:48.740> which<00:06:48.919> I've<00:06:49.070> enjoyed<00:06:49.340> sniping<00:06:49.880> the<00:06:50.000> most

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
game which I've enjoyed sniping the most

second on well world of war was good for
the<00:06:53.810> unseeable<00:06:54.710> Texans<00:06:55.400> but<00:06:55.669> even<00:06:56.570> though

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
the unseeable Texans but even though
