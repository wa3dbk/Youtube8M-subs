00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
keys right for it is insane but

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.529 
keys right for it is insane but
obviously<00:01:52.609> the<00:01:52.729> only<00:01:52.850> problem<00:01:53.090> with<00:01:53.209> him<00:01:53.329> is

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
obviously the only problem with him is

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.449 
obviously the only problem with him is
he's<00:01:54.469> only<00:01:54.560> got<00:01:54.679> three<00:01:54.829> star<00:01:55.009> skills<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:55.340> not

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
he's only got three star skills and not

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:57.879 
he's only got three star skills and not
for<00:01:56.049> so<00:01:57.049> this<00:01:57.200> is<00:01:57.319> where<00:01:57.469> the<00:01:57.560> team<00:01:57.709> gets

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:57.889 
for so this is where the team gets

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:58.870 
for so this is where the team gets
interesting<00:01:58.340> then<00:01:58.429> so<00:01:58.520> as<00:01:58.609> you<00:01:58.670> can<00:01:58.759> see

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
interesting then so as you can see

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.949 
interesting then so as you can see
everyone's<00:01:59.179> on<00:01:59.299> nine<00:01:59.450> chemistry<00:01:59.810> at<00:01:59.899> the

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
everyone's on nine chemistry at the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:00.940 
everyone's on nine chemistry at the
minute<00:02:00.139> the<00:02:00.200> only<00:02:00.409> reason<00:02:00.679> by<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.829> way

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
minute the only reason by the way

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.080 
minute the only reason by the way
because<00:02:01.159> it's<00:02:01.249> not<00:02:01.490> because<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:01.759> can't<00:02:01.969> do<00:02:02.060> it

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
because it's not because I can't do it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.699 
because it's not because I can't do it
live<00:02:02.270> again<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.869> two<00:02:03.020> centre-backs<00:02:03.350> needs<00:02:03.649> to

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
live again the two centre-backs needs to

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:04.840 
live again the two centre-backs needs to
be<00:02:03.799> switched<00:02:04.039> around<00:02:04.189> in<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.490> whole<00:02:04.639> team's

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
be switched around in the whole team's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.819 
be switched around in the whole team's
nine<00:02:05.060> chemistry<00:02:05.569> by<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.109> minute<00:02:06.469> it<00:02:06.619> just

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
nine chemistry by the minute it just

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.370 
nine chemistry by the minute it just
doesn't<00:02:07.069> get<00:02:07.159> it<00:02:07.219> because<00:02:07.700> there<00:02:07.819> there's<00:02:08.030> no

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
doesn't get it because there there's no

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.900 
doesn't get it because there there's no
the<00:02:09.380> bundesliga<00:02:10.009> link<00:02:10.160> but<00:02:10.310> in<00:02:10.399> sediment<00:02:10.789> then
