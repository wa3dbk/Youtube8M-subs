00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
put your feet together and then you do

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.859 
put your feet together and then you do
the<00:00:17.490> jump<00:00:17.699> right<00:00:17.940> after<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.630> want<00:00:18.810> to

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the jump right after that so you want to

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.720 
the jump right after that so you want to
make<00:00:18.900> sure<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.590> you're<00:00:19.890> kind<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.189> landing<00:00:20.609> on

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
make sure that you're kind of landing on

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.689 
make sure that you're kind of landing on
both<00:00:20.970> feet<00:00:21.330> instead<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.990> left<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.830> right<00:00:23.039> right

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
both feet instead of left to right right

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.269 
both feet instead of left to right right
left<00:00:23.730> right<00:00:24.330> left<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:25.080> wants<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.859> more<00:00:26.039> like

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
left right left it wants to be more like

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.450 
left right left it wants to be more like
left<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.180> right<00:00:27.390> right<00:00:28.019> left<00:00:28.050> right<00:00:28.800> together

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
left to right right left right together

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.330 
left to right right left right together
and<00:00:29.910> then<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.660> go<00:00:30.810> back<00:00:31.019> into<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.349> jump<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.279> if

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
and then you go back into the jump so if

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.940 
and then you go back into the jump so if
we<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.640> do<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.120> few<00:00:34.050> jumps<00:00:34.320> over<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.860> over

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
we just do a few jumps over and over

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.040 
we just do a few jumps over and over
again<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.399> get<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.910> feel<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.180> that

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.030 

everything's<00:00:40.050> really<00:00:40.260> light<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:40.829> feet

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
everything's really light on your feet

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.950 
everything's really light on your feet
you<00:00:41.100> don't<00:00:41.399> want<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.730> stomping<00:00:42.239> too<00:00:42.420> much

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.660 

so<00:00:45.960> that's<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.350> double<00:00:46.620> jump<00:00:46.860> or<00:00:47.100> triple<00:00:47.489> jump

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
so that's the double jump or triple jump

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.160 
so that's the double jump or triple jump
you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.120> many<00:00:48.239> jumps<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
you can do as many jumps as you want and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.510 
you can do as many jumps as you want and
then<00:00:49.230> we're<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> double<00:00:50.309> turn

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
then we're going to do the double turn

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.189 
then we're going to do the double turn
and<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.879> double<00:00:51.120> turn<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.690> same<00:00:51.930> rhythm

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and the double turn is the same rhythm

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.920 
and the double turn is the same rhythm
as<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> double<00:00:52.829> jealous<00:00:53.180> left<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.360> right<00:00:54.390> right

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
as a double jealous left to right right

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.500 
as a double jealous left to right right
left<00:00:54.960> right<00:00:55.469> left<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:56.610> double<00:00:56.910> turn<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.329> going

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
left right left the double turn is going

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.610 
left right left the double turn is going
to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> same<00:00:57.960> way<00:00:58.170> you're<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.500> pick

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
to be the same way you're going to pick

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
exact foot rhythm as the jump that we

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
exact foot rhythm as the jump that we
just<00:01:11.790> did<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.510> put<00:01:12.720> those<00:01:12.840> together<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.439> then
