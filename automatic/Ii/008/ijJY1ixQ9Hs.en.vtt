00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.499
 hello welcome to this territorial model of the euro zone 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:12.709
 and this time Lugo is showing how to do that 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.789
 computer automatically 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.289
 with a program called plan commented 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.960
 this which download from the page before the power such description of the video 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.470
 that statut is uploaded by dying downloads do not install 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.039
 It's free 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.829
 once you accept it where the prices this icon 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.790
 what we are going to do is open it 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.820
 and he's going to present us 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.820
 in this window right now we are in the event 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.850
 However 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.060
 we can choose a mode if we have simple counter 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.620
 advanced hour of the day counter just like process 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.230
 good on a motorbike 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.290
 ford offers the way in which as we have to for computers not 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.740
 efe simple counter whom we love to this active network allows to move the antenna 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.810
 and it allows us to choose minutes 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.010
 according to the strangers days 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 the advanced counter two performances 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.750
 up is down 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.980
 if we go to time of day 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.220
 what 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.320
 we choose of the day 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.080
 in which we remain of defense fayez 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.980
 for example lists at 27 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.780
 two prominent 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.810
 i 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.400
 then that moment 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.960
 of that family larsen however and with 30 minutes 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.340
 p - ap 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.210
 and already then woman maite put to quito 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.870
 protest this icon yes 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.070
 there are bad times 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.180
 there are four hours and 52 minutes 27 seconds left 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.680
 in that situation the others counter has spotted 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.740
 said simple counter here is for this one for example 30 minutes 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.300
 30 hours another Italian 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.300
 micheletti also German in the face of adversity or training 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.609
 venus your activity this depending on 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:10.950
 forever 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.830
 even if it's for the common good if your computer is generating many is 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.890
 generating 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.800
 with many processes and is going to pay automatically ducÃ³ by dior processes 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.020
 performance are the following in which they are in this area 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:30.759
 here we are going to be able to what we want them to do when that time arrives I do know 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:32.929
 if we want it to restart 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:35.929
 on the other hand the internet is suspended close session 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.679
 Gold and the Moor in the world 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:44.029
 kylie encounter here is at stake with the expected time 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.209
 when we want to wait after the count is over 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.319
 we want to wait 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.319
 1 5 seconds and 603 Vienna 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:59.269
 guti for example if you're doing something here what if if while 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.769
 diets and you put 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.009
 in prayer or bed sometimes means to turn off 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.499
 the good good program tells you that you can not pay because 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:16.680
 because there are open programs and that appears there had a message point that 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.240
 it is lined 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.480
 but force or close but because this does not put back two plugs 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.619
 this already with this 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.559
 you are going to be able to him that the program 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:30.559
 it was forced the closing of the applications 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:35.819
 and well then and this is another story is what they liked and served 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:39.249
 you already know some doubt beyond this 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:40.499
 we had not been there
