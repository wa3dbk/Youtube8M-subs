playing<00:02:34.189> their<00:02:34.340> own<00:02:34.370> game<00:02:34.519> because<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.090> know

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
playing their own game because you know

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.780 
playing their own game because you know
you<00:02:35.450> can<00:02:35.750> lose<00:02:35.930> every<00:02:36.379> 2v2<00:02:36.769> in<00:02:37.159> the<00:02:37.340> sole<00:02:37.549> lanes

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
you can lose every 2v2 in the sole lanes

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.869 
you can lose every 2v2 in the sole lanes
you<00:02:38.510> got<00:02:38.720> gragas<00:02:39.230> cassiopi<00:02:39.739> on<00:02:39.859> one<00:02:40.099> side<00:02:40.370> you

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
you got gragas cassiopi on one side you

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.149 
you got gragas cassiopi on one side you
got<00:02:41.090> gragas<00:02:41.629> LeBlanc<00:02:42.079> versus<00:02:42.470> chogath<00:02:42.920> wreck

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
got gragas LeBlanc versus chogath wreck

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.800 
got gragas LeBlanc versus chogath wreck
so<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.370> know<00:02:43.519> it's<00:02:43.670> not<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:44.150> best<00:02:44.329> matchup

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
so you know it's not the best matchup

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.569 
so you know it's not the best matchup
just<00:02:44.840> because<00:02:45.379> of<00:02:45.500> how<00:02:45.620> mobile<00:02:46.069> gragas<00:02:46.459> and

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
just because of how mobile gragas and

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.580 
just because of how mobile gragas and
LeBlanc<00:02:46.879> can<00:02:47.120> be<00:02:47.299> but<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:47.930> problem<00:02:48.409> was<00:02:48.530> that

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
LeBlanc can be but the problem was that

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.879 
LeBlanc can be but the problem was that
their<00:02:49.489> vision<00:02:50.090> just<00:02:50.420> was<00:02:50.810> being<00:02:51.290> pushed<00:02:51.650> back

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
their vision just was being pushed back

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.449 
their vision just was being pushed back
they<00:02:52.159> didn't<00:02:52.579> get<00:02:52.700> aggressive<00:02:53.269> Ward<00:02:53.599> for

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
they didn't get aggressive Ward for

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.860 
they didn't get aggressive Ward for
