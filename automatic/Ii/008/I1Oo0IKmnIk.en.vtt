it would break it all the way down to
the<00:00:35.640> screen<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.149> there<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.450> wouldn't<00:00:36.660> even

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
that's way too common I wouldn't make a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.190 
that's way too common I wouldn't make a
giveaway<00:00:47.520> video<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:48.059> something<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.480> common

guys<00:00:52.199> said<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.469> got<00:00:52.680> hit<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.010> BB<00:00:53.219> gun<00:00:53.340> or<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
guys said I got hit with a BB gun or I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.100 
guys said I got hit with a BB gun or I
got<00:00:53.879> shot<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.210> paintball<00:00:54.390> now<00:00:54.809> that's<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
got shot with a paintball now that's a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.110 
got shot with a paintball now that's a
little<00:00:55.320> bit<00:00:55.410> more<00:00:55.530> logical<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.030> an

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
little bit more logical but this is an

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.790 
little bit more logical but this is an
oval<00:00:57.539> not<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> circle<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> think<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.680> got

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
oval not a circle and I think if I got

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.860 
oval not a circle and I think if I got
pippa<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> BB<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.789> paintball<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.480> more<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
pippa the BB or a paintball be more of a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.560 
pippa the BB or a paintball be more of a
circle<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:03.149> takes<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
circle like that so that takes out that

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.140 
circle like that so that takes out that
guess<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.860> one<00:01:05.250> person<00:01:05.790> got<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.540> right<00:01:06.689> and

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
guess now one person got it right and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.020 
guess now one person got it right and
that<00:01:09.150> person<00:01:09.500> you'll<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.740> who<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.400> are<00:01:11.549> it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that person you'll know who you are it

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.770 
that person you'll know who you are it
was<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.320> controller<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.430> was<00:01:15.060> playing<00:01:15.360> call<00:01:15.750> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
was a controller I was playing call of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
was a controller I was playing call of
duty<00:01:15.900> with<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.530> my<00:01:16.619> friends<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.880> lost

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
duty with one of my friends and I lost

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.300 
duty with one of my friends and I lost
so<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> chucked<00:01:19.140> my<00:01:19.380> controller<00:01:19.799> at<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.040> ground

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
so I chucked my controller at the ground

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.280 
so I chucked my controller at the ground
and<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:21.030> some<00:01:21.240> reason<00:01:21.270> my<00:01:21.659> iphone<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.200> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and for some reason my iphone was on the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.350 
and for some reason my iphone was on the
ground<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.619> never<00:01:22.860> leave<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
ground I never leave it there and the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.719 
ground I never leave it there and the
controller<00:01:24.780> went<00:01:25.170> right<00:01:25.680> onto<00:01:26.009> my<00:01:26.100> iphone<00:01:26.250> hit

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
controller went right onto my iphone hit

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
controller went right onto my iphone hit
it<00:01:26.850> right<00:01:26.939> there<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.390> broke<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.380> can

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
it right there and broke it so you can

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.200 
it right there and broke it so you can
see<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> Oval<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.670> bottom<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
see the Oval on the bottom of the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.490 
see the Oval on the bottom of the
controller<00:01:31.079> matches<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.400> iphone<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.500> that's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
controller matches the iphone and that's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.249 
controller matches the iphone and that's
