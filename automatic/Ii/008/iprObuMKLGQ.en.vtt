00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello I am sad boston de box 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.580
 Office Hello I'm rudy de box 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.840
 office we will show you how 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.280
 protect your hands in the frame 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.540
 of a boxing class to achieve a 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.799
 effective editing of hands you go 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.179
 need two pairs of tapes 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.640
 a pair on each hand for 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.900
 immobilize the wrist and the hand he goes 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.060
 have already positioned the hand in 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.519
 the alignment of the forearm the first 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.090
 band will serve as a dish for 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.359
 immobilize the wrist and the hand in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.160
 the ideal punching position in boxing on 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.120
 will try to cover well the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.190
 metacarpal try to find the right ones 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.930
 metacarpus reflects the part that is going 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.260
 boxing in the middle of the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.540
 gang 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.710
 story that when one fists the fist 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.570
 bandage does not move and protects 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.210
 effectively this part try to 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.820
 put a good layer on the metacarp and 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.379
 at the same time to go on a cross for 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.140
 try to limit the movements of the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.399
 wrist until now the bandage 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.020
 is very close to a strapping for 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.220
 to do a doctor at a height of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.979
 wrist the third part is over on 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.570
 will now try to immobilize 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.520
 still a little more hand 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.780
 then to prevent the party who 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.369
 protect your card from slipping 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.030
 in the white is to go back on the on 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.439
 the top of the hand 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.659
 we will pass the band between the fingers 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.400
 going back on the outside without pulling 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.430
 on the finger the hand of being able to get well 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.280
 closed well locks and so without 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.079
 shoot the blu ray on the outside one 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.420
 go back to the other side of the sea 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.070
 diagonal is actually the same thing of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.380
 the other side here is always fleeing 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.729
 be careful what the band this not very 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.450
 flat to avoid the injuries of the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.549
 even superficial that to train 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.780
 internal problems and this 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.740
 technical pursues all will help 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.080
 better lock the hand with sort of 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.690
 bulges that will lie 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.760
 inside the hand and we can 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.100
 clear quite easily 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.980
 to do this a kind of handle that 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.869
 will power and who serves and the mandate I 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.140
 so finished one last check 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.310
 is needed 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.000
 actually no embarrassment to the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.710
 percussion by do you know so 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.790
 made a boxing montage and you 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:28.590
 can now go to the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:30.750
