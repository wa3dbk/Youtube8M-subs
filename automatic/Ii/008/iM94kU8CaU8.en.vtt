in<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> rooms<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.549> what's<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.479> point

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
think Dukes can be the same exact way

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.260 
think Dukes can be the same exact way
you<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.159> he<00:01:41.280> might<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.430> say<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> lot<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you know he might I say a lot but the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.510 
you know he might I say a lot but the
way<00:01:42.360> he<00:01:42.420> plays<00:01:42.689> he<00:01:42.899> goes<00:01:43.079> hard<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.680> he<00:01:44.280> plays

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520

with<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.790> super<00:01:45.509> hard<00:01:45.720> motor<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.290> think

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
with a super hard motor and I think

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.440 
with a super hard motor and I think
that's<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> great<00:01:46.979> thing<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.460> next<00:01:48.090> season

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
