00:03:49.150 --> 00:04:05.530 
check out the performance here some
small<00:03:50.150> like<00:03:50.780> there<00:03:51.080> and<00:03:51.110> sound

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.360 

okay<00:04:06.540> we<00:04:07.170> have<00:04:07.290> right<00:04:07.740> trigger<00:04:08.010> your<00:04:08.190> left

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
okay we have right trigger your left

okay we have right trigger your left
trigger<00:04:08.580> here<00:04:12.350> so<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.680> course<00:04:13.920> in<00:04:14.250> terms<00:04:14.490> of

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
trigger here so of course in terms of

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.720 
trigger here so of course in terms of
graphics<00:04:15.270> you<00:04:15.570> can<00:04:15.750> see<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:16.110> it<00:04:16.800> is<00:04:17.280> not<00:04:17.580> as

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
graphics you can see that it is not as

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.910 
graphics you can see that it is not as
good<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:18.090> course<00:04:18.780> if<00:04:19.080> you<00:04:19.230> would<00:04:19.440> play<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:19.800> on<00:04:19.890> a

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
good of course if you would play it on a

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.400 
good of course if you would play it on a
PC<00:04:21.980> it's<00:04:22.980> pretty<00:04:23.250> obvious<00:04:23.750> but<00:04:24.750> it's<00:04:25.200> still

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
PC it's pretty obvious but it's still

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.500 
PC it's pretty obvious but it's still
pretty<00:04:25.650> good<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:26.610> you<00:04:26.760> can<00:04:26.880> play<00:04:27.030> a<00:04:27.060> full

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
pretty good that you can play a full

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
pretty good that you can play a full
like<00:04:28.230> PC<00:04:28.740> game<00:04:29.040> here<00:04:29.430> on<00:04:30.950> my<00:04:31.950> smartphone<00:04:36.530> so

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
like PC game here on my smartphone so

like PC game here on my smartphone so
forth<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.130> graphics<00:04:38.520> it's<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:38.940> little<00:04:39.180> bit

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
forth the graphics it's a little bit

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.970 
forth the graphics it's a little bit
lower<00:04:39.770> but<00:04:40.770> who<00:04:41.280> cares<00:04:41.640> I<00:04:41.910> can<00:04:42.060> play<00:04:42.330> dirt<00:04:43.110> on

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
lower but who cares I can play dirt on

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.570 
lower but who cares I can play dirt on
my<00:04:44.250> phone<00:04:45.650> if<00:04:46.650> they<00:04:46.680> ever<00:04:46.950> have<00:04:47.160> some<00:04:47.400> lag

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
my phone if they ever have some lag

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.920 
my phone if they ever have some lag
issues<00:04:52.640> so<00:04:53.640> of<00:04:53.700> course<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:54.090> controls<00:04:54.480> take

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
issues so of course the controls take

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.280 
issues so of course the controls take
some<00:04:55.140> time<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.560> get<00:04:55.650> used<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:56.130> hear<00:04:56.660> this<00:04:57.660> it's

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
some time to get used to hear this it's

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.690 
some time to get used to hear this it's
a<00:04:58.410> little<00:04:58.650> bit<00:04:58.740> different<00:04:58.950> when<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.490> don't

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
a little bit different when you don't

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:08.900 
a little bit different when you don't
have<00:05:00.150> a<00:05:00.180> controller<00:05:00.900> oh<00:05:02.030> my<00:05:03.030> god<00:05:07.550> of<00:05:08.550> course<00:05:08.580> I

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
have a controller oh my god of course I

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.790 
have a controller oh my god of course I
can<00:05:09.120> adjust<00:05:09.420> my<00:05:09.450> left<00:05:09.750> trigger<00:05:09.960> here<00:05:10.380> to<00:05:10.680> you

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
can adjust my left trigger here to you

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.440 
can adjust my left trigger here to you
break<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:12.950> can<00:05:13.950> simulate<00:05:14.190> them<00:05:14.640> holding<00:05:15.210> in<00:05:15.330> the

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
break I can simulate them holding in the

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.130 
break I can simulate them holding in the
right<00:05:15.600> trigger<00:05:15.900> but<00:05:16.350> good<00:05:16.770> at<00:05:16.920> pushing<00:05:17.160> it<00:05:17.370> up

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
right trigger but good at pushing it up

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.870 
right trigger but good at pushing it up
and<00:05:19.140> then<00:05:19.950> just<00:05:20.220> use<00:05:20.670> the<00:05:20.820> brake<00:05:21.090> here<00:05:22.880> still

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
and then just use the brake here still

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.060 
and then just use the brake here still
pretty<00:05:24.120> good<00:05:24.330> performance<00:05:24.570> I<00:05:25.230> didn't<00:05:25.920> even

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
pretty good performance I didn't even

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.250 
pretty good performance I didn't even
know<00:05:26.340> until<00:05:26.640> today<00:05:27.000> that<00:05:27.360> you<00:05:27.450> can<00:05:27.600> do<00:05:27.720> this<00:05:27.900> or

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
know until today that you can do this or

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.440 
know until today that you can do this or
I've<00:05:28.800> seen<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:29.370> a<00:05:29.490> little<00:05:29.670> bit<00:05:29.790> you<00:05:30.060> can<00:05:30.210> do<00:05:30.330> it

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
I've seen it a little bit you can do it

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.480 
I've seen it a little bit you can do it
but<00:05:30.660> I<00:05:30.810> didn't<00:05:31.170> think<00:05:31.380> that<00:05:31.530> it<00:05:31.650> was<00:05:31.830> this<00:05:32.100> good

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
but I didn't think that it was this good

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.780 
but I didn't think that it was this good
I'm<00:05:33.240> $7<00:05:33.780> anything<00:05:34.320> just<00:05:34.860> in<00:05:35.100> the<00:05:35.280> cloud<00:05:35.520> the
