 Welcome from the ifa 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.439
 Messelive TV and digital television tv 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.980
 welcome you here at the fair 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.310
 Today we have a conversation with Mrs. Yvonne 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.010
 hunold deputy 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.710
 chairman of e on ag and a 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.470
 Real profi in things home appliances 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.150
 with tradition and innovation 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.390
 alike what you get on this 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.760
 to experience the trade fair booth this year 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.140
 what are the highlights in things 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.390
 tradition always comes back 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.930
 them and what is the innovation of it 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.329
 year on your stand the tradition is 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.789
 like every year a special model of the sg 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.910
 wand this year's very first 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.600
 times with 10 years warranty so almost 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.039
 Lifetime warranty for a Swiss 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.620
 quality product will be added 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.479
 a new super box set with a whole 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.280
 new tripod with many many 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.310
 accessories with shredder and 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.530
 clean savior and innovative we are yes 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.540
 anyway have this spring already in 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.299
 lembeck brought a milk frother 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.750
 which save up to 400,000 me too 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.540
 can 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.420
 and completely new now on the fifa 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.450
 comes the juicer of our lot user 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.720
 so that our customers throughout the year 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.689
 can enjoy fresh juice and could 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.000
 one think a juicer always stays 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.939
 a juicer no matter what you do but 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.159
 what makes this device different? 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.930
 the other can be the customer of the 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.020
 buyers have the difference but what 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.619
 of what they make of the as New 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.420
 Of course, the customer knows 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.820
 we do not see that very much 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.100
 it is not a juice centrifuge that is 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.229
 so no centrifugal force on it 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.960
 but it is a prestige there 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.220
 inside the principle then the fruit that 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.540
 vegetable rest and thus just this juice 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.250
 squeezes and does not fling 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.000
 That's the main thing for everyone 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.470
 vitamins that's what you're doing now 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.110
 the challenge as a manufacturer 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.240
 constantly seeing new trends 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.960
 recognize or create new ideas 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.940
 to have 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.180
 implement new ideas and here too 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.790
 to offer you the ideas to fly 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.040
 they are lying on the street or falling 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.650
 not difficult again and again to something new 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.050
 develop and offer 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.820
 It certainly is not easy because it is 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.440
 Almost everything already exists in this world 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.600
 but as you say for example 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.810
 Centrifuges have been around for years and years 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.070
 decades a juicer 1 los user 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.320
 That's not it 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.709
 development 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.360
 as far as the thing is concerned 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.610
 yes, there are always innovations 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.590
 always ideas again and again 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.350
 something new that you do not actually 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.610
 believed to be able to develop it but 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.430
 succeeds in a media star 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.600
 if you go over this eva like 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.090
 actually already last year 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.330
 is a topic that one of stand up to 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.980
 stand accompanies the topic of energy saving 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.750
 The energy revolution is on everyone's lips here 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.750
 energy-saving buttons are pressed 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.780
 spectacular and with a heap of press 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.489
 save electricity what does that mean in theirs 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.050
 products for you actually completely 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.050
 In concrete terms, how do you do that? 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.900
 surely it is an absolutely clear one 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.300
 juicer to stay with the topic 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.400
 does not need a lot of electricity a sg 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.900
 wand has never had much electricity 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.580
 used, but still brings fuller 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.989
 performance as they are 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.810
 logically just what this 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.150
 As far as ecology and economics are concerned, yes 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.709
 both then somewhere finally 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.200
 yes unfortunately god this stream yes 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.160
 even pay 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.620
 we also try logically 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.260
 innovative ideas to have developments 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.140
 to have that I just get the me 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.790
 Nevertheless, every day use energy-saving 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.360
 can use 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.939
 and finally also for the area of 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.000
 I think I'm making myself 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.140
 thoughts resource-saving too 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.799
 that's what it's for you too 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.900
 to save resources on the topic 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.539
 one theme is very clear for us, though 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.519
 that time over 46 years the main topic 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.830
 the service that is what we mean 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.720
 produce devices and want the 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.120
 afterwards because something does not work 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.520
 not equal tilt to the garbage dump 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.949
 but we just want these devices 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.620
 repair and therefore we have been since 46 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.479
 years own service 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.009
 then I wish you both 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.080
 Together, new devices are coming over and over again 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.830
 and the old ones live as long as they can 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:50.310
 and much success at ifa 2012 for the 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:52.889
 I thank the spectators the next day 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.830
 me with you for the attention 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.360
 and we will certainly be with you 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.330
 one or the other interesting 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.009
 innovations or traditions of 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.610
 the ifa report back to him 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.610
 Thank you
