airmax six from their new Xtreme line

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.780 
airmax six from their new Xtreme line
generally<00:00:11.110> I<00:00:11.260> don't<00:00:11.530> do<00:00:11.710> as<00:00:11.860> much<00:00:11.889> Mosby<00:00:12.550> stuff

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
generally I don't do as much Mosby stuff

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.839 
generally I don't do as much Mosby stuff
as<00:00:12.940> I<00:00:13.059> do<00:00:13.120> nerf<00:00:13.480> but<00:00:14.320> these<00:00:14.980> looked<00:00:15.549> really

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
as I do nerf but these looked really

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.940 
as I do nerf but these looked really
reminiscent<00:00:16.209> of<00:00:16.570> the<00:00:16.810> old<00:00:17.020> nerf<00:00:17.410> Air<00:00:17.710> Tech

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
reminiscent of the old nerf Air Tech

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.189 
reminiscent of the old nerf Air Tech
series<00:00:18.279> blasters<00:00:18.790> so<00:00:19.060> I<00:00:19.090> thought<00:00:19.810> I'd<00:00:19.990> take<00:00:20.140> a

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
series blasters so I thought I'd take a

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:20.910 
series blasters so I thought I'd take a
look

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
look

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.790 
look
it<00:00:21.100> is<00:00:21.310> a<00:00:21.340> six<00:00:22.330> shot<00:00:22.570> auto<00:00:22.869> rotating<00:00:23.500> turret

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
it is a six shot auto rotating turret

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.790 
it is a six shot auto rotating turret
and<00:00:23.949> how<00:00:24.670> you<00:00:24.730> fire<00:00:25.300> it<00:00:25.330> is<00:00:25.630> you<00:00:25.900> pump<00:00:26.470> this<00:00:26.619> up

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
and how you fire it is you pump this up

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.710 
and how you fire it is you pump this up
this<00:00:27.010> is<00:00:27.070> an<00:00:27.279> air<00:00:27.640> pressure<00:00:27.880> blaster<00:00:28.449> and<00:00:28.630> then

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
this is an air pressure blaster and then

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.810 
this is an air pressure blaster and then
pull<00:00:29.349> the<00:00:29.500> trigger<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:29.920> away<00:00:30.279> you<00:00:30.340> go

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
pull the trigger and away you go

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.049 
pull the trigger and away you go
one<00:00:31.269> important<00:00:31.779> thing<00:00:31.810> to<00:00:31.960> know<00:00:32.230> is<00:00:32.519> it<00:00:33.519> comes

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
one important thing to know is it comes

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.939 
one important thing to know is it comes
with<00:00:34.180> these<00:00:34.420> and<00:00:34.809> I<00:00:34.930> don't<00:00:34.960> know<00:00:35.320> how<00:00:35.620> well

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
with these and I don't know how well

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.360 
with these and I don't know how well
it'll<00:00:36.250> show<00:00:36.580> up<00:00:37.049> the<00:00:38.049> difference<00:00:38.470> on<00:00:38.680> camera

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
it'll show up the difference on camera

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.189 
it'll show up the difference on camera
but<00:00:39.549> these<00:00:40.269> are<00:00:40.479> what<00:00:40.780> they<00:00:40.870> call<00:00:40.900> their

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
but these are what they call their

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.950 
but these are what they call their
extreme<00:00:41.830> darts<00:00:42.280> and<00:00:42.489> they<00:00:43.059> are<00:00:43.269> made<00:00:43.479> out<00:00:43.510> of<00:00:43.780> a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
extreme darts and they are made out of a

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.240 
extreme darts and they are made out of a
much<00:00:44.440> much<00:00:45.129> harder<00:00:45.610> foam<00:00:46.089> than<00:00:46.870> normal<00:00:47.620> nerve

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
much much harder foam than normal nerve

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.460 
much much harder foam than normal nerve
darts<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:48.850> I<00:00:49.269> believe<00:00:49.629> that's<00:00:49.839> because<00:00:50.260> with

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
darts and I believe that's because with

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.229 
darts and I believe that's because with
the<00:00:50.559> air<00:00:50.680> pressure<00:00:51.010> blaster<00:00:51.699> if<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:51.970> were<00:00:52.089> to

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
the air pressure blaster if you were to

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.689 
the air pressure blaster if you were to
use<00:00:52.420> regular<00:00:53.049> darts<00:00:53.350> in<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:53.680> instead<00:00:54.280> of

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
use regular darts in it instead of

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.369 
use regular darts in it instead of
firing<00:00:54.970> them<00:00:55.239> properly<00:00:55.750> it<00:00:55.960> would<00:00:56.080> basically

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
firing them properly it would basically

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.579 
firing them properly it would basically
just<00:00:56.650> blow<00:00:57.280> holes<00:00:57.610> in<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.150> sides<00:00:58.390> of<00:00:58.659> the<00:00:59.409> foam

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
just blow holes in the sides of the foam

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.520 
just blow holes in the sides of the foam
darts<00:00:59.920> so<00:01:00.760> make<00:01:01.510> sure<00:01:01.540> if<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:02.049> are<00:01:02.080> gonna<00:01:02.320> pick

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
darts so make sure if you are gonna pick

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.780 
darts so make sure if you are gonna pick
one<00:01:02.589> of<00:01:02.739> these<00:01:02.830> up<00:01:02.890> that<00:01:03.189> you<00:01:03.280> pick<00:01:03.430> up<00:01:03.549> their

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
one of these up that you pick up their

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.570 
one of these up that you pick up their
extreme<00:01:04.360> dart<00:01:04.900> refills<00:01:05.439> otherwise<00:01:06.400> you're

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
extreme dart refills otherwise you're

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.670 
extreme dart refills otherwise you're
gonna<00:01:06.640> have<00:01:06.760> a<00:01:06.880> lot<00:01:07.030> of<00:01:07.150> broken<00:01:07.330> darts<00:01:07.680> but

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
gonna have a lot of broken darts but

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.090 
gonna have a lot of broken darts but
okay<00:01:09.160> the<00:01:09.850> important<00:01:10.360> thing<00:01:10.540> is<00:01:10.920> what<00:01:11.920> are<00:01:11.950> the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
okay the important thing is what are the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.810 
okay the important thing is what are the
ranges<00:01:12.400> like<00:01:12.580> so<00:01:13.060> here<00:01:13.420> we<00:01:13.570> go

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
ranges like so here we go

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.670 
ranges like so here we go
and<00:01:15.820> they<00:01:16.300> don't<00:01:16.480> they<00:01:16.690> just<00:01:16.720> say<00:01:17.080> on<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.470> box

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
and they don't they just say on the box

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.340 
and they don't they just say on the box
to<00:01:17.950> pump<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:18.970> up<00:01:19.120> multiple<00:01:19.780> times<00:01:19.990> they<00:01:20.200> don't

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
to pump it up multiple times they don't

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.900 
to pump it up multiple times they don't
really<00:01:20.500> give<00:01:20.740> you<00:01:20.770> a<00:01:20.860> number<00:01:21.370> so<00:01:21.610> I'm<00:01:21.730> just

a couple more in you get us up to ten

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.720 
a couple more in you get us up to ten
and<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:28.530> advertiser<00:02:28.980> ranges<00:02:29.400> on<00:02:29.580> this

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
and the advertiser ranges on this

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.610

blaster<00:02:30.180> are<00:02:30.530> 60<00:02:31.530> feet<00:02:31.819> so<00:02:32.819> we<00:02:33.239> will<00:02:33.510> use<00:02:34.470> that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
blaster are 60 feet so we will use that

00:02:34.620 --> 00:03:14.090 
blaster are 60 feet so we will use that
as<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.830> benchmark<00:03:07.820> okay<00:03:10.519> Fargo<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:14.010> of

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
as the benchmark okay Fargo and of

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.740 
as the benchmark okay Fargo and of
course<00:03:14.340> one<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.970> things<00:03:15.450> with<00:03:15.630> air

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
course one of the things with air

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.180 
course one of the things with air
pressure<00:03:15.900> blasters<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.769> have<00:03:16.890> all<00:03:17.070> that

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
pressure blasters is you have all that

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.620 
pressure blasters is you have all that
extra<00:03:17.340> time<00:03:17.640> between<00:03:17.790> shots<00:03:18.209> because<00:03:18.359> you<00:03:18.510> got

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
extra time between shots because you got

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.740 
extra time between shots because you got
to<00:03:18.720> pump<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.989> up<00:03:19.609> okay<00:03:20.609> here's<00:03:20.940> our<00:03:21.120> first<00:03:21.540> one

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
to pump it up okay here's our first one

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.500 
to pump it up okay here's our first one
the<00:03:22.350> black<00:03:22.590> darts<00:03:23.010> not<00:03:23.250> great<00:03:23.850> visibility<00:03:24.150> in

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
the black darts not great visibility in

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.190 
the black darts not great visibility in
the<00:03:24.600> grass<00:03:24.810> but<00:03:25.170> sitting<00:03:26.040> right<00:03:26.579> on<00:03:26.609> 29<00:03:27.299> but

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
the grass but sitting right on 29 but

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.170 
the grass but sitting right on 29 but
you<00:03:28.320> could<00:03:28.470> see<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.739> one<00:03:28.920> kind<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:30.060> was

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
you could see that one kind of that was

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.620 
you could see that one kind of that was
a<00:03:30.209> much<00:03:30.660> lower<00:03:30.900> than<00:03:31.140> all<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> rest

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
a much lower than all the rest

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.300 
a much lower than all the rest
hopefully<00:03:33.630> you'll<00:03:33.810> be<00:03:33.840> able<00:03:34.079> to<00:03:34.260> see<00:03:35.160> him
