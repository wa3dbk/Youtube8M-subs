00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.020
 how about friends I am cristian of the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.120
 graiver in this video we are going to talk about 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.100
 3d printers and new technology 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.490
 that allows you to make an exact copy of your 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.490
 person 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.510
 3ds printers have become very common 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.280
 in the last three years today 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.140
 We see all kinds of printers like 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.510
 chocolate printers and printers that 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.220
 print wedding cakes and even robots 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.320
 many people are talking about this 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.850
 new 3d printing technology without 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.920
 But I 've never seen a good 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.930
 potential to this technology until today 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.970
 a few weeks ago we had the pleasure and the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.980
 opportunity to visit the company artex 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.870
 art that is a company specialized in 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.820
 scan and print body molds 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.080
 complete to full color the work that 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.480
 they make is really impressive 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.250
 I had the opportunity to experience 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.659
 with this technology and I want it 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.370
 share with you 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.350
 you must initially stop at the center 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.960
 of a rotating camera which takes 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.550
 photos of each angle 360 degrees there 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.110
 different ways with which you can 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.300
 generate your body you can even 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.979
 use up your xbox 360 with the 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.839
 kinect platform to scan your 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.729
 body then you get a small view 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.720
 preliminary so you can see how your 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.520
 3d print 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.080
 If you liked the image you can access 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.270
 buy it and prices vary 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.250
 depending on the size and in the details 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.130
 that you want to include in your model the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.170
 Price varies between 99 to 150 currently 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.760
 It takes 10 to 15 days to deliver this 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.040
 person weeks and today 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.140

 details that can be printed with the 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.750
 3d impressions if we notice carefully 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.660

 no way I just share the 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.280
 experience that I had with this technology 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.140
 this technology can be used 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.200
