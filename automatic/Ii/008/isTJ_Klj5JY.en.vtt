00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.010
 sponsor heading company thermaltake 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:12.929
 thermaltake play while young charges 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.570
 our gushing reviews 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.710
 geospirit and a before him bring energy 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.710
 at any work table 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.230
 Hello everyone, I am Arina and this is a techno-kitchen 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.859
 We continue to examine the 31 series of urban from 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.410
 thermaltake 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.820
 on line we have r model and before 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
 how to start the days let's remember 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.489
 what modifications arman 31 we had and 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.530
 so at first it was with the model external 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.100
 Interfaces she had in front of a button 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.260
 on top of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.210
 then we got a model t whose 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.110
 interfaces are moved to the top and buttons 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.629
 power and reset 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.379
 front right now we have the third 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.390
 case p 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.329
 and how is it so different from the previous one 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.850
 models thought we finally found in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.129
 the model has 2 yusb 20 ports there is only 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.050
 two she shot down 30 but it would be quite sad 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.969
 or fun if you made all the difference 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.340
 only in this but a little poking around 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.559
 we found a revolutionary feature 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.560
 p models have no door 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.510
 the front panel is attached to the body 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.159
 who do not like the doors will be satisfied 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.750
 well, we can state the fact 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.340
 what are the air inlets 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.259
 made for just one external 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.890
 fan and even then in a small 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.990
 quantity 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.880
 that is, this case has increased noise from 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.310
 system and reduced airflow at 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.290
 installing two front fans well 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.659
 and everything else is identical you just 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.210
 repeat review from the model 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.899
 29 centimeters are reserved for the video card 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.060
 for gtx780 or r9 290x 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.890
 most it but if you close with on 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.109
 versions with long gigabyte coolers 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.140
 or install a cooler from arctic or 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.329
 growing to take ryden 7990 then problems 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.020
 also will not remove the basket with 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.030
 winchesters 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.250
 and now available space in 41 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.590
 centimeter so the system will be up 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.630
 six or up to three hard drives you decide 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.579
 in the case fit all existing on 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.580
 market CPU cooler and nye but sharpening 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.280
 two-section underwater radiator 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.840
 rear two holes for gun hoses 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.120
 which can be used for wire 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.890
 or to put the case on the chain developed 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.140
 cable management easily removable 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.780
 dust filter two fans in front 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.970
 and the ability to also add 2 at the back 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.130
 front two top and one bottom 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.770
 all twelve centimeters feet with 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.330
 rubber layered docking station for 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.790
 three and a half and two and a half 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.340
 inch hard drives and firmly telec 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.560
 That's actually the whole review of what is 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.400
 armor piercing was p model and you were 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.400
 Arina see you
