actually<00:01:27.550> like<00:01:27.640> 27<00:01:28.210> inches<00:01:28.420> i<00:01:28.540> think<00:01:29.970> overall

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
actually like 27 inches i think overall

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.050

the<00:01:31.420> m82a1<00:01:32.410> m107<00:01:33.040> is<00:01:34.020> 52<00:01:35.020> inches<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.310> think<00:01:36.850> so

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
the m82a1 m107 is 52 inches I think so

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.760 
the m82a1 m107 is 52 inches I think so
the<00:01:37.150> body<00:01:37.300> is<00:01:37.509> like<00:01:37.630> 35<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.229> receiver<00:01:38.560> the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
the body is like 35 the receiver the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.790 
the body is like 35 the receiver the
entire<00:01:39.040> receiver<00:01:39.399> everything<00:01:39.940> I<00:01:40.590> put<00:01:41.590> these

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
entire receiver everything I put these

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.889 
entire receiver everything I put these
here<00:01:42.130> because<00:01:42.460> it's<00:01:42.670> always<00:01:43.090> wobbling<00:01:43.660> so<00:01:43.840> I

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
here because it's always wobbling so I

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.510 
here because it's always wobbling so I
had<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.050> put<00:01:44.380> these<00:01:44.619> here<00:01:45.039> just<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.369> make<00:01:45.490> sure

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
had to put these here just to make sure

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.210 
had to put these here just to make sure
that<00:01:45.729> it<00:01:45.819> doesn't<00:01:46.350> continue<00:01:47.350> waddling<00:01:48.009> I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
that it doesn't continue waddling I

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.219 
that it doesn't continue waddling I
don't<00:01:48.670> know<00:01:48.729> why<00:01:48.850> but<00:01:48.880> on<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.509> picture<00:01:49.960> showed
