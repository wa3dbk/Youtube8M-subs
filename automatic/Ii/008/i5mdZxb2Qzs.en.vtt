00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
was way too strong for my hair and my

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.910 
was way too strong for my hair and my
hair<00:00:41.160> literally<00:00:41.969> started<00:00:42.390> smoking<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.739> had

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
hair literally started smoking and I had

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.729

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
to cut off more than 16 inches so it was

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.860 
to cut off more than 16 inches so it was
a<00:00:46.770> traumatic<00:00:47.160> experience<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:48.300> was<00:00:48.450> not<00:00:48.629> fun

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
a traumatic experience it was not fun

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.029 
a traumatic experience it was not fun
and<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.140> never<00:00:49.350> want<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.649> go<00:00:49.770> through<00:00:49.800> that

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

for<00:06:46.040> my<00:06:46.160> videos<00:06:46.550> and<00:06:47.000> you<00:06:47.030> you<00:06:47.660> only<00:06:47.810> see<00:06:48.080> me

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
for my videos and you you only see me

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.200 
for my videos and you you only see me
like<00:06:48.380> this<00:06:48.410> once<00:06:48.950> a<00:06:49.100> week<00:06:49.280> but<00:06:49.850> that's<00:06:50.030> also

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
like this once a week but that's also

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.000 
like this once a week but that's also
because<00:06:50.360> I'm<00:06:50.720> in<00:06:50.870> school<00:06:51.170> my<00:06:51.500> hair<00:06:51.680> is<00:06:51.800> in<00:06:51.920> a

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
because I'm in school my hair is in a

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.610 
because I'm in school my hair is in a
bun<00:06:52.040> every<00:06:52.700> single<00:06:53.150> day<00:06:53.330> and<00:06:53.750> I<00:06:53.990> only<00:06:54.170> wash<00:06:54.410> my

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
bun every single day and I only wash my

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.860 
bun every single day and I only wash my
hair<00:06:54.800> two<00:06:54.980> times<00:06:55.190> a<00:06:55.340> week<00:06:55.520> so<00:06:55.910> I<00:06:56.210> guess<00:06:56.720> that

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:56.870 
hair two times a week so I guess that

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.360 
hair two times a week so I guess that
it's<00:06:56.990> easier<00:06:57.260> for<00:06:57.320> me<00:06:57.530> because<00:06:57.800> I'm<00:06:57.920> in<00:06:58.040> school

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
it's easier for me because I'm in school

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.970 
it's easier for me because I'm in school
