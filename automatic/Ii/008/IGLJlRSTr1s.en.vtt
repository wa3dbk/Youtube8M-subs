police<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.200> we're<00:00:04.440> at<00:00:04.500> CES<00:00:05.009> 2015<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:06.029> we<00:00:06.690> are

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
police and we're at CES 2015 and we are

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.150 
police and we're at CES 2015 and we are
taking<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.040> look<00:00:08.069> at<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.730> G<00:00:09.090> flex<00:00:09.300> 2<00:00:09.980> this<00:00:10.980> is

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
taking a look at the G flex 2 this is

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.690 
taking a look at the G flex 2 this is
obviously<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.670> second<00:00:12.120> iteration<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.690> LG's

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
obviously the second iteration of LG's

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.900 
obviously the second iteration of LG's
slightly<00:00:14.700> flexible<00:00:15.120> but<00:00:15.480> curved<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.890> guess<00:00:17.789> you

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
slightly flexible but curved I guess you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.660 
slightly flexible but curved I guess you
would<00:00:18.029> say<00:00:18.560> well<00:00:19.560> I'm<00:00:19.949> not<00:00:20.160> sure<00:00:20.220> we<00:00:20.400> call

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
would say well I'm not sure we call

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.070 
would say well I'm not sure we call
correction<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.270> am<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.570> i<00:00:21.600> made<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> taco

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
correction first am so i made the taco

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.779 
correction first am so i made the taco
phone<00:00:22.380> LG<00:00:22.800> made<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> one<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:23.609> curved

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
phone LG made the one that was curved

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.480 
phone LG made the one that was curved
the<00:00:23.880> other<00:00:24.029> way<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.080> g<00:00:25.260> flex<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the other way so the g flex to the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.670 
the other way so the g flex to the
biggest<00:00:26.760> upgrades<00:00:27.090> are<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> screen<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.529> i

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
biggest upgrades are in the screen and i

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.349 
biggest upgrades are in the screen and i
would<00:00:28.769> say<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.010> chipset<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.000> we've<00:00:30.210> got<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
would say the chipset so we've got a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.690 
would say the chipset so we've got a
snapdragon<00:00:30.960> 810<00:00:31.439> chipset<00:00:31.980> here<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
snapdragon 810 chipset here this is the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.490 
snapdragon 810 chipset here this is the
first<00:00:33.000> phone<00:00:33.300> i<00:00:33.480> believe<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.870> ounce<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
first phone i believe in ounce with the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.840 
first phone i believe in ounce with the
chipset<00:00:34.920> knife<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.370> probably<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> first

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
chipset knife it's probably the first

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.900 
chipset knife it's probably the first
one<00:00:36.059> demos<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.930> well<00:00:37.200> now<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.980> Snapdragon<00:00:38.640> 810

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
one demos as well now the Snapdragon 810

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.389 
one demos as well now the Snapdragon 810
chipset<00:00:39.480> as<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.930> may<00:00:40.230> well<00:00:40.260> be<00:00:40.590> aware<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.040> a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
chipset as you may well be aware is a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.610 
chipset as you may well be aware is a
64-bit<00:00:42.210> chip<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.989> difference<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.410> it's

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
64-bit chip but the difference is it's

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.350 
64-bit chip but the difference is it's
not<00:00:43.680> using<00:00:44.010> Qualcomm's<00:00:44.489> crate<00:00:44.820> cores<00:00:45.090> it's

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
not using Qualcomm's crate cores it's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.080 
not using Qualcomm's crate cores it's
using<00:00:45.809> arm<00:00:46.110> reference<00:00:46.680> designs<00:00:47.010> as<00:00:47.820> far<00:00:48.000> as

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
using arm reference designs as far as

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.790 
using arm reference designs as far as
speed<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.570> phone<00:00:48.750> does<00:00:48.960> feel<00:00:49.140> pretty<00:00:49.260> quick

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
speed the phone does feel pretty quick

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.529 
speed the phone does feel pretty quick
but<00:00:49.980> we're<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.250> pre-release<00:00:50.789> software<00:00:50.820> here

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
but we're on pre-release software here

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.060 
but we're on pre-release software here
so<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.870> hard<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.170> say<00:00:52.379> how<00:00:52.530> fast<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.010> will

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
so it's hard to say how fast it will

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.130 
so it's hard to say how fast it will
actually<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.670> reality<00:00:54.180> once<00:00:54.750> comes<00:00:55.020> out

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
actually be in reality once comes out

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.840 
actually be in reality once comes out
there<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> wild<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> don't<00:00:56.579> want<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
there in the wild so I don't want to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
there in the wild so I don't want to
comment<00:00:57.000> too<00:00:57.329> much<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.620> cameras

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
comment too much on that the cameras

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.069 
comment too much on that the cameras
seen<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> big<00:00:59.399> upgrade<00:00:59.550> as<00:00:59.879> well<00:01:00.090> we've<00:01:00.690> got<00:01:00.719> the

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
we're not seeing anything else yet but I

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.690 
we're not seeing anything else yet but I
think<00:02:23.319> based<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.860> presentation<00:02:24.250> we<00:02:24.550> saw

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
think based on the presentation we saw

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.699 
think based on the presentation we saw
there<00:02:24.940> will<00:02:25.120> be<00:02:25.360> more<00:02:25.690> system<00:02:26.200> apps<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.560> get

there will be more system apps to get

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
what they call it I think quick glance

so<00:02:50.739> you<00:02:50.830> have<00:02:51.040> knock-on<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.700> then<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:51.880> have

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
so you have knock-on and then you have

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.759 
so you have knock-on and then you have
that<00:02:52.060> which<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.660> neat<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.170> don't<00:02:53.410> know<00:02:53.500> if<00:02:53.650> it's

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
that which is neat I don't know if it's

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.320 
that which is neat I don't know if it's
still<00:02:53.830> quite<00:02:54.160> as<00:02:54.310> good<00:02:54.430> as<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.640> Motorola's

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
still quite as good as a Motorola's

still quite as good as a Motorola's
active<00:02:55.660> display<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.530> just<00:02:57.190> doesn't<00:02:57.280> seem<00:02:57.519> quite

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
active display I just doesn't seem quite

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.490 
active display I just doesn't seem quite
as<00:02:57.730> useful<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.569> plugging<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.200> center

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
as useful and the plugging the center

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.110 
as useful and the plugging the center
right<00:02:59.680> now<00:02:59.830> obviously<00:02:59.980> is<00:03:00.400> influencing<00:03:00.940> me<00:03:01.090> a

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
right now obviously is influencing me a

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.020 
right now obviously is influencing me a
little<00:03:01.299> bit<00:03:01.480> but<00:03:02.319> yeah<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.190> software

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
little bit but yeah that is the software

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.420 
little bit but yeah that is the software
on<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.269> g2<00:03:04.600> in<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.900> nutshell<00:03:05.220> hardware<00:03:06.220> wise

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
on the g2 in a nutshell hardware wise

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.460 
on the g2 in a nutshell hardware wise
they<00:03:06.910> have<00:03:07.120> these<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.660> self-healing<00:03:08.110> back

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
they have these the self-healing back

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.930 
they have these the self-healing back
has<00:03:08.859> made<00:03:09.070> a<00:03:09.100> return<00:03:09.250> they<00:03:09.579> called<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:09.910> the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
has made a return they called it the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.660 
has made a return they called it the
advanced<00:03:10.450> self-healing<00:03:10.989> back<00:03:11.260> now<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.799> heals

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
advanced self-healing back now it heals

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.120 
advanced self-healing back now it heals
up<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.120> 70<00:03:13.570> times<00:03:13.810> faster<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:14.350> believe<00:03:14.680> within

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
up to 70 times faster I believe within

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.340 
up to 70 times faster I believe within
three<00:03:15.489> seconds<00:03:15.880> for<00:03:16.180> small<00:03:16.390> scratches<00:03:16.660> which

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
three seconds for small scratches which

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.860 
three seconds for small scratches which
is<00:03:17.500> pretty<00:03:17.680> incredible<00:03:17.940> we<00:03:18.940> scratched<00:03:19.209> ours<00:03:19.540> a

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
is pretty incredible we scratched ours a

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.530 
is pretty incredible we scratched ours a
little<00:03:20.350> too<00:03:20.530> hard<00:03:20.829> so<00:03:21.489> that<00:03:21.970> they<00:03:22.150> can<00:03:22.269> quite

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
little too hard so that they can quite

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.849 
little too hard so that they can quite
heal<00:03:22.930> unfortunately<00:03:23.920> but<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.440> idea<00:03:26.739> is

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
heal unfortunately but the the idea is

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.039 
heal unfortunately but the the idea is
very<00:03:26.890> cool<00:03:27.630> unfortunately<00:03:28.630> I'm<00:03:28.780> still

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
very cool unfortunately I'm still

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.690 
very cool unfortunately I'm still

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
finding the self-healing back like on

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.460 
finding the self-healing back like on

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
upgrade on screen it is also been

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.370 
upgrade on screen it is also been
reduced<00:03:45.820> in<00:03:45.940> size<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.660> original<00:03:46.989> deflects

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
reduced in size the original deflects

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.960 
reduced in size the original deflects
was<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.590> six<00:03:47.920> inch<00:03:48.100> display<00:03:48.430> they<00:03:48.730> probably

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
was a six inch display they probably

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.900 
was a six inch display they probably
sound<00:03:49.239> at<00:03:49.359> 5.5<00:03:50.260> inches<00:03:50.650> which<00:03:51.549> is<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.760> same

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
sound at 5.5 inches which is the same

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.910 
sound at 5.5 inches which is the same
size<00:03:52.150> as<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.540> three<00:03:53.079> that's<00:03:53.709> really

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
size as the three that's really

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.140 
size as the three that's really
interesting<00:03:54.130> I<00:03:54.459> think<00:03:54.519> that's<00:03:54.760> probably<00:03:54.970> the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
interesting I think that's probably the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.610 
interesting I think that's probably the
first<00:03:55.329> time<00:03:55.630> I've<00:03:55.690> seen<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:56.019> manufacturer

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
first time I've seen a manufacturer

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.650 
first time I've seen a manufacturer
actually<00:03:56.950> decrease<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:58.000> size<00:03:58.150> of<00:03:58.540> a

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
actually decrease the size of a

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.330 
actually decrease the size of a
subsequent<00:03:59.140> phone<00:03:59.350> we're<00:03:59.859> just<00:03:59.980> kind<00:04:00.130> of<00:04:00.190> nice

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
subsequent phone we're just kind of nice

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.099 
subsequent phone we're just kind of nice
it<00:04:00.549> makes<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.850> easier<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.150> hold<00:04:01.359> not<00:04:01.660> I<00:04:01.959> like

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
it makes it easier to hold not I like

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.530 
it makes it easier to hold not I like
5.5<00:04:02.709> inches

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
hearing about G flex shoes so far we

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.180 
hearing about G flex shoes so far we
don't<00:04:24.960> know<00:04:25.080> anything<00:04:25.289> about<00:04:25.440> pricing<00:04:26.039> or

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
don't know anything about pricing or

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.590 
don't know anything about pricing or
availability<00:04:26.220> in<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.940> US<00:04:27.180> or<00:04:27.360> really

anywhere<00:04:27.930> else<00:04:28.080> yet<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:28.710> can<00:04:28.830> assume<00:04:29.039> it'll

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
anywhere else yet you can assume it'll

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.850 
anywhere else yet you can assume it'll
probably<00:04:29.460> be<00:04:29.639> more<00:04:29.850> expensive<00:04:30.150> than<00:04:30.389> g3<00:04:31.080> but

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
probably be more expensive than g3 but

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.400 
probably be more expensive than g3 but
that's<00:04:32.340> probably<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:33.030> given<00:04:33.449> because<00:04:34.169> of<00:04:34.320> this

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
that's probably a given because of this

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.050 
that's probably a given because of this
