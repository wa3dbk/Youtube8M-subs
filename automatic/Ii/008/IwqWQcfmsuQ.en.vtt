that<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.690> shouldn't<00:00:39.960> go<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.980> early<00:00:41.399> so

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that I shouldn't go for it this early so

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.250 
that I shouldn't go for it this early so
i<00:00:41.579> go<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> shadow<00:00:42.300> claw<00:00:42.629> instead<00:00:43.079> which

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
i go for the shadow claw instead which

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.660 
i go for the shadow claw instead which
is<00:00:43.350> pretty<00:00:43.469> fantastic<00:00:43.710> where<00:00:44.250> extra<00:00:44.489> drill

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
is pretty fantastic where extra drill

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.549 
is pretty fantastic where extra drill
helps<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.480> those<00:00:45.600> spin<00:00:45.870> blockers<00:00:46.350> though

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
helps it with those spin blockers though

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.260 
helps it with those spin blockers though
not<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.309> much<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.640> traveling<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.120> it

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
not so much with traveling because it

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.240 
not so much with traveling because it
has<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.570> natural<00:00:48.750> bulk<00:00:49.140> angelical<00:00:49.710> isn't

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
has that natural bulk angelical isn't

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.490 
has that natural bulk angelical isn't
stabbed<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.270> super<00:00:51.809> duper<00:00:52.379> lee

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
stabbed and it's not a super duper lee

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500 
stabbed and it's not a super duper lee
powerful<00:00:52.949> move<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:54.059> gonna<00:00:54.180> do<00:00:54.300> half

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
powerful move so it's gonna do half

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.150 
powerful move so it's gonna do half
which<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.870> okay<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.620> I'm<00:00:55.739> gonna<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.039> to

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
which is okay but I'm gonna have to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
which is okay but I'm gonna have to
switch<00:00:56.370> because<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.730> don't<00:00:56.940> want<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> get

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
switch because I don't want to get

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.240 
switch because I don't want to get
burned<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.350> that's<00:00:58.710> basically<00:00:58.949> what

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
burned and that's basically what

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.160 
burned and that's basically what
traveling<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.820> there<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.570> goes<00:01:01.050> for

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
traveling is there to do so goes for

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.049 
traveling is there to do so goes for
will<00:01:01.350> OS<00:01:01.530> x<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.980> Alakazam<00:01:02.460> perfect

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
will OS x is going to Alakazam perfect

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.759 
will OS x is going to Alakazam perfect
switching<00:01:03.449> because<00:01:03.719> i<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> magic<00:01:04.379> guard

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
switching because i have the magic guard

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.890 
switching because i have the magic guard
so<00:01:05.010> i<00:01:05.040> am<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.489> affected<00:01:05.939> by<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.270> it

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
so i am not affected by it and it

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.030 
so i am not affected by it and it
doesn't<00:01:07.140> matter<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.470> i'm<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> special

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
doesn't matter because i'm a special

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.070 
doesn't matter because i'm a special
attack<00:01:08.280> us<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.490> i'm<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.600> worried

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
attack us so i'm not really worried

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.020 
attack us so i'm not really worried
about<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.650> any<00:01:10.860> way<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.820> i<00:01:11.850> took<00:01:11.909> over

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
about it in any way so so i took over

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.760 
about it in any way so so i took over
the<00:01:12.210> shadow<00:01:12.420> ball<00:01:12.630> here<00:01:12.869> thinking<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the shadow ball here thinking that it

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.560 
the shadow ball here thinking that it
would<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:13.950> enough<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.490> take<00:01:15.000> him<00:01:15.180> down<00:01:15.210> but

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
would be enough to take him down but

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.120 
would be enough to take him down but
unfortunately<00:01:16.140> doesn't<00:01:16.619> turn<00:01:16.799> out<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
unfortunately doesn't turn out to be the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.499 
unfortunately doesn't turn out to be the
case<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.400> traveling<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.090> specially

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
case this traveling is specially

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.600 
case this traveling is specially
defensive<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.320> takes<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.920> hit<00:01:20.159> really

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
defensive and takes that hit really

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.609 
defensive and takes that hit really
nicely<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.780> i'm<00:01:21.840> gonna<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.140> switch<00:01:22.409> i

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
nicely so i'm gonna have to switch i

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.780 
nicely so i'm gonna have to switch i
definitely<00:01:22.920> don't<00:01:23.220> wanna<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.430> staying<00:01:23.670> in

didn't actually matter to me because

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
even if he did i'd be able to just

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.090 
even if he did i'd be able to just
shadow<00:02:44.610> bullet<00:02:44.970> anyway<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.810> i<00:02:46.230> really<00:02:46.740> didn't

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
shadow bullet anyway so i really didn't

definitely on this is humoral i was
thinking<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.360> know<00:03:15.390> what<00:03:15.660> he's<00:03:15.810> probably

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
thinking you know what he's probably

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.710 
thinking you know what he's probably
gonna<00:03:16.290> over<00:03:16.560> predict<00:03:16.890> because<00:03:17.540> extra<00:03:18.540> drill

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
gonna over predict because extra drill

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.800 
gonna over predict because extra drill
could<00:03:19.560> very<00:03:20.430> very<00:03:20.850> easily<00:03:21.060> be<00:03:21.270> killed<00:03:21.480> by<00:03:21.570> an

could very very easily be killed by an
awkward<00:03:22.290> yes<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:22.770> he's<00:03:22.980> probably<00:03:23.160> gonna

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
awkward yes so he's probably gonna

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.740 
awkward yes so he's probably gonna
predict<00:03:23.700> me<00:03:23.760> switch<00:03:23.970> go<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.330> something<00:03:24.600> like

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
predict me switch go for something like

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.420 
predict me switch go for something like
a<00:03:24.810> play<00:03:24.990> rough<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.650> i<00:03:25.740> ended<00:03:25.950> up<00:03:26.070> rapid

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
a play rough and i ended up rapid

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.680 
a play rough and i ended up rapid
spinning<00:03:26.670> because<00:03:26.790> i<00:03:26.910> really<00:03:27.270> need<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.510> get

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
spinning because i really need to get

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.270

those<00:03:27.810> sticky<00:03:28.620> web<00:03:28.740> out<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.160> i'll<00:03:29.250> be

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
those sticky web out of that i'll be

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.580 
those sticky web out of that i'll be
really<00:03:29.910> frustrating<00:03:30.090> for<00:03:30.540> me<00:03:30.600> so<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:31.110> got<00:03:31.560> rid

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
really frustrating for me so I got rid

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.410 
really frustrating for me so I got rid
of<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.010> then<00:03:32.430> ended<00:03:32.850> up<00:03:32.940> going<00:03:33.240> for<00:03:33.360> the

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
of it and then ended up going for the

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.730 
of it and then ended up going for the
earthquake<00:03:33.720> because<00:03:33.780> he<00:03:33.959> misses<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.350> second

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
play rough which kind of sucks to be

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.860 
play rough which kind of sucks to be
honest<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:38.190> all<00:03:38.520> honesty<00:03:38.880> I'm<00:03:39.390> not<00:03:39.630> really

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
sure how big a part it played doesn't

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.370 
sure how big a part it played doesn't
mean<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.060> extra<00:03:42.330> drill<00:03:42.510> gets<00:03:42.750> another<00:03:43.020> kill

like okay I should probably go into
dragonite<00:04:25.380> because<00:04:25.530> he's<00:04:25.620> probably<00:04:25.680> gonna

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
dragonite because he's probably gonna

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.680

he ends up bullet punching I make a

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.680 
he ends up bullet punching I make a
major<00:04:29.400> mistake<00:04:29.610> here<00:04:29.970> because<00:04:30.150> having

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
major mistake here because having

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.540 
major mistake here because having
Dragonite<00:04:31.050> there<00:04:31.200> with<00:04:31.350> a<00:04:31.380> multiscale<00:04:31.830> for<00:04:32.520> a

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
Dragonite there with a multiscale for a

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.490 
Dragonite there with a multiscale for a
free<00:04:33.300> switch<00:04:33.540> in<00:04:33.720> would<00:04:33.840> have<00:04:33.930> been<00:04:34.050> really

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
free switch in would have been really

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.020 
free switch in would have been really
nice<00:04:34.590> because<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:34.830> have<00:04:35.040> the<00:04:35.190> fire<00:04:35.430> punch<00:04:35.670> I<00:04:35.820> can

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
nice because I have the fire punch I can

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.540 
nice because I have the fire punch I can
kill<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.390> but<00:04:36.600> I<00:04:36.870> wasn't<00:04:37.560> able<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.950> preserve<00:04:38.250> it

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
kill it but I wasn't able to preserve it

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.620 
kill it but I wasn't able to preserve it
which<00:04:38.640> is<00:04:38.760> really<00:04:38.940> unfortunate<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:39.390> I<00:04:39.420> just

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
which is really unfortunate so I just

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.060 
which is really unfortunate so I just
have<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:39.840> hope<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.170> town<00:04:40.350> flame<00:04:40.650> can<00:04:40.860> survive
