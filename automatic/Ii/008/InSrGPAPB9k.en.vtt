 pollution detected up to 900 micrograms 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.930
 of particles per square meter of 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.059

 safe 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.880
 the 2.5 microgram material is a 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.670
 tiny contaminant that can enter 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.120
