00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.160
 the beautiful sun-drenched 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.720
 spring day my vacation so much 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.429
 children 5 from schools means it 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.679
 was busy with the training of psv 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.049
 this morning on the herdgang 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.269
 psv is preparing himself here with mark van bommel 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.430
 for the home match against nec de 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.470
 last home game of this season 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.150
 then the cup final and maybe 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.010
 do the all-deciding game 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.029
 against twente it will be an exciting ending 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.830
 of the competition 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.359
 yeah that's nice or this 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.289
 competition no week you can season 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.880
 already pretty good closing one 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.250
 Second, how you look at it 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.780
 returns to this with the maximum attainable 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.579
 yes the last one I saw 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.890
 click let it is no longer running 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.340
 that should focus on the second 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.469
 Place 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.940
 psv der already made one last weekend 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.770
 great start with a sounding one 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.989
 victory over FC Groningen 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.550
 here is goal number 3 and the make of it 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.469
 jeremain lens 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.969
 PSV suffer already with five zero and won 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.820
 finally with 5 2 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.530
 and showed that it can play football 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.949
 too bad we already knew that it is possible 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.449
 but do not fall back on what 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.080
 what i said before we know 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.790
 water light and 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.080
 we cannot change what I myself do 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.660
 but again it first had it 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.580
 excellent in terms of football in terms of experience 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.280
 twice a little less but it was too 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.660
 make it just fell back even further 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.280
 and delivered less space so yes below 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.860
 have had enough until two three had a good chance 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.080
 also a second half and after FC Groningen 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.970
 arrives nec in eindhoven on Sunday afternoon 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.830
 visit earlier this season played at the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.600
 plow against each other in Nijmegen 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.180
 it became a huge weather through this sphere 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.740
 from zanka excellent header one 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.740
 dries mertens corner kick 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.850
 but just before time PSV gave the 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.310
 apparently certain victory anyway 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.070
 pumping or drowning out of your hands 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.590
 nec that put a lot of pressure on them 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.080
 attack and through a brilliant 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.780
 goal of passing 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.060
 11 minutes before time the position 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.800
 draws the players right away has something 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.630
 right to oppose nec in here 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.890
 Eindhoven certainly no open house 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.330
 will love 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.570
 yes and is sea salt now have learned 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.070
 of how groningen played so it will 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.170
 a team are normally those too 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.390
 also fails then we have to be patient 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.450
 can take me to and the screen tons for the 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.370
 goal yes stuff that last ball in it 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.570
 yes, because being against the opponent is already 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.420
 one with all due respect you must be at home 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.820
 can win yes yes without them you 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.620
 strikes is respectfully but 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.209
 we must win otherwise have a chance 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.500
 more in second place 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.270
 Secondly, it seems pretty much 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.410
 the ultimate goal of this competition 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.820
 but here we leave with all 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.590
 youth interest in the 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.510
 May holiday remember that 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.790
 next Thursday on Ascension Day too 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.940
 to play another cup final is the 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.530
 cup final between psv and az 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.480
 lawyer wanted to go there for a moment 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.070
 look ahead and in particular also to 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.200
 in the last competition match 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.239
 Alkmaar won from az 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.010
 expect that in Rotterdam next week 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.750
 another incite the cup final 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.580
 well tonight I put on the first one 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.810
 the first half hour against us well 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.880
 played 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.110
 we got away a few times because 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.030
 that is still the possibility to 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.290
 score to come 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.880
 Keep doing it even less 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.410
 of dennis with very good players 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.320
 So 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.300
 it remains a very difficult team and we 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.280
 we must ensure that we are in good shape and 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.420
 create opportunities, we always do so but 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.310
 we should not give away opportunities like 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.970
 and determine who gave the first all 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.640
 firing 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.930
 basically gone so in that respect you have 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.730
 there are some lessons learned from 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.770
 lessons from that competition match 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.380
 without sin we are too late with 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.640
 shorter play and an opportunity that we 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.890
 minutes 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.230
 create that should be good first 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.140
 the focus on nec next Sunday afternoon 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.030
 at half past twelve without lucia narsingh 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.740
 it has been injured and possible for some time 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.630
 also without georginio vinousalum 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.400
 You were missing today at the training with 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.900
 an ankle injury 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.790
 decide for lawyer actually no 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.860
 some reason to like the setup 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.690
 who started against FC Groningen last week 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.880
 to change 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.470
 well that is no cause so if 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.920
 nothing happens tomorrow at the training 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.780
 then the players will now agree 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.250
 with yourself because this is my feeling 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.290
 your last home match in the 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.270
 philips stadium 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.710
 well we have decided with the board 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.060
 shortly after the last match in 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.620
 screws and give them and come back there 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.440
 but it already had the faces before 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.459
 I'm gone to become a champion 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.459
 do not make your question
