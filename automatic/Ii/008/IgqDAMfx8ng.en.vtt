00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
on the pressure plate it will go into

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.570 
on the pressure plate it will go into
the<00:00:15.210> chest<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.990> first<00:00:16.289> command<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.190> collect

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.089 
pressure plate and then click on the
chest<00:00:29.099> now<00:00:29.910> they're<00:00:30.150> linked<00:00:30.710> so<00:00:31.710> if<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.830> throw

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
items onto the pressure plate you'll see

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.170 
items onto the pressure plate you'll see
that<00:00:33.750> they<00:00:33.870> go<00:00:34.020> into<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> chest<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.940> can

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.359 
the items into individual chests I mean
I<00:02:02.899> could<00:02:03.080> just<00:02:03.229> have<00:02:03.350> this<00:02:03.530> gun<00:02:03.770> both<00:02:04.130> items

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
I could just have this gun both items

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.249 
I could just have this gun both items
into<00:02:04.640> one<00:02:04.880> chest<00:02:05.180> but<00:02:05.450> I<00:02:05.479> think<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.840> going<00:02:06.050> into

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
into one chest but I think it going into

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.999 
into one chest but I think it going into
separate<00:02:06.619> just<00:02:06.830> as<00:02:06.950> helpful<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:09.259> i'll<00:02:09.950> just

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
separate just as helpful so i'll just

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.800 
separate just as helpful so i'll just
show<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.399> how<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.580> create<00:02:10.880> this<00:02:11.060> quickly<00:02:11.360> all

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
show you how to create this quickly all

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.650 
show you how to create this quickly all
you<00:02:11.930> have<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.170> do<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:12.380> create<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.709> second<00:02:13.130> chest

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
you have to do is create a second chest

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.880 
you have to do is create a second chest
and<00:02:14.660> then<00:02:14.750> do<00:02:14.900> exactly<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.410> same<00:02:15.440> as<00:02:15.800> the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
and then do exactly the same as the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.150 
and then do exactly the same as the
first<00:02:16.040> command<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:18.080> chest<00:02:18.470> plate<00:02:18.770> create

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
first command so chest plate create

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.410 
first command so chest plate create
stand<00:02:19.880> on<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:21.020> then<00:02:21.140> hit<00:02:21.320> it<00:02:22.270> so<00:02:23.270> now

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
stand on that and then hit it so now

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.330 
stand on that and then hit it so now
they're<00:02:24.080> both<00:02:24.290> linked<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.070> pressure

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
they're both linked to that pressure

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.490 
they're both linked to that pressure
plate<00:02:25.700> if<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.300> didn't<00:02:26.540> add<00:02:26.630> any<00:02:26.900> filters<00:02:27.290> all

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
plate if I didn't add any filters all

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.810 
plate if I didn't add any filters all
the<00:02:27.620> items<00:02:27.920> would<00:02:27.980> just<00:02:28.190> fill<00:02:28.340> up<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.580> first

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
the items would just fill up the first

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.870 
the items would just fill up the first
chest<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.420> then<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.660> second<00:02:30.019> chest<00:02:30.850> so<00:02:31.850> now

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
chest and then the second chest so now

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.910 
chest and then the second chest so now
I'll<00:02:32.090> just<00:02:32.239> add<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.570> filters<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.709> it's<00:02:33.830> the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
I'll just add the filters so it's the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.890 
I'll just add the filters so it's the
same<00:02:34.130> as<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.400> would<00:02:34.549> just<00:02:35.090> on<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.390> single<00:02:35.750> one

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
same as you would just on the single one

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.820 
same as you would just on the single one
that<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.500> do<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.680> on<00:02:36.769> both<00:02:36.920> chest<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.489> time

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
that you do it on both chest this time

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.170 
that you do it on both chest this time
so<00:02:39.830> now<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.010> see<00:02:40.220> when<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.430> chuck<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.760> items<00:02:41.030> on

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
so now you see when I chuck the items on

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.840 
so now you see when I chuck the items on
they'll<00:02:41.360> go<00:02:41.450> into<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.720> separate<00:02:42.080> chests<00:02:42.850> this

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
they'll go into the separate chests this

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.430 
they'll go into the separate chests this
plug-in<00:02:44.120> is<00:02:44.239> definitely<00:02:44.690> useful<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:45.170> mean<00:02:45.320> you

could<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:45.620> have<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:46.100> pressure<00:02:46.400> plate<00:02:46.610> outside

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
could just have a pressure plate outside

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.640 
could just have a pressure plate outside
your<00:02:47.330> house<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.840> then<00:02:47.930> all<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.110> items<00:02:48.470> get
