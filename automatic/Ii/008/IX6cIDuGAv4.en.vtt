00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.450
 hello i introduce myself stefan smart i 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.060
 am responsible for the arts workshop 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.830
 plastics for over 15 years at 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.340
 Bruguier I will introduce you to 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.250
 thing with which I experienced a beautiful 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.419
 success that is to say that we will make a 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.860
 giant critter 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.360
 we just need a 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.210
 white sheet of paper and pencil 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.800
 at the mines we will draw 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.820
 the insect in question is that I'm going 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.719
 to draw the head the thorax and the abdomen 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.329
 it's this pact and two internal 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.679
 in truth it is that I need that the 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.460
 half of a circle 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:51.399
 so I'm going to line roots in the middle and 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.750
 then my sheet because the drawing this 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.199
 is only a guide for following the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.030
 things 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.440
 I now need a cover 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.910
 plastic you know what kind of 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.269
 look pouches are very easy to 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.179
 find 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.339
 what I did I cut this 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.750
 part the water and this northern part so 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.790
 to have a plastic pouch that 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.640
 opens like this I drop the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.390
 cover in question on the drawing that 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.660
 I did I need gouache and 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.810
 as I need clear colors I 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.720
 am going to use white too I'm going 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.330
 apply color on half of 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.890
 spatters it is not necessary to 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.790
 strive to do little details and 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.230
 all this is going to be done alone a 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.120
 once I finish applying the 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:39.010
 gouache 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:44.590
 I close the cover I will exercise 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:47.170
 a slight pressure to transfer the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.150
 color are both sides what I 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.320
 do is I'm going to open the 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.320
 20 months pocket 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:06.479
 drop a black paper on what I have 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:10.160
 done once done this pulls the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.200
 sheet and that's the job 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:18.260
 we try as seen under a microscope 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.260
 it is the giant creature thank you very much
