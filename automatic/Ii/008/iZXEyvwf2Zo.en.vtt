yeah I seen here found it just like this
and<00:01:09.890> we're<00:01:10.890> gonna<00:01:10.979> use<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> here's<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
and we're gonna use it so here's the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.620 
and we're gonna use it so here's the
string<00:01:16.580> it<00:01:17.580> looks<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.909> somebody<00:01:18.240> might<00:01:18.509> have

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
string it looks like somebody might have

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.179 
string it looks like somebody might have
used<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.990> at<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.229> time<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.710> there's<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> two

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
used it at one time so there's the two

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.179 
used it at one time so there's the two
pieces<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> plastic<00:01:25.470> handle<00:01:25.979> on

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189

these long on this long string so you're

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.190 
these long on this long string so you're
basically<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.670> dip<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.060> in<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.570> they
