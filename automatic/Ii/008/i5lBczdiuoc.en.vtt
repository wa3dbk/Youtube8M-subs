00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
little siege so they're saying it

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.360 
little siege so they're saying it
doesn't<00:03:16.450> even<00:03:16.630> count<00:03:16.959> as<00:03:17.139> one<00:03:17.530> lumen<00:03:17.889> for<00:03:18.310> the

doesn't even count as one lumen for the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.240 
doesn't even count as one lumen for the
red<00:03:18.549> in<00:03:19.120> my<00:03:19.900> previous<00:03:20.260> video<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.650> said<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.130> I

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
red in my previous video I said that I

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.860 
red in my previous video I said that I
wish<00:03:21.459> they<00:03:21.670> would<00:03:21.790> change<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.239> operation<00:03:22.750> of

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
wish they would change the operation of

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.330 
wish they would change the operation of
the<00:03:23.019> power<00:03:23.170> button<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.010> would<00:03:24.160> always

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
the power button so you would always

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.309 
the power button so you would always
know<00:03:24.670> what<00:03:24.880> color<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.510> brightness<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.230> would

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
know what color and brightness you would

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.620 
know what color and brightness you would
get<00:03:26.500> when<00:03:26.650> turning<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.069> on<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.459> not<00:03:28.209> blind

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
get when turning it on and not blind

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.319 
get when turning it on and not blind
yourself<00:03:28.780> in<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.470> middle<00:03:29.709> of<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:29.920> night<00:03:30.329> well

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
yourself in the middle of the night well

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.210 
yourself in the middle of the night well
they<00:03:31.450> did<00:03:31.630> change<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.139> a<00:03:32.319> little<00:03:32.739> so<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.069> don't

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
they did change it a little so I don't

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.440 
they did change it a little so I don't
know<00:03:33.310> if<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.489> was<00:03:33.579> because<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:33.940> mentioned<00:03:34.150> it<00:03:34.389> in

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
know if it was because I mentioned it in

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.090 
know if it was because I mentioned it in
the<00:03:34.540> video<00:03:34.750> or<00:03:34.930> not<00:03:35.079> but<00:03:35.380> I'm<00:03:35.739> really<00:03:35.980> glad

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
the video or not but I'm really glad

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.520 
the video or not but I'm really glad
that<00:03:36.220> they<00:03:36.489> did<00:03:36.730> I<00:03:37.000> don't<00:03:37.870> think<00:03:37.989> it's<00:03:38.079> perfect

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
that they did I don't think it's perfect

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.009 
that they did I don't think it's perfect
but<00:03:38.950> it's<00:03:39.100> definitely<00:03:39.280> much<00:03:39.670> better<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.870> I'll

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
but it's definitely much better so I'll

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.350 
but it's definitely much better so I'll
explain<00:03:41.260> that<00:03:41.590> here<00:03:41.860> with<00:03:42.310> my<00:03:42.459> original<00:03:42.730> seeds

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
explain that here with my original seeds

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.300 
explain that here with my original seeds
you<00:03:43.659> can<00:03:43.810> only<00:03:43.959> turn<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.349> back<00:03:44.470> on<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.129> same

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
you can only turn it back on to the same

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.170 
you can only turn it back on to the same
color<00:03:45.580> it<00:03:45.760> was

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
color it was

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.709 
color it was
off<00:03:46.299> on<00:03:46.659> so<00:03:47.439> if<00:03:48.189> you<00:03:48.370> turn<00:03:48.609> it<00:03:48.730> off<00:03:48.879> while<00:03:49.540> it's

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:49.719 
off on so if you turn it off while it's

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.530

no<00:03:54.310> way<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.519> turn<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.909> directly<00:03:55.209> on<00:03:55.359> to<00:03:55.540> red<00:03:56.250> it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
no way to turn it directly on to red it

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.429 
no way to turn it directly on to red it
goes<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.609> white<00:03:57.819> first<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.629> then<00:03:58.989> switches<00:03:59.409> to

you last turn it off one click will

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.490 
you last turn it off one click will
still<00:04:12.430> turn<00:04:12.819> it<00:04:12.969> to<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.299> last<00:04:13.540> color<00:04:13.959> that<00:04:14.379> it

really<00:04:41.289> nice<00:04:41.560> is<00:04:41.979> that<00:04:42.039> when<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:42.340> turn<00:04:42.580> this

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
really nice is that when you turn this

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.300 
really nice is that when you turn this
Lantern<00:04:43.240> on<00:04:43.419> white<00:04:43.720> it<00:04:44.349> always<00:04:44.530> goes<00:04:44.979> to<00:04:45.220> the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
Lantern on white it always goes to the

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.670 
Lantern on white it always goes to the
lowest<00:04:45.699> white<00:04:45.910> setting<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.570> then<00:04:47.050> you<00:04:47.199> cycle

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
lowest white setting and then you cycle

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.310 
lowest white setting and then you cycle
up<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:48.220> get<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.490> highest<00:04:48.729> setting<00:04:49.320> my

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
up to get to the highest setting my

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.649 
up to get to the highest setting my
original<00:04:50.919> siege<00:04:51.190> always<00:04:51.729> turns<00:04:52.060> on<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.570> the

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
original siege always turns on to the

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.110 
original siege always turns on to the
highest<00:04:53.139> white<00:04:53.560> setting<00:04:53.949> first<00:04:54.220> and<00:04:54.639> then

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
highest white setting first and then

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.050 
highest white setting first and then
from<00:04:55.810> there<00:04:56.080> you<00:04:56.289> have<00:04:56.440> to<00:04:56.500> cycle<00:04:57.039> down<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.909> the

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
from there you have to cycle down to the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.180 
from there you have to cycle down to the
lowest<00:04:58.270> white<00:04:58.690> setting<00:04:59.080> so<00:04:59.590> I<00:04:59.620> think<00:04:59.949> that's<00:05:00.099> a

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
lowest white setting so I think that's a

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.950 
lowest white setting so I think that's a
lot<00:05:00.430> better<00:05:00.639> with<00:05:00.940> this<00:05:01.060> little<00:05:01.330> lantern<00:05:01.750> I

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
lot better with this little lantern I

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.050 
lot better with this little lantern I
did<00:05:02.889> a<00:05:02.919> stream<00:05:03.400> light<00:05:03.550> if<00:05:03.669> they<00:05:03.789> were<00:05:03.849> making

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
did a stream light if they were making

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.850 
did a stream light if they were making
these<00:05:04.330> same<00:05:04.570> upgrades<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.289> the<00:05:05.409> larger

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
these same upgrades to the larger

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.010 
these same upgrades to the larger
lanterns<00:05:06.250> as<00:05:06.430> well<00:05:06.639> and<00:05:06.940> I<00:05:07.210> said<00:05:07.419> no<00:05:07.659> and<00:05:07.930> I

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
lanterns as well and I said no and I

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.500 
lanterns as well and I said no and I
don't<00:05:08.080> intend<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.620> so<00:05:09.010> I<00:05:09.190> think<00:05:10.120> that's<00:05:10.270> kind

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
don't intend to so I think that's kind

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.210 
don't intend to so I think that's kind
of<00:05:10.570> obnoxious<00:05:10.720> because<00:05:11.500> now<00:05:11.800> these<00:05:11.979> two

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
of obnoxious because now these two

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.680 
of obnoxious because now these two
lanterns<00:05:12.430> operate<00:05:13.210> a<00:05:13.419> little<00:05:13.539> differently

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
lanterns operate a little differently

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.029 
lanterns operate a little differently
when<00:05:14.260> you<00:05:14.349> turn<00:05:14.530> them<00:05:14.680> on

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
when you turn them on

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.129 
when you turn them on
but<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:15.970> thought<00:05:16.180> bothers<00:05:16.539> anyone<00:05:16.870> like<00:05:17.020> it

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
but I thought bothers anyone like it

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.230 
but I thought bothers anyone like it
does<00:05:17.289> me<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:17.800> only<00:05:18.190> solution<00:05:18.639> I<00:05:18.789> have<00:05:18.820> found

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
does me the only solution I have found

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.170 
does me the only solution I have found
is<00:05:19.630> to<00:05:19.659> just<00:05:20.080> always<00:05:20.289> turn<00:05:21.280> them<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.759> the<00:05:21.789> red

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
is to just always turn them to the red

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.719 
is to just always turn them to the red
setting<00:05:22.659> before<00:05:23.020> turning<00:05:23.590> them<00:05:23.710> off<00:05:23.889> and<00:05:24.580> then

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
setting before turning them off and then

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.100 
setting before turning them off and then
you'll<00:05:24.849> always<00:05:25.060> know<00:05:25.419> how<00:05:25.599> they<00:05:25.780> were<00:05:25.840> last

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
you'll always know how they were last

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.930 
you'll always know how they were last
used<00:05:26.470> and<00:05:26.949> then<00:05:27.070> you'll<00:05:27.190> never<00:05:27.340> get<00:05:27.639> sudden

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
used and then you'll never get sudden

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.219 
used and then you'll never get sudden
white<00:05:28.090> light<00:05:28.300> when<00:05:28.509> you<00:05:28.630> want<00:05:28.780> them<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:29.050> come

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
white light when you want them to come

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:30.320 
white light when you want them to come
on<00:05:29.349> red

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
on red

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.850 
on red
the<00:05:31.330> only<00:05:31.509> difference<00:05:31.960> I<00:05:32.110> see<00:05:32.139> besides

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
the only difference I see besides

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.450 
the only difference I see besides
brightness<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:33.729> size<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:35.110> this<00:05:35.919> writing<00:05:36.159> on

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
brightness and size and this writing on

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.730 
brightness and size and this writing on
the<00:05:36.639> back<00:05:36.849> is<00:05:37.210> that<00:05:37.750> the<00:05:37.990> new<00:05:38.289> one<00:05:38.470> doesn't

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
the back is that the new one doesn't

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.730 
the back is that the new one doesn't
have<00:05:39.130> a<00:05:39.460> carabiner<00:05:40.180> on<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.570> top<00:05:40.750> but<00:05:41.500> there<00:05:41.620> is

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
have a carabiner on the top but there is

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.409 
have a carabiner on the top but there is
still<00:05:41.889> one<00:05:42.130> on<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.460> bottom<00:05:42.639> and<00:05:43.060> it<00:05:43.240> works

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
still one on the bottom and it works

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.330 
still one on the bottom and it works
just<00:05:43.690> like<00:05:43.810> the<00:05:44.080> original<00:05:44.470> one<00:05:44.500> it's

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
just like the original one it's

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.460 
just like the original one it's
spring-loaded<00:05:45.820> and<00:05:46.479> it<00:05:46.840> flips<00:05:47.110> to<00:05:47.320> either

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
spring-loaded and it flips to either

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.240 
spring-loaded and it flips to either
side<00:05:48.180> you<00:05:49.180> can<00:05:49.479> still<00:05:49.900> twist<00:05:50.349> off<00:05:50.680> the<00:05:50.979> cover

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
side you can still twist off the cover

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.420 
side you can still twist off the cover
and<00:05:51.930> then<00:05:52.930> you<00:05:53.050> can<00:05:53.229> hang<00:05:53.500> it<00:05:53.650> that<00:05:54.099> way<00:05:54.250> if<00:05:54.400> you

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
and then you can hang it that way if you

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.170 
and then you can hang it that way if you
want<00:05:55.680> there's<00:05:56.680> also<00:05:56.860> still<00:05:57.250> a<00:05:57.430> battery<00:05:57.849> level

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
want there's also still a battery level

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.470 
want there's also still a battery level

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
sort of a pain you get less brightness

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.560 
sort of a pain you get less brightness
using<00:06:30.950> three<00:06:31.310> double<00:06:31.610> A<00:06:31.730> batteries<00:06:31.760> versus

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
using three double A batteries versus

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.050 
using three double A batteries versus
three<00:06:32.930> D<00:06:33.200> batteries<00:06:33.440> but<00:06:34.220> double<00:06:34.790> a's<00:06:34.910> are

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
three D batteries but double a's are

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.670 
three D batteries but double a's are
great<00:06:35.240> because<00:06:35.480> there's<00:06:35.870> so<00:06:36.050> much<00:06:36.200> cheaper

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
great because there's so much cheaper

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.280 
great because there's so much cheaper
easier<00:06:37.100> to<00:06:37.340> come<00:06:37.550> by<00:06:37.700> and<00:06:38.210> obviously<00:06:39.140> they're

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
easier to come by and obviously they're

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.560 
easier to come by and obviously they're
a<00:06:39.320> lot<00:06:39.440> lighter<00:06:39.680> in<00:06:39.920> weight<00:06:39.950> so<00:06:40.520> while<00:06:41.300> you<00:06:41.420> do

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
a lot lighter in weight so while you do

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.300 
a lot lighter in weight so while you do
lose<00:06:41.870> quite<00:06:42.590> a<00:06:42.650> bit<00:06:42.830> of<00:06:42.920> brightness

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
lose quite a bit of brightness

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.060 
lose quite a bit of brightness
downsizing<00:06:44.240> to<00:06:44.270> the<00:06:44.450> double-a<00:06:44.810> model<00:06:45.170> it<00:06:45.800> is<00:06:46.040> a

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
downsizing to the double-a model it is a

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.640 
downsizing to the double-a model it is a
lot<00:06:46.670> lighter<00:06:47.030> than<00:06:47.600> the<00:06:47.750> full-size<00:06:48.140> lantern

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
lot lighter than the full-size lantern

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.400 
lot lighter than the full-size lantern
so<00:06:49.010> this<00:06:49.790> one<00:06:50.000> will<00:06:50.210> probably<00:06:50.420> become<00:06:50.990> my

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
so this one will probably become my

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.770 
so this one will probably become my
camping<00:06:52.040> and<00:06:52.370> hunting<00:06:52.670> lantern<00:06:53.300> and<00:06:53.570> then

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
camping and hunting lantern and then

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.630 
camping and hunting lantern and then
I'll<00:06:53.870> just<00:06:54.050> use<00:06:54.140> the<00:06:54.470> larger<00:06:54.830> ones<00:06:55.040> at<00:06:55.220> home<00:06:56.560> on

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:57.640 
I'll just use the larger ones at home on

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.530 
I'll just use the larger ones at home on
my<00:06:58.640> scale<00:06:59.500> the<00:07:00.500> larger<00:07:01.040> seed<00:07:01.400> weighs<00:07:02.120> one

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:02.540 
my scale the larger seed weighs one

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.340 
my scale the larger seed weighs one
pound<00:07:02.620> 14<00:07:03.620> ounces<00:07:03.950> with<00:07:04.550> batteries<00:07:05.000> and<00:07:05.350> the

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.350 
pound 14 ounces with batteries and the

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.400 
pound 14 ounces with batteries and the
tiny<00:07:06.620> double<00:07:07.190> a<00:07:07.340> siege<00:07:07.700> weighs<00:07:08.660> only<00:07:08.990> eight

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
tiny double a siege weighs only eight

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.220 
tiny double a siege weighs only eight
ounces<00:07:10.070> with<00:07:10.310> batteries<00:07:10.760> so<00:07:11.630> that<00:07:11.780> is<00:07:11.930> two

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.230 
ounces with batteries so that is two

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.770 
ounces with batteries so that is two
pounds<00:07:12.500> versus<00:07:13.430> half<00:07:13.730> a<00:07:13.880> pound<00:07:14.090> which<00:07:14.570> is<00:07:14.600> a

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780 
pounds versus half a pound which is a

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:20.350 
pounds versus half a pound which is a
huge<00:07:15.320> weight<00:07:15.620> savings<00:07:18.190> so<00:07:19.190> overall<00:07:19.670> I<00:07:19.970> love

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 
huge weight savings so overall I love

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.840 
huge weight savings so overall I love
how<00:07:20.630> compact<00:07:21.260> and<00:07:21.560> lightweight<00:07:21.890> this<00:07:22.280> is<00:07:22.520> and

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:22.850 
how compact and lightweight this is and

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.310 
how compact and lightweight this is and
that<00:07:22.880> they<00:07:23.090> change<00:07:23.330> the<00:07:23.510> controls<00:07:23.900> a<00:07:24.050> little

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:24.320 
that they change the controls a little

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.890 
that they change the controls a little
bit<00:07:24.470> but<00:07:25.250> I<00:07:25.490> do<00:07:25.760> wish<00:07:26.180> they<00:07:26.480> would<00:07:26.630> have<00:07:26.720> just

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
bit but I do wish they would have just

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.990 
bit but I do wish they would have just
upgraded<00:07:27.530> the<00:07:27.830> controls<00:07:28.220> on<00:07:28.490> the<00:07:28.610> larger

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 
upgraded the controls on the larger

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.940 
upgraded the controls on the larger
lantern<00:07:29.390> and<00:07:29.630> made<00:07:30.110> it<00:07:30.230> run<00:07:30.350> off<00:07:30.470> double<00:07:30.800> A's

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:30.950 
lantern and made it run off double A's

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.830 
lantern and made it run off double A's
so<00:07:31.730> I<00:07:31.760> would<00:07:32.090> still<00:07:32.360> have<00:07:32.540> the<00:07:32.690> higher

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 
so I would still have the higher

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.420 
so I would still have the higher
brightness<00:07:33.350> and<00:07:33.590> longer<00:07:33.980> runtime

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:34.430 
brightness and longer runtime

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.790 
brightness and longer runtime
I<00:07:34.640> also<00:07:35.540> wish<00:07:35.780> there<00:07:35.990> was<00:07:36.140> actually<00:07:36.590> a<00:07:36.620> white

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 
I also wish there was actually a white

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.010 
I also wish there was actually a white
strobe<00:07:37.130> feature<00:07:37.310> especially<00:07:38.060> with<00:07:38.870> the

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.020 
strobe feature especially with the

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.870 
strobe feature especially with the
smaller<00:07:39.140> siege<00:07:39.710> since<00:07:40.190> I<00:07:40.310> don't<00:07:40.460> know<00:07:40.610> that<00:07:40.850> a

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 
smaller siege since I don't know that a

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.460 
smaller siege since I don't know that a
red<00:07:41.210> strobe<00:07:41.630> of<00:07:41.870> this<00:07:42.020> lower<00:07:42.230> brightness

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:42.470 
red strobe of this lower brightness

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.100 
red strobe of this lower brightness
would<00:07:42.890> be<00:07:42.980> that<00:07:43.130> useful<00:07:43.450> but<00:07:44.450> I<00:07:44.510> am<00:07:44.690> definitely

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.110 
would be that useful but I am definitely

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.010 
would be that useful but I am definitely
going<00:07:45.500> to<00:07:45.560> be<00:07:45.710> using<00:07:45.830> this<00:07:46.100> a<00:07:46.160> lot<00:07:46.280> though<00:07:47.020> the

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:48.020 
going to be using this a lot though the

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.110 
going to be using this a lot though the
tiny<00:07:48.320> seed<00:07:48.710> can<00:07:49.070> be<00:07:49.160> found<00:07:49.370> for<00:07:49.670> around<00:07:49.820> thirty

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 
tiny seed can be found for around thirty

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.450 
tiny seed can be found for around thirty
to<00:07:50.420> thirty-five<00:07:50.690> dollars<00:07:51.230> and<00:07:51.500> the<00:07:52.040> larger

to thirty-five dollars and the larger

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.880 
to thirty-five dollars and the larger
siege<00:07:52.790> is<00:07:53.060> slightly<00:07:53.540> more<00:07:53.900> around<00:07:54.320> thirty<00:07:54.500> six

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:54.890 
siege is slightly more around thirty six

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.020 
siege is slightly more around thirty six
to<00:07:55.130> thirty<00:07:55.370> nine<00:07:55.460> dollars
