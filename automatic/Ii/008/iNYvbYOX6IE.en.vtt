mushrooms in the nether which is stupid
and<00:01:46.659> but<00:01:47.659> I<00:01:48.049> built<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.890> building<00:01:49.100> kind<00:01:49.700> of<00:01:49.820> up

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
and but I built the building kind of up

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.600 
and but I built the building kind of up
there<00:01:50.509> in<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:51.380> main<00:01:51.560> mushroom<00:01:51.920> cities<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:52.579> I

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
there in the main mushroom cities so I

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.630 
there in the main mushroom cities so I
just<00:01:52.939> I<00:01:53.469> didn't<00:01:54.469> really<00:01:54.619> feel<00:01:54.950> like<00:01:55.009> just

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
just I didn't really feel like just

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.179 
just I didn't really feel like just
removing<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.719> just<00:01:57.229> after<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.619> built<00:01:57.860> it<00:01:58.039> so<00:01:58.070> I

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
removing it just after I built it so I

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.639 
removing it just after I built it so I
just<00:01:58.219> decided<00:01:58.549> to<00:01:58.939> continue<00:01:59.289> continue<00:02:00.289> with

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649

basically that you know let's say I'm
the<00:02:29.459> blue<00:02:29.640> guy<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.120> normally<00:02:31.019> you<00:02:31.319> would<00:02:31.500> like

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
the blue guy and normally you would like

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.530 
the blue guy and normally you would like
get<00:02:32.189> a<00:02:32.250> minecart<00:02:32.730> air<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.209> then<00:02:33.299> you<00:02:33.420> could

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
get a minecart air and then you could

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.000 
get a minecart air and then you could
ride<00:02:34.340> out<00:02:35.340> here<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:36.269> since<00:02:36.540> I'm<00:02:36.659> a<00:02:36.689> lacy<00:02:37.010> dude

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
ride out here but since I'm a lacy dude

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.759 
ride out here but since I'm a lacy dude
I<00:02:38.280> have<00:02:39.180> not<00:02:39.390> put<00:02:40.049> a<00:02:40.079> minecart<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
I have not put a minecart in the

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.619 
I have not put a minecart in the
dispenser<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.579> that's<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.569> you

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
dispenser so that's that so you

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.750 
dispenser so that's that so you
basically<00:02:42.930> get<00:02:43.319> yourself<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.739> shovel<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.220> then

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
basically get yourself a shovel and then

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.430 
basically get yourself a shovel and then
you<00:02:44.879> go<00:02:45.060> out<00:02:45.090> here<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.750> arena<00:02:46.079> and<00:02:46.349> you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
you go out here to the arena and you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.890 
you go out here to the arena and you
start<00:02:46.709> digging<00:02:47.159> away<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.849> snow<00:02:47.909> and<00:02:48.389> your

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
start digging away the snow and your

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.440 
start digging away the snow and your
goal<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> make<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.519> opponent<00:02:51.090> from<00:02:51.269> the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
goal is to make the opponent from the

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.899 
goal is to make the opponent from the
red<00:02:51.599> team<00:02:51.629> to<00:02:52.349> fall<00:02:52.650> down<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:53.159> the<00:02:53.190> lava<00:02:53.489> and

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
red team to fall down in the lava and

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.119 
red team to fall down in the lava and
burn<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> horrible<00:02:55.500> death<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.989> know

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
burn to a horrible death and you know

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.399 
burn to a horrible death and you know
but<00:02:59.129> there's<00:02:59.579> one<00:02:59.819> rule<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.150> cannot<00:03:00.840> like

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
but there's one rule you cannot like

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.589 
but there's one rule you cannot like
damage<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.220> other<00:03:02.340> play<00:03:02.609> by<00:03:02.790> beating<00:03:03.150> him<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
damage the other play by beating him the

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.509 
damage the other play by beating him the
only<00:03:04.019> way<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.230> can<00:03:04.530> defeat<00:03:04.799> him<00:03:05.159> is<00:03:05.340> by

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
only way you can defeat him is by

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.460 
only way you can defeat him is by
digging<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.239> ground<00:03:06.480> away<00:03:06.920> under<00:03:07.920> his<00:03:08.099> feet

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
digging the ground away under his feet

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.170 
digging the ground away under his feet
so<00:03:10.470> that's<00:03:10.680> pretty<00:03:10.889> much<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.519> new<00:03:11.819> thing<00:03:12.150> that

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
so that's pretty much the new thing that

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.059 
so that's pretty much the new thing that
I<00:03:12.420> added<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:13.109> mushroom<00:03:13.409> town<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.799> I<00:03:13.859> thought

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
I added to mushroom town and I thought

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.740 
I added to mushroom town and I thought
this<00:03:14.250> was<00:03:14.400> kind<00:03:14.549> of<00:03:14.639> cool<00:03:14.849> to<00:03:15.120> use<00:03:15.810> these<00:03:17.750> steel

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
this was kind of cool to use these steel

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.830 
this was kind of cool to use these steel
things<00:03:19.349> through<00:03:20.010> chain<00:03:20.340> chains<00:03:21.120> or<00:03:21.569> whatever

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
things through chain chains or whatever

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.900 
things through chain chains or whatever
it's<00:03:22.049> like<00:03:22.199> it<00:03:22.650> hangs<00:03:22.949> from<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.430> roof<00:03:23.669> I

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
it's like it hangs from the roof I

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.659 
it's like it hangs from the roof I
thought<00:03:24.359> that<00:03:24.510> was<00:03:24.629> pretty<00:03:24.840> neat<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:27.660> yeah<00:03:28.669> and

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
thought that was pretty neat so yeah and

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.030 
thought that was pretty neat so yeah and
yeah<00:03:30.359> but<00:03:30.569> that<00:03:30.720> that's<00:03:31.079> not<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.560> only<00:03:31.590> thing

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
yeah but that that's not the only thing

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.970 
yeah but that that's not the only thing
I<00:03:32.310> want<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.549> talk<00:03:32.730> about<00:03:32.790> in<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.269> video

don't want to stop building because I
love<00:04:53.400> this<00:04:53.550> little<00:04:54.270> project<00:04:54.660> here<00:04:55.699> and<00:04:56.699> I

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
love this little project here and I

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.659 
love this little project here and I
think<00:04:57.060> it's<00:04:57.240> pretty<00:04:57.780> much<00:04:58.250> maybe<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.460> only

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
think it's pretty much maybe the only

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.870 
think it's pretty much maybe the only
unique<00:05:00.330> thing<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:01.020> I'm<00:05:01.139> doing<00:05:01.669> on<00:05:02.669> my

in this shape there's really no
possibility<00:05:33.150> for<00:05:33.180> me<00:05:33.450> to<00:05:33.750> make<00:05:34.530> in<00:05:34.680> different

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
possibility for me to make in different

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.310 
possibility for me to make in different
shapes<00:05:35.580> because<00:05:36.450> if<00:05:36.599> I<00:05:36.720> am<00:05:36.870> gonna<00:05:37.169> make

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
shapes because if I am gonna make

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.870

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
different shapes I have to make houses

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.310 
different shapes I have to make houses
that<00:05:39.360> are<00:05:39.419> much<00:05:39.810> more<00:05:39.990> like<00:05:40.229> this<00:05:40.470> one<00:05:40.770> and<00:05:42.320> you

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
that are much more like this one and you

that are much more like this one and you
know<00:05:43.440> this<00:05:44.130> one<00:05:44.430> is<00:05:44.639> I<00:05:45.330> mean<00:05:46.169> the<00:05:46.349> old<00:05:46.560> ones<00:05:47.010> are

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
know this one is I mean the old ones are

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.909 
know this one is I mean the old ones are
mushroom<00:05:47.639> but<00:05:47.849> it's<00:05:48.690> not<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:48.990> red<00:05:49.380> mushroom

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
mushroom but it's not the red mushroom

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.440 
mushroom but it's not the red mushroom
and<00:05:50.160> it's<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.520> red<00:05:50.729> mushroom<00:05:51.090> that's<00:05:51.300> the

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
and it's the red mushroom that's the

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
and it's the red mushroom that's the
cool<00:05:51.660> mushroom<00:05:52.080> you<00:05:52.200> know<00:05:52.320> so<00:05:53.070> yeah<00:05:53.729> I<00:05:54.599> thought

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
cool mushroom you know so yeah I thought

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.219 
cool mushroom you know so yeah I thought
of<00:05:55.770> making<00:05:56.340> you<00:05:57.030> like<00:05:57.240> it<00:05:57.419> underground

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
of making you like it underground

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.939 
of making you like it underground
mushroom<00:05:58.979> base<00:05:59.849> down<00:06:00.240> there<00:06:00.570> because<00:06:01.169> this

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
mushroom base down there because this

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.159 
mushroom base down there because this
water<00:06:02.340> is<00:06:02.490> real<00:06:02.880> deep<00:06:03.240> I<00:06:03.449> don't<00:06:03.630> know<00:06:03.870> if<00:06:04.050> you

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
water is real deep I don't know if you

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.510 
water is real deep I don't know if you
can<00:06:04.289> see<00:06:04.560> it<00:06:04.590> in<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:04.919> video<00:06:05.039> so<00:06:05.340> I'm<00:06:05.400> just

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
can see it in the video so I'm just

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.129 
can see it in the video so I'm just
gonna<00:06:05.669> head<00:06:05.820> go<00:06:06.090> up<00:06:06.270> again<00:06:06.539> there's<00:06:06.840> no<00:06:06.960> real

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
gonna head go up again there's no real

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.800 
gonna head go up again there's no real
purpose<00:06:07.410> but<00:06:07.710> it's<00:06:08.160> a<00:06:08.250> really<00:06:08.490> deep<00:06:08.760> ocean<00:06:09.660> or

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
purpose but it's a really deep ocean or

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.710 
purpose but it's a really deep ocean or
whatever<00:06:10.110> so<00:06:10.710> I<00:06:10.740> planned<00:06:11.370> maybe<00:06:11.639> making<00:06:11.940> a<00:06:12.150> you

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
whatever so I planned maybe making a you

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.900 
whatever so I planned maybe making a you
know<00:06:12.840> underground<00:06:13.770> mushroom<00:06:14.280> house<00:06:14.699> or

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
know underground mushroom house or

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.029 
know underground mushroom house or
something<00:06:15.090> like<00:06:15.210> that<00:06:15.270> but<00:06:16.229> I<00:06:16.380> tried<00:06:16.860> it<00:06:17.010> and

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
something like that but I tried it and

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:18.890 
something like that but I tried it and
it<00:06:17.280> was<00:06:17.430> almost<00:06:17.729> impossible<00:06:18.120> because<00:06:18.810> you

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
it was almost impossible because you

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.500 
it was almost impossible because you
can't<00:06:19.169> really<00:06:19.440> grow<00:06:19.949> mushrooms<00:06:20.510> underwater

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
can't really grow mushrooms underwater

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.890 
can't really grow mushrooms underwater
so<00:06:22.410> I<00:06:22.440> mean<00:06:22.949> I<00:06:23.130> had<00:06:23.610> to<00:06:23.789> do<00:06:23.940> some<00:06:24.120> try<00:06:24.720> some

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
so I mean I had to do some try some

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.839 
so I mean I had to do some try some
crazy<00:06:25.050> stuff<00:06:25.410> like<00:06:25.530> building<00:06:26.099> a<00:06:26.160> giant<00:06:26.400> dome

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
crazy stuff like building a giant dome

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.379 
crazy stuff like building a giant dome
under<00:06:27.419> water<00:06:27.690> and<00:06:28.280> that<00:06:29.280> dome<00:06:29.610> have<00:06:29.910> to<00:06:30.090> be<00:06:30.210> so

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
under water and that dome have to be so
