00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 big hello to everyone today i would like to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.759
 share with you another idea for 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.529
 french manicure 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.970
 if you're wondering how I did it 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.970
 please stay with me 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.740
 I will show them on one nail on 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:23.550
 the ring finger is first degreased 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:26.310
 our nails further for this manicure 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.060
 I will use this polish from 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.599
 vivienne sabo 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.040
 white on the beveled tassel it you i 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.710
 you already showed in one of her 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.200
 video about the fascist manicure and on this 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.469
 Iâ€™ll just draw my nails 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.719
 my daughter said it was the wings that is, 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.210
 unusual stripe attack minutes 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.430
 in triangles this manicure can 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.680
 make with special stencils 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.320
 either make these stencils with your own hands 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.980
 just cut with scissors and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.230
 scotch tape 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.180
 triangles and stick them to the nails 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.329
 I will not bother just 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.329
 I'll draw by hand such wings 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.690
 at a glance it turns out very interesting 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.700
 such a variation of French manicure 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.250
 non-standard now waiting for this layer 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.960
 dries you can apply a second layer to me 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.280
 it seems 1 layer will be enough so 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.970
 white varnish dried up 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.810
 Now I will use such a favorite 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.380
 lacquer for french manicure direct pro 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.720
 shades 433 french and marie 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.260
 I will put it in one layer more to me 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.260
 would need 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.740
 the varnish has dried up now I will add 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.960
 zest to my french manicure 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.860
 for this I will use these 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.410
 here are rhinestones 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.660
 I bought them all the store for 37 rubles 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.940
 and I will use this one 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:59.120
 round white rhinestone 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:01.330
 if you can call it that and in order to 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:09.910
 I will use its buttons 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:09.910
 clear lacquer here in the middle 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:18.160
 a drop of clear varnish on the hole in 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:22.720
 one stick like this 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.720
 I attach the rhinestone to the marigold 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.440
 and that's what we get 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.680
 Here is such a manicure as a result 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.020
 I think it turned out very gently and 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.700
 unusually hope you enjoyed it
