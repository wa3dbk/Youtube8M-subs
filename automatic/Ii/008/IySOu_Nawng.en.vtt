00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello people outside today as we you 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:12.809
 the packard bell easynote ev lhc 33 14 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:15.770
 50 mm kss is delivered with windows 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.480
 8 that is preinstalled 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.859
 all form disadvantages of minus 8 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.020
 Notebooks should be known 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.100
 the windows 8 version is attached to the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.930
 hardware bound 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.980
 The notebook is form factor 15.6 inches 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.529
 is all right 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.989
 Nice is the notebook an i3 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.629
 processor has the it generation 2 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:44.309
 gigahertz dedicated graphics card goes 26 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.690
 m with RAM 4 gigabytes 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.510
 working memory installed 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.950
 For comparison hard drive everything with more 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.680
 stood the processing is in 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.050
 order 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.210
 getting used to this pattern 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.379
 which one on the display also on the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.300
 lid recognizes what is beautiful there are two 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.030
 outputs for monitor connections 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.010
 both vw and hdmi many only 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.420
 together when only one species, the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.310
 can then easily lead to problems 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.680
 For example, if you have something new, just something 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.970
 then you can have a HDMI output 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.490
 older beamer, for example, not anymore 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.810
 use when presenting 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.580
 or you have to get an adapter 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.150
 which is also annoying what I am 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.470
 always completely works yes still disadvantage 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.530
 I think the piano lacquer look 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.750
 looks very nice but as soon as 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.479
 one then works every fingerprint 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.570
 dust crumbs you can see everything 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.799
 the price said 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.939
 performance ratio is relatively in 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.780
 Order is limited game suitable 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.020
 Battlefield 3 will probably be 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.549
 no longer work but 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.340
 weaker games or dads online titles 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.659
 will still go the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.360
 battery life you can not even four 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.189
 hours when you do office work 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.740
 if you play with it, of course 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.810
 of course that's down 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.790
 yes the hinges are relatively in 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.000
 order so noticed that 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.069
 So someday I would be due 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.780
 positively surprised I had me 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.130
 Expects the packard bell special pressure 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.420
 the processing is okay i deliver 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.340
 can not say now that's at acer 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.099
 or where he makes other brands essential 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.319
 better is how the display reflects 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.790
 strong we measure here we already recognize 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.250
 can if the sunlight 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.769
 you can see a little bit on it 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.269
 quite fast 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.120
 that is very mirrored is the 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.860
 keyboard is all right it is held 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.200
 a keyboard what you expect 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.980
 touchpad on you can not complain synonymous 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.459
 She now sees you look at the plant 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.420
 It is also very clear that even if the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.250
 monitor is that one the 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.709
 Mirror surface recognizes very back 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.690
 which of course reflects in one 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.069
 abroad use if you are with direct 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.860
 sunlight compatible of course very 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.390
 very stupid is the negative recognizes the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.370
 Surface is not for everyone 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.859
 you have to first turn I used 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:07.079
 think she's okay and how did it say so 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.120
 is of course nice in the price you can 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.340
 for the price is relatively okay 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.260
 not piece of good piece of hardware 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.760
 for the price everyone has the long-term 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.730
 How long will that be ? 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.690
 I can not say notebook yet 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.040
 if you want to know more about that 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.269
 describes the comments questions 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.140
 she tries to answer and me 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.340
 would be glad if he was on the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:34.549
 next videos will see that soon 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.549
 Goodbye makes good and jazz
