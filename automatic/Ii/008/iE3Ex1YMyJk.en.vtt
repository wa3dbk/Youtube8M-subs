00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.270

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.779

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.060
 hands and we hold it back with two 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.390
 hairpins one looking to the side and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.309
 the other towards the other we take the lock 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.239
 on one side and we make a braid of three 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.239

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.520
 braid with a small rubber 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.520

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.220
 We take a press roll it up the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.800

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.260

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.260

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.710
 if you see the flat forks that 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.140
 we have placed before we remove them 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.650
 and we join the two braids with another rubber 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.650

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.820

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.100
 the hair and with a lock is country the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.500
 from above with a ponytail 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.770
 we open the hair and pass the pigtail 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.289
 from the bottom 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.299
 We squeeze the hair in two 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.299
 partitions and we make two braids 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.310
 30 all the lock 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:58.410

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.410
 we just need to make another braid 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.650
 We hold the two braids by the 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.640
 from above giving it the shape with 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.640
 bow hairpins 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.360
