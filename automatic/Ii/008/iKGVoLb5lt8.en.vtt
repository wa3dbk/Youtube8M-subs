boost<00:00:25.029> it's<00:00:26.029> one<00:00:26.240> of<00:00:26.269> two<00:00:26.660> booths<00:00:26.990> they<00:00:27.170> make

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
boost it's one of two booths they make

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.179 
boost it's one of two booths they make
this<00:00:27.650> here's<00:00:27.949> the<00:00:28.130> other<00:00:28.250> one<00:00:28.400> now

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
this here's the other one now

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.140 
this here's the other one now
interesting<00:00:31.189> thing<00:00:31.340> about<00:00:31.369> this<00:00:31.699> one<00:00:31.880> here<00:00:32.119> is

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
interesting thing about this one here is

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.650 
interesting thing about this one here is
that<00:00:32.449> it<00:00:33.280> unlike<00:00:34.280> this<00:00:34.460> one<00:00:34.699> which<00:00:35.000> is<00:00:35.030> super

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
that it unlike this one which is super

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:49.840 
that it unlike this one which is super
super<00:00:36.290> clean<00:00:47.949> super<00:00:48.949> clean<00:00:49.339> boost<00:00:49.580> where's

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
super clean super clean boost where's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.399 
super clean super clean boost where's
this<00:00:50.000> one<00:00:50.180> here<00:00:50.330> really<00:00:50.570> thickens<00:00:51.019> things<00:00:51.260> up

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
this one here really thickens things up

00:00:51.409 --> 00:01:22.830 
this one here really thickens things up
a<00:00:51.500> little<00:00:51.619> bit

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.000 

notice<00:01:23.840> I've<00:01:24.020> got<00:01:24.200> it<00:01:25.690> sitting<00:01:26.690> here<00:01:27.020> going

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
notice I've got it sitting here going

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.530 
notice I've got it sitting here going
into<00:01:28.610> my<00:01:29.440> modded<00:01:30.850> tube<00:01:31.850> screamer<00:01:32.030> pedal<00:01:32.420> here

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
into my modded tube screamer pedal here

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
into my modded tube screamer pedal here
and<00:01:33.910> there's<00:01:34.910> a<00:01:34.970> reason<00:01:35.120> for<00:01:35.330> that<00:01:35.480> if<00:01:36.470> you

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
and there's a reason for that if you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:48.610 
and there's a reason for that if you
listen<00:01:36.830> to<00:01:36.890> tube<00:01:37.130> screamer<00:01:37.370> alone<00:01:47.620> adding

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
listen to tube screamer alone adding

00:01:48.620 --> 00:02:14.500 
listen to tube screamer alone adding
this<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.830> it<00:01:49.160> really<00:01:49.430> thickens<00:01:49.820> it<00:01:49.910> up<00:02:13.510> you'll

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
this to it really thickens it up you'll

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.380 
this to it really thickens it up you'll
notice<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.990> up<00:02:15.760> naturally<00:02:16.760> having<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.150> boost

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
notice it up naturally having a boost

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.060 
notice it up naturally having a boost
before<00:02:17.870> an<00:02:18.470> overdrive<00:02:18.950> pedal<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.580> going<00:02:20.450> to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
before an overdrive pedal is going to

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.670 
before an overdrive pedal is going to
kind<00:02:22.070> of<00:02:22.100> drive<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.610> overdrive<00:02:23.030> pedal<00:02:23.480> into

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
kind of drive the overdrive pedal into

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.180 
kind of drive the overdrive pedal into
more<00:02:24.680> saturation<00:02:26.320> so<00:02:27.320> there's<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.739> angle<00:02:28.100> as

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
more saturation so there's that angle as

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.900 
more saturation so there's that angle as
well<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:29.269> i<00:02:29.300> know<00:02:29.570> i'm<00:02:29.810> not<00:02:29.989> only<00:02:30.230> do<00:02:30.380> i<00:02:30.440> get<00:02:30.680> a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
well so i know i'm not only do i get a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.540 
well so i know i'm not only do i get a
boost<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.150> volume<00:02:32.660> but<00:02:33.110> if<00:02:33.530> i'm<00:02:33.769> getting

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
boost and volume but if i'm getting

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.750 
boost and volume but if i'm getting
ready<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.820> do<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:34.970> little<00:02:35.060> solo<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.900> hit<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.530> and

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
ready to do a little solo I hit it and

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.449 
ready to do a little solo I hit it and
the<00:02:37.760> sound<00:02:38.060> gets<00:02:38.360> louder<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:39.040> gets<00:02:40.040> thicker

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
the sound gets louder and gets thicker

00:02:40.459 --> 00:03:09.470 
the sound gets louder and gets thicker
and<00:02:40.610> more<00:02:40.820> over<00:02:41.360> driven

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.800 

so<00:03:10.480> there<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.660> go<00:03:11.940> now<00:03:12.940> what<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.150> do<00:03:13.240> is<00:03:13.420> at<00:03:13.690> the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
so there you go now what I do is at the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.140 
so there you go now what I do is at the
end<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.020> my<00:03:14.140> chain<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.740> have<00:03:15.160> this<00:03:15.430> one<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
end of my chain I have this one the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.570 
end of my chain I have this one the
clean<00:03:16.420> boost<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.740> if<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.040> want<00:03:18.280> even<00:03:18.550> more

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
clean boost so that if I want even more

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:43.550 
clean boost so that if I want even more
volume<00:03:19.150> let's<00:03:19.600> say<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:19.810> have<00:03:19.900> this<00:03:20.200> one<00:03:20.410> engaged

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.459 

all<00:03:44.560> right<00:03:44.730> another<00:03:45.730> thing<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:46.629> it's<00:03:47.319> really

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:47.469 
all right another thing so it's really

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:49.890 
all right another thing so it's really
cool<00:03:47.739> is<00:03:48.099> how<00:03:48.310> it<00:03:48.459> affects<00:03:48.760> other<00:03:48.939> pedals<00:03:49.299> here

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
cool is how it affects other pedals here

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.699 
cool is how it affects other pedals here
I<00:03:49.930> have<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.310> just<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.400> typical<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:52.349> stock<00:03:53.349> phase

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
I have a just a typical of stock phase

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:40.920 
I have a just a typical of stock phase
90<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.930> really<00:04:38.110> makes<00:04:38.380> it<00:04:38.560> juicier<00:04:39.720> also<00:04:40.720> cool

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
90 it really makes it juicier also cool

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.390 
90 it really makes it juicier also cool
if<00:04:41.050> I'm<00:04:41.199> a<00:04:41.229> little<00:04:41.320> bit<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.710> overdrive<00:04:42.099> going

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
if I'm a little bit of overdrive going

00:04:42.400 --> 00:05:38.060 
if I'm a little bit of overdrive going
with<00:04:42.520> that<00:04:42.550> too

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.520 

so<00:05:39.070> you<00:05:39.190> go<00:05:39.280> a<00:05:39.310> little<00:05:39.550> look<00:05:39.790> at<00:05:39.970> a<00:05:40.390> little<00:05:41.380> look

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
so you go a little look at a little look

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.230 
so you go a little look at a little look
at<00:05:41.650> how<00:05:41.740> I<00:05:41.770> have<00:05:42.040> my<00:05:42.250> little<00:05:42.430> pedal<00:05:42.790> board<00:05:43.000> set

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
at how I have my little pedal board set

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.320 
at how I have my little pedal board set
up<00:05:43.360> here<00:05:43.660> with<00:05:44.080> these<00:05:44.830> two<00:05:45.100> cool<00:05:45.670> track<00:05:46.090> house

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
up here with these two cool track house

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.650 
up here with these two cool track house
boosts<00:05:47.460> how<00:05:48.460> they<00:05:48.640> can<00:05:48.790> be<00:05:48.910> used<00:05:49.210> in<00:05:49.630> different

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
boosts how they can be used in different

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.790 
boosts how they can be used in different
settings<00:05:50.230> i<00:05:50.620> hope<00:05:51.220> that<00:05:51.820> i<00:05:52.210> was<00:05:53.140> able<00:05:53.290> to<00:05:53.590> pick

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
settings i hope that i was able to pick

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.860 
settings i hope that i was able to pick
up<00:05:53.980> the<00:05:54.190> sound<00:05:55.110> that<00:05:56.110> I<00:05:56.230> here<00:05:56.620> where<00:05:57.010> I<00:05:57.040> am<00:05:57.370> and
