little bit about the Miller light this
is<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> light<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:09.110> we<00:00:10.110> have<00:00:10.139> developed

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
is a light that we have developed

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.379 
is a light that we have developed
because<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.540> importance<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.410> having<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
of the trees that milkers has developed

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.630 
of the trees that milkers has developed
over<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.720> years<00:00:21.750> have<00:00:22.680> been<00:00:22.890> folding<00:00:23.130> trees

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
over the years have been folding trees

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.939 
over the years have been folding trees
that<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.359> are<00:00:24.480> able<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.900> fold<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.740> leave

that you are able to fold up and leave
the<00:00:26.099> lights<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.689> well<00:00:27.689> if<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.199> light<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.680> not<00:00:28.980> a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the lights on well if the light is not a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.070 
the lights on well if the light is not a
reliable<00:00:29.340> light<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.210> doesn't<00:00:30.420> continue<00:00:30.869> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
reliable light that doesn't continue to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.650 
reliable light that doesn't continue to
work<00:00:31.260> over<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> years<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.669> have<00:00:32.700> lost<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
work over the years you have lost the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.830 
work over the years you have lost the
convenience<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.739> set<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.399> achieve

convenience that you set out to achieve

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.450 
convenience that you set out to achieve
so<00:00:36.840> I'd<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.140> tell<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.469> all<00:00:37.829> about<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
so I'd like to tell you all about the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.069 
so I'd like to tell you all about the
Miller<00:00:38.670> Lite<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.360> why<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.070> wonderful

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
Miller Lite and why it is so wonderful

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.619 
Miller Lite and why it is so wonderful
the<00:00:43.079> first<00:00:43.350> thing<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.550> purpose<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the first thing is the purpose of the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.080 
the first thing is the purpose of the
light<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.260> be<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> showcase<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
light is to be a showcase for or the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.940 
light is to be a showcase for or the
backdrop<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:49.079> collection<00:00:49.860> of

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
backdrop for your collection of

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.600 
backdrop for your collection of
ornaments<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.469> created<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.309> light

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
ornaments and so we have created a light

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.660 
ornaments and so we have created a light
and<00:00:57.090> where<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.930> lamp<00:00:58.170> itself<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and where the lamp itself is the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.729 
and where the lamp itself is the
smallest<00:00:59.969> one<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> market<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.590> an

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
smallest one on the market for an

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.820 
smallest one on the market for an
incandescent<00:01:02.129> light<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.409> so<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.680> little

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
incandescent light and so it's a little

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
incandescent light and so it's a little
bit<00:01:05.040> smaller<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.820> doesn't<00:01:06.119> show<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.869> much

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
bit smaller it doesn't show up as much

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.590 
bit smaller it doesn't show up as much
on<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> tree<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> same<00:01:08.880> time<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.450> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
on the tree but at the same time it is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.660 
on the tree but at the same time it is
the<00:01:09.689> most<00:01:09.900> brilliant<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.189> no<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:11.549> else

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the most brilliant there is no one else

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.330 
the most brilliant there is no one else
on<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> market<00:01:12.210> producing<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.320> 200<00:01:13.830> milli<00:01:14.040> amp

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
on the market producing a 200 milli amp

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.260 
on the market producing a 200 milli amp
Bowl<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.700> combination<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.880> two<00:01:18.060> good

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
Bowl so we have combination of two good

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.490 
Bowl so we have combination of two good
things<00:01:18.630> going<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.920> addition<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:21.500> we

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
things going on in addition to that we

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.700 
things going on in addition to that we
have<00:01:22.740> nine<00:01:22.979> inch<00:01:23.220> spacing<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.240> our<00:01:24.450> lights

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
have nine inch spacing on our lights

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.280 
have nine inch spacing on our lights
instead<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.729> less<00:01:27.299> expensive<00:01:27.450> light<00:01:27.990> sets

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
instead of the less expensive light sets

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.929 
instead of the less expensive light sets
and<00:01:28.530> some<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> which<00:01:28.979> are<00:01:29.159> only<00:01:29.400> two<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and some of which are only two and a

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.780 
and some of which are only two and a
half<00:01:30.119> inch<00:01:30.329> spacing<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.979> enables<00:01:32.549> you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
half inch spacing now this enables you

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.880 
half inch spacing now this enables you
to<00:01:32.820> go<00:01:33.299> from<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.840> branch<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.259> another<00:01:34.439> one

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
to go from one branch to another one

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
to go from one branch to another one
your<00:01:35.040> lighting<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.400> tree<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.049> can

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
your lighting your tree so that you can

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.690 
your lighting your tree so that you can
get<00:01:37.409> further<00:01:37.770> out<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:39.000> branch<00:01:39.210> tip<00:01:39.720> so

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
get further out on the branch tip so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.940 
get further out on the branch tip so
that<00:01:41.700> will<00:01:42.000> make<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.780> illumination<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
that will make the illumination of the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.719 
that will make the illumination of the
tree<00:01:44.689> appear<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:46.140> more<00:01:46.890> impressive<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
tree appear to be more impressive it

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.440 
tree appear to be more impressive it
does<00:01:48.540> not<00:01:48.659> stay<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> interior<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.329> the

does not stay in to the interior of the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.450 
does not stay in to the interior of the
tree<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.079> works<00:01:52.259> its<00:01:52.500> way<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.280> the

tree but it works its way out to the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.030 
tree but it works its way out to the
outside<00:01:53.610> edge<00:01:54.090> giving<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.040> appearance

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
outside edge giving you the appearance

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.300 
outside edge giving you the appearance
of<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:57.030> larger<00:01:57.600> tree<00:01:59.930> finally<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.619> best<00:02:02.040> thing

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
of a larger tree finally the best thing

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.910 
of a larger tree finally the best thing
about<00:02:02.399> our<00:02:02.729> life<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.780> light<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
about our life the light is that it is a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.540 
about our life the light is that it is a
long<00:02:05.310> life<00:02:05.759> bulb<00:02:06.649> there's<00:02:07.649> no<00:02:08.129> point<00:02:08.429> in

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
long life bulb there's no point in

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.260 
long life bulb there's no point in
having

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
having

that our light tests out actually much
longer<00:02:27.960> than<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:29.040> what<00:02:29.490> we<00:02:29.640> tell<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.060> is
