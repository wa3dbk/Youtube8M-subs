00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.580
 not always there or they did 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.000
 just through it but ultimately god me 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.980

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.180

 organize this tournament that is then 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.860
 first something because to me how much effort 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.340
 they put it in is real 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.770
 true 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.720
 incredibly 21 days every day 3 a 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.400
 Stream for 4 hours 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.700
 everything also put all that into worry 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.950
 the whole string goes well together 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.510
 and that kind of thing i know how 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.670
 streaming and I know how 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.860
 that she can be back and if you 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.390
 have problems with it and who wants to be 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.180
 all that kind of thing comes a lot 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.000
 view it is not just something you 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.000
 organizes and ready costs enormously 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.409

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.329
 just huge thanks for it 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.210
 organize of course because yes then it will 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:48.079
 the we of course that alarm once again 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:52.909

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.290
 people were playing against it 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.080
 we didn't have it here 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.570
 extremely difficult afterwards, the second 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.300
 round charming we close to tfo 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.280
 lecter bertram out after it's dead momentarily

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.870
 together I managed to get through well 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.940
 and from 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.260
 yes from then on we had something 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.670
 fairly difficult opponents so yes 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.360

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.310
 offer you a body say no string 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.940
 their 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.290
 they were us with us from the start 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.110
 that we should play against them 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.959
 in need in the semi-final 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.459
 whether in the final or in any time we 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.280
 We knew how we play against a 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.050
 you have an enormous amount of hardness against her 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.989
 545 pussy has screened a lot and it is 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.670
 have always been extremely healthy once 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.299
 they were always for yourself heard 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:08.390
 whether the pastors beat us and us 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.700
 also the hardpoint of their 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.769
 so that always very big together and 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.120
 then see it and clear 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.220
 winner in safari was very close 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.380
 each other and also really shadowed them 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.200
 that we would lose our team to them 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.480
 is good and that is not just mean 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.040
 t i love when people say when you 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.269
 are good 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.440
 that people immediately find that you already 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.560
 are used to 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.150
 our team is good we have proven 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.830
 don't just work exciting rapping 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.830
 we are just a good team 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.970
 and we just huge paint just guessing 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.569
 There was a huge amount of drama in the final 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.760
 come a long way 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.909
 and we came to the final table qg and 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.590
 from then on I didn't like it anymore 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.579
 what happened then i want an honest one 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.739

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.760
 i know mike casio g-shock cujus rei 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.950

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.439

 each other on bill with each other so played together 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.540
 they know each other well and me 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.519
 of course also grant him if they win 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.810
 that's not it i have for the 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.690

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.949
 our it would just be a nice honest 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.970
 Law should be the best about him 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.650
 but inside 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.240
 that is how simple it is with every game 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.880
 to go and so it went against 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.930
 neighborhood you did it called why 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.930
 tech world is playing 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.430

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.340
 about him conservatories yesterday became a huge one 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.770
 moment of further explanation 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:47.550
 We first started at Murthy's 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.659
 third whole whole whole in each with 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.080
 had no problems with it 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:54.389
 except the final then werder 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.009
 I bright internet twice lord 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.990
 market areas lsst and i better on that 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.449
 boxes is so we are not going to tell that 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.820
 I did something else because I got used to it 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.889
 seriously the beatles 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.990
 i saw him marie so that does 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.580
 not matter 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.259
 we just disconnected from the 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.710
 game yes 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:15.599
 just make sure that we are hot 5 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.550
 against them, fire played against them like up 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:19.320
 a moment three mountains 6 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.880
 yes and when we get it it 's called again 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.210
 and yet again the window 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.580
 be laid then you must understand that 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.400
 we no longer feel like it 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.780
 every time it is done and me 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.909
 do not come, the also makes 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.280
 not at all whether it comes from qg 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:39.300
 your accuse does not but I will 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.190
 huge shit and our motivations 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.300
 we absolutely love to play those games 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.840
 in the end we are also more 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.970
 known it has a very melody 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.430
 vision um between the two 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.350
 winners to the only thing i have one 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.180
 sacrifice of will do is win win 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.460
 win win win I've got myself all 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.350
 likes girls so you can not win 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.720
 received from and that mainly comes from humans 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.669
 got a self and then i didn't 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.190
 towards me i know mike doesn't 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.639
 want to do where his team does it and 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.010
 I'm not happy about that 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.030
 so mike mike but that teammate of 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.610
 their 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.010
 still not sure for sure 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.220
 big mouth that they have incredible 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.930
 but with that we finished the final 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.770
 so we won't go again or line up 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.540
 stream 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.250
 we will catch up again I know 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.050
 not exactly when 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.900
 neither churn nor seen that rules fish 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.960
 all and then is uploaded and then is 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.120
 it may just be the best and win again 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.190
 just as we were offering you we are 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.590
 were enormously motivated when it came to van 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.050
 beauty to win we had to win it 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.979
 and we want to win it q no was something 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.510
 different 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.010
 good friends of each other and we go it 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.530
 already one two each other so we were not in it 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:51.580
 then just to tell played something 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:55.240
 relaxed there says but now you make it so 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.850
 it has just stopped being friends 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.860
 is it just pure I want to win I want 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:03.729

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.570
 ok well then they have proven them 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:16.419
 be better to stan is a province 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.660
