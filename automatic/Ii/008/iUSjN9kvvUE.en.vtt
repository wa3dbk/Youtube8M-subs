is<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.310> most<00:01:17.490> believable<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
is going to be most believable the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.510 
is going to be most believable the
broken<00:01:18.840> monitor<00:01:19.020> well<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.280> once

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
broken monitor well as you can see once

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.640 
broken monitor well as you can see once
you<00:01:20.640> click<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.780> looks<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.470> your

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
you click it it looks like that your

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.609 
you click it it looks like that your
computer<00:01:23.100> screen<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.670> actually<00:01:24.119> broken<00:01:24.630> now

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
computer screen is actually broken now

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.130 
computer screen is actually broken now
this<00:01:26.460> does<00:01:26.729> look<00:01:26.759> believable<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
this does look believable but the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.130 
this does look believable but the
problem<00:01:28.619> with<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.820> your<00:01:30.720> boss<00:01:30.900> may

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
problem with it is that your boss may

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.719 
problem with it is that your boss may
have<00:01:31.290> an<00:01:31.380> extra<00:01:31.470> monitor<00:01:31.860> say<00:01:32.310> hey<00:01:32.460> let's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
have an extra monitor say hey let's

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.520 
have an extra monitor say hey let's
replace<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.290> go<00:01:34.409> back

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
replace it and then you have to go back

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.950 
replace it and then you have to go back
to<00:01:34.710> work<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> best<00:01:35.520> route<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.329> use<00:01:36.630> the
