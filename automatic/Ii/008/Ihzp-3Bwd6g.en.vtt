here's the question why does someone

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.570 
here's the question why does someone
remake<00:01:14.660> a<00:01:14.690> movie<00:01:14.860> because<00:01:15.860> they<00:01:16.160> want<00:01:16.369> to<00:01:16.430> put

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
remake a movie because they want to put

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.639 
remake a movie because they want to put
their<00:01:16.759> own<00:01:16.850> spin<00:01:17.210> on<00:01:17.270> it<00:01:17.390> because<00:01:18.170> they<00:01:18.410> want

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
their own spin on it because they want

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.580 
their own spin on it because they want
to<00:01:18.710> change<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:19.310> or<00:01:19.490> because<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.240> catching<00:01:20.869> well

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
to change it or because of catching well

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.469 
to change it or because of catching well
probably<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:22.369> latter<00:01:22.580> reason<00:01:23.119> but<00:01:23.330> you'll

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
probably the latter reason but you'll

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.630 
probably the latter reason but you'll
often<00:01:23.630> hear<00:01:23.960> that<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.200> filmmaker<00:01:24.800> wanted<00:01:25.520> to

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640

remake<00:01:26.000> something<00:01:26.509> because<00:01:26.810> they<00:01:26.990> grew<00:01:27.290> up

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
remake something because they grew up

remake something because they grew up
loving<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.130> original<00:01:28.670> well<00:01:29.479> if<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.810> love<00:01:30.080> the

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
loving the original well if you love the

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.350

original<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:30.950> much<00:01:31.159> then<00:01:31.430> why<00:01:31.670> change<00:01:32.090> it

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
original so much then why change it

original so much then why change it
sometimes<00:01:33.290> remix<00:01:33.770> will<00:01:33.979> be<00:01:34.100> better<00:01:34.369> than<00:01:34.640> the

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
sometimes remix will be better than the

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
much became an industry joke was it 100%

awful<00:04:20.090> no<00:04:20.570> more<00:04:20.930> like<00:04:21.079> 60<00:04:21.680> or<00:04:21.709> 70<00:04:22.280> but<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:22.820> most

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
awful no more like 60 or 70 but the most

awful no more like 60 or 70 but the most
frustrating<00:04:23.750> part<00:04:23.900> about<00:04:24.080> playing<00:04:24.229> it<00:04:24.680> was

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
frustrating part about playing it was

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.090 
frustrating part about playing it was
that<00:04:25.370> there<00:04:25.700> was<00:04:25.789> a<00:04:25.820> lot<00:04:26.150> of<00:04:26.180> potential<00:04:26.780> there

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
that there was a lot of potential there

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.190 
that there was a lot of potential there
the<00:04:28.100> gameplay<00:04:28.370> itself<00:04:28.760> was<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.360> mess<00:04:29.750> but<00:04:30.020> the

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
the gameplay itself was a mess but the

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.290 
the gameplay itself was a mess but the
level<00:04:30.440> design<00:04:30.680> was<00:04:31.100> actually<00:04:31.130> really<00:04:31.940> good

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
level design was actually really good

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.150 
level design was actually really good
there<00:04:32.810> were<00:04:32.930> visual<00:04:33.380> glitches<00:04:33.530> but<00:04:34.039> the

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
there were visual glitches but the

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.190 
there were visual glitches but the
graphics<00:04:34.370> looked<00:04:34.850> nice<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.539> voice<00:04:35.750> acting

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
graphics looked nice the voice acting

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.170 
graphics looked nice the voice acting
was<00:04:36.350> all<00:04:36.530> over<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.860> map<00:04:37.039> but<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.640> music<00:04:37.820> is

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
was all over the map but the music is

was all over the map but the music is
some<00:04:38.390> of<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.660> best<00:04:38.690> in<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.140> series<00:04:39.380> this<00:04:40.099> is<00:04:40.520> a

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
some of the best in the series this is a

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.650 
some of the best in the series this is a
game

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.890 
game
potential<00:04:42.500> so<00:04:42.920> why<00:04:43.760> hasn't<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.240> been<00:04:44.300> remade

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
potential so why hasn't this been remade

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.710 
potential so why hasn't this been remade
I'm<00:04:45.170> not<00:04:45.650> saying<00:04:45.980> that<00:04:46.070> it<00:04:46.340> will<00:04:46.580> or<00:04:46.880> heck<00:04:47.270> that

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
I'm not saying that it will or heck that

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.840 
I'm not saying that it will or heck that
it<00:04:47.840> even<00:04:47.990> should<00:04:48.650> be<00:04:48.980> remade<00:04:49.520> I<00:04:51.460> mean<00:04:52.460> Sonic

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
it even should be remade I mean Sonic

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.150 
it even should be remade I mean Sonic
Team<00:04:53.060> seem<00:04:53.420> to<00:04:53.570> have<00:04:53.690> nailed<00:04:53.960> 3d<00:04:54.530> gameplay<00:04:54.770> now

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
Team seem to have nailed 3d gameplay now

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.250 
Team seem to have nailed 3d gameplay now
so<00:04:55.640> maybe<00:04:55.850> it's<00:04:56.120> best<00:04:56.390> that<00:04:56.540> they<00:04:56.750> look<00:04:56.930> ahead

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
so maybe it's best that they look ahead

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.770 
so maybe it's best that they look ahead
but<00:04:57.650> that<00:04:58.040> was<00:04:58.250> just<00:04:58.280> one<00:04:58.880> example<00:04:59.060> out<00:04:59.750> of

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
but that was just one example out of

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.320 
but that was just one example out of
many<00:05:00.290> others<00:05:00.710> a<00:05:00.890> game<00:05:01.460> that<00:05:01.700> never<00:05:02.000> got<00:05:02.270> a

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
many others a game that never got a

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.870 
many others a game that never got a
proper<00:05:02.630> chance<00:05:03.050> being<00:05:03.650> remade<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.580> give<00:05:04.760> it

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
proper chance being remade to give it

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.360 
proper chance being remade to give it
the<00:05:05.000> chance<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.480> deserves<00:05:05.870> so<00:05:06.620> what's<00:05:07.190> the

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
the chance it deserves so what's the

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.490 
the chance it deserves so what's the
conclusion<00:05:07.580> or<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.420> point<00:05:08.720> to<00:05:08.990> this<00:05:09.140> video

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
conclusion or the point to this video

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.370 
conclusion or the point to this video
well<00:05:10.160> I'm<00:05:10.640> not<00:05:10.850> really<00:05:10.910> sure<00:05:11.210> I<00:05:11.690> guess<00:05:12.170> if

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
well I'm not really sure I guess if

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.470 
well I'm not really sure I guess if
you're<00:05:12.530> going<00:05:12.740> to<00:05:12.860> remake<00:05:13.310> a<00:05:13.370> game<00:05:13.730> then<00:05:14.060> do<00:05:14.360> it

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
you're going to remake a game then do it

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.780 
you're going to remake a game then do it
for<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.750> right<00:05:14.960> reasons<00:05:15.560> it<00:05:16.100> just<00:05:16.370> seems<00:05:16.580> that

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
for the right reasons it just seems that

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.460 
for the right reasons it just seems that
most<00:05:16.940> remakes<00:05:17.480> are<00:05:17.630> games<00:05:17.870> that<00:05:18.020> were<00:05:18.260> already

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
most remakes are games that were already

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.590 
most remakes are games that were already
considered<00:05:19.130> great<00:05:19.370> at<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.640> time<00:05:19.670> and<00:05:20.150> are

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
considered great at the time and are

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.990 
considered great at the time and are
still<00:05:20.900> great<00:05:21.140> now<00:05:21.380> those<00:05:22.070> games<00:05:22.430> aren't<00:05:22.700> going

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
still great now those games aren't going

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.970 
still great now those games aren't going
anywhere<00:05:23.210> they're<00:05:23.780> readily<00:05:24.170> available<00:05:24.500> and

anywhere they're readily available and

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.470 
anywhere they're readily available and

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
if you've already bought them then

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.060 
if you've already bought them then
they'll<00:05:26.840> be<00:05:26.990> on<00:05:27.020> your<00:05:27.290> shelf<00:05:27.620> if<00:05:27.800> you<00:05:27.920> should

they'll be on your shelf if you should
