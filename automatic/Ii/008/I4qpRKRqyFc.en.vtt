00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.619 

I'm<00:00:02.040> gonna<00:00:02.159> do<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.310> video<00:00:02.520> here<00:00:02.639> of<00:00:02.939> uh<00:00:03.149> some

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
I'm gonna do a video here of uh some

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.579 
I'm gonna do a video here of uh some
Travis<00:00:04.470> picking<00:00:04.799> that<00:00:05.009> I<00:00:05.100> found<00:00:05.370> online<00:00:05.580> and

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:06.589 
Travis picking that I found online and

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:39.799 
Travis picking that I found online and
here's<00:00:07.589> how<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.130> goes

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.090 

and<00:00:40.809> what<00:00:40.960> I'm<00:00:41.050> doing<00:00:41.320> there<00:00:41.559> I'm<00:00:41.680> just<00:00:41.860> doing

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
and what I'm doing there I'm just doing

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.970 
and what I'm doing there I'm just doing
a<00:00:42.129> one-finger<00:00:42.579> G<00:00:43.030> here<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:43.620> I'm<00:00:44.620> hitting<00:00:44.770> the

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
a one-finger G here and I'm hitting the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.240 
a one-finger G here and I'm hitting the
six<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.460> second<00:00:45.850> string<00:00:46.090> together<00:00:47.250> fourth

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
six and second string together fourth

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.729 
six and second string together fourth
and<00:00:48.489> third<00:00:49.620> six<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:51.070> second<00:00:51.610> fourth<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.620> it's

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
and third six and second fourth so it's

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.090 
and third six and second fourth so it's
outside<00:00:54.120> strings<00:00:55.120> so<00:00:55.420> outside<00:00:56.100> inside

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
outside strings so outside inside

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.220 
outside strings so outside inside
outside<00:00:58.110> inside

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
outside inside

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.010 
outside inside
so<00:01:00.740> that's<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.040> pattern<00:01:01.250> then<00:01:02.210> I<00:01:02.240> do<00:01:02.360> a<00:01:02.450> CG

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
so that's the pattern then I do a CG

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.960 
so that's the pattern then I do a CG
just<00:01:03.440> drop<00:01:03.680> like<00:01:03.980> you're<00:01:04.280> going<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.520> see<00:01:04.699> here

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
just drop like you're going to see here

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.260 
just drop like you're going to see here
but<00:01:05.180> keep<00:01:05.330> your<00:01:05.449> third<00:01:05.660> finger<00:01:05.900> where<00:01:06.590> it's<00:01:06.680> at

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
but keep your third finger where it's at

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.310 
but keep your third finger where it's at
do<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.420> same<00:01:08.780> thing<00:01:09.880> move<00:01:10.900> these<00:01:11.900> two<00:01:12.080> fingers

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
do the same thing move these two fingers

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.490 
do the same thing move these two fingers
up<00:01:12.800> a<00:01:13.010> whole-step<00:01:13.630> grab<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.660> six<00:01:15.020> string<00:01:15.230> with

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
up a whole-step grab a six string with

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:27.900 
up a whole-step grab a six string with
your<00:01:15.530> thumb<00:01:18.820> back<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.030> CG

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.540 

then<00:01:28.910> I<00:01:28.940> take<00:01:29.180> my<00:01:29.240> third<00:01:29.510> finger<00:01:29.870> and<00:01:30.490> go<00:01:31.490> to

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
then I take my third finger and go to

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.840 
then I take my third finger and go to
the<00:01:31.700> fifth<00:01:31.940> string<00:01:32.030> just<00:01:32.390> do<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.600> C<00:01:32.900> chord<00:01:33.260> and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
the fifth string just do a C chord and

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.370 
the fifth string just do a C chord and
then<00:01:34.850> now<00:01:35.060> I'm<00:01:35.240> gonna<00:01:35.420> hit<00:01:35.600> this<00:01:35.780> fifth<00:01:36.230> and

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
then now I'm gonna hit this fifth and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.030 
then now I'm gonna hit this fifth and
second<00:01:37.060> together<00:01:38.440> for<00:01:39.440> third<00:01:40.070> fifth<00:01:40.700> second

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
second together for third fifth second

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.760 
second together for third fifth second
fourth

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.410 

with<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.190> pinky<00:01:46.520> down<00:01:46.670> second<00:01:47.180> string<00:01:47.390> third

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
with the pinky down second string third

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:56.300 
with the pinky down second string third
fret<00:01:49.479> it's<00:01:50.479> a<00:01:50.600> cn9<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:53.140> minor

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:06.440 

first<00:01:57.310> mayor<00:01:57.460> comes<00:01:57.700> off<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:58.120> sus<00:01:58.630> two

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.630 

back<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.350> G

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.250 

then<00:02:14.090> your<00:02:14.240> third<00:02:14.450> finger<00:02:14.600> goes<00:02:14.750> up<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.170> the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
then your third finger goes up to the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.450 
then your third finger goes up to the
fifth<00:02:15.470> fret<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:15.860> do<00:02:15.980> like<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.130> CG<00:02:16.730> up<00:02:16.970> here

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
fifth fret and you do like a CG up here

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.550 
fifth fret and you do like a CG up here
and<00:02:19.460> then<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.730> time<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:19.970> do<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.570> six<00:02:21.350> and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
and then this time I do the six and

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:37.360 
and then this time I do the six and
second<00:02:21.860> together<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:25.370> go<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.830> CG<00:02:37.280> you

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
second together so just go on the CG you

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.400 
second together so just go on the CG you
do<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.640> same<00:02:37.850> thing

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.040 

oh<00:02:42.550> gee

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050
