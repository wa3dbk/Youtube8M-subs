00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.710 
here we're looking to create as many of
these<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.829> can<00:01:53.100> already<00:01:53.520> missed<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.329> up

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
these as we can already missed one up

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
these as we can already missed one up
there

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.200 

three<00:01:57.990> or<00:01:58.229> more<00:01:58.469> basically<00:01:59.070> two<00:01:59.490> will<00:01:59.939> get

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
three or more basically two will get

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.060 
three or more basically two will get
them<00:02:00.359> to<00:02:00.479> disappear<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:01.350> they<00:02:01.500> won't<00:02:01.740> really

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
them to disappear but they won't really

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.399 
them to disappear but they won't really
get<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.460> anywhere<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.359> the<00:02:03.390> longer<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.140> chain

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
get you anywhere so the longer the chain

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.359 
get you anywhere so the longer the chain
the<00:02:05.009> more<00:02:06.380> points<00:02:07.380> you're<00:02:07.619> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.950> get<00:02:08.129> and

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
the more points you're going to get and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.490 
the more points you're going to get and
the<00:02:08.459> faster<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.390> will<00:02:09.450> take<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.019> on<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the faster it will take you on to the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.119 
the faster it will take you on to the
next<00:02:10.709> level<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:12.209> obviously<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:13.739> object

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
next level and so obviously the object

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.949 
next level and so obviously the object
of<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> game<00:02:14.340> acquires<00:02:15.090> many<00:02:15.450> points<00:02:15.840> as<00:02:15.900> you

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
of the game acquires many points as you

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.309 
of the game acquires many points as you
can<00:02:16.260> move<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.430> next<00:02:17.459> levels<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.390> get

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
can move on to the next levels and get

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.369 
can move on to the next levels and get
as<00:02:19.470> far<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:19.890> can<00:02:20.160> before<00:02:20.989> there<00:02:21.989> are<00:02:22.170> no

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
as far as you can before there are no

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.350 
as far as you can before there are no
moves<00:02:22.650> left<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.280> game<00:02:23.489> will<00:02:23.700> tell<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.180> in

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
moves left and the game will tell you in

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.119 
moves left and the game will tell you in
this<00:02:24.540> mode<00:02:24.930> will<00:02:24.959> tell<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.650> when<00:02:25.830> there<00:02:26.010> are

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
this mode will tell you when there are

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.309 
this mode will tell you when there are
no<00:02:26.250> moods<00:02:26.519> are<00:02:26.849> moves<00:02:27.150> left<00:02:27.420> hitting<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
no moods are moves left hitting the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.920 
no moods are moves left hitting the
multiplier<00:02:28.950> will<00:02:29.310> multiply<00:02:30.209> your<00:02:30.360> score<00:02:30.750> as

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
multiplier will multiply your score as

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.539 
multiplier will multiply your score as
well<00:02:31.110> as<00:02:31.290> get<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.769> other<00:02:31.920> levels<00:02:32.340> faster

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
well as get you to other levels faster

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.380 
well as get you to other levels faster
so<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:33.810> when<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.290> have<00:02:34.440> those<00:02:34.590> multipliers

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
so if when you have those multipliers

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.199 
so if when you have those multipliers
it's<00:02:36.390> good<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.780> use<00:02:37.019> them<00:02:37.760> obviously<00:02:38.760> this<00:02:38.910> to

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
it's good to use them obviously this to

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.000 
it's good to use them obviously this to
multiplier<00:02:39.780> wouldn't<00:02:40.170> be<00:02:40.260> as<00:02:40.410> good<00:02:40.560> as<00:02:40.620> using

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
multiplier wouldn't be as good as using

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.759 
multiplier wouldn't be as good as using
that<00:02:41.130> for<00:02:41.400> multiplier<00:02:41.940> but<00:02:42.750> once<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.410> can<00:02:43.620> no

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
that for multiplier but once I can no

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.619 
that for multiplier but once I can no
longer<00:02:43.980> use<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.280> four<00:02:44.670> multiplier<00:02:45.209> I<00:02:45.239> could

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
longer use the four multiplier I could

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.630 
longer use the four multiplier I could
go<00:02:45.750> ahead<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:45.959> use<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.379> two<00:02:46.560> probably<00:02:47.489> should

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
go ahead and use the two probably should

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.030 
go ahead and use the two probably should
use<00:02:47.879> them<00:02:48.150> in<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.510> reverse<00:02:48.810> order<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.860> that's

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
use them in the reverse order but that's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.780 
use them in the reverse order but that's
alright<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.879> now<00:02:51.060> we're<00:02:51.209> using<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.660> two<00:02:51.840> and

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
alright so now we're using the two and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.180 
alright so now we're using the two and
this<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.970> going<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.299> help<00:02:54.420> us<00:02:54.599> get<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.860> other

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
this is going to help us get on to other

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.289 
this is going to help us get on to other
levels<00:02:56.610> faster<00:02:56.879> and<00:02:57.420> gain<00:02:57.720> more<00:02:58.019> points<00:02:59.299> so

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
levels faster and gain more points so

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.940 
levels faster and gain more points so
that's<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.750> object<00:03:01.079> of<00:03:01.139> the<00:03:01.230> game<00:03:01.290> there<00:03:01.829> are

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
that's the object of the game there are

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.430 
that's the object of the game there are
other<00:03:02.130> modifiers<00:03:02.880> as<00:03:03.209> well<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:03.780> if<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.170> find

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
other modifiers as well like if you find

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.610 
other modifiers as well like if you find
yourself<00:03:04.620> not<00:03:05.160> being<00:03:05.549> able<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.970> move<00:03:06.810> or<00:03:07.230> you

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
yourself not being able to move or you

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.500 
yourself not being able to move or you
think<00:03:07.859> that<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.190> can't<00:03:08.459> move<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.910> can<00:03:09.060> hit<00:03:09.269> a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
think that you can't move you can hit a

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.280 
think that you can't move you can hit a
bomb<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.440> will<00:03:10.850> drop<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.880> bomb<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.450> move<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.079> on

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
bomb it will drop a bomb and move you on

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.150 
bomb it will drop a bomb and move you on
to<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:15.450> know<00:03:15.569> some<00:03:15.840> more<00:03:16.019> colors<00:03:16.530> here<00:03:16.769> so<00:03:16.950> see

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
to you know some more colors here so see

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.339 
to you know some more colors here so see
we<00:03:17.280> have<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.609> ton<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.849> orange<00:03:18.329> now<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.840> can

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
we have like a ton of orange now I can

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.940 
we have like a ton of orange now I can
go<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.829> get<00:03:20.400> all<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:20.849> those<00:03:21.000> out<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.480> way<00:03:21.510> I

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
go and get all of those out of the way I

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.009 
go and get all of those out of the way I
could<00:03:22.950> hit<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.220> floor<00:03:23.459> multiplier<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.239> go<00:03:24.810> in

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
could hit the floor multiplier and go in

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.059 
could hit the floor multiplier and go in
and<00:03:25.380> then<00:03:25.500> grab<00:03:25.799> all<00:03:26.010> these<00:03:26.250> greens<00:03:26.669> and<00:03:28.069> so

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
and then grab all these greens and so

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.339 
and then grab all these greens and so
you<00:03:29.130> see<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.790> idea<00:03:29.940> here<00:03:30.419> there<00:03:31.139> are<00:03:31.230> some

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
you see the idea here there are some

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.900 
you see the idea here there are some
other<00:03:31.530> things<00:03:31.590> as<00:03:31.919> well<00:03:31.950> see<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.549> one<00:03:32.700> turned

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
other things as well see that one turned

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.789 
other things as well see that one turned
a<00:03:33.090> whole<00:03:33.239> bunch<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.569> things<00:03:33.630> into<00:03:34.109> orange<00:03:34.500> so

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
a whole bunch of things into orange so

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.250 
a whole bunch of things into orange so
now<00:03:35.340> I've<00:03:35.549> got<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:35.940> for<00:03:36.209> multiplier<00:03:36.780> going

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
now I've got that for multiplier going

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.430 
now I've got that for multiplier going
and<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.980> could<00:03:38.160> go<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:38.609> just<00:03:38.849> really<00:03:39.269> grab<00:03:40.200> a

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
and I could go and just really grab a

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.890 
and I could go and just really grab a
lot<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.859> points<00:03:41.310> which<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.180> think<00:03:42.359> I<00:03:42.450> ran<00:03:42.690> out<00:03:42.870> of

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
lot of points which I think I ran out of

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.629 
lot of points which I think I ran out of
that<00:03:43.109> multiplier<00:03:43.620> before<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.010> was<00:03:44.190> able<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.489> get
