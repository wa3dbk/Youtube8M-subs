00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.100
 scripts today we're going to learn how to do the 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.100
 toymaker I'll explain 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.190
 for this we need an old disk that 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.570
 no longer use a bottle of these 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.430
 the mouthpiece is a painter or how 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.560
 water bottles for children one 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.560
 thermo fuse gun or American ribbon 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.520
 it's almost the first thing we have to do 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.520
 is to paste the plug 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.060
 in the disk for it you have two 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.550
 options the first is to use a 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.890
 little bit of American tape and the second 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 If you have an adult nearby, the best 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.180
 you can do is use a gun 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.910
 thermo fuse we throw thread with the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.910
 central circle 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:49.079
 [Music] 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.079
 and stick the plug 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.030
 we have to make sure that there is no 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.490
 not a single hole in the entire cap and a 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.490
 once checked now if we put the balloon 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.660
 to load air into our 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.160
 hovercraft we raise the spout e 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.460
 inflate the balloon through the hole 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.460
 disk 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.300
 once inflated the 'balloon' we have to 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.800
 quickly lower the rock whistle so that 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.110
 do not blow out air so now 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.210
 you just have to put it on the ground and 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.300
 raise the spout 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.300
 [Music] 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.350
 and you can play to have fun with you 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.400
 friends 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.400
 [Music] 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.920
 [Music] 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:51.650
 or not 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.650
 [Music] 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.610
 but what has happened here what 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.130
 what we have done has been to convert a 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.260
 I gave a bottle cap and a balloon in 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.850
 a perfect home analyzer and how 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.290
 the analyzers work 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.360
 they expel a lot of air to 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.369
 a lot of power that causes you to create 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.020
 an air chamber under the object that 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.730
 causes the disk never to enter 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.530
 contact with the ground but move 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.690
 about the intermediate air calls 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.790
 open thanks to this are able to 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.260
 measure by ground report so nothing 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.150
 we hope you try it company and
