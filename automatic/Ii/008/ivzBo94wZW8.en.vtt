00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.740 
it's an interesting place for the Jags
because<00:01:53.850> they<00:01:54.000> actually<00:01:54.270> had<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> pretty<00:01:54.600> good

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
will scare me in practice because they

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.810 
will scare me in practice because they
could<00:02:30.110> certainly<00:02:30.500> maybe<00:02:30.920> shore<00:02:31.550> up<00:02:31.700> the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
could certainly maybe shore up the

could certainly maybe shore up the
offensive<00:02:32.210> line<00:02:32.270> I'm<00:02:32.810> sure<00:02:32.990> it'll<00:02:33.170> work<00:02:33.400> and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
offensive line I'm sure it'll work and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.130 
offensive line I'm sure it'll work and

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
draft pick they do now have a seemingly

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.180 
draft pick they do now have a seemingly
competent<00:02:56.540> GM<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.200> we'll<00:02:57.380> see<00:02:57.620> how<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:57.980> goes

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
competent GM so we'll see how that goes

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.340 
competent GM so we'll see how that goes
I'm<00:02:58.730> yeah<00:02:59.180> we<00:02:59.720> don't<00:02:59.780> have<00:02:59.959> enough<00:03:00.110> time<00:03:00.290> to

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
I'm yeah we don't have enough time to

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.990 
I'm yeah we don't have enough time to
talk<00:03:00.740> about<00:03:00.860> every<00:03:01.250> draft<00:03:01.520> pick<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:01.910> this

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
talk about every draft pick in this

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.270 
talk about every draft pick in this
mocking<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.390> draft<00:03:02.510> mock<00:03:03.470> draft<00:03:03.830> but<00:03:04.100> let's

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
mocking the draft mock draft but let's

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.760 
mocking the draft mock draft but let's
go<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.459> number<00:03:04.910> nine<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.930> Giants<00:03:06.470> taking

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
go to number nine the Giants taking

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.699 
go to number nine the Giants taking
Amari<00:03:07.100> Cooper<00:03:07.220> yeah<00:03:07.910> i<00:03:08.300> spending<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.320> second

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
Amari Cooper yeah i spending a second

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.520 
Amari Cooper yeah i spending a second
consecutive<00:03:09.860> top<00:03:10.400> ten<00:03:10.459> pick<00:03:10.910> on<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:12.020> maybe

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
consecutive top ten pick on the maybe

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.870 
consecutive top ten pick on the maybe
the<00:03:12.680> best<00:03:12.830> wide<00:03:13.010> receiver<00:03:13.040> in<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.400> draft<00:03:13.640> so

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
the best wide receiver in the draft so

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.330 
the best wide receiver in the draft so
it<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.630> is<00:03:14.780> really<00:03:14.959> tricky<00:03:15.290> because<00:03:15.560> Amari

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
it this is really tricky because Amari

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.830 
it this is really tricky because Amari
Cooper<00:03:16.400> I<00:03:16.700> think<00:03:17.030> is<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.450> best<00:03:17.600> wide<00:03:17.810> receiver

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
Cooper I think is the best wide receiver

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.960 
Cooper I think is the best wide receiver
in<00:03:18.260> this<00:03:18.590> draft<00:03:18.890> but<00:03:19.130> if<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.340> look<00:03:19.550> at<00:03:19.700> last

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
in this draft but if you look at last

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.020 
in this draft but if you look at last
year's<00:03:20.269> draft<00:03:20.600> you<00:03:20.870> probably<00:03:21.170> say<00:03:21.650> he<00:03:22.310> doesn't

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
year's draft you probably say he doesn't

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.420 
year's draft you probably say he doesn't
have<00:03:23.209> that<00:03:23.420> unique<00:03:23.810> leaping<00:03:24.800> and<00:03:25.010> catching

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
have that unique leaping and catching

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.770 
have that unique leaping and catching
ability<00:03:25.519> than<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:25.940> Mike<00:03:26.150> Evans<00:03:26.330> does<00:03:26.630> he

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
ability than a Mike Evans does he

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.080 
ability than a Mike Evans does he
certainly<00:03:26.989> not<00:03:27.260> his<00:03:27.350> otherworldly<00:03:28.280> fastest

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
certainly not his otherworldly fastest

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.670 
certainly not his otherworldly fastest
Sammy<00:03:29.300> Watkins<00:03:29.630> he's<00:03:30.050> kind<00:03:30.320> of<00:03:30.380> like<00:03:30.530> an

the kind of guy who makes all the
highlight<00:06:46.720> plays<00:06:46.900> but<00:06:47.380> he's<00:06:47.430> almost<00:06:48.430> always

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
highlight plays but he's almost always

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.690 
highlight plays but he's almost always
near<00:06:49.210> the<00:06:49.360> ball<00:06:49.510> he's<00:06:49.780> 6'5<00:06:50.440> very<00:06:51.070> fast<00:06:51.490> very

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
long he can stand to improve a lot in

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.970 
long he can stand to improve a lot in
terms<00:06:55.150> of<00:06:55.360> his<00:06:55.420> what<00:06:56.170> he's<00:06:56.320> doing<00:06:56.620> in<00:06:56.680> terms<00:06:56.800> of

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
terms of his what he's doing in terms of

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.590 
terms of his what he's doing in terms of
technique<00:06:57.490> and<00:06:57.670> footwork<00:06:58.030> and<00:06:58.210> those<00:06:58.360> things

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
technique and footwork and those things

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.770 
technique and footwork and those things
but<00:06:59.290> those<00:07:00.070> that's<00:07:00.460> kind<00:07:00.820> of<00:07:00.910> why<00:07:01.030> you<00:07:01.090> takes<00:07:01.540> a

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
but those that's kind of why you takes a

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.600 
but those that's kind of why you takes a
rookie<00:07:02.230> that<00:07:02.410> you<00:07:02.560> you<00:07:02.920> think<00:07:03.190> has<00:07:03.370> that

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
rookie that you you think has that

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.040 
rookie that you you think has that
potential<00:07:03.940> so<00:07:04.150> you<00:07:04.240> can<00:07:04.390> teach<00:07:04.570> him<00:07:04.720> to<00:07:04.840> be<00:07:04.870> a

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050 
potential so you can teach him to be a

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.510 
potential so you can teach him to be a
better<00:07:05.260> football<00:07:05.500> player<00:07:05.620> at<00:07:05.950> the<00:07:06.010> next<00:07:06.220> level

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
better football player at the next level
