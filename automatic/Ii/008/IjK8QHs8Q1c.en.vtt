00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Let's have a look at these strangers 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.690
 more precisely in the gaza strip for example 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.730
 We have a group of young men 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.650
 We want the right way 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.980
 front national you definitely do not have 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.139
 want 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.000
 but they sit down to france 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.379
 not just in a boat or trust 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.630
 tackle any drag 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.160
 they want athletic use 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.740
 create with bold jumps and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.810
 daring saltus parcours means you 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.789
 Sport and its role models are here 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.269
 Paris suburbs have long become stars 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.160
 become 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.349
 that is what they want and that's why 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.140
 They train like crazy in the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.070
 ruins of gaza richard schneider has 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.070
 accompanied her 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.719
 this is called autumn on some days 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.149
 still had it almost 30 degrees as 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.570
 doing nothing a little in the water 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.570
 splash 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.940
 or even a prayer is just going 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.650
 but not much else 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.840
 but some adolescents in gaza is 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.880
 beach life and they love one another 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.300
 extreme sports even when they sweat 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.300
 come 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:20.510
 and that's parkour I'm doing it 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.450
 about floor and stone about house builders 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.740
 ruin of war ruins in a fiction 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.740
 from the residence of paris 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.450
 It 's the best sport ever 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.729
 feel free when I make it 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.350
 neither do you risk and if I'm someone 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.000
 here in gaza if anything haunts 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.660
 You can walk on the street right away 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.210
 flee 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.280
 you know the situation in gaza attacks 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.080
 fire shootings you know that you too 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:51.950
 practice is practiced everywhere and always 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.620
 one quite astonished in the audience 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.570
 they no longer have training centers 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.140
 that was the Israelis last 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.140
 war to 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.450
 the few cool clubs in europe and the 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.979
 USA are very professional they have 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.420
 a special walls and obstacle 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.070
 stir wooden utensils 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.660
 but I there are no clubs we 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:20.410
 Just meet us on the street and 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:22.660
 Lead away from the beach we are now in 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.360
 Dschabalia refugee camp at Gaza 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.459
 city 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.459
 over one hundred thousand people live here 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:41.380
 and practice here in the narrow streets 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:45.250
 the park-watch fanatics go with them 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.810
 an extremely high risk for us 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.340
 are afraid that the people in the camp are us 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.050
 for those who are on the run 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.450
 and that they will follow us then 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.739
 have often had problems themselves before 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.580
 mosques do not scare the boys 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.200
 back if that does not matter the imamen 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.410
 everything has to be for her 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.500
 passion sometimes has 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.880
 also include a price violations 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.650
 to the agenda 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.640
 But you buy them because they are 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.840
 secretly have a goal 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.640
 the location is also so that you do not stay here 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.350
 can live if the political and 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.730
 economic situation would be good then 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.709
 nobody has left gaza 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.269
 the situation is shitty there is war 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.370
 between the Palestinian camps 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.170
 and with the jews who wants to die already 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.170
 Everyone wants to fly before death 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.310
 two of them already have that 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.680
 they were on a parcours 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.250
 in the tournament in norway and are there 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.290
 remained 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.720
 these guys are still dreaming about this 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.720
 opportunity and continue training
