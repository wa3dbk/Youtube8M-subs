00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.660 
buy garbage packs that's ridiculous so
the<00:01:50.810> question<00:01:51.079> is<00:01:51.139> how<00:01:51.350> do<00:01:51.409> you<00:01:51.619> know<00:01:51.950> if<00:01:52.249> your

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
the question is how do you know if your

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.730 
the question is how do you know if your
local<00:01:52.909> store<00:01:53.299> does<00:01:53.630> this<00:01:53.869> what<00:01:54.350> are<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.529> sort

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
local store does this what are the sort

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.499 
local store does this what are the sort
of<00:01:54.799> signs<00:01:55.009> you<00:01:55.219> look<00:01:55.399> for<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:56.029> first<00:01:56.270> thing

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
of signs you look for the first thing

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.269 
of signs you look for the first thing
that<00:01:56.659> I<00:01:56.689> do<00:01:56.840> when<00:01:57.170> I<00:01:57.259> walk<00:01:57.439> into<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.709> store<00:01:57.799> is<00:01:58.249> I

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:58.279 
that I do when I walk into a store is I

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:59.980 
that I do when I walk into a store is I
look<00:01:58.670> at<00:01:58.789> door<00:01:58.969> and<00:01:59.119> I<00:01:59.149> say<00:01:59.329> are<00:01:59.450> they<00:01:59.569> selling

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
look at door and I say are they selling

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.840 
look at door and I say are they selling
the<00:02:00.079> Boosters<00:02:00.439> directly<00:02:01.249> out<00:02:01.399> of<00:02:01.429> a<00:02:01.639> box

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
the Boosters directly out of a box

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.519 
the Boosters directly out of a box
meaning<00:02:02.509> they're<00:02:02.630> not<00:02:02.749> in<00:02:02.899> a<00:02:02.990> separate<00:02:03.289> case

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:03.529 
meaning they're not in a separate case

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:06.099 
meaning they're not in a separate case
just<00:02:04.009> flipped<00:02:04.249> open<00:02:04.429> on<00:02:04.819> display<00:02:05.329> if<00:02:05.719> it's

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
directly out of a booster box it's more

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.820 
directly out of a booster box it's more
likely<00:02:08.209> again<00:02:08.660> not<00:02:08.869> guaranteed<00:02:09.410> but<00:02:09.440> it's

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
likely again not guaranteed but it's

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.770 
likely again not guaranteed but it's
more<00:02:10.069> likely<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.670> they're<00:02:11.150> not<00:02:11.360> selling

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
more likely that they're not selling

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.020 
more likely that they're not selling
hand-picked<00:02:12.560> packs<00:02:12.860> because<00:02:13.670> they<00:02:13.760> probably

hand-picked packs because they probably

at least in one of the stores I visited

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.190 
at least in one of the stores I visited
what<00:02:17.000> they<00:02:17.090> do<00:02:17.150> is<00:02:17.360> they<00:02:17.450> open<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.780> box<00:02:17.960> and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
what they do is they open the box and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.510 
what they do is they open the box and
they<00:02:18.380> stick<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.710> out<00:02:18.800> in<00:02:18.890> front<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.190> that's<00:02:19.340> it

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
they stick it out in front and that's it

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.180 
they stick it out in front and that's it
more<00:02:19.850> likely<00:02:20.090> they're<00:02:20.570> not

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
more likely they're not

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.580

ones are less likely to box Matt they

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.400 
ones are less likely to box Matt they
move<00:04:23.290> enough<00:04:23.560> packs<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:24.370> not<00:04:25.360> do<00:04:25.930> this<00:04:26.080> sort<00:04:26.290> of

move enough packs to not do this sort of
box<00:04:26.650> mapping<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:27.220> hopefully<00:04:27.610> they're<00:04:27.760> also

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
box mapping and hopefully they're also

fourth<00:04:29.910> thing<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.180> think<00:04:30.360> about<00:04:30.569> do<00:04:31.110> people

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
fourth thing I think about do people

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.020 
fourth thing I think about do people
regularly<00:04:31.860> not<00:04:32.130> get<00:04:32.340> good<00:04:32.520> stuff<00:04:32.639> in<00:04:32.940> the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
regularly not get good stuff in the

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.580 
regularly not get good stuff in the
individual<00:04:33.509> packs<00:04:33.750> if<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.080> have<00:04:34.199> friends<00:04:34.380> who

if it's a consistent trend chances are

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.800 
if it's a consistent trend chances are
they're<00:04:47.669> box<00:04:47.880> mapping<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.389> you<00:04:48.479> should<00:04:48.630> stop

they're box mapping and you should stop

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.969 
they're box mapping and you should stop
