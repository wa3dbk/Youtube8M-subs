00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.360 
doesn't have this problem so if you are
like<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.340> really<00:03:20.090> really<00:03:20.480> perfect<00:03:21.080> form<00:03:21.350> so<00:03:22.310> you

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
like a really really perfect form so you

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:30.640 
like a really really perfect form so you
might<00:03:22.700> want<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.150> consider<00:03:24.160> Isis<00:03:25.420> j+

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.260

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.260 

I<00:03:36.260> think<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.740> software<00:03:37.160> is<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.370> same<00:03:37.640> as<00:03:38.030> I

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
I think the software is the same as I

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.950 
I think the software is the same as I
60-plus<00:03:39.520> just<00:03:40.520> exactly<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.120> same<00:03:41.770> that's<00:03:42.770> all
