00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.460
 Hello everyone, today I will show how to do 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:26.020
 perfect white background open our 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.880
 an image in Photoshop that's it right in 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.450
 us on this our image is written 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:39.100
 background right click and 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:42.670
 click create duplicate layer further 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.390
 go to the image level correction y 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.710
 we have three sliders we need 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:55.299
 rim he is responsible for light colors and we 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:59.379
 we move it to the left we move and for the time being 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:02.920
 get a lighter image but 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.060
 it should not change itself 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.040
 the color of our clone in this case 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.990
 the left slider can be moved 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.500
 will be darker 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.720
 your vertebra code itself is responsible for dark 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.840
 tones 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.750
 something like this did click yes 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.789
 Next, we go to the image correction brightness 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:32.439
 and contrast and here even more 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:34.329
 We lighten our background, too, see how you 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:41.079
 like you can leave like this 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:45.069
 click yes then go filter sharpness 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.560
 clever sharpness you need to make an image 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.979
 more honorable 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.240
 here I have the effect of 68 percent 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.280
 radius two point three pixels 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.439
 You can change to move the slider to watch 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.200
 so that the image was rosary click yes 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.700
 then go to your and 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.700
 new layer 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.750
 here we have it click on it two 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:20.040
 fold and tick overlay color 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.950
 automatic color will be red 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:29.670
 click yes we take the brush you need to select it 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:36.049
 slightly stiffness take about 40 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:39.959
 percent and diameter a little more 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:44.819
 choose white color we need the background exactly 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.629
 white and paint our background as we 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.959
 made 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:52.349
 color overlay then we'll paint 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.670
 in red just to see 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:00.959
 where what places did you paint over then and how 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.400
 would we remove this effect and the background would be 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.400
 completely white 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:28.120
 paint over and and now but back 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:31.630
 your one written effects effects we 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.050
 we remove a tick who tick who 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.380
 eyes like me and get a white background 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.080
 enter the back of the canopy there is a shadow like 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:46.410
 You can of course paint over it was also white 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.530
 color but it is so very difficult 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.280
 laborious 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:57.490
 so we take a tool 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:01.900
 clarifier take and tested push 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:04.920
 in the background and pass through the edge 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:11.230
 that's where there is a shadow where I want more 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:14.730
 lighten the tip of such shallow places those 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.730
 very small details 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.299
 and get 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:33.100
 for comparison, I'll show you the previous one 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.100
 photo of what was and what has become now 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.190
 now you can make your products on 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.190
 perfect white background
