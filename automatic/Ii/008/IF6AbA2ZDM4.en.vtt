00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.629
 in the field of science fiction a 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.690
 of the most outstanding films of the 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:13.099
 decade of the 60s 20th century was without 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:15.440
 doubt fantastic trip in your plot a 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.470
 group of scientists as well as the ship 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.140
 that manned are reduced to size 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.100
 microscopic so that they can travel 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.260
 through the interior of a human organism 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.510
 in this case the one of an important 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.880
 statesman who has been the victim of a 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.210
 attack during which a bullet is 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.820
 he lodged dangerously in his brain the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.530
 objective of those scientists 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.760
 miniaturized is to reach the area of 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.220
 brain where that bullet is and extract it 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.920
 surgically a typical plot 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.200
 Hollywood that maybe there would be 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.020
 been much more interesting and even 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.770
 memorable to have happened to the 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.410
 producers take advantage of said trip 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.980
 miniaturized towards the human brain 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.539
 to add an educational comment 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.570
 identifying the specific sites in 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.729
 that organ 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.909
 which was moving in those fictitious 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.850
 miniaturized travelers with names 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.700
 of true pathological scientists and 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.479
 anatomists that identified them wave 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.290
 the superstation presents our 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.350
 Unusual universe 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.050
 five minutes and touring our 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.300
 amazing world 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.050
 an independent national production of 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.050
 rafael silva certified number 3 thousand 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.050
 664 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.340
 the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.620
 as the miniaturized spacecraft 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.620
 moved through the different areas 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.860
 brain some of the neurologists to 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.500
 board of that micro ship could have 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.310
 indicated to his colleagues and to those who saw 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.459
 the movie we incite look now 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.010
 We are in the area of ​​drill bit in the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.000
 brain that identified pierre paul broca 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.000
 French surgeon 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.599
 later I would report now we cross 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.140
 the carus curve to rotate around 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.720
 of the circle of wings and then we will pass 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.150
 in front of the key column for 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.269
 stop for a while in front of the window 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.780
 of life continuing towards the pyramid 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.780
 ferry 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.400
 then we will go through the end arch giving 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.760
 a detour to the weak tie to climb towards 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.180
 the alcoholic crest towards the Gulf of 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.180
 state 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.579
 there we would have liked to be feasible 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:12.150
 board the sailboat of fabricio for 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.159
 get to the islets of langerhans and to the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.180
 come back to stop at the bar 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.849
 mercier crossing the neck canal avoiding 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.750
 the piqué cistern to land in the 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.750
 healthy area 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.290
 at this point we pause in the 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.870
 imaginary anatomical travel by the 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.730
 geography of the human brain and those 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.620
 Sites identified by different 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.020
 scientists who gave them their names 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.470
 to reiterate to those who now listen 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.590
 that we are not teaching courses of 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.680
 cerebral anatomy is rather about 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.810
 a low and imaginary flight by 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.360
 certain points inside our 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.540
 organism and that over time 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.020
 they were located and identified as 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.250
 it was already said by men of science and 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.970
 researchers with the names that now 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.850
 they have such a low flight we have 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.580
 been doing as was said at the beginning 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.420
 root of the already old science film 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.980
 fiction entitled fantastic trip 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.090
 made in 1966 and where by the way 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.630
 I was part of the cast 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.420
 Rachel Welch in those days a bomb 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.060
 sexy 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.240
 later and with the passage of the years 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.860
 turned into a grotesque old woman and 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.320
 disfigured by as direct as 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.390
 numerous aesthetic operations in 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.730
 different points of its anatomy 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.190
 returning to the film in question is worth the 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:51.250
 also worth mentioning that would be 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.650
 special effects of it showing 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.980
 the inside of our body were 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.140
 rather artisanal and nothing to do with 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.140
 the technological waste of the present 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:06.250
 they were quite acceptable anyway 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:09.280
 and its plot although fanciful so 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:13.150
 least I had a valid idea and in certain 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.060
 way more interesting than those songs 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.270
 of rodgers of computer crap 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.960
 that characterize the cinematography of 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:25.280
 I presented 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:29.190
 the superstate presented our 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.949
