00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.720
 where we're going to basically talk about 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.509
 the main questions that make me 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.999
 in acrylic nail videos like 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.620
 I 've always told you this these videos 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:15.379
 I do them with a lot of love for you 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.430
 but they only represent my opinion about 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.670
 of certain things or the procedure of x 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.520
 or such products does not mean you have 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.850
 all the truth in the hands but if my 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.440
 advice or my mistakes or my successes 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.539
 can you help them so that you 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.190
 improve your technique because what better me 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.130
 I feel very lucky to be able to 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.660
 help them a lot in what I deal with 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.440
 always answer all the questions 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.970
 they just reach my channel I want 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.650
 thank all those who command 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.110
 very good vibes really are the 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.410
 I appreciate and it 's reciprocal decisions for 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.410
 all of you 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.860
 I try to respond as soon as possible and 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.050
 some questions that responds well as 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.640
 that much later is because of 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.930
 strange do not appear in my tray 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.050
 comments one of the main 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.699
 questions that they always ask me is because 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.320
 the day after applying the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.990
 acrylic on the nails we like it 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.509
 obviously that also happened to me and 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.090
 I want to believe that it is a procedure or 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.380
 it's something that normally happens with we're 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.930
 learning they have commented that they are 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.630
 They happen because of several issues 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.030
 mainly because it is not done this 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.149
 well the magnet or because you did not take off 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.280
 well the cuticle and why are not you 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.880
 using adequately the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.190
 products or you're mixing products the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.570
 first it is very important that when we 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.670
 let's make our acrylic nails 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.430
 you have to file 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.220
 the magnet does not wear the nail until you 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.049
 I give the lime means if we can see 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.780
 our nails at this time we go a 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.790
 group exercise but when we 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.310
 we see our nails and it has a shine 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.070
 natural that protects the nail let's say that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.399
 this is a natural grease that has 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.920
 to eliminate with a clear soft file the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.259
 softer we have and it only serves 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.300
 to remove the shine later 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.269
 let's put what is the dehydrator 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.950
 and with that we ensure at least or 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.110
 we discard one of the possible errors 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.350
 in our application 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.030
 the other is to remove the cuticle when 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.519
 let's make us nails or when 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.069
 we make nails if you have noticed this 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.230
 pushes on the cuticle backwards not 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.299
 it's just pushing to push this 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.019
 they have because when we push 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:37.200
 the cuticle this is necessary from 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.569
 preference to cut it because because it 's 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.130
 dead skin that at the end of the day 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.080
 natural form 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.060
 will be detached especially when 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.290
 we apply chemical products to our 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.110
 nails then if you 're not 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.780
 completely the cuticle what are you going to 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.490
 do is let's say your cuticle is 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.920
 you apply the acrylic and this at the end of 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.560
 day you will want to get up as you go 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.380
 growing the nail then what does that 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.290
 it releases the acrylic and that is another 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.580
 of the errors and the third one that I believe 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.270
 that happens to all of us with such 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.480
 economize and so we do not occupy this 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.750
 the product line as it should be for 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.700
 example to where I stayed is 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.940
 important to use the two products of 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.730
 the same line is the number and number 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.460
 the acrylic powder this because we say 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.550
 what is it like the shampoo and the 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.730
 conditioner I do not understand or that is the 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.310
 complement and being of the same brand 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.530
 the same lab and all that 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.750
 ensures that those two products are 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.740
 compatible to me for example when 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.340
 I was starting 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.290
 what happened to me frequently was that 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.780
 I did my nails and it could take me 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:55.390
 literal centuries and centuries 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:59.520
 and it was never touched to bury her 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.910
 another and it was like a pill 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.910
 and I put the lime to him we passed him the lime what 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.210
 What happens is to go out and fly and others 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.690
 and beni 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.730
 then they are little things that we think not 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.620
 they are important but that at the end of 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.650
 day are not 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.490
 ok next question can be applied 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.290
 Acrylic directly on the nail yes clear 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.170
 of course that's what we do 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:30.430
 normally the one we use 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:34.600
 depp or use the molds to make 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.150
 making the extension of the nail always 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.240
 it involves gluing them on our nails now 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.310
 yes something you are referring to is not to get 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.050
 you or anything and let's say you have the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.160
 If the nail is long and you want to apply 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.340
 acrylic yes yes you can but not all 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.190
 the cases is recommended well in my 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.500
 experience 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.540
 of the times that I apply the because 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.970
 obviously not only is learning but 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.660
 also with seeing you can learn certain 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.990
 celtics tricks that have salons and 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.540
 for example in my case you look like two 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.710
 or three times I put the excess 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.690
 aluminum that puts you right now 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.310
 I remember the name well but they are 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.220
 special bandits obviously that 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:22.180
 they use there are many brands 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.070
 neil factory republic neil do it 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.170
 Many brands 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.410
 I remember her name well with a 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:32.670
 grid because everything is at least me 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:36.280
 but I 'm not a candidate for that kind of 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:39.280
 products because my nails are extremely 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.950
 thin but me when the game believe me 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.500
 I wash my hands whatever it is 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.870
 moisturizing my nails in automatic it 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.330
 they put straight 12 in squares 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.430
 beautiful but only while they are 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.520
 hydrated then what happened with me 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.770
 that I put it on and that and obviously the 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.170
 Acrylic is wet and it grabbed the shape 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.410
 derechita as was drying my 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:05.560
 little girl they turned fearless I did not have the 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:08.560
 curved shape and immediately began to 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.120
 detach and that was worse because 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.449
 they got more water 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.610
 the water enters very fast and this one 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:19.050
 it could cause a car sis in fact 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.150
 this time in this one I had a fungus 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.190
 and good to me it did not hurt or anything but 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.190
 obviously you know that she is healthy
