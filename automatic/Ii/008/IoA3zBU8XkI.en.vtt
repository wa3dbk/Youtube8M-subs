24-bit<00:01:10.080> oh<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:11.220> did<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.939> mention<00:01:11.970> note<00:01:12.689> 3<00:01:12.960> has<00:01:12.990> 3

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
24-bit oh and did I mention note 3 has 3

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.730 
24-bit oh and did I mention note 3 has 3
gigabytes<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.130> RAM<00:01:14.340> ok<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.270> did<00:01:15.509> good<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
gigabytes of RAM ok just did good so the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.850 
gigabytes of RAM ok just did good so the
hardware<00:01:17.130> spec<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:18.240> ok<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.590> digest

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
hardware spec is there ok we can digest

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.219 
hardware spec is there ok we can digest
that<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.549> my<00:01:20.700> immediate<00:01:20.909> response<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
that but my immediate response is a

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.710 
that but my immediate response is a
pretty<00:01:22.439> obvious<00:01:22.799> question<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:24.270> battery<00:01:24.570> life

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
pretty obvious question the battery life

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.210 
pretty obvious question the battery life
is<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.110> affected<00:01:25.500> how<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> battery

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
is that affected how is the battery

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.490 
is that affected how is the battery
performance<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.540> definitely<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.320> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
performance so you definitely have to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.770 
performance so you definitely have to
have<00:01:28.650> power<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:29.430> devices<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.119> we've

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
have power with these devices and we've

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.289
