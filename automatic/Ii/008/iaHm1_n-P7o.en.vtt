00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.030
 what material to build the house itself 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.059
 common question arising 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.800
 people wanting to build their home and 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.090
 to make a choice you need to know 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.140
 primarily the properties of these materials 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.760
 as well as advantages and disadvantages in 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.170
 mostly the choice falls on the wooden 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.720
 frame brick houses 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.460
 Therefore, in this video we will analyze these 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.600
 types of materials and so the house of timber 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.839
 the main advantage of houses from a bar 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.629
 is that they breathe and hold 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.100
 heat is better than stone houses 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.370
 such a home is more pleasant 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.909
 microclimate for man 9 until may of 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.499
 timber certainly looks very beautiful 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:51.569
 the above mentioned dignity has 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:53.609
 place only with proper construction 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:56.069
 and with all the requirements for 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.839
 design and construction of timber 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.489
 houses 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.679
 By the way from a bar to build a house is easier than 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.579
 from trousers 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.430
 building houses from timber more often 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.070
 use conifers such as spruce 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.680
 larches pine fir cedar 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.270
 and for the construction of supporting structures 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.000
 at home more suitable pine or 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.070
 Larches these species unlike ate 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.780
 and fir is less subject to the processes 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.439
 rotting 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.990
 Europe is the most common 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.659
 got pine as the most affordable 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.149
 construction material 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.170
 thanks to its insulating 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.009
 energy saving and environmental 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.600
 characteristics 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.270
 the tree has won fame better 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.859
 building material by structure 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.560
 wood is natural 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:40.109
 polymer forming and fiber cells 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.750
 aimed along the trunk has a tubular 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:46.109
 form therefore it has a number of 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.630
 virtues such as high elasticity 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:51.869
 strength low density and small 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.609
 weight low thermal conductivity natural 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.759
 decorative resistance 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:59.420
 chemical corrosive media and that 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.409
 important simple processing and installation 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.749
 special importance is low 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.560
 thermal conductivity of wood 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:08.450
 it will be lower in order to your home 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.039
 houses made of logs have 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.530
 almost the same virtues and 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.510
 disadvantages that except log houses 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.870
 that they can not be insulated as outdoor 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.800
 surface n is the face 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.130
 wooden log house 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.060
 is that the rounded shape of the log 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.750
 allows you to achieve a tight connection 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.730
 European standard logs overpayment diameter 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.000
 rounded log should not 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.230
 exceed two to four millimeters 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.480
 the aging process rounded log 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.459
 less deformed and big plus 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.500
 is that houses are built from 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.870
 Round logs do not require 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.440
 finish due to almost the same diameter 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.790
 and high quality processing 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.680
 necessary grooves and locks you yourself 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.290
 Us belt has mathematically 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.930
 verified form and performed with a very 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.819
 precision resulting Wenzel 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.489
 cylinder house has minimal 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.310
 log clearances can be connected under 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.510
 any angle needed 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.790
 service life and technical parameters 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.200
 modern frame house often 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.709
 leaves far behind 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.880
 traditional wooden house building 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.950
 new materials and technologies allow 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.850
 create in the frame house the same 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.519
 internal climate 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.530
 as in traditional wooden at the same time 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.200
 reduce heating costs somewhat 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.209
 times the frame house is initially possible 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.030
 lay good heat engineering and 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.900
 wet dreams and characteristics of which house 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.970
 less inert 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.130
 there is no moisture arising 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.630
 for example in a stone house it is less 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.090
 subject to negative impact 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.389
 environment frame house 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.340
 environmentally friendly comfortable and 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.590
 energy efficient since the total weight 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.780
 frame construction is much smaller than 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.970
 the whole structure of brick or timber 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.489
 reinforced concrete then during erection 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.760
 frame house saving starts already 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.540
 at installation of the base 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.299
 if on construction sites 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.120
 soft ground is an alternative to Frame 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.470
 home virtually non-existent 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.940
 at frame construction also 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.160
 possible without serious financial 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.079
 attachments give appearance and 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.959
 internal planning of the house is practically 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.060
 any architectural form appears 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.450
 opportunity to embody the life of the original 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.180
 ideas 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.040
 architect and designer and facing 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.840
 frame house can do this 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.299
 the way that it will not differ from 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.120
 houses from brick or for example and houses from 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.590
 solid logs now let's move brick 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.480
 houses 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.139
 brick houses for decades to save 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.970
 warm and bring the comfort of their owners 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.290
 brick house and this construction which 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.770
 may well be inherited 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.250
 over several generations 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.540
 for at least 100 150 years 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.290
 spacious brick house despite 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.700
 architecture 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.910
 no doubt can be called 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.220
 family home use modern 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.840
 thermal insulation materials allows 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.840
 introduce effective technology 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.720
 home insulation warm on the house wall 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.979
 built on such technology 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.760
 corresponds to the heat loss normal 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:04.639
 brick wall 2 meters thick 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.680
 usually a wall of brick 51 51 thick 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.270
 a centimeter no longer passes by 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.930
 modern heat technical standards 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.280
 Russia 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.850
 to achieve the required 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.340
 heat transfer wall resistance 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.840
 Today necessary and warming insulation 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.750
 performed in two ways 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.820
 inside or outside to the main 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.979
 The advantages of brick houses include 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.740
 durability low exposure 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.750
 atmospheric influences are not subject to 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.710
 biological factors high strength 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.510
 constructions 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.110
 high degree of protection from 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.850
 fire hazard ie fire resistance 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.400
 the wealth of brick houses is 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.130
 that stone or brick walls require 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.990
 heavy expensive foundations with 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.310
 depth and foundation changes 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.320
 depending on the depth of frost penetration 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.639
 ground 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.830
 summing up we can say that 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.740
 heatproof sanitary hygienic 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.610
 properties of the walls of logs and timber 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.520
 significantly higher than 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.680
 stone and brick but shorter 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.970
 low flame life and 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.220
 initial shrinkage 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.440
 after all, finishing work is usually done 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.690
 one and a half years after collection 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.180
 such a house is all negative 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.500
 properties of wooden houses 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.050
 by the way fire resistance of a wooden house 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.920
 can be upgraded to brick walls 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.210
 or building blocks 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.280
 I hope this information will help 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.500
 determine the choice and at least 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.380
 bow so to speak take note 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.310
 some material if so then like 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.590
 if not difficult 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.910
 and I say goodbye to you subscribe to 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.910
 channel and see you soon
