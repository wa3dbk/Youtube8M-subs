 terrifying legends or urban legends 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.689

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.980
 your comment because I like what you say 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.719
 we're going to start with this we're going to 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.130
 start with these 15 curiosities that 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.750
 some of them will surely know and 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.020
 some of them you will not know I imagine 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.680
 the first of all is that azurri the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.780
 martin production has 25% of 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.050
 possibilities of changing sex when 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.559
 evolves that is to say when it evolves 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.539
 azurri a marril has 25% of 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.030
 chances that if it's female to 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.000
 be male and if it is male to be female 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.800
 a pretty curious fact ct advertising 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.019
 number 14 sure I opened them many of 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.150
 you but good is a curiosity 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.980
 that I really liked in his 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.470
 day 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.990
 and is that pokemon is not a word 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.880
 Japanese that is to say is the union of 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.010
 words pocket and monster that is 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.500
 pocket monster in English until 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.560
 originally the word pokemon is a 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.900
 english word so to speak how much 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.780
 less interesting since it's more Japanese 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.520
 what I know about curiosity 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.730
 says that and this is not worth it 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.470
 we know everyone please 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.020
 comment that anthem apart from being a 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.120
 pokémon with the ability to hypnotize 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.890
 the people and those things already their 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.830
 adversaries is also a hijacker 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.930
 of children or this we all know by 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.460
 please because we have already seen fail agor 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.500
 as I talked a lot about hymn 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.110
 etc. etcetera it even takes a 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.660
 scare pretty big on the part of a 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.230
 friend of yours in a series of pits the mont 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.000
 he got a scare the scare was important 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.250
 the one who stuck the truth I think that that 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.160
 night he did not sleep 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.430
 curiosity number 12 is that to be 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.500
 this I have seen a terrifying legend 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.600
 about this pokemon about to set and it's 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.210
 that to be are 2 pokemon in one is 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.090
 say the mushroom that he carries in the 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.360
 head is the pokemon is the part that 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.980
 controls the crab part ie 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.750
 go that the fungus is the parasite that 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.060
 is controlling the set 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.250
 that is, originally a set is 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.620
 like a paras but bigger without the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.510
 fungus however the ogre the fungus is a 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.610
 parasite that controls it there has already been 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.040
 enough terrifying legends about 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.170
 this pokemon and maybe maybe I'll bring it 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.390
 you will also see the following 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.880
 Pokemon's curiosity is that in 2008 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.850
 Japanese scientists discovered a 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.959
 mineral and they called them picachuri because 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.970
 it worked quite well with the 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.739
 electricity go that the island is going 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.110
 pretty good and it worked well with the 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.239
 electricity and they called it turing itch 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.239
 as pikachu go the name is in 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.040
 epic of pikachu in the number 10 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.320
 we have to be rumored that this too 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.360
 is very well known please because I already 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.030
 I made a video about this and it is that 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.340
 rumored that he edited and mine 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.770
 come from the same thing that edited is the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.800
 miu's failed experiment is like the 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.209
 Fake version of me that even is that 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.330
 they look a lot like it is because 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.700
 they weigh the same 8.8 weigh the same the two 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.110
 They are pink and can learn 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.780
 all movements 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.030
 except I edit that they are movements 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.130
 who learns temporarily for 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.319
 say it in curiosity number 9 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.870
 pikachu that resembles a mouse with 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.480
 we all know what pikachu is a mouse 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.300
 damn it in the appo you give is the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.209
 number 25 in the picacho pokédex is the 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.910
 number 25 while mine or that is me out ' 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.120
 that fled that I say of me I out the 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.319
 of the rocket team that resembles a cat 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.410
 is number 52 in the pokedex bone 2552 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.750
 they are invested invested in the order and 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.250
 they are like opposites in one another such 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.110
 like the cat and the mouse that they take 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.200
 Like your ass, you already know that 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.150
 a cat and a mouse get very bad and 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.010
 precisely because they are 25 and 5 shots 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.890
 that are numbers invested a data 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.120
 quite curious in the data number 8 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.489
 each thorn 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.859
 different moles pattern there are more than 4 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.690
 billions of combinations in the game I 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.360
 this I had no idea what I read and I 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.830
 is a little like wat yes without understanding 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.990
 I mean, I did not understand it at all 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.930
 but it has 4 million combinations 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.820
 in the game in the following data worthy and 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.169
 their evolutions I do not know if you know who 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.470

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.000
 obviously I will leave you the image of day 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.270
 well they know and their evolutions 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.139
 contain the numbers 1 2 and 3 in German 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:49.660
 I do not know if you have noticed dent 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:53.919

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.199
 article states and moto3 which is one two 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.699
 and three sad article 2003 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.870
 This information was already known to most 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.479
 the people but good for the people 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.370
 that does not know well welcome is hey 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.419
 he is curious, it is said that 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.820
 pokemon ya max or ya max ya max I do not know 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.150
 how do they pronounce damn it damn 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.639
 be 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.020
 that you are a teacher are you a teacher 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.660
 but you have to know how 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.090
 the pokemon the ya max are said to be 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.180
 human souls that for some reason are 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.590
 have reincarnated so to speak in form 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.810
 of pokemon 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.550
 what a cock you have left me not that 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.150
 have preserved in the form of pokemon and that 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.250
 remember all go remember everything 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.110
 of their previous life and are aware of 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.479
 this and that gives me very bad vibes 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.530
 maybe make a legend about this 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.180
 Pokemon 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.550
 after hearing this the next 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.080
 curiosity in the original game of 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.690
 pokemon in the first games of 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.229
 pokémon the player could throw a tree 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.479
 down obviously and when it's 6 and it 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.960
 put where that tree was kept and 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:03.250
 I restarted the game 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.400
 it ended up on the tree that had 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:10.360
 cut or it was like a kind of bug 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.580
 in the number 4 data if the player speaks 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.280
 with down or lucas on his birthday 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.259
 he was blessed or whether congratulate the 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.930
 birthday day but this only 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:23.199
 happens after defeating the elite 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.789
 force in the number 3 data the swirls 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.350
 from the state of Paul, I do not know if 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.720
 have you ever fixed 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.970
 Paul has the same there is as a kind of 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.950
 swirl in the stomach are based on 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.510
 the intestines of the tadpoles because 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.240
 the tadpole's intestines are 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.480
 swirls and a poly wash could be 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.580
 say that it is like a tadpole, that is, 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.410
 It pretty much hits the truth in the 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.020
 next curiosity the editions of 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.790
 red blue and yellow were not displayed 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.880
 excess of the pokemon could be intuited 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:55.690
 looking at his statistics it was said that if 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:58.480
 his attack was quite high he was male and 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.730
 if your defense was high was female is and 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.530
 as the latest data and the most interesting 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.900
 for me for me this was not this was not a 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.640
 order of data from better to worse but this 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.260
 last data for me is the most curious and 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.660
 the funniest and the one that has most 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:13.390
 liked and is some you will know 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.880
 obviously and others do not and that's what I ride 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:19.150
 and jim beall and are based on jackie 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.890
 chan and bruce list respectively by 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.590
 with the bet the truth I would bet 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:26.920
 I do not know jackie chan is the milk but bruce 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.310
 lee has been ethical epic has been the most 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.340
 of the most 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.920
 but as you well know and molly reads 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.770
 bruce lee and djimon chat from jackie chan 

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.300
 quite curious are these data from 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.380
