the screw paint here better is almost
does<00:00:36.020> that's<00:00:36.260> pretty<00:00:36.470> slow<00:00:36.770> but<00:00:37.040> a<00:00:39.010> battery

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
does that's pretty slow but a battery

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.810 
does that's pretty slow but a battery
the<00:00:40.280> bed

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.310 

there's<00:00:48.820> also<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.840> solar<00:00:53.080> speed<00:00:53.380> feet<00:00:53.620> here

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
there's also the solar speed feet here

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.299 
there's also the solar speed feet here
this<00:00:56.320> is<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.800> old<00:00:57.100> school<00:00:58.440> or<00:00:59.440> some<00:00:59.739> say<00:01:00.040> AG

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
this is the old school or some say AG

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.710 
this is the old school or some say AG
speed<00:01:01.270> feed<00:01:04.410> that's<00:01:05.410> one<00:01:05.940> with<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.060> pawns<00:01:07.300> I

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
speed feed that's one with the pawns I

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.249 
speed feed that's one with the pawns I
got<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.050> gold<00:01:08.320> one<00:01:11.940> it'll<00:01:12.940> fit<00:01:12.970> but<00:01:13.930> like<00:01:14.050> my

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
got a gold one it'll fit but like my

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:15.960 
got a gold one it'll fit but like my
other<00:01:14.410> video<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:14.979> don't<00:01:15.190> have<00:01:15.399> it<00:01:15.520> facing<00:01:15.700> like

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
other video I don't have it facing like

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.340 
other video I don't have it facing like
that<00:01:16.270> i<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:17.590> my<00:01:17.710> face<00:01:18.009> backwards<00:01:19.350> because

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
that i have my face backwards because

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.030 
that i have my face backwards because
the<00:01:20.530> paint<00:01:20.740> goes<00:01:20.890> an<00:01:21.130> easier<00:01:21.460> like<00:01:21.670> that<00:01:23.040> so

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
the paint goes an easier like that so

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.570 
the paint goes an easier like that so
you<00:01:24.610> need<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:25.090> hose<00:01:25.330> clamp<00:01:26.310> hold<00:01:27.310> it<00:01:27.460> on<00:01:27.550> there

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
you need a hose clamp hold it on there

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.580 
you need a hose clamp hold it on there
otherwise<00:01:27.940> you<00:01:28.660> lose<00:01:28.810> around<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.200> doesn't<00:01:29.440> fit

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
otherwise you lose around it doesn't fit

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.710 
otherwise you lose around it doesn't fit
right<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.930> i<00:01:31.990> have<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.229> do<00:01:32.380> is<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.539> hose

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
right so i have to do is to the hose

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.430 
right so i have to do is to the hose
clamp<00:01:34.899> around<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:37.180> tighten<00:01:37.570> it<00:01:37.630> up<00:01:40.440> paint

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
clamp around it and tighten it up paint

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.109 
clamp around it and tighten it up paint
goes<00:01:41.590> in<00:01:46.680> goes<00:01:47.680> a<00:01:47.740> much<00:01:47.979> better<00:01:48.220> like<00:01:48.400> that<00:01:48.430> it

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
goes in goes a much better like that it

00:01:49.119 --> 00:02:00.840 
goes in goes a much better like that it
doesn't<00:01:49.180> come<00:01:49.630> out<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.400> other<00:01:51.520> way<00:01:59.850> if

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
doesn't come out get the other way if

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:10.919 
doesn't come out get the other way if
it's<00:02:01.090> this<00:02:01.270> way<00:02:09.000> now<00:02:10.000> for<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.330> paint<00:02:10.540> tap<00:02:10.750> that

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
it's this way now for the paint tap that

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.340 
it's this way now for the paint tap that
going<00:02:11.200> like<00:02:11.380> that<00:02:13.019> but<00:02:14.019> yeah<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:17.170> basically

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
going like that but yeah so basically

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.110 
going like that but yeah so basically
those<00:02:17.890> are<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.250> speed<00:02:18.489> fees<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.910> will<00:02:19.000> work

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
those are the speed fees that will work

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.479 
those are the speed fees that will work
they<00:02:19.269> also<00:02:19.390> have<00:02:19.570> like<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.840> exalt<00:02:20.200> ones<00:02:20.489> which

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489
