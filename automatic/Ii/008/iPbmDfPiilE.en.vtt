00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.640
 let's talk a little about the symbol myself 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.269
 I think a lot of people have a 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.269
 incorrect preconception 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.139
 those who wear the belt who do not do weights 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.640
 they do not have a basis in bodybuilding 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.349
 who 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.320
 they simply want to become the 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.119
 show a clown those are the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.869
 people who would say that 99% that 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.869
 you are 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.120
 pursuing as the only ones who use the 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.720
 belt but the reality is that more than 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.680
 50% of the best bodybuilders in the world 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.450
 they are using muscleless without muscle 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.329
 when the cent is used in a way 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.210
 discreet obvious contact 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.789
 It is very effective the belt is not a 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.969
 hormone is not any type of steroid 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.820
 it is simply oil the reason that the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.140
 sintrom is legal in the USA and in many of 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.140
 the other countries of the world 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.350
 it's precisely because they sell it as a 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.600
 oil to pose or be an oil for 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.690
 the scenario not different from the many 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.300
 that are used today 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.190
 but nobody buys it to throw it in 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.380
 the skin does not buy everything to inject 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.200
 only to the muscles 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.680
 I think there is a question 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.009
 the belt clashes with classic bodybuilding 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.079
 from the oven age and even from the era 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.060
 of the 80's and even of the 90's and I 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.759
 I would say if it collides 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.620
 but if you tell me that the belt is 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.630
 for 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.220
 those who look terrible to the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.590
 idiots and for clowns because I have 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.380
 that disagree because it's not true 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.920
 I do not know if they are weak jay cutler use without 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.990
 ton I do not know if I fell ruinous symbol but 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.569
 you say yes I can within 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.960
 five of the world's best there can be one 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.700
 or up to two who use it 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.400
 I'm not making this video for 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.290
 promote the centor because the truth that 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.510
 I do not want to promote even the no-nonsense 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.340
 much less insulin and steroids 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.379
 not even from the creatine cta 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.709
 but if I do this video because I think that 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:15.800
 many of you truly want 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.690
 Learn more about bodybuilding and the belt 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.190
 it's so much apart from bodybuilding in the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.830
 present as is the dust of the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.830
 forgive me but it's the reality
