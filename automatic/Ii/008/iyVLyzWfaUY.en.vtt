00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hello everybody my name is Ivan fat and

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.510 
hello everybody my name is Ivan fat and
this<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.090> fascist<00:00:03.570> tactics<00:00:03.990> traffic<00:00:04.650> so<00:00:05.250> in

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
this is fascist tactics traffic so in

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.010 
this is fascist tactics traffic so in
this<00:00:05.640> video<00:00:05.879> I'll<00:00:06.060> be<00:00:06.089> showing<00:00:06.420> you<00:00:06.569> where<00:00:06.899> on

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
this video I'll be showing you where on

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.259 
this video I'll be showing you where on
the<00:00:07.140> map<00:00:07.259> has<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.740> fast<00:00:07.980> response<00:00:08.160> as<00:00:08.910> well<00:00:09.120> as

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
the map has the fast response as well as

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.240 
the map has the fast response as well as
going<00:00:09.450> more<00:00:09.630> in<00:00:09.719> depth<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.139> exactly<00:00:10.740> what<00:00:11.070> you

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
going more in depth of exactly what you

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.370 
going more in depth of exactly what you
should<00:00:11.280> do<00:00:11.580> pass<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.599> point<00:00:12.809> where<00:00:12.990> Regan's

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
should do pass the point where Regan's

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.189 
should do pass the point where Regan's
become<00:00:13.799> kind<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.340> useless<00:00:14.780> so<00:00:15.780> let's<00:00:16.080> get

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
become kind of useless so let's get

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.140 
become kind of useless so let's get
started<00:00:16.560> with<00:00:16.740> where<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.550> map<00:00:17.670> has<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
started with where on the map has the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.840 
started with where on the map has the
fastest<00:00:18.510> spots<00:00:18.750> well<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.369> front<00:00:20.699> of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
fastest spots well that is in front of

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.300 
fastest spots well that is in front of
the<00:00:20.970> farm<00:00:21.240> with<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.990> door<00:00:22.109> closed<00:00:22.500> if<00:00:23.100> you

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the farm with the door closed if you

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.429 
the farm with the door closed if you
leave<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.730> door<00:00:23.880> closed<00:00:24.210> there<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.660> only<00:00:24.900> five

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
leave the door closed there is only five

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.650 
leave the door closed there is only five
spawn<00:00:25.949> points<00:00:26.369> they're<00:00:26.849> all<00:00:26.939> very<00:00:27.210> close

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
spawn points they're all very close

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810 
spawn points they're all very close
together<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.039> see<00:00:29.250> right<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.580> they

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
together as you can see right here they

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.359 
together as you can see right here they
are<00:00:29.939> there<00:00:30.240> they're<00:00:30.689> there<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.410> two<00:00:31.980> right

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
are there they're there and two right

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.299 
are there they're there and two right
there<00:00:33.170> now<00:00:34.170> there<00:00:34.530> are<00:00:34.620> many<00:00:34.710> ways<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.100> after

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
there now there are many ways of after

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.889 
there now there are many ways of after
you<00:00:35.399> running<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.850> area<00:00:36.149> since<00:00:36.329> well<00:00:36.570> there's

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you running this area since well there's

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.750 
you running this area since well there's
so<00:00:37.170> much<00:00:37.380> room<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.800> work<00:00:38.040> with

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
so much room to work with

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
so much room to work with
but<00:00:39.300> here's<00:00:39.540> probably<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.110> safest<00:00:40.710> way<00:00:40.860> of

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
but here's probably the safest way of

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.500 
but here's probably the safest way of
doing<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.640> me<00:00:41.820> doing<00:00:42.000> cutbacks

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
doing it it's just me doing cutbacks

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.180 
doing it it's just me doing cutbacks
here<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.290> zombies<00:00:43.680> will<00:00:43.800> never<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.100> on

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
here because zombies will never be on

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
here because zombies will never be on
both<00:00:44.399> sides<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.210> can't<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.690> get

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
both sides of you you can't really get

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.229 
both sides of you you can't really get
trapped<00:00:46.340> anyways<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.370> really<00:00:47.700> want<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.120> talk

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
trapped anyways I really want to talk

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.040 
trapped anyways I really want to talk
about<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.500> spawn<00:00:49.860> speed<00:00:50.250> 40<00:00:50.760> plus<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.780> this

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
about is the spawn speed 40 plus in this

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.160 
about is the spawn speed 40 plus in this
game<00:00:52.289> they<00:00:52.590> changed<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> spawn<00:00:53.370> mechanics<00:00:53.550> of

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
game they changed the spawn mechanics of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.860 
game they changed the spawn mechanics of
the<00:00:55.170> zombies<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.149> old<00:00:57.300> game<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.690> black

the zombies so in the old game in black
ops<00:00:58.050> 1<00:00:58.289> zombies<00:00:59.100> would<00:00:59.430> be<00:01:00.210> kind<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.600> random

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
ops 1 zombies would be kind of random

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.439 
ops 1 zombies would be kind of random
purport<00:01:01.469> if<00:01:01.649> their<00:01:01.829> ground<00:01:02.100> spawners

purport if their ground spawners
sometimes<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.629> would<00:01:03.780> come<00:01:03.960> really<00:01:04.110> fast

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
sometimes they would come really fast

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.109 
sometimes they would come really fast
sometimes<00:01:04.710> I'd<00:01:05.070> go<00:01:05.189> really<00:01:05.489> they've<00:01:05.700> kind<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
sometimes I'd go really they've kind of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.450 
sometimes I'd go really they've kind of
gone<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.479> slow<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:07.979> quite<00:01:08.130> round

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
gone really slow like it was quite round

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.700 
gone really slow like it was quite round
no<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:09.090> good<00:01:09.510> example<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.290> no<00:01:10.530> one's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
no a good example of this is no one's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.440 
no a good example of this is no one's
eye<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.130> I'm<00:01:11.250> sure<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.970> guys<00:01:12.270> have

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
eye so I'm sure if all you guys have

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.950 
eye so I'm sure if all you guys have
noticed<00:01:12.799> anyways<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:14.010> about<00:01:14.310> 40<00:01:14.700> plus<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.720> can

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
noticed anyways at about 40 plus you can

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.499 
noticed anyways at about 40 plus you can
get<00:01:16.200> full<00:01:16.590> hordes<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.189> zombies<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.700> about<00:01:18.119> ten

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
get full hordes of zombies in about ten

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.620 
get full hordes of zombies in about ten
seconds<00:01:19.020> which<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.770> faster<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.670> anywhere<00:01:21.330> on

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
seconds which is faster and anywhere on

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.590 
seconds which is faster and anywhere on
black<00:01:21.840> ops<00:01:22.049> 1<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.460> imagine<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> had<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
black ops 1 so just imagine if you had a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.870 
black ops 1 so just imagine if you had a
thundergun<00:01:25.080> using<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.680> strategy<00:01:26.220> that

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
thundergun using this strategy that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.390 
thundergun using this strategy that
would<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.150> insane<00:01:27.840> now<00:01:28.590> let's<00:01:28.920> move<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.220> to

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
would be insane now let's move on to

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.890 
would be insane now let's move on to
what<00:01:29.640> has<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:29.970> done<00:01:30.030> once<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.600> run<00:01:30.810> an

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
what has to be done once you run an

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.749 
what has to be done once you run an
animal<00:01:31.350> instead<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.070> trading<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.490> Raygun

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
animal instead of trading in the Raygun

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.880 
animal instead of trading in the Raygun
like<00:01:32.970> yeah<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.509> every<00:01:33.960> other<00:01:33.990> map<00:01:34.409> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
like yeah you and every other map you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.950 
like yeah you and every other map you
can<00:01:35.040> actually<00:01:35.250> use<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.880> jet<00:01:36.060> gun<00:01:36.240> instantly

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
can actually use the jet gun instantly

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.710 
can actually use the jet gun instantly
and<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.500> mean<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.829> truly<00:01:38.220> infant<00:01:38.939> Lee<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.479> use

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and I mean it truly infant Lee you use

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.350 
and I mean it truly infant Lee you use
the<00:01:39.900> jet<00:01:40.110> gun<00:01:40.259> trick<00:01:40.650> exploit<00:01:41.340> or<00:01:41.549> well<00:01:41.729> glitch

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.170 
the jet gun trick exploit or well glitch
you<00:01:43.110> can<00:01:43.320> kill<00:01:43.530> three<00:01:43.860> zombies<00:01:44.310> without<00:01:44.640> using

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you can kill three zombies without using

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.270 
you can kill three zombies without using
any<00:01:45.360> charge<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.470> done<00:01:46.740> properly

any charge if done properly

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.630 
any charge if done properly
so<00:01:48.240> using<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.290> properly<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.950> coffees<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so using this properly in coffees and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.210 
so using this properly in coffees and
kill<00:01:50.850> three<00:01:51.119> zombies<00:01:51.360> every<00:01:51.869> 2.5<00:01:52.560> seconds

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
kill three zombies every 2.5 seconds

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.120 
kill three zombies every 2.5 seconds
which<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.579> about<00:01:53.869> 24<00:01:54.869> zombies<00:01:55.320> every<00:01:55.619> 20

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
which is about 24 zombies every 20

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.330 
which is about 24 zombies every 20
seconds<00:01:56.579> forever<00:01:57.469> this<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.649> about<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.159> same

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
seconds forever this is about the same

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.609 
seconds forever this is about the same

but<00:02:09.920> what<00:02:10.489> if<00:02:10.519> I<00:02:10.670> told<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.599> technically

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
but what if I told you that technically

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.820 
but what if I told you that technically
isn't<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.860> fastest<00:02:13.310> way<00:02:13.430> of<00:02:13.459> playing<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.060> map

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
isn't the fastest way of playing the map

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.199 
isn't the fastest way of playing the map
technically<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.310> fastest<00:02:16.760> way<00:02:16.879> of<00:02:16.910> playing

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
technically the fastest way of playing

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.390 
technically the fastest way of playing
the<00:02:17.330> map<00:02:17.480> would<00:02:17.720> be<00:02:17.810> using<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.620> trap<00:02:19.010> glitch

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
the map would be using the trap glitch

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.300 
the map would be using the trap glitch
instead<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:19.970> jet<00:02:20.269> gun<00:02:20.540> glitch<00:02:20.840> but<00:02:21.800> as<00:02:22.010> I'm

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
instead of a jet gun glitch but as I'm

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.699 
instead of a jet gun glitch but as I'm
sure<00:02:22.340> most<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:23.060> would<00:02:23.239> agree<00:02:23.599> that<00:02:24.019> this

sure most you would agree that this

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.199 
sure most you would agree that this

jet gun trick which whatever to be legit
which<00:02:38.569> does<00:02:38.900> make<00:02:39.140> sense<00:02:39.470> since<00:02:39.769> well<00:02:40.099> you

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
which does make sense since well you

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.009 
which does make sense since well you
still<00:02:40.580> have<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.730> train<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.360> can't<00:02:41.660> just<00:02:41.840> go<00:02:41.989> up

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
still have to train you can't just go up

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.319 
still have to train you can't just go up
kay<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.890> really<00:02:43.040> just<00:02:43.400> all<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:43.940> does<00:02:44.120> is

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
kay and it really just all it does is

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.350 
kay and it really just all it does is
speed<00:02:44.720> up<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.200> game<00:02:45.610> but<00:02:46.610> if<00:02:46.849> that's<00:02:47.180> your

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
speed up the game but if that's your

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.920 
speed up the game but if that's your
attitude<00:02:47.510> about<00:02:47.989> glitch<00:02:49.329> well<00:02:50.329> then<00:02:50.510> what<00:02:50.720> if

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
attitude about glitch well then what if

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.380 
attitude about glitch well then what if
you<00:02:51.079> use<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.709> trap<00:02:52.220> glitch<00:02:52.489> with<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:53.030> jetting

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
you use a trap glitch with the jetting

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.990 
you use a trap glitch with the jetting
glitch<00:02:53.630> would<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.769> be<00:02:55.099> the<00:02:55.250> true<00:02:55.489> fastest

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
glitch would that be the true fastest

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.539 
glitch would that be the true fastest
tactic<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.660> personally<00:02:57.620> wouldn't<00:02:57.950> say<00:02:58.130> so

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
tactic I personally wouldn't say so

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.280 
tactic I personally wouldn't say so
but<00:02:58.730> if<00:02:58.849> we<00:02:59.090> have<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.239> community<00:02:59.720> I've<00:02:59.930> already

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
but if we have a community I've already

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.440 
but if we have a community I've already
said<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.739> this<00:03:01.069> one<00:03:01.340> glitch<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.849> fine<00:03:02.060> use

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
said that this one glitch is fine use

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.559 
said that this one glitch is fine use
where<00:03:03.079> is<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.319> line<00:03:03.560> what<00:03:04.340> really<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.880> what

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
where is the line what really is what

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.110 
where is the line what really is what
really<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:06.079> legit<00:03:06.560> in<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:07.370> game<00:03:07.549> that<00:03:07.790> all<00:03:08.000> you

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
really is legit in the game that all you

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.400 
really is legit in the game that all you
have<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.329> do<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.630> look<00:03:08.780> at<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.019> ground<00:03:09.260> with

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
have to do is look at the ground with

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.740 
have to do is look at the ground with
sally's<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.130> you<00:03:10.340> have<00:03:10.519> godmode<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.660> a

sally's and you have godmode that is a

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.090 
sally's and you have godmode that is a
very<00:03:12.019> hard<00:03:12.290> question<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.739> answer

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
very hard question to answer

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.470 
very hard question to answer
and<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:13.609> is<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.850> reason<00:03:14.090> I'm<00:03:14.209> making<00:03:14.299> this

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
and that is the reason I'm making this

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.110 
and that is the reason I'm making this
video<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.340> posing<00:03:16.340> this<00:03:16.489> question<00:03:16.609> to<00:03:16.970> you

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
video and posing this question to you

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.319 
video and posing this question to you
what<00:03:17.930> is<00:03:18.019> your<00:03:18.049> opinion<00:03:18.609> my<00:03:19.609> opinion<00:03:19.639> is<00:03:20.299> that

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
what is your opinion my opinion is that

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.240 
what is your opinion my opinion is that
this<00:03:20.600> game<00:03:20.810> has<00:03:20.959> way<00:03:21.230> too<00:03:21.260> many<00:03:21.500> problems<00:03:21.859> I

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
this game has way too many problems I

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.580 
this game has way too many problems I
mean<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.910> negatives<00:03:23.389> outweigh<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.900> positive

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
mean the negatives outweigh the positive

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.759 
mean the negatives outweigh the positive
by<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.040> lot<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.870> one<00:03:27.049> thing<00:03:27.230> I<00:03:27.350> did<00:03:27.530> like<00:03:27.709> about

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
by a lot the one thing I did like about

by a lot the one thing I did like about

this map the one real map we got transit

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.920 
this map the one real map we got transit

pretty<00:03:36.350> much<00:03:36.440> had<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.769> go<00:03:36.950> chord<00:03:37.220> by<00:03:37.370> chord<00:03:37.840> in

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
pretty much had to go chord by chord in

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.780 
pretty much had to go chord by chord in
any<00:03:39.019> strategy<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:39.889> didn't<00:03:40.130> involve<00:03:40.370> traps

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
any strategy that didn't involve traps

any strategy that didn't involve traps
in<00:03:41.299> this<00:03:41.510> game<00:03:41.810> you're<00:03:42.380> using<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:43.220> jet<00:03:43.519> gun

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
in this game you're using the jet gun

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.610 
in this game you're using the jet gun
glide<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.060> can<00:03:44.540> kill<00:03:44.780> three<00:03:45.109> zombies<00:03:45.470> at<00:03:45.560> a

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
glide you can kill three zombies at a

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.220 
glide you can kill three zombies at a
time<00:03:45.829> constantly<00:03:46.790> which<00:03:47.420> actually<00:03:47.900> makes<00:03:48.049> it

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
time constantly which actually makes it

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.949 
time constantly which actually makes it
kind<00:03:48.709> of<00:03:48.799> fun<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.120> mean<00:03:50.299> in<00:03:50.450> front<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:50.810> the

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
kind of fun and I mean in front of the

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.099 
kind of fun and I mean in front of the
farm<00:03:51.620> is<00:03:51.829> probably<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:52.880> largest<00:03:53.090> area<00:03:53.930> that

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
farm is probably the largest area that

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.250 
farm is probably the largest area that
ever<00:03:54.349> made<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.859> training<00:03:55.359> but<00:03:56.359> it's<00:03:56.810> actually

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
ever made to training but it's actually

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.110 
ever made to training but it's actually
kind<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:57.650> necessary<00:03:58.010> if<00:03:58.459> you're<00:03:58.609> using<00:03:58.849> the

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
kind of necessary if you're using the

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.770 
kind of necessary if you're using the
Czech<00:03:59.299> gun<00:03:59.450> in<00:03:59.569> this<00:03:59.750> way<00:04:00.670> so<00:04:01.670> without<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.569> jet

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
Czech gun in this way so without the jet

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.159 
Czech gun in this way so without the jet
gun<00:04:02.959> glitch<00:04:03.230> I<00:04:03.530> would<00:04:04.040> personally<00:04:04.840> not<00:04:05.840> like

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
gun glitch I would personally not like

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.259 
gun glitch I would personally not like
transit<00:04:06.680> at<00:04:06.829> all<00:04:07.040> I<00:04:07.250> would<00:04:07.430> not<00:04:07.609> play<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:08.030> for

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
transit at all I would not play it for

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.409 
transit at all I would not play it for
high<00:04:08.419> rounds<00:04:08.840> but<00:04:09.590> with<00:04:09.859> it<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:11.209> maps

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
high rounds but with it the maps

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.809 
high rounds but with it the maps
actually<00:04:11.750> pretty<00:04:12.290> fun<00:04:12.500> to<00:04:12.680> play<00:04:12.859> and<00:04:13.130> well

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
actually pretty fun to play and well
