comparison review between the QB the
cube<00:00:08.990> u30gt2<00:00:10.099> quad-core<00:00:11.099> tablet<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:12.620> the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
cube u30gt2 quad-core tablet and the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.730 
cube u30gt2 quad-core tablet and the
IBEX<00:00:14.009> flytouch<00:00:14.250> 10<00:00:15.139> was<00:00:16.139> pretty<00:00:16.350> much<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.500> tie

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
IBEX flytouch 10 was pretty much a tie

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.580 
IBEX flytouch 10 was pretty much a tie
the<00:00:16.800> cube<00:00:17.279> was<00:00:18.240> faster<00:00:18.750> I'm<00:00:19.380> rendering

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
the cube was faster I'm rendering

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.560 
the cube was faster I'm rendering
certain<00:00:20.070> websites<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> over<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.359> broad

the overseas websites so right now you
want<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:28.580> see<00:00:29.580> which<00:00:31.309> we<00:00:32.309> have<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> Prime

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
want to just see which we have the Prime

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.090 
want to just see which we have the Prime
LP<00:00:33.030> 9<00:00:33.120> x<00:00:33.360> over<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:34.950> want

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
LP 9 x over here on the right so we want

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.290 
LP 9 x over here on the right so we want
to<00:00:35.130> see<00:00:35.250> which<00:00:35.370> one<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.670> faster<00:00:37.160> so<00:00:41.120> let's<00:00:42.120> go

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
to see which one is faster so let's go

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.479 
to see which one is faster so let's go
to<00:00:47.420> we<00:00:48.420> want<00:00:49.020> I'm<00:00:49.350> trying<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.980> site

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to we want I'm trying to think of a site

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.689 
to we want I'm trying to think of a site
that's<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.820> blocked<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.360> China<00:00:52.100> so<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.550> go

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that's not blocked in China so we can go

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:05.439 
that's not blocked in China so we can go
to

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.929 

yeah<00:01:06.259> okay<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:06.590> let's<00:01:06.829> go<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:06.979> a<00:01:07.189> steeper<00:01:07.549> calm

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
yeah okay so let's go to a steeper calm

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:31.220 
yeah okay so let's go to a steeper calm
it's<00:01:08.149> like<00:01:08.299> a<00:01:08.329> a<00:01:09.009> translating<00:01:10.009> side<00:01:10.250> acebo<00:01:16.420> com

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.630 

okay<00:01:32.230> so<00:01:32.290> we'll<00:01:32.590> see<00:01:32.770> which<00:01:32.920> one<00:01:33.130> is<00:01:33.250> faster

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
okay so we'll see which one is faster

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.940 
okay so we'll see which one is faster
that<00:01:33.880> on<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.660> Left<00:01:34.870> we<00:01:34.990> have<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.170> cube<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:35.770> on

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
that on the Left we have the cube and on

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.040 
that on the Left we have the cube and on
the<00:01:36.070> right<00:01:36.280> we<00:01:36.310> have<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.610> primal<00:01:36.940> p<00:01:37.060> 9<00:01:37.210> X<00:01:37.420> 1<00:01:37.810> 2<00:01:38.020> 3

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
the right we have the primal p 9 X 1 2 3

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.280 
the right we have the primal p 9 X 1 2 3
go<00:01:41.580> wow<00:01:42.580> so<00:01:42.970> it<00:01:43.090> looks<00:01:43.120> like<00:01:43.300> that<00:01:43.480> primal<00:01:43.840> 12

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
go wow so it looks like that primal 12

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:58.140 
go wow so it looks like that primal 12
spy<00:01:44.500> here<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.930> sea<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.380> TMZ<00:01:50.710> is<00:01:52.860> DMZ<00:01:56.790> top<00:01:57.790> is

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.180 

Wow<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.950> primal<00:02:24.340> p<00:02:24.520> 9<00:02:24.700> x<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.540> uh<00:02:26.130> looks<00:02:27.130> like

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
Wow the primal p 9 x is uh looks like

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.830 
Wow the primal p 9 x is uh looks like
it's<00:02:27.400> faster<00:02:27.850> than<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.120> cube<00:02:28.770> u30gt2<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.660> this

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
it's faster than the cube u30gt2 so this

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.370 
it's faster than the cube u30gt2 so this
is<00:02:31.870> running<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.590> samsung<00:02:33.660> shyness<00:02:34.660> 4412

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
see we'll try one more site you can go

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:22.130 
see we'll try one more site you can go
to<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:15.360> can<00:03:15.390> go<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.720> deals<00:03:16.020> prime<00:03:16.380> calm<00:03:21.140> the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
to you can go to deals prime calm the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.290 
to you can go to deals prime calm the
one<00:03:22.319> thing<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.400> cube<00:03:23.790> we<00:03:24.090> already

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
one thing is that the cube we already

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.270 
one thing is that the cube we already
went<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.380> site<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:25.980> it's<00:03:26.100> probably

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
went to that site so it's probably

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
went to that site so it's probably
cashed<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:28.020> FC<00:03:28.290> it's<00:03:28.410> cash<00:03:28.680> there<00:03:32.300> but

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
cashed the FC it's cash there but

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.699 
cashed the FC it's cash there but
actually<00:03:33.540> we<00:03:33.810> can<00:03:33.959> go<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.110> deals<00:03:34.320> prime<00:03:34.560> dot

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
actually we can go to deals prime dot

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.660 
actually we can go to deals prime dot
net<00:03:34.980> as<00:03:35.220> that's<00:03:35.970> our<00:03:36.360> old<00:03:37.220> server<00:03:38.220> we've

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
net as that's our old server we've

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.449 
net as that's our old server we've
updated<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.239> server<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:41.040> we<00:03:41.130> can<00:03:41.250> check<00:03:41.400> that

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
updated the server so we can check that

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:56.890 
updated the server so we can check that
out<00:03:41.640> deals<00:03:42.209> Prime<00:03:42.540> net

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.160 

okay<00:03:57.709> so<00:03:58.400> we<00:03:59.180> will<00:03:59.299> check<00:03:59.480> out<00:03:59.569> deals<00:03:59.870> prime

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
okay so we will check out deals prime

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
okay so we will check out deals prime
net<00:04:00.680> one<00:04:01.670> two<00:04:01.849> three<00:04:01.879> go

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:22.670 

ok<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.540> promo<00:04:15.870> p90x<00:04:16.470> is<00:04:16.910> faster<00:04:21.680> you're

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
ok so the promo p90x is faster you're

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.370 
ok so the promo p90x is faster you're
the<00:04:22.800> icons<00:04:23.130> on<00:04:23.310> on<00:04:23.520> are<00:04:23.730> not<00:04:24.090> these<00:04:24.810> categories

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
the icons on on are not these categories

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.940 
the icons on on are not these categories
they<00:04:25.800> aren't<00:04:26.010> showing<00:04:26.250> up<00:04:26.520> properly<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:27.950> but

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
they aren't showing up properly so but

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.540 
they aren't showing up properly so but
