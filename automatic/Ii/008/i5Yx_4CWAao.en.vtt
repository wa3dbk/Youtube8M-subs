the visual client and its feature set so

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.180 
the visual client and its feature set so
far<00:00:07.820> i'm<00:00:08.820> just<00:00:09.090> using<00:00:09.349> mock-up<00:00:10.349> art<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.889> stuff

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
far i'm just using mock-up art and stuff

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.549 
far i'm just using mock-up art and stuff
right<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:11.519> so<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:13.080> isn't<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.500> to

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
rendered on the compass right here so

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.779 
rendered on the compass right here so
you<00:00:25.680> got<00:00:25.830> north<00:00:27.019> east<00:00:28.019> south<00:00:28.380> west<00:00:28.769> up<00:00:29.340> down

you got north east south west up down

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.749 
you got north east south west up down
and<00:00:30.179> they're<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:30.929> representing<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.769> so

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and they're all representing here so

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.110 
and they're all representing here so
about<00:00:32.940> those<00:00:33.829> using<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> number<00:00:35.070> pad<00:00:35.430> angle

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
about those using the number pad angle

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.110 
about those using the number pad angle
south<00:00:37.100> there's<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.160> hooded<00:00:38.430> woman<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:38.940> this

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
there's a small board so every time you

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.430 
there's a small board so every time you
move<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.820> compass<00:00:57.270> changes<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:58.020> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
move the compass changes what it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.920 
move the compass changes what it
reflects<00:00:58.859> what<00:00:59.100> exits<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.670> available<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
reflects what exits are available and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.360 
reflects what exits are available and
I'm<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.350> make<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:02.010> click<00:01:02.160> on
