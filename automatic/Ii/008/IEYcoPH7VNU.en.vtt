you feel this was a challenge I decided
to<00:01:29.950> take<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.310> challenge<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:31.050> tried<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.230> Paleo

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
to take the challenge I tried the Paleo

so this is my challenge to you see if
the<00:01:46.360> Paleo<00:01:46.750> diet<00:01:47.080> works<00:01:47.500> for<00:01:47.800> you<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:50.140> theory

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
the Paleo diet works for you the theory

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.740 
the Paleo diet works for you the theory
behind<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:51.010> diet<00:01:51.250> is<00:01:51.550> that<00:01:51.820> stone<00:01:52.060> age<00:01:52.300> man<00:01:52.509> or

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
behind the diet is that stone age man or

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.080 
behind the diet is that stone age man or
caveman<00:01:53.290> ain't<00:01:53.800> mainly<00:01:54.400> what<00:01:54.580> he<00:01:54.700> could<00:01:54.880> hunt

he supplemented this animal protein with

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.760 
he supplemented this animal protein with
