00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
teeth number five favorite word and I

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.479 
teeth number five favorite word and I
guess<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:16.989> is<00:03:17.050> like<00:03:17.260> any<00:03:17.470> English<00:03:17.980> word<00:03:18.220> I

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
guess this is like any English word I

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.949 
guess this is like any English word I
couldn't<00:03:18.970> really<00:03:19.090> think<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.390> anything<00:03:19.600> but

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
couldn't really think of anything but

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.140 
couldn't really think of anything but
then<00:03:20.080> last<00:03:20.620> minute<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.130> thought<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.519> hullabaloo

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
then last minute I thought of hullabaloo

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.430 
then last minute I thought of hullabaloo
which<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.870> really<00:03:23.080> liked

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
which I really liked

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.900 
which I really liked
so<00:03:23.560> if<00:03:23.620> I<00:03:23.709> was<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:23.860> use<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.160> sentence<00:03:24.670> it

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
so if I was to use that sentence it

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.000 
so if I was to use that sentence it
would<00:03:25.000> be<00:03:25.269> what's<00:03:26.050> all<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.410> hullabaloo<00:03:26.620> over

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
would be what's all that hullabaloo over

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.750 
would be what's all that hullabaloo over
there

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
there

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.940 
there
so<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.480> think<00:03:28.630> that<00:03:28.930> means<00:03:29.110> like<00:03:29.290> like

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
so I think that means like like

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.520 
so I think that means like like
commotion<00:03:30.610> up<00:03:30.910> for<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.420> think<00:03:31.989> it's<00:03:32.260> a<00:03:32.320> funny
