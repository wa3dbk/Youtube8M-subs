00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
now is double click that file that you

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.660 
now is double click that file that you
made<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.799> it'll<00:03:23.610> open<00:03:23.790> up<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.209> command<00:03:24.720> window

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
made and it'll open up a command window

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.400 
made and it'll open up a command window
that's<00:03:26.670> going<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.180> start<00:03:27.780> displaying<00:03:28.080> some

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
that's going to start displaying some

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.770 
that's going to start displaying some
information<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.489> should<00:03:29.780> essentially

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
information and it should essentially

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.530 
information and it should essentially
start<00:03:31.230> mining<00:03:31.890> if<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.670> have<00:03:32.790> any<00:03:32.940> problems<00:03:33.390> it

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
start mining if you have any problems it

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.390 
start mining if you have any problems it
helps<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.900> kind<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.140> unplug<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.920> plug<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.370> back

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
helps to kind of unplug and plug it back

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.699 
helps to kind of unplug and plug it back
in<00:03:36.440> sometimes<00:03:38.570> as<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.870> ought<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:40.380> just<00:03:40.500> let<00:03:40.650> it

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
in sometimes as you ought to just let it

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:49.960 
in sometimes as you ought to just let it
run<00:03:40.860> through<00:03:41.130> here<00:03:41.340> for<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.610> minute

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.270 

and<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:50.840> believe<00:03:51.110> I<00:03:51.230> actually<00:03:51.380> unplugged<00:03:52.040> cuz

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
and I believe I actually unplugged cuz

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.830 
and I believe I actually unplugged cuz
mine<00:03:52.520> wasn't<00:03:52.940> working

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.559 

yeah<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.560> go<00:03:59.739> ahead<00:03:59.800> and<00:03:59.980> unplug<00:04:00.190> mine<00:04:00.569> close

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
yeah I go ahead and unplug mine close

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.570 
yeah I go ahead and unplug mine close

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
time it goes and it it starts working

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.470 
time it goes and it it starts working
right<00:04:11.950> away<00:04:12.040> as<00:04:12.340> you'll<00:04:12.940> see<00:04:13.120> here<00:04:13.330> in<00:04:13.420> a

right away as you'll see here in a
minute<00:04:23.280> once<00:04:24.280> you<00:04:24.400> get<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:24.610> going<00:04:24.639> it's<00:04:25.030> you

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
minute once you get it going it's you

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.940 
minute once you get it going it's you
know<00:04:25.419> it<00:04:25.570> does<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:25.930> all<00:04:26.020> on<00:04:26.050> its<00:04:26.290> own<00:04:26.410> but<00:04:26.710> again

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
know it does it all on its own but again

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.409 
know it does it all on its own but again
for<00:04:27.280> troubleshooting<00:04:27.580> all<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.060> can<00:04:28.210> recommend

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
for troubleshooting all I can recommend

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.320 
for troubleshooting all I can recommend
really<00:04:28.810> is<00:04:29.580> well<00:04:30.580> as<00:04:30.669> you<00:04:30.700> can<00:04:30.850> see<00:04:30.970> in<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.120> top

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
really is well as you can see in the top

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.530 
really is well as you can see in the top
left<00:04:31.780> corner<00:04:33.990> it's<00:04:34.990> getting<00:04:35.530> right<00:04:36.070> there<00:04:36.540> 1.6

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
left corner it's getting right there 1.6

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.240 
left corner it's getting right there 1.6
Giga<00:04:38.080> hash<00:04:38.229> it<00:04:38.410> kind<00:04:38.530> of<00:04:38.590> bounces<00:04:38.710> around<00:04:39.040> and

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
Giga hash it kind of bounces around and

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.230 
Giga hash it kind of bounces around and
goes<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.400> little<00:04:39.490> higher<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:39.910> a<00:04:39.940> little<00:04:39.970> bit

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
goes a little higher and a little bit

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.760 
goes a little higher and a little bit
lower<00:04:40.419> I<00:04:40.540> don't<00:04:40.810> know<00:04:40.870> if<00:04:41.050> it's<00:04:41.200> just<00:04:41.260> mine<00:04:41.560> if

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
lower I don't know if it's just mine if

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.560 
lower I don't know if it's just mine if
that's<00:04:41.919> how<00:04:42.100> they<00:04:42.220> are<00:04:42.370> but<00:04:43.240> as<00:04:43.300> you<00:04:43.389> can<00:04:43.510> see

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
that's how they are but as you can see

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.570 
that's how they are but as you can see
it<00:04:43.810> is<00:04:43.930> mining<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:45.040> for<00:04:45.220> any<00:04:45.400> any

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
it is mining and for any any

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.129 
it is mining and for any any
troubleshooting<00:04:46.120> techniques<00:04:46.419> I<00:04:46.630> have<00:04:46.780> is<00:04:46.990> to

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
troubleshooting techniques I have is to

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.740 
troubleshooting techniques I have is to
go<00:04:47.260> ahead<00:04:47.350> and<00:04:47.590> use<00:04:47.680> that<00:04:47.710> zag<00:04:48.700> or<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.450> the

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
go ahead and use that zag or the the

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.629 
go ahead and use that zag or the the
program<00:04:50.410> that<00:04:50.710> you<00:04:50.830> reinstall<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.400> driver

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
program that you reinstall the driver

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.030 
program that you reinstall the driver
you<00:04:51.880> might<00:04:52.030> want<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:52.300> click<00:04:52.479> that<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:53.740> just

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
you might want to click that and just

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.650 
you might want to click that and just
try<00:04:54.220> unplugging<00:04:54.430> and<00:04:54.910> plugging<00:04:54.970> in<00:04:55.479> the<00:04:55.510> a

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
try unplugging and plugging in the a

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.629 
try unplugging and plugging in the a
minor<00:04:56.139> that<00:04:56.440> usually<00:04:56.770> will<00:04:56.889> fix<00:04:57.130> any<00:04:57.280> problem

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
minor that usually will fix any problem

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.129 
minor that usually will fix any problem
that<00:04:57.669> you're<00:04:57.850> gonna<00:04:57.970> have<00:04:58.150> but<00:04:58.450> hopefully

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
that you're gonna have but hopefully
