00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.040
 hello dear friends 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.790
 Victoria people 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.790
 therefore the author of this 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.259
 which is called 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.460
 what have I tried here 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.770
 I tried to imagine years 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.550
 ten 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.919
 present the most basic 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.029
 the simplest very initial stage 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.460
 stations who counted start every 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.539
 Chinese 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.539
 that is, it is hidden stas piha ports 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.170
 with plain more 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.170
 and the most basic thing then what 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.940
 will give you the opportunity 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.260
 learn by yourself 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.040
 continue 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.120
 this is what any chinese starts 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.190
 if you first took the trouble 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.040
 while this is what you need 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.530
 if you already know something 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.750
 Tuva and I am already working 2 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.890
 new program us current course where 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.280
 to be continued 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.380
 significant dwell here 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.400
 in this disc europe 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.140
 on all 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.470
 but let's say it is equal to two three months 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.260
 live learning 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.270
 work you need to try need 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.560
 I tried to work 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.720
 maximum of all this 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.180
 to make it clear what was available 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.850
 but for example someone plays with one finger 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.850
 think that they are already playing 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.330
 if ship searches 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.060
 then there is no about the harvest among polish 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.060
 that is, it can be replaced 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.790
 we will introduce 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.790
 to make 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.210
 also politician 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.270
 rollerblading win revenue is about it 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.010
 see a huge difference 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.810
 leaflets saying no finger 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.520
 and this is already professional 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.760
 let's say the game tricks 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.830
 and I wish good luck 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.000
 I hope that everything is clear to you 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.970
 and that you will please your friends 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.289
 your loved ones however will not happen yours 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.019
 dream 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.559
 I hope so 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:13.299
 not saying goodbye
