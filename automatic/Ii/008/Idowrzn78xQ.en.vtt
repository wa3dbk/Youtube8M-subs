have right now in and this is 14 does it
focus<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:11.360> don't<00:02:12.360> know<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.780> can

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
focus I don't know but you can

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.710 
focus I don't know but you can
we<00:02:13.680> see<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.040> difference<00:02:14.190> definitely<00:02:15.090> can<00:02:15.300> can

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
we see the difference definitely can can

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.890 
we see the difference definitely can can
tell<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.050> oh<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.560> go<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:17.400> here<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.120> what<00:02:18.870> I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
tell it oh here you go so here is what I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.960 
tell it oh here you go so here is what I
go<00:02:19.170> for<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.709> seems<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.310> bit<00:02:20.430> bigger<00:02:20.670> because

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
go for it seems a bit bigger because

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.589 
go for it seems a bit bigger because
this<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:21.690> exactly<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.349> same<00:02:22.590> type<00:02:22.860> of

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
this is not exactly the same type of

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.220 
this is not exactly the same type of
stretcher<00:02:24.599> this<00:02:24.870> one<00:02:25.110> but<00:02:25.260> well<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:27.030> first<00:02:27.959> off

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
stretcher this one but well so first off

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.070 
stretcher this one but well so first off
you<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.620> need<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.950> clean<00:02:29.299> the<00:02:30.299> plugs<00:02:30.569> or

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
you just need to clean the plugs or

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.830 
you just need to clean the plugs or
tunnels<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.920> will<00:02:32.129> use<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.940> use<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.690> method

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
tunnels you will use to use that method

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.750 
tunnels you will use to use that method
so<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.739> clean<00:02:35.340> them<00:02:35.549> all<00:02:35.849> clean<00:02:36.690> yay<00:02:37.489> so<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.519> will

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
so I clean them all clean yay so I will

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.130 
so I clean them all clean yay so I will
use<00:02:39.060> up<00:02:39.390> oops<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.030> will<00:02:42.269> use<00:02:42.510> these<00:02:42.690> tunnels

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
use up oops so I will use these tunnels

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.370 
use up oops so I will use these tunnels
there<00:02:44.040> are<00:02:44.160> screw<00:02:44.519> on<00:02:44.640> tunnels<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.390> prefer

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
there are screw on tunnels I prefer

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.180 
there are screw on tunnels I prefer
using<00:02:46.590> strong<00:02:47.250> tunnels<00:02:47.730> for<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.209> method<00:02:48.450> I

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
using strong tunnels for that method I

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.410 
using strong tunnels for that method I
think<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.310> goes<00:02:50.750> easier<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:53.310> yeah<00:02:53.670> here<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.269> it

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
think it goes easier so yeah here is it

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.650 
think it goes easier so yeah here is it
it<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.840> without<00:02:55.140> this<00:02:55.470> crew<00:02:56.150> no<00:02:57.150> don't<00:02:57.450> focus

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
takes it you can put three layers at a

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.599 
takes it you can put three layers at a
time<00:03:18.079> to<00:03:19.079> stretch<00:03:19.319> up<00:03:19.470> your<00:03:19.650> ears<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.340> after

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.920 

one<00:04:08.230> layer

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.940 

two<00:04:12.799> layers<00:04:13.099> hahaha<00:04:13.939> so<00:04:14.269> I<00:04:14.450> will<00:04:14.659> cut<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.650> part

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
two layers hahaha so I will cut the part

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.870 
two layers hahaha so I will cut the part
that<00:04:16.160> I<00:04:16.190> don't<00:04:16.340> want<00:04:17.169> today<00:04:18.370> so<00:04:19.370> try<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.609> make
