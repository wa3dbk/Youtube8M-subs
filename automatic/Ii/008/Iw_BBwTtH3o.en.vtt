00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
pipe system that sounds a little better

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.900

so<00:00:19.080> without<00:00:19.740> further<00:00:19.800> ado<00:00:20.310> I'll<00:00:20.460> just<00:00:20.670> walk

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
so without further ado I'll just walk

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.220 
so without further ado I'll just walk
you<00:00:20.939> through<00:00:21.300> real<00:00:21.449> quick<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.869> look<00:00:22.020> at<00:00:22.140> each

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
plant rather quickly and you can see

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.689 
plant rather quickly and you can see
kind<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> how<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.689> working<00:00:25.460> I've<00:00:26.460> had<00:00:26.580> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
kind of how it's working I've had to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.910 
kind of how it's working I've had to
raise<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> lights<00:00:27.359> several<00:00:28.349> notches<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.890> the

raise the lights several notches on the
chain<00:00:29.220> over<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> last<00:00:29.789> few<00:00:30.029> days<00:00:30.439> the

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
chain over the last few days the

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.380 
chain over the last few days the
radishes<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.219> peas<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.700> course<00:00:33.000> very

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.170 
fast-growing plants they're going nuts
so<00:00:37.129> had<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.160> raise<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.640> light<00:00:38.820> several

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
so had to raise the light several

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.770 
so had to raise the light several
notches<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.750> I'll<00:00:40.170> show<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.559> those<00:00:40.860> now<00:00:41.780> ok

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
notches and I'll show you those now ok

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.889 
notches and I'll show you those now ok

here's brussel sprouts you can see
they're<00:00:52.949> getting<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:53.399> an<00:00:53.550> inch<00:00:53.640> high

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879

radish<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.899> going<00:00:55.170> crazy<00:00:56.059> that's<00:00:57.059> cool<00:00:57.360> Robbie

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
radish is going crazy that's cool Robbie

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.979 
radish is going crazy that's cool Robbie
it's<00:00:58.199> doing<00:00:58.440> well<00:00:59.359> it's<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.840> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it's doing well it's that we have the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.700 
it's doing well it's that we have the
lettuce<00:01:01.379> leaf<00:01:01.890> lettuce

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.469 

and<00:01:04.920> next<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.120> colored

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
and next to that we have the colored

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.789 
and next to that we have the colored
green<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.020> I'll<00:01:07.140> probably<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.530> adjust

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
green so I'll probably have to adjust

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.080 
green so I'll probably have to adjust

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
that drip a little bit looks like it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.730 
that drip a little bit looks like it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.120 
highest plan I've got right now it's
really<00:01:15.900> doing<00:01:16.320> well<00:01:16.490> as<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.060> sweet<00:01:18.330> basil

light<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.399> can<00:01:41.550> barely<00:01:41.759> see<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
light you can barely see it because the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.370 
light you can barely see it because the
lighting<00:01:43.700> right<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:48.929> just<00:01:49.050> on<00:01:49.350> a

one here on my tube system zoom it out
there<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.899> go<00:02:10.079> that's<00:02:10.350> my<00:02:10.649> air<00:02:11.310> pump<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.820> keep

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
there you go that's my air pump to keep

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.579 
there you go that's my air pump to keep
it<00:02:12.120> aerated<00:02:12.540> underneath<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.340> that's<00:02:14.340> it
