00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 short yesterday cÃ©line we lived a meeting 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.069
 irrational but it was so good 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.870
 and for that we have to really thank 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.460
 both teams and suddenly philippe 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.960
 saint-andrÃ© we say but why 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.950
 have waited for the last match for 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.770
 finally loosen the brake 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.779
 arnaud took a long time I was slow 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.820
 believe she also wants the victory 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.160
 the victory in italy in a context 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.920
 difficult did a lot of good to 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.380
 players and I believe that we really they 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.910
 are invested are completely let go 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.669
 even sometimes a little too much because 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.500
 finally 2 at the end of the first half 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.719
 keep the balloon for 3 minutes and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.809
 we guaranteed and after we take a test 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.100
 80 meters and that's a shame because 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.430
 I think there was some way 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.640
 to do better especially 40 we lead 15 to 7 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.180
 we can go to 18.7 and go to 21 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.300
 7 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.660
 so things are going to have to 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.370
 improve on the in the following of 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.230
 the adventured you who registered the essay 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.109
 of the twickenham century you have experienced it 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.870
 how does this nakaitaci essay that offers 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.489
 this balloon to vincent debaty in 1 in 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.490
 a match but complete I said 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.619
 deglingo yes but here it is a match 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.770
 exceptional but what is this 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.520
 great especially for vincent debaty it's 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.159
 that he is not used to being 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.860
 holder and there is the 60th minute in 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.200
 a match with a lot of intensity and 20 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.880
 kg and the tools is 120 kg and it is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.549
 he is in support after a run of 80 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.860
 meters but we can see that 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.340
 now the rugby of the international 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.079
 high performance rugby was 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.310
 enormously enormously 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.710
 activity and that's why it takes 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.689
 that we go even further and that will be 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.960
 in the preparation of this cup of 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.429
 world 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.990
 in any case this corner succeeds well to 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.640
 french what we remember two years ago 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.229
 years dies wesley fofana a little bit 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.240
 in the same configuration were giving 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.560
 so in the same angle madam body 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.359
 in the same body is in the same 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.880
 body is not remembered with a little bit 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.560
 more recoil because there was 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.909
 wrong to find words to qualify this 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.619
 match how do you analyze a little bit 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.119
 this meeting we went through all 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.609
 the emotions but is this really a 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.500
 surprise to see enterprising blue 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.299
 it's probably going to be for them for the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.759
 english that seem to me were not 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.410
 prepared to see the blues play on on 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.180
 the widths go get these width 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.790
 and iron with really great 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.920
 technical quality no doubt that the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.560
 blue had been prepared had to 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.450
 exploit this corridor of 15 meters on 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.680
 saw it on the previous action with a 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.780
 Agatha if seen their investments 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.220
 also fronts with guirado which is 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.840
 decisive for this winger's try 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.489
 French I think these are 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.200
 actions that leave very very mean which 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.030
 stands out a bit of this pragmatism 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.410
 this idea also to occupy the ground 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.900
 by the footwork we've seen since the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.180
 start of the tournament and that too to get 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.150
 fun it's a comment that have 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.389
 pick up the players after the match 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.709
 this tight defense of the English was a 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.859
 been in default at certain times 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.200
 of course we have to stress 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:03:00.130
 the unacceptable gaps at this level 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.169
 especially success at the foot when our 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.810
 scorers are less than 50% successful 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:06.099
 on this match ford the young half 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.560
 English opening we have them 9 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.510
 out of 10 so that does not bring any margin 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.739
 maneuver to the team in the game and 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.840
 that unfortunately takes us away from 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.120
 best for the moment philippe raphaÃ«l 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.669
 spoke of pragmatism and speaks he speaks 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.370
 very well and is so much better yes and 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:23.109
 he was going he was right first one magnifying 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.639
 15.15 kicks and after 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.530
 we have good strikers because I 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.700
 say it's a good scorer camille 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.040
 lopez is a good scorer 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.530
 but in matches at this intensity 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.849
 it lacks lucidity about fatigue and 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.359
 then in addition they are trying 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.700
 learn 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.139
 we work for we work for the 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.790
 next we will say the closest 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.470
 for the next coach because 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.269
 I believe that what must not be forgotten 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.380
 is that we have a young 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.350
 generation of players 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.640
 against against English 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.950
 the English are much more comfortable 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.680
 with the ball in defense so we 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.420
 had really focused on the fact of the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.250
 conservation because we knew that if 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.750
 we kept the balloon we find and we 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.070
 was going to find solutions on the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.290
 wide philippe road which is a 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.000
 pragmatic you have built a team 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.290
 with a solid defense a solid 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.570
 conquest is this match 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.430
 it is likely to change a little bit 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.960
 your dashboard your sheet of 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.240
 road because there were 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.850
 offensive ambitions here but yes there is 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.520
 offensive ambitions but also I 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.560
 believe is that work two of his 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.300
 players of his of his young players who 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.860
 for two and a half years three years 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.190
 discover the very high level 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.590
 we are better physically we are better 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.740
 technically we have players who 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.780
 really start to know each other 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.670
 intensity the high level and it starts 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.170
 to be simpler but it's like in 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.000
 the beautiful houses first you have to build 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.590
 good foundations and after you have to 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.080
 to go further and you have to go more 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.600
 far like this game there to twickenham by 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.430
 against we must lose this year 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.230
 against Scotland and we lose against 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.880
 Scotland names come the costs in 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.590
 Wales shelling Italy but we lose 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.570
 against Wales against 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.730
 ireland and england and our stats 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.160
 at the foot we are not even at 50% 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.410
 we can not win games very 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.220
 high level 46 on small details 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.750
 when we talked about the fact you 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.050
 add three more people in the 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.900
 staff 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.400
 yeah but one of the areas on which we 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.880
 already has in Roman Teulet who 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.590
 arrive and who is working hard on a 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.210
 great job he is with us in 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.640
 permanently he goes to the clubs but he 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.040
 must also know that clubs have 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.260
 many now specialists 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.360
 camille work with someone 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.580
 clearly I too at the stadium 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.220
 French and so we have a connection between 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.420
 between his personal coaches and the coach 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.560
 of the French rugby federation 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.050
 in any case philippe this match will remain 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.520
 obviously in the story and the day 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.510
 also was just as stunning 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.650
 three matches 27 and his 221 weights and at 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.650
 the end is ireland wins
