00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
and home commitments I did actually

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.850 
and home commitments I did actually
several<00:01:53.549> courses<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.390> they<00:01:54.659> were<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:55.710> think

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
several courses and they were I think

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.889 
several courses and they were I think
four<00:01:56.399> weeks<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:57.060> little<00:01:57.360> more<00:01:57.509> than<00:01:57.540> four<00:01:57.869> weeks

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
four weeks a little more than four weeks

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.410 
four weeks a little more than four weeks
and<00:01:58.759> I<00:01:59.759> spent<00:02:01.670> approximately

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
and I spent approximately

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.249 
and I spent approximately
five<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.729> seven<00:02:05.729> hours<00:02:05.850> per<00:02:06.360> week<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:06.990> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
five to seven hours per week but it

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.100 
five to seven hours per week but it
varied<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.220> topics<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.149> how<00:02:09.599> secure<00:02:10.020> I

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
varied on the topics and how secure I

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.229 
varied on the topics and how secure I
felt<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> topics<00:02:11.280> how<00:02:11.520> much<00:02:11.730> reading<00:02:12.120> I

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
felt in the topics how much reading I

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.040 
felt in the topics how much reading I
had<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.540> do<00:02:12.690> around<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.540> varied<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.660> bit<00:02:15.870> I

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
had to do around it so it varied a bit I

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.630 
had to do around it so it varied a bit I
would<00:02:16.410> recommend<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:17.069> online<00:02:17.340> courses

and<00:03:38.190> for<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.519> they<00:03:38.760> need<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:39.090> headset<00:03:39.859> and<00:03:40.859> a

good sound card and other than that they

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
for that and that's all I'm figuring to

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.240 
for that and that's all I'm figuring to
me<00:03:48.200> they've<00:03:49.200> changed<00:03:49.470> over<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.859> years<00:03:50.160> I

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
me they've changed over the years I

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.710 
me they've changed over the years I
think<00:03:50.579> because<00:03:50.700> we've<00:03:51.030> been<00:03:51.060> able<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.450> keep

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
think because we've been able to keep

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.069 
think because we've been able to keep
pace<00:03:52.079> with<00:03:52.109> new<00:03:52.890> technology<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:54.079> nowadays

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
pace with new technology and nowadays

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.800 
pace with new technology and nowadays
there's<00:03:55.620> quite<00:03:55.859> an<00:03:55.980> emphasis<00:03:56.519> on<00:03:56.810> various

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
there's quite an emphasis on various

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.870 
there's quite an emphasis on various
kinds<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.260> applications<00:03:58.440> as<00:03:59.069> well<00:03:59.100> as<00:03:59.370> social

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
kinds of applications as well as social

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.490 
kinds of applications as well as social
software<00:04:00.239> applications<00:04:01.049> they're<00:04:01.290> all<00:04:01.410> the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
software applications they're all the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.920 
software applications they're all the
different<00:04:01.799> kinds<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.130> media<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.450> think<00:04:03.750> for

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
different kinds of media so I think for

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.970 
different kinds of media so I think for
the<00:04:04.079> online<00:04:04.230> courses<00:04:04.829> particularly<00:04:05.700> make

the online courses particularly make

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.940 
the online courses particularly make

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
news of podcasts has also helped to

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.449 
news of podcasts has also helped to
ensure<00:04:09.760> that<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:10.720> tutor<00:04:11.200> is<00:04:11.560> present<00:04:12.190> all<00:04:12.340> the

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
ensure that the tutor is present all the

participants<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.880> think<00:04:48.880> what's<00:04:49.060> distinctive

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
participants I think what's distinctive

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.629 
participants I think what's distinctive
about<00:04:49.780> acs<00:04:50.260> or<00:04:50.410> these<00:04:50.560> online<00:04:50.710> courses<00:04:51.130> is

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
about acs or these online courses is

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.939 
about acs or these online courses is
their<00:04:52.030> activity<00:04:53.020> based<00:04:53.229> rather<00:04:53.650> than

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
their activity based rather than

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.340 
their activity based rather than
content-based<00:04:54.610> so<00:04:55.449> the<00:04:55.600> participants<00:04:56.139> have

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
content-based so the participants have

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.500 
content-based so the participants have
to<00:04:56.500> do<00:04:56.740> things<00:04:57.100> every<00:04:57.580> week<00:04:57.820> that<00:04:58.150> they're<00:04:58.300> on

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
to do things every week that they're on

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.290 
to do things every week that they're on
an<00:04:58.690> online<00:04:58.840> course<00:04:59.350> they're<00:05:00.300> intensively

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
an online course they're intensively

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.360 
an online course they're intensively
tutored<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.289> the<00:05:02.500> participants<00:05:02.949> don't<00:05:03.220> feel

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
tutored so the participants don't feel

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.279 
tutored so the participants don't feel
that<00:05:03.490> they're<00:05:03.669> left<00:05:03.880> alone<00:05:04.060> at<00:05:04.539> any<00:05:04.720> time<00:05:05.020> and

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
that they're left alone at any time and

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.200 
that they're left alone at any time and
they're<00:05:06.220> based<00:05:06.460> on<00:05:06.699> principles<00:05:07.120> of

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
they're based on principles of

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.610 
they're based on principles of
collaborative<00:05:07.539> learning<00:05:07.870> so<00:05:08.320> they<00:05:08.440> get<00:05:08.560> to

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
collaborative learning so they get to

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.020 
collaborative learning so they get to
work<00:05:08.860> with<00:05:08.889> other<00:05:09.220> people<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.789> produce

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
work with other people to produce

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.839 
work with other people to produce
something<00:05:10.510> that's<00:05:10.810> meaningful<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.349> them<00:05:11.700> if<00:05:12.700> I

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
something that's meaningful to them if I

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.400 
something that's meaningful to them if I
started<00:05:13.210> off<00:05:13.330> as<00:05:13.450> a<00:05:13.479> participant<00:05:13.900> on<00:05:14.289> the

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
started off as a participant on the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
on that course and also on the

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.240 
on that course and also on the
reflective<00:05:19.360> learning<00:05:19.539> I<00:05:20.349> think<00:05:21.070> that<00:05:21.099> was

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
reflective learning I think that was

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.430 
reflective learning I think that was
really<00:05:21.460> important<00:05:21.910> because<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.720> got<00:05:23.200> a<00:05:23.229> real

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
really important because I got a real

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.529 
really important because I got a real
feel<00:05:23.740> for<00:05:23.770> what<00:05:24.610> it's<00:05:24.639> like<00:05:24.820> to<00:05:25.180> follow<00:05:25.360> the
