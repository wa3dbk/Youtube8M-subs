00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.920
 and 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.779
 hi friends, how are you? 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.250
 the best and welcome gentlemen to a 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.099
 new minecraft video in which they 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.590
 I bring how to make a barrel of 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.360
 decoration then good regulation what 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.770
 only I need in version 1.8 for 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.660
 what then because they have we are using 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.239
 these these new doors are not 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.040
 express 2 that obviously in versions 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.680
 previous are not then so 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.050
 they would see something like that the barrels and then if 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.120
 you see them a little bit far away they really 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.860
 they look pretty good especially for 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.480
 put them do not give any kind of union 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.670
 in a cave and it's out there in a 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.969
 little house and we all know that the barrels 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.249
 dock very well with many things in 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.780
 almost all games everywhere 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:55.329
 there are barrels that you have to break for 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.999
 take out things and decoration are very 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.890
 nice then well we are going to open them 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:01.749
 these kegs and we can save what 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.540
 that we want inside because the 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.880
 chest not and the idea then is this is not 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.650
 a very simple idea, however, that 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.479
 Well, I do not think everyone is 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.040
 it would happen then then 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.810
 teach how to make the kegs 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.690
 beautiful good we need first the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.670
 wood is the long tribes we are the 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.640
 door of the same type and you need 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.170
 what would be the step and a chest 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.759
 obviously the chest is optional 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.229
 but I say to keep something 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.149
 inside for storage 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.820
 it looks very good then nothing has 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.670
 that being a little hole in the earth puts 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.799
 in what would be his first first board 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.450
 they put it what would be the chest go up 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.600
 to the chest and they give you what you click 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.789
 right to hong kong to each of the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.100
 sides to which it is pointing 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.409
 Mr. chest then we went out what 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.789
 we open we bend over because if we 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.500
 we bend down they're going to open the door no 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.850
 then he does not want to open the door what 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.470
 what he wants to do is crouch 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.960
 right with the step so that it 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.600
 place and then cover the barrel 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.659
 then absolutely it is totally 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.490
 covered looks very good ie it combines 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.649
 quite how can you see the lines of 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.860
 the door go according to the lines 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.799
 of the east plank and it fits very well 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.410
 right now they sported a few examples of how 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.959
 you can use then here we are like in a 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.459
 zone as well as little beach and then as 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.769
 can see the gentlemen fit very well 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.510
 barrelitos I only think they would be as 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.110
 better a little better if you can 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.040
 make smaller 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.300
 and I say what else you can ask is very good 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.710
 here we are a video train station 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.990
 that looks more like they change is 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.640
 giving in darker areas then 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.010
 We have two barrels and this side 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.810
 we have two other barrels if we 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.240
 we are seeing in this way we can 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.590
 see that the sister cndh is dancing 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.570
 well, practically this would be all nothing 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.670
 more is like a little way to decorate 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.990
 for those who did not know and then nothing 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.000
 remember that we need everything that 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.860
 was being spruce wood and in 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.720
 Spanish gentlemen and therefore a little box 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.940
 then it's not great science it 's very 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.220
 simple and well I also have one of 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.720
 how to make umbrellas like that for the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.209
 beach that will later bring us 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.800
 gentlemen and also some mosquitoes that already 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.090
 I have prepared see you until the 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.670
 next video if you liked how 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.470
 you see leave a like and favorites all that 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.480
 kind of things comment know what is 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.160
 it happened to them because you have a fungus 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.330
 you can not even handle these 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.330
 flowers are the poor floating 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.840
 car
