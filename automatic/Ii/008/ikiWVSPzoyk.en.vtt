00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
this part right here so as you can see I

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.319 
this part right here so as you can see I
just<00:04:18.260> layered<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:18.919> with<00:04:18.949> some<00:04:19.370> black<00:04:19.669> basil

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
just layered it with some black basil

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.680 
just layered it with some black basil
cardstock<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.520> then<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.699> box<00:04:22.910> opens<00:04:23.419> up<00:04:23.540> like

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
cardstock and then the box opens up like

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.170 
cardstock and then the box opens up like
this<00:04:23.900> so<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.110> slides<00:04:24.560> it<00:04:25.130> tucks<00:04:25.430> inside<00:04:25.850> the

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
this so it slides it tucks inside the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.560 
this so it slides it tucks inside the
sides<00:04:26.449> there<00:04:27.580> so<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:28.699> just<00:04:28.880> have<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.150> lift<00:04:29.360> it

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
sides there so you just have to lift it

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.920 
sides there so you just have to lift it
up<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:30.280> then<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.310> also<00:04:31.520> put<00:04:31.910> one<00:04:32.210> in<00:04:32.449> them<00:04:32.630> in

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930

the<00:04:33.139> inside<00:04:33.500> of<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.710> box<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.419> then<00:04:35.419> that's

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
the inside of the box and then that's

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.750 
the inside of the box and then that's
where<00:04:35.900> I<00:04:35.930> would<00:04:36.139> put<00:04:36.169> my<00:04:36.470> mom's<00:04:36.919> ornament<00:04:37.550> I
