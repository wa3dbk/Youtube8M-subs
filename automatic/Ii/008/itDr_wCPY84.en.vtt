liking my videos even though lately

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.149 
liking my videos even though lately
we've<00:01:41.850> had<00:01:41.880> some<00:01:42.509> trouble<00:01:43.110> with<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.439> mass

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
we've had some trouble with a mass

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.800 
we've had some trouble with a mass
disliking<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.149> think<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.720> over

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
disliking but I think that's all over

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.410 
disliking but I think that's all over
now<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.790> hope<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
now and I really really do hope that the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.080 
now and I really really do hope that the
fighting<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:49.140> over<00:01:49.500> no<00:01:50.070> more<00:01:50.250> drama<00:01:50.490> because

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
fighting is over no more drama because

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.840 
fighting is over no more drama because
honestly<00:01:52.100> it's<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.280> annoying<00:01:54.350> but<00:01:55.350> yeah

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.520

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
I've tried settling things out and

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.900 
I've tried settling things out and
hopefully<00:02:00.010> it<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.250> because<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.550> don't<00:02:00.700> want<00:02:00.820> to

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
hopefully it is because I don't want to
