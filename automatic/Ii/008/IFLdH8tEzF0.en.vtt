on<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> ps4<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.979> lot<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.400> newer<00:01:35.610> titles

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
on the ps4 but a lot of the newer titles

on the ps4 but a lot of the newer titles
that<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.299> would<00:01:36.420> normally<00:01:36.540> play<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.930> consoles<00:01:37.500> I

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that I would normally play on consoles I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.950 
that I would normally play on consoles I
would<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.070> rather<00:01:38.310> play<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> PC<00:01:39.570> anyway

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
would just rather play on a PC anyway

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.510 
would just rather play on a PC anyway
what<00:01:40.290> effect<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> upcoming

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
what effect do you think the upcoming

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.550 
what effect do you think the upcoming
DirectX<00:01:42.060> 12<00:01:42.240> will<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.020> regards<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
DirectX 12 will have is regards to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.660 
DirectX 12 will have is regards to
gaming<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> Xbox<00:01:44.430> one

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
gaming on the Xbox one

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.550 
gaming on the Xbox one
I<00:01:44.939> think<00:01:45.450> DirectX<00:01:45.840> 12<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.439> be<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
I think DirectX 12 is going to be a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.410 
I think DirectX 12 is going to be a
pretty<00:01:46.829> big<00:01:47.040> deal<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> PC<00:01:47.850> side<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.210> things

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
pretty big deal on the PC side of things

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.389 
pretty big deal on the PC side of things
however<00:01:49.229> I'm<00:01:49.290> not<00:01:49.409> quite<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.890> convinced<00:01:50.310> on

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
however I'm not quite so convinced on

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.969 
however I'm not quite so convinced on
the<00:01:50.490> Xbox<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.570> right<00:01:51.720> now<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> Xbox<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.619> uses

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the Xbox so right now the Xbox one uses

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.010 
the Xbox so right now the Xbox one uses
a<00:01:53.009> modified<00:01:53.549> version<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.970> DirectX<00:01:54.360> 11<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
a modified version of DirectX 11 and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.380 
a modified version of DirectX 11 and
while<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> lot<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.549> things<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.880> DirectX<00:01:57.210> 12

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
while a lot of the things in DirectX 12

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.270 
while a lot of the things in DirectX 12
are<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.140> focused<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.710> being<00:01:58.950> able<00:01:59.040> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
are going to be focused on being able to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.859 
are going to be focused on being able to
better<00:01:59.520> optimize<00:01:59.729> for<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.420> hardware<00:02:00.630> you've

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
better optimize for the hardware you've

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.569 
better optimize for the hardware you've
got<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.649> for<00:02:01.770> example<00:02:02.070> taking<00:02:02.399> better

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
got so for example taking better

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.760 
got so for example taking better
advantage<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:03.180> multiple<00:02:03.659> CPU<00:02:04.140> cores<00:02:04.439> which

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
advantage of multiple CPU cores which

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.889 
advantage of multiple CPU cores which
the<00:02:05.070> consoles<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> lot<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.540> well<00:02:06.750> as

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
the consoles have a lot of as well as

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:07.999 
the consoles have a lot of as well as
you<00:02:07.020> know<00:02:07.110> being<00:02:07.290> able<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.469> tinker<00:02:07.770> out<00:02:07.890> with

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
you know being able to tinker out with

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.100 
you know being able to tinker out with
memory<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.310> whatnot<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:08.879> one<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> things

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
memory and whatnot but one of the things

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.910 
memory and whatnot but one of the things
is<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.440> that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
is is that

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.559 
is is that
consoles<00:02:11.310> live<00:02:11.400> kind<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.700> always<00:02:12.120> had<00:02:12.360> that

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
consoles live kind of always had that

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.660 
consoles live kind of always had that
ability<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.680> don't<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> massive

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
ability so I don't see a massive

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.610 
ability so I don't see a massive
improvement<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.690> Xbox<00:02:16.050> one<00:02:16.260> as<00:02:16.380> far<00:02:16.500> as

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
improvement to the Xbox one as far as

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.860 
improvement to the Xbox one as far as
performance<00:02:17.099> with<00:02:17.250> DirectX<00:02:17.640> 12<00:02:17.760> will<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.750> be<00:02:18.840> a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
performance with DirectX 12 will it be a

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.479 
performance with DirectX 12 will it be a
little<00:02:19.050> bit<00:02:19.140> easier<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.620> get<00:02:20.099> at<00:02:20.310> that

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
little bit easier to get at that

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.059 
little bit easier to get at that
performance<00:02:20.910> by<00:02:21.120> developers<00:02:21.690> probably<00:02:22.530> will

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
performance by developers probably will

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.920 
performance by developers probably will
we<00:02:23.280> see<00:02:23.520> some<00:02:23.819> minor<00:02:24.239> performance<00:02:24.720> games

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
we see some minor performance games

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.559 
we see some minor performance games
probably<00:02:25.890> but<00:02:26.580> will<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.910> be<00:02:27.060> able<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.239> catch<00:02:27.540> up

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
probably but will it be able to catch up

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.360 
probably but will it be able to catch up
with<00:02:27.720> something<00:02:28.050> like<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> ps4<00:02:28.830> with<00:02:29.069> purely

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
with something like the ps4 with purely

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.670 
with something like the ps4 with purely
a<00:02:29.459> software<00:02:29.850> update<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.420> doubt<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.080> has<00:02:31.500> your

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
a software update I doubt it has your

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.990 
a software update I doubt it has your
channel<00:02:32.010> ever<00:02:32.160> helped<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.550> in<00:02:32.700> getting<00:02:32.880> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
channel ever helped you in getting a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.930 
channel ever helped you in getting a
girlfriend<00:02:36.860> do<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.950> think<00:02:38.160> curved<00:02:38.430> edges<00:02:38.640> on

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
girlfriend do you think curved edges on

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.309 
girlfriend do you think curved edges on
phones<00:02:39.209> will<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.630> thing<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.050> future

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
phones will be a thing in future

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.900 
phones will be a thing in future
flagships<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:41.069> do<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.340> consider<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.819> a

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
flagships or do you consider it a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.410 
flagships or do you consider it a
gimmick

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
gimmick

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.330 
gimmick
so<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.780> original<00:02:42.870> curved<00:02:43.410> phones<00:02:43.769> like<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
so the original curved phones like the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.150 
so the original curved phones like the
LG<00:02:44.700> G<00:02:44.940> flex<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.510> Samsung<00:02:46.019> Galaxy<00:02:46.380> round<00:02:46.620> or<00:02:47.100> a

LG G flex and Samsung Galaxy round or a

LG G flex and Samsung Galaxy round or a
very<00:02:47.730> very<00:02:48.090> dim<00:02:48.360> icky<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.650> remember<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.069> G

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
very very dim icky so I remember the G

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.729 
very very dim icky so I remember the G
flex<00:02:50.430> especially<00:02:50.910> had<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.480> really<00:02:52.080> cool<00:02:52.290> curved

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
flex especially had a really cool curved

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.800 
flex especially had a really cool curved
screen<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.400> looked<00:02:53.640> nice<00:02:53.880> but<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.540> wasn't

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
screen it looked nice but it wasn't

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.380 
screen it looked nice but it wasn't
particularly<00:02:55.080> practical<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.880> quality

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
particularly practical and the quality

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.880 
particularly practical and the quality
of<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.660> screen<00:02:57.900> was<00:02:58.019> not<00:02:58.200> all<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.650> great

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
of the screen was not all that great

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.970 
of the screen was not all that great
however<00:02:59.580> with<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.090> Galaxy<00:03:00.450> s6<00:03:00.750> edge<00:03:01.049> all

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
however with the Galaxy s6 edge all

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.740 
however with the Galaxy s6 edge all
those<00:03:02.340> misconceptions<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:03.120> had<00:03:03.299> about<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.660> as

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
those misconceptions I had about it as

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.270 
those misconceptions I had about it as
far<00:03:03.930> as<00:03:04.019> trying<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.440> first<00:03:04.680> generation<00:03:04.830> are

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
far as trying that first generation are

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.100 
far as trying that first generation are
completely<00:03:05.730> gone<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.630> think<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.900> big<00:03:07.080> thing

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
completely gone so I think the big thing

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.600 
completely gone so I think the big thing
is<00:03:07.260> we've<00:03:07.709> all<00:03:07.890> been<00:03:08.010> staring<00:03:08.310> at<00:03:08.370> flat

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
is we've all been staring at flat

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.190 
is we've all been staring at flat
screens<00:03:08.970> forever<00:03:09.600> basically

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
screens forever basically

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.620 
screens forever basically
now<00:03:10.680> with<00:03:11.160> just<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.430> little<00:03:11.610> tiny<00:03:11.970> taper<00:03:12.390> on<00:03:12.600> the

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
now with just a little tiny taper on the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.240 
now with just a little tiny taper on the
edge<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.230> mean<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.500> screen<00:03:13.709> still<00:03:13.890> functions

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
edge I mean the screen still functions

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.319 
edge I mean the screen still functions
exactly<00:03:14.640> like<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.910> would<00:03:15.000> normally<00:03:15.299> expect

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
exactly like you would normally expect

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.360 
exactly like you would normally expect
just<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.230> be<00:03:16.350> able<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.560> play<00:03:16.769> with<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.010> galaxy

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
just to be able to play with the galaxy

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.759 
just to be able to play with the galaxy
s6<00:03:17.640> edge<00:03:17.850> hurdle<00:03:18.180> up<00:03:18.269> about<00:03:18.359> an<00:03:18.510> hour<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:19.079> I<00:03:19.320> was

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
s6 edge hurdle up about an hour so I was

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.560 
s6 edge hurdle up about an hour so I was
immediately<00:03:20.070> sold<00:03:20.579> on<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:21.239> fact<00:03:21.269> in

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
immediately sold on that and in fact in

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.640 
immediately sold on that and in fact in
my<00:03:21.690> opinion<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:22.170> almost<00:03:22.350> seems<00:03:22.560> like

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
my opinion it almost seems like

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.349 
my opinion it almost seems like
Samsung's<00:03:23.250> playing<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:23.700> safe<00:03:23.880> by<00:03:24.120> even

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
Samsung's playing it safe by even

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.150 
Samsung's playing it safe by even
bothering<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.870> make<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.019> normal<00:03:25.230> galaxy<00:03:25.769> s6<00:03:25.980> at

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
bothering to make a normal galaxy s6 at

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.310 
bothering to make a normal galaxy s6 at
all<00:03:26.280> big<00:03:27.000> thumbs<00:03:27.299> up<00:03:27.450> for<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.720> curved<00:03:27.900> displays

what<00:03:29.130> are<00:03:29.220> your<00:03:29.340> thoughts<00:03:29.579> on<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.940> new

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
what are your thoughts on the new

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.569 
what are your thoughts on the new
MacBook<00:03:30.269> 12-inch<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.829> new<00:03:31.950> MacBook<00:03:32.340> looks

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
MacBook 12-inch so the new MacBook looks

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.920 
MacBook 12-inch so the new MacBook looks
really<00:03:33.109> really<00:03:34.130> really<00:03:35.130> cool<00:03:35.519> now<00:03:36.269> if<00:03:36.720> that

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
really really really cool now if that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.599 
really really really cool now if that
was<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.200> only<00:03:37.230> thing<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.799> consider<00:03:38.190> then<00:03:38.459> yeah

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
was the only thing to consider then yeah

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:39.920 
was the only thing to consider then yeah
everyone<00:03:39.060> should<00:03:39.180> just<00:03:39.209> go<00:03:39.359> buy<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> MacBook

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
everyone should just go buy a MacBook

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.009 
everyone should just go buy a MacBook
however<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:40.769> not<00:03:40.950> quite<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.340> simple<00:03:41.579> so<00:03:42.570> on

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
however it's not quite that simple so on

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.330 
however it's not quite that simple so on
one<00:03:43.320> hand<00:03:43.350> we're<00:03:43.769> talking<00:03:44.010> about<00:03:44.100> something

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
one hand we're talking about something

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.580 
one hand we're talking about something
that's<00:03:44.459> not<00:03:44.790> tremendously<00:03:45.720> powerful<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.530> mean

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
that's not tremendously powerful I mean

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.410 
that's not tremendously powerful I mean
we're<00:03:47.010> talking<00:03:47.070> about<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.340> 5<00:03:47.670> watt<00:03:47.940> 4<00:03:48.269> M

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
we're talking about a 5 watt 4 M

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.840 
we're talking about a 5 watt 4 M
processor<00:03:49.019> that's<00:03:49.739> about<00:03:50.190> what<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.519> lot<00:03:50.790> of

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
processor that's about what a lot of

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.640 
processor that's about what a lot of
like<00:03:51.060> higher<00:03:51.359> and<00:03:51.570> tablets<00:03:52.049> need<00:03:52.260> as<00:03:52.380> far<00:03:52.410> as

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
like higher and tablets need as far as

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.220 
like higher and tablets need as far as
what<00:03:53.040> so<00:03:53.459> it's<00:03:54.030> not<00:03:54.239> gonna<00:03:54.420> be<00:03:54.510> massively

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
what so it's not gonna be massively

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.170 
what so it's not gonna be massively
powerful<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.980> think<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.400> should<00:03:56.579> probably<00:03:56.819> fall

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
powerful I think it should probably fall

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.120 
powerful I think it should probably fall
a<00:03:57.209> little<00:03:57.390> bit<00:03:57.569> behind<00:03:57.690> like<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.130> current

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
a little bit behind like a current

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.979 
a little bit behind like a current
MacBook<00:03:59.579> Air<00:03:59.819> which<00:04:00.030> isn't<00:04:00.180> terrible<00:04:00.750> for<00:04:00.959> a

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
MacBook Air which isn't terrible for a

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.330 
MacBook Air which isn't terrible for a
lot<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.200> things<00:04:01.350> it's<00:04:01.470> going<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.709> be<00:04:01.769> fine<00:04:02.010> but

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
lot of things it's going to be fine but

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.890 
lot of things it's going to be fine but
I<00:04:02.579> think<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.180> biggest<00:04:03.359> problem<00:04:03.540> for<00:04:03.840> me

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
I think the biggest problem for me

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.449 
I think the biggest problem for me
though<00:04:04.170> is<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.500> fact<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.829> it<00:04:05.100> only<00:04:05.220> has<00:04:05.430> one

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
though is the fact that it only has one

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.539 
though is the fact that it only has one
port<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.150> mean<00:04:06.480> yeah<00:04:06.870> sure<00:04:07.170> USB<00:04:07.590> see<00:04:07.829> is<00:04:08.010> if

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
port I mean yeah sure USB see is if

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:09.800 
port I mean yeah sure USB see is if
you're<00:04:08.730> gonna<00:04:08.910> put<00:04:09.120> one<00:04:09.150> port<00:04:09.510> on<00:04:09.569> a<00:04:09.630> laptop

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
you're gonna put one port on a laptop

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.569 
you're gonna put one port on a laptop
that's<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.590> way<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.739> go<00:04:10.980> when<00:04:11.370> you're<00:04:11.489> getting

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
that's the way to go when you're getting

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.180 
that's the way to go when you're getting
power<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:12.569> can<00:04:12.720> put<00:04:13.019> like<00:04:13.200> DisplayPort<00:04:14.010> and

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
power you can put like DisplayPort and

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.310 
power you can put like DisplayPort and
HDMI<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.850> USB<00:04:15.269> there's<00:04:15.840> all<00:04:15.959> kinds<00:04:16.200> of<00:04:16.260> things

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
HDMI and USB there's all kinds of things

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.880 
HDMI and USB there's all kinds of things
that<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.739> can<00:04:16.859> adapt<00:04:17.160> off<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.850> USB<00:04:18.570> C<00:04:18.989> but<00:04:19.650> you

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
that you can adapt off of USB C but you

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.800 
that you can adapt off of USB C but you
have<00:04:20.039> to<00:04:20.130> buy<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.519> ton<00:04:20.970> of<00:04:21.030> adapters<00:04:21.479> to<00:04:21.510> do

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
have to buy a ton of adapters to do

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.590 
have to buy a ton of adapters to do
almost<00:04:22.140> everything

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
almost everything

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.420 
almost everything
just<00:04:24.020> think<00:04:24.200> about<00:04:24.230> something<00:04:24.380> like<00:04:24.680> if<00:04:25.250> I

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
just think about something like if I

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.580 
just think about something like if I
want<00:04:25.610> to<00:04:25.670> edit<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.910> video<00:04:26.030> on<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:26.600> I've<00:04:27.050> got<00:04:27.350> to

to<00:04:31.100> get<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.250> USB<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:32.240> USB<00:04:32.420> C<00:04:32.930> adapter<00:04:33.350> like<00:04:33.860> I'm

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
to get a USB to USB C adapter like I'm

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.350

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.800 
adapters just to use this super thin
laptop<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:37.880> I<00:04:38.090> don't<00:04:38.270> think<00:04:38.390> it's<00:04:38.540> a<00:04:38.630> really

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
laptop so I don't think it's a really

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.500 
laptop so I don't think it's a really
good<00:04:38.930> fit<00:04:39.140> for<00:04:39.170> me<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:40.250> might<00:04:40.820> be<00:04:40.880> better<00:04:41.270> if

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
good fit for me it might be better if

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.820 
good fit for me it might be better if
you're<00:04:41.660> like<00:04:41.930> maybe<00:04:42.110> I<00:04:42.230> can<00:04:42.380> writer<00:04:42.590> or

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.410 
you're like maybe I can writer or
student<00:04:43.220> or<00:04:43.400> someone<00:04:43.820> who<00:04:43.970> really<00:04:44.120> doesn't

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
student or someone who really doesn't

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.970 
student or someone who really doesn't
need<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.690> use<00:04:44.990> lots<00:04:45.170> of<00:04:45.260> like<00:04:45.380> adapters<00:04:45.830> and

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980

need to use lots of like adapters and
stuff<00:04:46.160> all<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.430> time<00:04:46.640> but<00:04:47.060> uh<00:04:47.120> it<00:04:48.110> looks<00:04:48.350> cool

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.250 
try but I can't say I'm super excited
about<00:04:52.460> it<00:04:52.610> why<00:04:53.180> haven't<00:04:53.510> you<00:04:53.600> done<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:53.960> asked

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
about it why haven't you done and asked

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.140 
about it why haven't you done and asked
me<00:04:54.380> for<00:04:54.410> so<00:04:54.740> long<00:04:54.920> so<00:04:55.280> what<00:04:55.730> you<00:04:55.820> used<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.000> do

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
me for so long so what you used to do

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.670 
me for so long so what you used to do
these<00:04:56.300> once<00:04:56.540> a<00:04:56.690> month<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.170> I<00:04:57.290> felt<00:04:57.530> like<00:04:57.620> that

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
these once a month and I felt like that

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.740 
these once a month and I felt like that
was<00:04:57.920> a<00:04:57.950> good<00:04:58.190> balance<00:04:58.340> however<00:04:58.940> I<00:04:59.390> started

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
was a good balance however I started

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.210 
was a good balance however I started
having<00:04:59.960> fun<00:05:00.170> with<00:05:00.350> them<00:05:00.470> doing<00:05:00.650> like<00:05:00.890> skits

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
having fun with them doing like skits

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.530 
having fun with them doing like skits
and<00:05:01.340> stuff<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:01.820> I<00:05:01.940> made<00:05:02.120> them<00:05:02.210> once<00:05:02.420> a<00:05:02.510> week

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
and stuff and I made them once a week

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.380 
and stuff and I made them once a week
and<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.680> got<00:05:04.010> difficult<00:05:04.280> not<00:05:04.790> only<00:05:04.970> to<00:05:05.150> be<00:05:05.300> able

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
and it got difficult not only to be able

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.660 
and it got difficult not only to be able
to<00:05:05.510> kind<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.170> keep<00:05:06.680> interesting<00:05:07.220> questions

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
to kind of keep interesting questions

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.130 
to kind of keep interesting questions
every<00:05:07.910> week<00:05:07.940> but<00:05:08.360> just<00:05:08.390> to<00:05:08.630> be<00:05:08.720> able<00:05:08.780> to<00:05:08.870> spend

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
every week but just to be able to spend

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.960 
every week but just to be able to spend
that<00:05:09.230> much<00:05:09.380> time<00:05:09.410> I<00:05:09.710> mean<00:05:10.070> it<00:05:10.490> was<00:05:10.610> fitting

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
that much time I mean it was fitting

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.390 
that much time I mean it was fitting
like<00:05:11.090> two<00:05:11.540> days<00:05:11.810> on<00:05:12.290> a<00:05:12.320> lot<00:05:12.560> of<00:05:12.620> ESPYs

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400

before<00:05:13.700> I<00:05:13.730> stopped<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.300> that<00:05:14.780> just<00:05:14.960> kind<00:05:15.110> of

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
before I stopped and that just kind of

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.420 
before I stopped and that just kind of
kept<00:05:15.350> me<00:05:15.470> from<00:05:15.590> making<00:05:15.710> a<00:05:15.920> lot<00:05:16.070> of<00:05:16.100> the<00:05:16.190> videos
