against LeBron James Dwyane Wade and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.049 
against LeBron James Dwyane Wade and
Chris<00:01:00.090> Bosh<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.840> phenomenal<00:01:01.410> bitch<00:01:01.649> play

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
Chris Bosh in that phenomenal bitch play

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.850 
Chris Bosh in that phenomenal bitch play
with<00:01:03.059> Ray<00:01:03.390> Allen<00:01:03.750> coming<00:01:03.930> off<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.320> bench<00:01:04.530> I

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
with Ray Allen coming off the bench I

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.530 
with Ray Allen coming off the bench I
think<00:01:05.129> Shane<00:01:05.339> Battier<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.270> back

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
think Shane Battier is going to be back

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.800 
think Shane Battier is going to be back
then<00:01:07.290> they<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.220> slew<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.240> guys<00:01:09.510> like

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
then they have a slew of other guys like

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
then they have a slew of other guys like
Mike<00:01:10.049> Miller<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.680> James<00:01:10.950> Jones<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.760> can

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
Mike Miller and James Jones that can

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.750 
Mike Miller and James Jones that can
come<00:01:12.060> out<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.689> them<00:01:12.810> some<00:01:13.020> extra

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
come out there and get them some extra

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.249

hot<00:01:16.470> stuff<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:16.979> too<00:01:17.340> much<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
hot stuff it's just too much for the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.560 
hot stuff it's just too much for the
Milwaukee<00:01:19.049> Bucks<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.520> series<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.270> think

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
Milwaukee Bucks in this series I think

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.770 
Milwaukee Bucks in this series I think
um<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.580> Bucks<00:01:23.580> kind<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.030> match<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.479> well<00:01:24.750> with

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
um the Bucks kind of match up well with

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.230 
um the Bucks kind of match up well with
their<00:01:25.140> length<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:26.340> against<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> Miami

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
their length going against the Miami

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.499 
their length going against the Miami
Heat<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.470> some<00:01:28.799> long<00:01:29.189> athletic<00:01:29.579> guys

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
Heat they have some long athletic guys

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.140 
Heat they have some long athletic guys
on<00:01:30.990> their<00:01:31.200> team<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.680> Milwaukee<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.939> not

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
on their team in Milwaukee but it's not

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.210 
on their team in Milwaukee but it's not
going<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.509> enough<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.110> will<00:01:34.650> tell<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.070> this

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
going to be enough I will tell you this

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.810 
going to be enough I will tell you this
i<00:01:35.280> do<00:01:35.520> think<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:37.680> Milwaukee<00:01:38.159> Bucks<00:01:38.340> can

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
i do think that the Milwaukee Bucks can

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.940 
i do think that the Milwaukee Bucks can
win<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> game<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.780> series<00:01:39.840> i<00:01:40.259> will<00:01:40.500> give<00:01:40.799> on

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
win a game in this series i will give on

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.280 
win a game in this series i will give on
one<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.250> think<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:42.150> miami<00:01:42.570> heat<00:01:42.750> will<00:01:42.990> put<00:01:43.170> them

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
one I think the miami heat will put them

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.990 
one I think the miami heat will put them
away<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.530> five<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.250> i<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.790> going<00:01:44.939> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
away in five but i think it's going to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.389 
away in five but i think it's going to
be<00:01:45.060> at<00:01:45.299> least<00:01:45.329> two<00:01:45.780> close<00:01:46.110> games<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.130> think

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
be at least two close games and I think

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.789 
be at least two close games and I think
Milwaukee<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.299> pull<00:01:48.509> away<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:49.380> one

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
Milwaukee is going to pull away with one

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.219 
Milwaukee is going to pull away with one
