00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello to all the last leg of the tour 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.450
 of France is obviously the arrival at 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.980
 paris and fields elysées with often 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.530
 unification in the sprint it is necessary 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.210
 admit it is not the case today 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.639
 because he can already stung part there 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.529
 between with castroviejo coppel and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.270
 vorganov the peloton led by the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.430
 teammates including chagall and 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.820
 cavendish there we see the passage on the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.170
 elysées fields so a detour 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.010
 we will arrive at the Arc de Triomphe 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.150
 beautiful with the little pavers of 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.820
 deschamps so with always this audience 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.010
 en masse came to publish the runner after 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.110
 three weeks of intensive efforts is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.790
 amazing we see on a cup there at 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.899
 right 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.550
 here we went around the arc of 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.840
 triumph this classic course 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.670
 obviously involves no difficulty 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.379
 if not obviously the watch is 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.670
 there after the tunnel but obviously these 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.770
 a few dozen meters before 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.480
 more so it does not represent anything we see 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.719
 the city of paris so with the bow of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.879
 triumph to turn around and as expected 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.840
 an all will be played in the sprint he is going 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.989
 and there is a general grouping 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 we will see it in a few moments 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.729
 so christopher froome who addressed this 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.369
 tour de France 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.630
 not without evil we see this beautiful 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.619
 view that needs sunset 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.780
 obviously we know it's at night 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.110
 castroviejo efforts bowls 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.670

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.070

 Denis Wood had already sprinted 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.310

 in front of alberto contador and ab the gap 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.200
 after for the third even worse for 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.299
 the fourth van den broeck finished in the 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.260
 top 5 just like thibaut pinot and there is 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.780
 like hen 5 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.030
 our friend voeckler failed in 11th place 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.549
 unfortunately for him sublime 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.200
 victory of chris froome who has cracked 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.700
 at times but never gave way 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.049
 completely complete and make you 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.390
 keep his jersey for many 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:35.129
 steps since the time trial of 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.360
 nice is awesome then to each 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.709
 from them winning the points ranking 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.350
 he was more regular simply 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.630
 it's a bit of a goal two cases are 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.040
 sometimes it is to show who is the most 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.410
 regular in this pack 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.930
 and this time it was the team of 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.290
 peter sagan the team rather chagall has 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.670
 been good 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.560
 obviously later chagan in person 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.630
 who was very regular and who knew how to 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.459
 to take all the steps it 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.680
 was taken in is finished because with 58 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.299
 points de France is not talking about 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.190
 of the mountain is a suspense 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.349
 panting and only a small point 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.870
 separates the first rodriguez to the third 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.970
