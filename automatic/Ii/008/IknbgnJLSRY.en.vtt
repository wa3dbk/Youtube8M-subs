Joe let's start with what a bit is very
briefly<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:36.390> bit<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> single

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
briefly here one bit is a single

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.940 
briefly here one bit is a single
character<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.100> binary<00:00:38.460> either<00:00:38.969> 1<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:39.780> 0<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
character in binary either 1 or 0 so it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.790 
character in binary either 1 or 0 so it
can<00:00:41.100> only<00:00:41.250> express<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.239> 2<00:00:42.450> values<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.469> 2

with 3 bits that goes up to 8 every bit

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.290 
with 3 bits that goes up to 8 every bit
we<00:00:49.230> add<00:00:49.500> increases<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> number<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.969> different

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
we add increases the number of different

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.380 
we add increases the number of different
