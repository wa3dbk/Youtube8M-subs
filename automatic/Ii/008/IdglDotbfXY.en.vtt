00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello everyone my name is timur and you 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.410
 watch the show less than five shows in which i 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.050
 telling the subtleties of photography on 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.330
 regular smartphone just a couple of minutes 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.070
 ago there was a heavy downpour and many 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.990
 believe that the photos after the rain 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.359
 it turns out not very cool and because 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.810
 and the sun is cloudy and all that but 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.720
 there is 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.529
 puddles right now we will them 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.529
 take pictures 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.380
 to make a cool photo after 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.290
 we only need rain 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.480
 phone and puddle we still have some subtleties 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.220
 which I will tell you now to 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.199
 get an interesting photo with a puddle 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.729
 you need to pick the right angle otherwise 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.860
 we get something like that 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.170
 but we want to get something like 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.479
 such a photo for this we need to 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.940
 walk around puddles and correctly 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:21.830
 expose our model 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:29.460
 step back still back left to the other left 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:30.950
 forward stop back right to right 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.250
 slightly back 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.759
 a little more clearly need to act 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.440
 on the principle of seven times measure once 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.350
 takes pictures, that is, we do a lot of things 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.420
 different samples from different angles and maybe 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.360
 1 2 photos we get very 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.950
 interesting as for example this one 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.979
 the photo came out about somewhere with 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.200
 5 attempts and the other looks like I got taken 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.420
 out of 10 it did not have to crawl 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.170
 literally on my knees near this puddle 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.260
 to catch 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.360
 just such an interesting perspective 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.979
 you can photograph absolutely any 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.020
 puddles or even not necessarily puddles 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.760
 just in reflections for example cars or 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.400
 here's a sewer hatch 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.260
 any reflections in an unusual performance 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.140
 that is, when we see for example legs 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.180
 and the reflection looks interesting to 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.280
 catch a reflection in a puddle for example here in 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.430
 you need to put such a little person 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.959
 as far as possible from her and again 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.049
 frame manipulation trying to catch 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.519
 his reflection is already more difficult exactly 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.959
 a week ago we had a competition 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.880
 together with Kalash throw was 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.220
 take pictures of flowers to win 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.170
 5030 or 20 dollars respectively for 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.910
 first second third and at the end 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.079
 of this release you will find out the results 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.180
 this contest 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.209
 further work on harder we need 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.250
 big puddle and the main thing here 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.140
 fit in the frame as much as possible the sky and 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.390
 as little land as possible then we get 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.190
 something like this photo 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.260
 if we also competent and cut it 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.690
 In general, the land will be visible and it seems like 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.579
 like he's standing right in the sky 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.090
 You can also experiment and 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.400
 show imagination and do something like that 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.519
 photo and here are a lot of friends and type 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.110
 go for all the photos already looks 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.300
 rather unusual but if not and 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.250
 correctly crop handle photoshop 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.890
 In my opinion it will look more 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:23.150
 better and notice this photo is taken 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.959
 just on a regular phone a couple more 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.720
 steps back 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.459
 one more plus of big shallow puddles 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.220
 shifts in what can be done here 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.140
 such a photo where a lot of everything is not a bunch 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.870
 just sky and just and and flip 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.150
 then it turns out just interesting 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.160
 photo in general if recently was 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.370
 rain it doesn't matter just take 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.380
 camera and run to the street you have everything 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.910
 it turns out and that all the photos 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.650
 made it left them to process and 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.150
 put in instagram 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.250
 if you like my photos 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.680
 made on the phone you can look 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.230

 saying choose work was very 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.690
 not easy because there were so many 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.580
 good works that are made by example 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.910
