00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
hand back with the left hand the next

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:22.590 
hand back with the left hand the next
movement<00:01:07.820> sequence<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.509> inside<00:01:09.020> out<00:01:09.200> cross

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:36.130 

the<00:01:23.140> next<00:01:23.380> move<00:01:23.590> between<00:01:23.980> the<00:01:24.310> legs

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.860 

our<00:01:36.770> last<00:01:37.220> move<00:01:37.460> in<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.640> sequence<00:01:38.090> is<00:01:38.360> behind

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
our last move in the sequence is behind

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:53.060 
our last move in the sequence is behind
the<00:01:39.050> back

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.910 

so<00:01:53.670> our<00:01:53.790> sequence<00:01:54.330> of<00:01:54.480> drill<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:55.080> crossover

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
so our sequence of drill is crossover

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.310 
so our sequence of drill is crossover
inside<00:01:56.730> out<00:01:56.940> right<00:01:57.180> hand<00:01:57.450> inside<00:01:57.690> out<00:01:58.140> left

inside out right hand inside out left
hand<00:01:58.440> inside<00:01:59.370> out<00:01:59.610> cross<00:01:59.910> between<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.780> legs

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
hand inside out cross between the legs

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.120 
hand inside out cross between the legs
behind<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.740> back

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
behind the back

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.700 
behind the back
do<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.670> move<00:02:02.820> down<00:02:03.060> back<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:04.020> do<00:02:04.230> that<00:02:04.380> entire

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
do the move down back to do that entire

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.350 
do the move down back to do that entire
sequence<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.580> then<00:02:05.760> you<00:02:05.880> would<00:02:06.000> come<00:02:06.150> back

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
sequence and then you would come back

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.359 
sequence and then you would come back
and<00:02:06.660> repeat<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> sequence<00:02:07.320> go<00:02:08.070> through<00:02:08.280> it

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and repeat the sequence go through it

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.490 
and repeat the sequence go through it
twice
