00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.810
 On a physical level we find a camera unrivaled by any other model of

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.940

 the nikon d90 is targeted as a reference that segment 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.150
 first reflection of its category with auto focus system with detection of 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.450

 lose what you identify what part of the photo is the one that should be kept 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.539
 clear when we work with very short depth of field the nikon 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.699
 d90 integrates all the genealogy you can imagine 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.619
 sensor with self-cleaning system with four release frequencies 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:31.369

 inches and gea resolution deflected it with autofocus by contrast detection 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.309
 and I say who shot four point five frames per second 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.930
 If we add to that, it starts up but eat 15 seconds is easy 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:50.449
 conclude that never with advanced camera title better than the new nikon d90 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:53.679
 but the nikon d90 ends here 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:57.329
 the nikon d90 is the first reflects the world capable of recording video on high 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.859
 resolution thanks to the expected quality of your image sensor we have 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:01.940
 12 megapixels 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.219
 in format of x 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.639
 The nikon d90 delivers perfect photographic images in any 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.479
 situation and allows recording up to 29 consecutive minutes of high video 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.970
 resolution in the conventional SD card 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.630
 at 24 frames per second and in avi format plus a button dedicated to the 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.730
 passion litibú and video greatly facilitates the recording of movies 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.239
 at any time 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.530
 also the use of photographic optics makes video images 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:27.930
 acquires a dimension only comparable to those of the video camera 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.979
 professional 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.320
 the size of the sensor 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.740
 together with the particular construction structure of the optics 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.310
 Reflex photographic between sharp and very realistic images 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.460
 to which is added the wide range of depth of field characteristic in 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.149
 the photographic composition 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:43.969
 just like in these pictures now our children happen to be an aspect 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:45.530
 practically professional 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.030
 impossible to achieve with the compact camera both photo and ahead 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.739
 of life 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.849
 the built-in mic allows us to capture the ambient sound naturally 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.749
 equally the wide variety of compatible tools extends not only possible 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:59.539
 in our votes but also that of these rivers 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:03.749
 I imagine results that can be obtained with an optics like wolves nicor 18 105 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:04.330
 vr 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.180
 that covers from the wide angle of 28 millimeters to the tele of 160 millimeters 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.840
 with optical stabilization an irresistible combination in a single 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.380
 compact equipment and cable well thanks to its output hdmi my movies 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.390
 video will be seen in high resolution on any flat screen by hector of 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.840
 Last generation 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.160
 I do not go often you have the feeling of having in your hands a product that 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.069
 represents the beginning of the new era 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.379
 today as eight years ago, the one of nikon d90 marks the way forward
