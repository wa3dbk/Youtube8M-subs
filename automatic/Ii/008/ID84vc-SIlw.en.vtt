is a woman's guide five the old one but
a<00:00:35.370> couple<00:00:35.610> things<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.090> you'll<00:00:36.270> notice<00:00:36.329> in

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
a couple things that you'll notice in

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.880 
a couple things that you'll notice in
the<00:00:36.870> new<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:38.690> rubber<00:00:39.690> outsole<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the new one the rubber outsole on the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.010 
the new one the rubber outsole on the
fourth<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.489> front<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> foot<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.570> these

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
fourth on the front of the foot of these

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.069 
fourth on the front of the foot of these
has<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> more<00:00:43.950> tacky<00:00:44.250> grip<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.629> they

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
has a more tacky grip to it and they

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.350 
has a more tacky grip to it and they
change<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.649> configuration<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:47.969> it

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
change the configuration of that so it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.959 
change the configuration of that so it
feels<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.260> little<00:00:49.410> more<00:00:49.590> flexible<00:00:50.100> oil<00:00:50.489> cushier

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
feels a little more flexible oil cushier

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
feels a little more flexible oil cushier
but<00:00:51.480> also<00:00:51.629> gives<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.140> little<00:00:52.289> more

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
but also gives you a little more

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.170 
but also gives you a little more
traction<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.100> then<00:00:53.550> another<00:00:53.730> thing<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.120> think

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
traction and then another thing I think

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.630 
traction and then another thing I think
you'll<00:00:54.480> notice<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.649> hill<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.399> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
you'll notice is that in the hill it's a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.950 
you'll notice is that in the hill it's a
little<00:00:57.000> bit<00:00:57.770> more<00:00:59.120> separated<00:01:00.120> or<00:01:00.420> grooved<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
little bit more separated or grooved a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.209 
little bit more separated or grooved a
little<00:01:01.350> bit<00:01:01.469> as<00:01:01.590> well<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.949> what<00:01:02.100> they're

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
little bit as well so what they're

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.399 
little bit as well so what they're
trying<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.460> do<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:02.930> overall<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.199> give

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
trying to do is just overall just give

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.929 
trying to do is just overall just give
you<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> little<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:04.830> fluid<00:01:05.220> right<00:01:05.400> something

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
you a little more fluid right something

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.160 
you a little more fluid right something
that<00:01:06.030> feels<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.299> little<00:01:06.420> more<00:01:06.630> plush<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.110> I

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that feels a little more plush and I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.660 
that feels a little more plush and I
think<00:01:07.409> they're<00:01:07.830> doing<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.490> definitely

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
think they're doing that it's definitely

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.789 
think they're doing that it's definitely
more<00:01:09.240> flexible<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> forefoot<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.650> I

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
more flexible in the forefoot so I

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.510 
more flexible in the forefoot so I
handled<00:01:11.220> snow<00:01:11.689> pretty<00:01:12.689> well<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:12.990> mean<00:01:13.400> took<00:01:14.400> him

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
handled snow pretty well I mean took him

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240 
handled snow pretty well I mean took him
on<00:01:14.640> some<00:01:14.850> ice<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.270> other<00:01:15.420> day<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.560> ice

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
on some ice the other day you know ice

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.929 
on some ice the other day you know ice
is<00:01:17.549> ice<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.090> antenna<00:01:19.549> that's<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
is ice and antenna that's not going to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.140 
is ice and antenna that's not going to
make<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> big<00:01:21.180> difference<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:23.060> other<00:01:24.060> than

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
make a big difference but I other than

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.090 
make a big difference but I other than
the<00:01:24.450> other<00:01:24.600> day<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.320> had<00:01:25.500> problems<00:01:25.710> and

some snowshoes
let's<00:01:30.690> go<00:01:30.920> flexibil<00:01:31.920> anything<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.520> he<00:01:32.670> said

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
let's go flexibil anything like he said

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.800 
let's go flexibil anything like he said
a<00:01:33.260> little<00:01:34.260> more<00:01:34.500> flex<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.549> forefoot<00:01:36.090> only

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
a little more flex in that forefoot only

of ache you know from either from
probably<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:45.180> hyper<00:01:45.509> extending<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.229> little

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
probably just hyper extending a little

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.520 
probably just hyper extending a little
bit<00:01:46.860> yeah<00:01:47.040> maybe<00:01:47.550> it<00:01:47.790> more<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.210> what<00:01:49.200> I've<00:01:49.320> been
