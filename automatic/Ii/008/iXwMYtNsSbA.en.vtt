group<00:00:24.680> way<00:00:25.680> down<00:00:25.890> here<00:00:26.400> has<00:00:27.390> Yule<00:00:27.539> period<00:00:28.019> with

group way down here has Yule period with

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.710 
group way down here has Yule period with
pedals<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> original<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.539> race

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
pedals I do have the original do race

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.250

though<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:32.009> an<00:00:32.610> old<00:00:32.759> water<00:00:32.969> bottle<00:00:33.360> -<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:34.050> top

though and an old water bottle - the top

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.990 
though and an old water bottle - the top
so<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.829> really<00:00:35.130> useful<00:00:35.250> right<00:00:35.640> writing

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
so it's not really useful right writing

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.040 
so it's not really useful right writing

looking at it it's really in remarkable
condition<00:01:48.110> if<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.350> pan<00:01:49.860> around<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.579> can

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
condition if I pan around here you can

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.170 
condition if I pan around here you can
see<00:01:51.649> there's<00:01:52.649> pretty<00:01:53.130> much<00:01:53.280> not<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> scratch<00:01:53.970> on

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
see there's pretty much not a scratch on

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.850 
see there's pretty much not a scratch on
this<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.600> mean<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> only<00:01:55.049> flaw<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.590> bike

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
this I mean the only flaw on this bike

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.010 
this I mean the only flaw on this bike
is<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.420> Columbus<00:01:58.020> decal<00:01:58.439> right<00:01:58.710> there<00:02:00.020> aside

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
is the Columbus decal right there aside

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.209 
is the Columbus decal right there aside
from<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.619> basically<00:02:02.040> scratch<00:02:02.520> free<00:02:03.030> I

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
from that it's basically scratch free I

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.289 
from that it's basically scratch free I
really<00:02:05.219> could<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:05.490> believe<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.909> when<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
really could not believe it when it

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.190 
really could not believe it when it
arrived<00:02:06.770> in<00:02:07.770> terms<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.220> condition<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.849> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.040 

aside<00:02:11.860> from<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:12.610> think<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:13.540> cable<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:13.990> a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
aside from I think this cable is a

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.170 
aside from I think this cable is a
little<00:02:14.260> different<00:02:14.560> than<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.770> original<00:02:15.180> this

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
little different than the original this

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.620 
little different than the original this
is<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.570> original<00:02:16.890> cabling<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:19.330> these

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
is the original cabling and these

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.840 
is the original cabling and these
shifters<00:02:20.110> are<00:02:20.380> not<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.770> originals<00:02:21.220> he<00:02:21.640> had

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
shifters are not the originals he had

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.440 
shifters are not the originals he had
changed<00:02:22.120> those<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:23.190> do<00:02:24.190> have<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.730> original<00:02:25.180> I

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.580 
percent stock in just a few minutes but
just<00:02:31.060> kind<00:02:31.210> of<00:02:31.270> left<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.540> alone<00:02:31.600> for<00:02:31.930> now<00:02:31.990> and

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
just kind of left it alone for now and

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.190 
just kind of left it alone for now and
it<00:02:32.970> normally<00:02:33.970> sits<00:02:34.390> in<00:02:34.510> my<00:02:34.630> kitchen

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
it normally sits in my kitchen

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.500 
it normally sits in my kitchen
above<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.860> cupboards<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:36.970> it's<00:02:37.090> not<00:02:37.210> one<00:02:37.420> that

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
above the cupboards so it's not one that

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.310 
above the cupboards so it's not one that
I<00:02:37.600> normally<00:02:37.930> ride<00:02:38.380> but<00:02:39.720> there<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:40.930> go

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
I normally ride but there you go

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.090 
I normally ride but there you go
1986<00:02:42.250> Panasonic<00:02:42.940> Team<00:02:43.120> America<00:02:43.680> probably<00:02:44.680> the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
1986 Panasonic Team America probably the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.449 
1986 Panasonic Team America probably the
nicest<00:02:45.400> bike<00:02:45.820> in<00:02:46.060> my<00:02:46.090> collection<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:49.230> roughly

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
nicest bike in my collection and roughly

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.730 
nicest bike in my collection and roughly
750<00:02:51.459> dollars<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:52.270> would<00:02:52.720> say<00:02:52.900> invest<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.620> at

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
750 dollars I would say invest it at

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.790 
750 dollars I would say invest it at
this<00:02:53.860> point<00:02:54.130> so<00:02:55.140> not<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.290> cheapest<00:02:56.650> one

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
this point so not the cheapest one

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.280 
this point so not the cheapest one
either<00:02:56.920> but<00:02:57.840> certainly<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.930> cool<00:02:59.110> bike

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
either but certainly a cool bike

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.180 
either but certainly a cool bike
especially<00:02:59.709> for<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.160> time<00:03:00.340> hope<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:00.940> enjoy
