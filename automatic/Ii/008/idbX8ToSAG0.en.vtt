way back what I have chosen to do on
this<00:00:26.519> application<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:27.359> I've<00:00:27.510> chosen<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.050> mount

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
this application is I've chosen to mount

this application is I've chosen to mount
mine<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.550> front<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.240> we're<00:00:30.449> gonna<00:00:30.570> go<00:00:30.810> with

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
mine on the front so we're gonna go with

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.680 
mine on the front so we're gonna go with
a<00:00:31.050> front<00:00:32.009> mount<00:00:32.250> application<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> bow<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
a front mount application on the bow of

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
would probably be at the at the transom

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.600 
would probably be at the at the transom
or<00:00:40.020> over<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> helm

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
on this wire was already attached I ran

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.249 
on this wire was already attached I ran
that<00:01:27.390> wire<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.470> see<00:01:28.680> all<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:29.850> up

that wire as you can see all the way up

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.539 
that wire as you can see all the way up
along<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.650> shaft<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.100> trolling<00:01:32.400> motor

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
along the shaft of the trolling motor

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.710 
along the shaft of the trolling motor
and<00:01:33.079> when<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.110> got<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:36.150> where<00:01:36.630> the

and when I got to about here where the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.560 
and when I got to about here where the
trolling<00:01:36.960> motor<00:01:37.909> pivots<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> head<00:01:39.240> from<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
trolling motor pivots the head from the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.960 
trolling motor pivots the head from the
shaft<00:01:39.900> what<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> did<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.310> gave<00:01:41.520> myself<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
shaft what I did is I gave myself a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.310 
shaft what I did is I gave myself a
little<00:01:42.119> loop<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.079> right<00:01:43.259> here

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
little loop you can see that right here

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.560 
little loop you can see that right here
I<00:01:43.710> gave<00:01:44.130> myself<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.640> loop<00:01:44.939> right<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.210> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
I gave myself this loop right here and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.539 
I gave myself this loop right here and
that<00:01:45.659> what<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.439> allow<00:01:46.710> me<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
that what that's for is allow me to to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.030 
that what that's for is allow me to to
spin<00:01:48.180> around<00:01:48.420> when<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.990> thing<00:01:49.200> rotates<00:01:49.770> and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
spin around when this thing rotates and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.510 
spin around when this thing rotates and
spins

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
spins

that's<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.989> pretty<00:02:23.109> important<00:02:23.650> step<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.219> want<00:02:24.430> to

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
that's a pretty important step I want to

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.039 
that's a pretty important step I want to
make<00:02:24.670> sure<00:02:24.700> you're<00:02:25.000> away<00:02:25.209> from<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.599> so<00:02:25.870> once

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
make sure you're away from that so once

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.569 
make sure you're away from that so once
again<00:02:26.260> I'll<00:02:26.379> try<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.590> show<00:02:26.799> you<00:02:26.859> a<00:02:27.010> wider<00:02:27.219> view

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
again I'll try to show you a wider view

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
here came up the shaft

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.280 
here came up the shaft
there's<00:02:31.090> my<00:02:31.299> loop<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.659> was<00:02:31.780> just<00:02:31.959> telling<00:02:32.230> you

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
there's my loop I was just telling you

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.890 
there's my loop I was just telling you
about<00:02:32.319> came<00:02:33.189> around<00:02:33.540> went<00:02:34.540> over<00:02:34.780> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
about came around went over the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.559 
about came around went over the
breakaway<00:02:35.650> head<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.220> then<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.819> mounted<00:02:37.359> it<00:02:37.480> and

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
breakaway head and then I mounted it and

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.830 
breakaway head and then I mounted it and
ran<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.049> down<00:02:38.079> the<00:02:38.500> side<00:02:39.269> give<00:02:40.269> me<00:02:40.299> a<00:02:40.420> second

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
ran it down the side give me a second

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.160 
ran it down the side give me a second
here<00:02:40.870> come<00:02:41.170> over<00:02:41.260> here<00:02:41.620> show<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.430> that

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.050 

there's<00:02:47.170> my<00:02:47.379> loop<00:02:47.590> once<00:02:47.859> again<00:02:48.159> came<00:02:48.700> around

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
there's my loop once again came around

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.000 
there's my loop once again came around
did<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.689> loop<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.170> when<00:02:50.379> I<00:02:50.409> got<00:02:50.620> down<00:02:50.829> the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
did the loop and when I got down the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.129 
did the loop and when I got down the
side<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.250> actually<00:02:51.549> drilled<00:02:52.090> two<00:02:52.569> holes<00:02:52.599> in<00:02:53.049> the

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
side I actually drilled two holes in the

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.629 
side I actually drilled two holes in the
side<00:02:53.319> of<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.530> trolling<00:02:53.709> motor<00:02:53.859> bracket<00:02:54.280> and

side of the trolling motor bracket and

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.110 
side of the trolling motor bracket and
zip-tied<00:02:55.540> those<00:02:55.810> right<00:02:56.109> there<00:02:57.000> here's<00:02:58.000> an

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
zip-tied those right there here's an

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.990 
zip-tied those right there here's an
important<00:02:58.540> part<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:59.250> found<00:03:00.250> out<00:03:00.489> where<00:03:00.790> the

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
important part I found out where the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.119 
important part I found out where the
trolling<00:03:01.359> motor<00:03:01.480> actually<00:03:02.109> makes<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.650> pivot<00:03:02.980> on

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
trolling motor actually makes a pivot on

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
base itself and where that pivoted is

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.360 
base itself and where that pivoted is
where<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.459> decided<00:03:09.939> to<00:03:10.540> make<00:03:10.720> my<00:03:10.930> turn<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.680> what

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370

and<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.329> big<00:03:34.569> coil<00:03:34.870> because<00:03:35.199> they<00:03:35.319> give<00:03:35.500> you

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
and a big coil because they give you

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.289 
and a big coil because they give you
plenty<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.159> footage<00:03:36.519> with<00:03:36.699> this<00:03:36.879> and<00:03:37.060> you<00:03:37.150> can

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
plenty of footage with this and you can

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.899 
plenty of footage with this and you can
see<00:03:37.479> that<00:03:38.079> moves<00:03:38.349> in<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.829> moves<00:03:39.430> out<00:03:39.609> like

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
see that moves in and moves out like

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.879 
see that moves in and moves out like
it's<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.510> drilled<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:41.049> decent<00:03:41.500> hole<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.739> get

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
it's I drilled a decent hole to get

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.330 
it's I drilled a decent hole to get
myself<00:03:42.069> some<00:03:42.430> some<00:03:42.940> play<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.769> that<00:03:44.919> comes<00:03:45.129> in

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
myself some some play so that comes in

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.750 
myself some some play so that comes in
all<00:03:45.819> mounted<00:03:46.419> all<00:03:46.599> underneath<00:03:47.199> in<00:03:47.409> here<00:03:47.760> and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
all mounted all underneath in here and

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.849 
all mounted all underneath in here and
then<00:03:48.849> that<00:03:49.150> wire<00:03:49.419> then<00:03:49.930> was<00:03:50.169> drilled<00:03:50.530> out

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
then that wire then was drilled out

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.289 
then that wire then was drilled out
right<00:03:51.220> through<00:03:51.459> here<00:03:51.639> through<00:03:51.879> a<00:03:51.909> one-inch

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
right through here through a one-inch

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.960 
right through here through a one-inch
hole<00:03:52.479> and<00:03:52.829> then<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:53.859> trolling<00:03:54.459> motor<00:03:54.549> wire

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
hole and then the trolling motor wire

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.640 
hole and then the trolling motor wire
came<00:03:55.329> out<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.720> that's<00:03:55.810> one<00:03:56.079> of<00:03:56.109> these<00:03:56.290> serial

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
came out and that's one of these serial

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.800 
came out and that's one of these serial
numbers<00:03:56.919> on<00:03:57.099> it<00:03:57.250> here<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.970> comes<00:03:58.359> in<00:03:58.599> and

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
numbers on it here and comes in and

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.520 
numbers on it here and comes in and
trolling<00:03:59.319> motor<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.949> do<00:04:00.010> believe<00:04:00.519> is<00:04:01.290> this<00:04:02.290> one

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
trolling motor I do believe is this one

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.870 
trolling motor I do believe is this one
over<00:04:02.769> here<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:04.540> this

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
over here is this

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.880 
over here is this
and<00:04:06.970> let<00:04:07.780> over<00:04:07.960> here<00:04:08.230> don't<00:04:08.440> hold<00:04:08.590> me<00:04:08.740> to<00:04:08.770> that

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
and let over here don't hold me to that

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.470 
and let over here don't hold me to that
it's<00:04:09.190> what<00:04:09.340> it's<00:04:09.490> one<00:04:09.640> of<00:04:09.760> these<00:04:09.880> anyway<00:04:10.330> so

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
it's what it's one of these anyway so

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.360 
it's what it's one of these anyway so
that's<00:04:10.810> basic<00:04:11.230> trolling<00:04:11.560> motor<00:04:11.740> installation

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
that's basic trolling motor installation

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.520 
that's basic trolling motor installation
so<00:04:12.660> went<00:04:13.660> from<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:15.030> transducer<00:04:16.230> ran<00:04:17.230> the<00:04:17.380> wire

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
so went from the transducer ran the wire

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.100 
so went from the transducer ran the wire
up<00:04:17.800> the<00:04:17.950> shaft<00:04:18.190> created<00:04:18.850> my<00:04:18.970> loop<00:04:19.239> went<00:04:19.870> around

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
up the shaft created my loop went around

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.030 
up the shaft created my loop went around
came<00:04:20.800> back<00:04:21.040> down<00:04:21.340> came<00:04:22.210> in<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:23.530> bow<00:04:23.740> mount

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
came back down came in the bow mount

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.700 
came back down came in the bow mount
area<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:25.060> boat<00:04:25.240> itself<00:04:25.540> plate<00:04:26.110> unscrewed

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
area of the boat itself plate unscrewed

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.620 
area of the boat itself plate unscrewed
app<00:04:26.860> put<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.220> through<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.430> back<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:28.150> came<00:04:28.480> out

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
app put it through the back and came out

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.590 
app put it through the back and came out
over<00:04:28.900> here<00:04:29.160> next<00:04:30.160> you'll<00:04:30.400> see<00:04:30.610> is<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:31.360> GPS

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
over here next you'll see is the GPS

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.700 
over here next you'll see is the GPS
puck<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:34.630> is<00:04:34.810> pretty<00:04:35.020> important<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:35.530> want

want<00:04:54.850> that<00:04:55.090> too<00:04:55.240> far<00:04:55.480> away<00:04:55.570> from<00:04:55.720> where<00:04:56.020> you're

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
want that too far away from where you're

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.780 
want that too far away from where you're
making<00:04:56.350> your<00:04:56.620> marks<00:04:56.890> because<00:04:57.010> then<00:04:57.220> your<00:04:57.340> GPS

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
making your marks because then your GPS

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:58.860 
making your marks because then your GPS
coordinates<00:04:58.180> are<00:04:58.240> gonna<00:04:58.330> be<00:04:58.510> off<00:04:58.660> you'll

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
coordinates are gonna be off you'll

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.560 
coordinates are gonna be off you'll
never<00:04:59.050> find<00:04:59.350> your<00:04:59.560> cover<00:05:00.310> structure<00:05:01.030> or<00:05:01.180> item

this puck you can drill a hole one inch

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.800 
this puck you can drill a hole one inch
hole<00:05:11.530> roughly<00:05:12.040> a<00:05:12.190> little<00:05:12.330> smaller<00:05:13.330> probably

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
hole roughly a little smaller probably

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.950 
hole roughly a little smaller probably
3/4<00:05:14.500> drill<00:05:15.040> a<00:05:15.070> hole<00:05:15.340> in<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:16.030> boat<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:16.480> you<00:05:16.780> can

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
3/4 drill a hole in the boat and you can

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.320 
3/4 drill a hole in the boat and you can
pass<00:05:17.170> this<00:05:17.350> wire<00:05:17.560> down<00:05:17.890> through<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:18.520> then<00:05:19.180> you

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
pass this wire down through and then you

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.450 
pass this wire down through and then you
will<00:05:19.450> also<00:05:19.630> have<00:05:19.870> to<00:05:20.170> drill<00:05:20.440> these<00:05:20.920> two<00:05:21.220> holes

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
will also have to drill these two holes

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.720 
will also have to drill these two holes
right<00:05:21.760> here<00:05:22.510> to<00:05:22.990> mount<00:05:23.170> it<00:05:23.380> I<00:05:23.560> kind<00:05:24.550> of<00:05:24.610> took

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
right here to mount it I kind of took

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.980 
right here to mount it I kind of took
the<00:05:24.880> lazy<00:05:25.060> way<00:05:25.300> out<00:05:25.510> and<00:05:25.600> didn't<00:05:25.810> want<00:05:25.930> to

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
the lazy way out and didn't want to

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.840 
the lazy way out and didn't want to
drill<00:05:26.200> holes<00:05:26.380> in<00:05:26.530> my<00:05:26.620> nice<00:05:26.800> new<00:05:27.010> boat<00:05:27.250> but

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
drill holes in my nice new boat but

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.660 
drill holes in my nice new boat but
since<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:28.840> was<00:05:28.990> going<00:05:29.230> so<00:05:29.440> close<00:05:29.740> I<00:05:30.040> just<00:05:30.220> laid

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
since I was going so close I just laid

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.640 
since I was going so close I just laid
the<00:05:30.820> wire<00:05:30.970> down<00:05:31.300> you<00:05:32.110> can<00:05:32.260> see<00:05:32.410> there's<00:05:32.590> a

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
the wire down you can see there's a

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.050 
the wire down you can see there's a
little<00:05:32.770> arch<00:05:33.040> if<00:05:33.220> that<00:05:33.370> can<00:05:33.490> sit<00:05:33.700> down<00:05:33.850> in

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
little arch if that can sit down in

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.540 
little arch if that can sit down in
there<00:05:34.380> notches<00:05:35.380> out<00:05:35.530> and<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:36.010> just<00:05:36.220> ran<00:05:36.400> it

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
there notches out and I just ran it

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.550 
there notches out and I just ran it
right<00:05:36.580> through<00:05:37.060> and<00:05:37.300> once<00:05:37.540> again<00:05:37.870> once<00:05:38.440> again

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
right through and once again once again

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.110 
right through and once again once again
came<00:05:39.010> back<00:05:39.540> into<00:05:40.540> the<00:05:41.370> mounting<00:05:42.370> cover<00:05:42.700> on<00:05:42.910> the

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
came back into the mounting cover on the

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.120 
came back into the mounting cover on the
bow<00:05:43.270> of<00:05:43.450> the<00:05:43.510> boat<00:05:43.540> just<00:05:44.320> drill<00:05:44.560> a<00:05:44.590> 1/8<00:05:45.100> inch
