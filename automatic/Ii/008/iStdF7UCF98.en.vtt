fellow survivors who will need escaping
through<00:03:56.859> the<00:03:57.040> growing<00:03:57.250> hordes<00:03:57.579> you<00:03:57.670> look<00:03:57.790> kind

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
through the growing hordes you look kind

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.819 
through the growing hordes you look kind
of<00:03:58.000> objectives<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:58.870> have<00:03:59.049> to<00:03:59.170> guide<00:03:59.410> these

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
of objectives you have to guide these

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.590 
of objectives you have to guide these
are<00:04:00.100> pretty<00:04:00.310> unarmed<00:04:00.760> civilians<00:04:01.180> through<00:04:01.420> to

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
are pretty unarmed civilians through to

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.690 
are pretty unarmed civilians through to
evac<00:04:01.989> points<00:04:02.380> I<00:04:02.440> guess<00:04:02.650> because<00:04:02.859> they<00:04:03.250> escaped

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
evac points I guess because they escaped

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.610 
evac points I guess because they escaped
so<00:04:04.030> if<00:04:04.359> they<00:04:04.600> can<00:04:04.780> escape<00:04:04.930> that<00:04:05.200> I<00:04:05.290> can<00:04:05.470> suggest

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
so if they can escape that I can suggest

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.289 
so if they can escape that I can suggest
that<00:04:05.859> you<00:04:06.010> can<00:04:06.160> pre<00:04:06.340> escape<00:04:06.640> as<00:04:06.819> well<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.060> can't

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
that you can pre escape as well I can't

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.059 
that you can pre escape as well I can't
see<00:04:07.450> why<00:04:07.600> you<00:04:07.660> can't<00:04:07.930> escape<00:04:08.140> if<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.890> air

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
see why you can't escape if the air

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.650 
see why you can't escape if the air
civilians<00:04:09.519> can<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:09.910> maybe<00:04:10.150> I'll<00:04:10.329> be<00:04:10.450> way<00:04:10.600> to

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
civilians can so maybe I'll be way to

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.539 
civilians can so maybe I'll be way to
actually<00:04:11.019> complete<00:04:11.260> this<00:04:11.500> mode<00:04:11.739> if<00:04:11.950> these<00:04:12.370> air
