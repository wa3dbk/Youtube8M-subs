00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.240 
saying like I didn't find diamonds but
it's<00:04:32.180> obviously<00:04:32.599> based<00:04:32.960> on<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.229> seed<00:04:33.470> but<00:04:34.039> I'm

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
it's obviously based on the seed but I'm

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.710 
it's obviously based on the seed but I'm
showing<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:34.639> this<00:04:34.759> is<00:04:34.940> my<00:04:35.090> way<00:04:35.300> if<00:04:35.449> you<00:04:35.569> want

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
to use it go ahead it's pretty efficient

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.360

way I think so at least but we don't put

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.430 
way I think so at least but we don't put
