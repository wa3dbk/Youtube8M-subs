00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
shower and then come up with some ideas

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.310

from<00:00:23.519> there<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.630> things<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.900> recommend

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
from there one of the things I recommend

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.400 
from there one of the things I recommend
is<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.590> really<00:00:25.890> think<00:00:26.130> about<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:27.380> type<00:00:28.380> of

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
is to really think about what type of

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.140 
is to really think about what type of
thing<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.070> know<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.580> want<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.939> send

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
your guests home with and so I actually

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.920 
your guests home with and so I actually
really<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> idea<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:35.040> donation<00:00:35.930> that

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
really like the idea of a donation that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.220 
really like the idea of a donation that
can<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.559> either<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.760> children's<00:00:39.329> charity<00:00:39.390> or

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
can be to either a children's charity or

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.920 
can be to either a children's charity or
perhaps<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.890> local<00:00:41.309> charity<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.690> really

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
perhaps a local charity if you really

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.209 
perhaps a local charity if you really
want<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.170> send<00:00:43.350> your<00:00:43.469> guests<00:00:43.739> home<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:44.070> like
