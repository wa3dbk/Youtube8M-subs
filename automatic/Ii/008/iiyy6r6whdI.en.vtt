00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 and I simply said stop a lake then 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.160
 I often make women talk about 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.980
 facts that do not understand them why 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.809
 the guys refuse to confess their twist and 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.490
 consciousness often disproportionate and 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.980
 hairdressers to change that he is certain 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.089
 that there is my opinion about it 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.160
 can not be worse than advice 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.439
 that our girl friends or one while 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.820
 it's a post of what and not only 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.740
 the women say they win and s 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.830
 confess their wrongs because they target 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.920
 igo misplaced because we are drunk 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.170
 testosterone in defense and found 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.239
 rally for several reasons it takes 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.130
 not in account that has conditioning 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.309
 millennium behind all that if we 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.469
 look at the base of a man what is it 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.020
 it's a hunter of our a protector 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.140
 provided qatar then a resolution of 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.950
 emotional isolation issues and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.440
 non-household 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.370
 yeah in two more companies 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.559
 primitives 7am time sums up to this what 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.809
 means to be wrong in this 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.559
 task there meant what about the ten 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.390
 that you put in the body 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.030
 causing death or endangering 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.220
 so force or not be the one who 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.310
 was going to wear this free then if you 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.770
 do not you do not want them to be 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.689
 associated with you his site to fight of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.250
 anyway that people did not want 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.619
 whether there invites all parties 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.509
 August explains to your pasta have by 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.670
 example attempted chassis failed to 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.280
 lead 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.900
 game and it's not the family's fault 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.549
 the end she does not want that to explain 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.049
 little excuse you correct members 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.299
 will men are not used to 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.759
 simply to a thief wrong because 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.200
 that ben is like having a failure and 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.850
 before a ladder in these areas rats 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.750
 sauce that reduces their value or be 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.549
 it could just be a 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.369
 danger he could necessarily cause there 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.759
 in the killing so by grumbling 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:56.030
 to sum up the man confessed this horde 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.190
 and is important because it is confessing that the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.429
 night in check and it's up to you it's 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.149
 possible or who believes him or they 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.000
 should be 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.049
 So it hurts the ego and sees all 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.569
 what can stand it is there 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.640
 now we know like ok but here we 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.190
 must evolve we are in a society 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.260
 new paradigm how to make that 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.030
 your guy is ready to accept it 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.950
 this order who had who live and 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.180
 their regrets it's very simple you 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.000
 give as much as a lot of things that 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.090
 men take a walk around the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.100
 women and if it's not money it's 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.079
 not for lego it's going to be for 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.640
 fine so if you want your 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.410
 child you're going to have to make him 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.170
 understand that when you made him 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.630
 notice this gold is that want it 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.819
 admire this time it's not because you 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.829
 want 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.349
 to belittle him but because you love him 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.450
 and you want to not improve what 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.909
 wanted everyone that each passage aspires to 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.920
 to be the same person who can be 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.319
 so we have to improve and how is 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.319
 not perfect it's normal we have wrongs 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.500
 we look in the face we correct them 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.299
 in the take this is number 1 so he 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.950
 will me feel threatened not go to 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.480
 hockey because she herself - soul and 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.639
 arsenal is actually I'm going to be more 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.900
 receptive number 2 you will make him 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.579
 also understand that it gives him a 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.290
 competitive advantage over 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.109
 other good things as I say them 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.060
 that children is because they 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.829
 want finally like everything else 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.419
 I have a lot of people consuming that 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.159
 gives a competitive advantage through 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:23.680
 report to other men whose which 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.329
 you're going to see us do it's their 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.069
 make it clear that you are eliminating 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.650
 guys who are younger so they 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.510
 are men who are capable 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.919
 to accept their torpor that sinks to 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.579
 lied it's some form of 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.199
 maturity 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.329
 his name is someone who must be able 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.609
 in a couple having something of 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.900
 more baffles bones because they 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.629
 would be unable to fabre gold from 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.419
 things between the others its walls etc that 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.799
 So here longer wants to keep the face 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:51.009
 because it's so much more attractive 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.930
 a guy who is in such a way that a 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:56.199
 guy who plays tomorrow 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.299
 so if that's why he'll start 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.639
 to think about it because he does not want to lose 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.290
 life will start to change 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.720
 the building because it is used for its 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.919
 traders to try to change a 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.959
 conditioning without even it takes 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.689
 that the person really wants it so 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.069
 that for that does not feel threatened and worse 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.650
 a lens we understand that it's for better 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.090
 the person of real women a man you 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.650
 wanted to make understand something 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.880
 I tell him quick concise shock because 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.969
 as I say in pensions 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.740
 did not care kiki who cleans wanted 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:30.039
 the excuse of the time can be explained 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.909
 bled until yesterday fix up if the year venerated 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:35.740
 in a nice design it happens to your 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:39.370
 this spring his excuses this juice what 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.080
 corrects the situation and so he will do 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.960
 no effort on it but does not wish 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.260
 more to see with him and so you are a little 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.480
 more 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.610
 distant from a little less certainties or 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.920
 in phase maybe had a little bit more 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.620
 to have some favors so see 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.810
 my tears it was my little explanation 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.820
 on this phenomenon angie sport it has you 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.490
 helped when I explain and undermine the 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.890
 enriches and without begging it helped them 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.240
 so that's all there had been two 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.680
 children today I wish you to 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.680
 pass good luck goodbye
