 Automatically translated by the machine. Today's nail art is inspired by a very beautiful 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.870
 Stone: Bornite. I may be wrong with the pronunciation. 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.870
 It is full of beautiful dark purple, blue and pink. 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.179
 These are the nail polish colors I use. Same as any of the same techniques you can use. 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.250
 You also need a dice and an organization. Start with a basic dark purple base. 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.789
 It doesn't have to be neat at all. Add a drop of purple light tip and crush 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.609
 Organize a piece and tap it gently to form a pattern with tweezers. 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:55.510
 This same basic technique is used to add other colors, so if you don't feel confident 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.510
 It exercises a little bit first. Add a drop of pink flash around the base 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.870
 And repeat. You can use different items like sponges, 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.300
 Paper or fabric has different effects. Wrinkle your organization is 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.300
 Interesting mode. Add some dark spots to make up for any gaps 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.430
 And the DAB is in the place. Finally add some sparkling green highlights 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.890
 in the same way. The good pattern you get depends on your nail polish 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.900
 Consistency, so if you can't get it right, try leaving your nail polish a little dry 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.900
 Nail first. With a cuticle stick and clean any mess 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.740
 Organize your nail polish remover. Once dry, give all nails a clear top 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.069
 Coat. You are finished! 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.069
 Shiny, very beautiful. Like beautiful stones, inspired 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.340

 Goodbye!
