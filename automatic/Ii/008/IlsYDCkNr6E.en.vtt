00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
though when it's pistols like when

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.380 
though when it's pistols like when
people<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.130> bayonets<00:00:32.579> pretty<00:00:33.000> much<00:00:33.180> it's

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
people have bayonets pretty much it's

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.860 
people have bayonets pretty much it's
just<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.660> bayonet<00:00:33.840> bell<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.520> stills<00:00:36.480> pistol

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
just a bayonet bell but it stills pistol

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:46.340 
just a bayonet bell but it stills pistol
so<00:00:37.590> yeah<00:00:40.160> 55<00:00:41.160> damage<00:00:43.219> but<00:00:44.360> 1200<00:00:45.360> yeah<00:00:46.200> it's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
so yeah 55 damage but 1200 yeah it's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
so yeah 55 damage but 1200 yeah it's
pretty<00:00:46.590> insane<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.489> rate<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.730> fire

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
pretty insane the rate of fire

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.410 
pretty insane the rate of fire
surprisingly<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.079> has<00:00:49.110> more<00:00:49.440> than<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.950> LMG<00:00:50.820> 3

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
surprisingly it has more than the LMG 3

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.130 
surprisingly it has more than the LMG 3
I<00:00:52.910> did<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> review<00:00:54.300> video<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.050> was

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
I did a review video on that but it was

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.930 
I did a review video on that but it was
a<00:00:55.170> fail<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.920> audio<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.280> fucked<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.640> so

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
a fail because the audio is fucked up so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.979 
a fail because the audio is fucked up so
I<00:00:56.969> removed<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.570> free<00:01:00.719> fall<00:01:00.899> in

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
I removed it so it's free fall in

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.549 
I removed it so it's free fall in
downtown<00:01:01.500> joined<00:01:02.430> during<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> match<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:04.320> go

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
doesn't make any sense

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.479
