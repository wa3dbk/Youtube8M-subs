00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.640
 To us today a kitchen request is going 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.520
 teach you how to make stuffed potatoes 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.710
 and stuffed tomatoes are very easy and tasty 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.599
 You do not need to buy too much. 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.009
 Can you do for your family? 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.869
 can make someone you like 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.730
 can do for yourself is very good 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.970
 too good 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.809
 Are you going to need onion broccoli? 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.390
 atom tomato potato cheese and curd cheese 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.420
 but the grated cheese is optional and the 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.109
 cheese is chosen but it can be another 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.579
 flavor 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.109
 first of all need to catch the 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.379
 broccoli and put in the water to 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:53.199
 thaw hot water after you go 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.870
 cut the tomato and the potato you go 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.409
 make a black hole you can stuff 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.739
 You pick a knife and make a son with em. 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:05.379
 top of it and then you take your this 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.840
 cover and will transplant spoon up 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.580
 form a hole inside the tomato and then 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.140
 You can enjoy the pulp for later 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.210
 Do you want to make a tomato sauce? 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.460
 and then you do the same thing as the potato 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.470
 You cut is so much the top part. 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.000
 and will remove the filling 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.009
 then you can use the part you took 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.020
 how to cover bread in the oven 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.250
 I've already cut all the tomatoes and 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.799
 all the potatoes 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.930
 now we will throw water out will 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.170
 put in the sieve or take out the blocks 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.969
 It 's just that once you take it out 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.509
 You'll get the olive oil put in the 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.829
 same pan and for you braise broccoli 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.140
 with olive oil 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.600
 then the block came out of a braid on it 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.590
 the amount of broccoli that has a 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.969
 serve in one 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.770
 I think it's better for two 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.920
 fill up more because it gave to us is everything 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.140
 only two you better be stirring 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.780
 a little there to brave to be more 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.149
 Yummy even know now you're gonna cut 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.579
 an entire onion will revoke this 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.310
 I hope to be good to put 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.560
 as filling is also very tasty 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.340
 Leave bolton because you are 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.340
 very delicious 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.280
 It's our only way of seeing and giving me 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.140
 My God, mouth that delights ready 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.459
 blocks is also so ready and this is good 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.459
 It's ready too. 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.489
 Now we're going to fill up. 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.560
 in a form to be brought to the oven and 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.849
 you put the filling put first 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.580
 the onion 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.590
 then I put the broccoli on top and 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.120
 now turned the tuna tin square 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.489
 balance that lies within the Latin you 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.290
 can is lose in the field and then dump 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.950
 It's worse not to stay that thing in the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.049
 fifth 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.239
 Then I already took the oil, too. 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.420
 Nothing is falling and it's better when it's 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.420
 like this 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.910
 Oh my God, people look at my god 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.720
 and he does nec 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.570
 so we've already put the act 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.000
 nothing because it fell to the ground but I put the 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.860
 olimpo, people 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.530
 after this confusion I put the 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.770
 grated cheese on top and then I put 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.830
 the cheddar cheese on top of it to me later 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.880
 It tastes good and I also 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.370
 potatoes, right? 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.100
 the tomato does not have as much bell 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.180
 I put it in the oven and put it in 3 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.080
 130 degrees 150 degrees for about 40 minutes and then 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.150
 stay this way 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.709
 Delicious and the tomato stays capelinha but 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.260
 You can take it if you do not know you. 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.900
 likes to eat without her because the task 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.700
 stay soft, you can enlarge my god 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.830
 Look, the potato looks like potatoes. 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.890
 When are you going to the mall and have 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.330
 that stuffed potato knows that she is 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.860
 Do not forget the name of the store but have a 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.010
 shop that sells stuffed potatoes is very 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.010
 good 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.510
 that's what we hope you have 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.590
 liked this recipe 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.050
 Now I'll keep making more 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.250
 revenue because I took too long to do 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.780
 another recipe 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.690
 I think it's been more than two months since I 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.209
 I made no recipe when it came to making 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.209
 but because it's very tasty and I like it 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.310
 teach you then until the next 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.310
 edition of the lost in the kitchen bye
