focus of the lens to match the patient's
prescription<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:10.290> change<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.740> so<00:02:10.770> precise

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
prescription the change is so precise

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520 
prescription the change is so precise
and<00:02:11.310> accurate<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.180> actually<00:02:12.360> make<00:02:13.350> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
and accurate we can actually make the

and accurate we can actually make the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
lens bifocal or very focal as well so in

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.850 
lens bifocal or very focal as well so in
addition<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.550> giving<00:02:17.790> them<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> good<00:02:18.300> vision

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
addition to giving them a good vision

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.050 
addition to giving them a good vision
distance<00:02:19.860> we<00:02:20.070> can<00:02:20.160> actually<00:02:20.520> get<00:02:20.730> them<00:02:20.880> good

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
distance we can actually get them good

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.120 
distance we can actually get them good
vision<00:02:21.300> for<00:02:21.630> reading<00:02:22.080> intermediate<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
vision for reading intermediate and

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.640 
vision for reading intermediate and
distance<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.630> there<00:02:24.780> weren't<00:02:24.930> either<00:02:25.110> glasses

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
