moved<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:20.010> windshield<00:02:20.370> out<00:02:20.880> they<00:02:21.450> were<00:02:21.510> able

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
moved that windshield out they were able

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.440 
moved that windshield out they were able
to<00:02:21.959> create<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.440> cavity<00:02:22.739> in<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.250> front<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:24.209> put

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
to create a cavity in the front to put

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.600 
to create a cavity in the front to put
the<00:02:24.660> subwoofer<00:02:25.290> for<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:25.830> Bose<00:02:26.040> surround

the subwoofer for the Bose surround

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.850 
the subwoofer for the Bose surround
sound<00:02:27.060> system<00:02:27.480> or<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.930> Burmaster<00:02:28.260> surround

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
sound system or the Burmaster surround

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.650 
sound system or the Burmaster surround
sound<00:02:29.160> system<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.180> really<00:02:30.330> gives

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
sound system and so that really gives

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.170 
sound system and so that really gives
you<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> true<00:02:31.080> 5.1<00:02:31.860> surround<00:02:32.130> sound<00:02:32.580> system<00:02:33.060> as
