video<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.000> will<00:00:09.420> show<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.660> how<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.110> attach<00:00:10.620> a

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
video I will show you how to attach a

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.570 
video I will show you how to attach a
camera<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.610> tripod<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:13.160> basically<00:00:14.160> each

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
camera to a tripod and basically each

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.859 
camera to a tripod and basically each
tripod<00:00:15.179> can<00:00:15.389> be<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.750> little<00:00:16.260> different<00:00:17.000> but<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
tripod can be a little different but the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.470 
tripod can be a little different but the
basic<00:00:19.320> mechanisms<00:00:20.010> are<00:00:20.279> very<00:00:20.310> similar<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
basic mechanisms are very similar and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.330 
basic mechanisms are very similar and
you're<00:00:22.020> probably<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.830> able<00:00:22.980> to

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
you're probably going to be able to

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.179 
you're probably going to be able to
follow<00:00:24.240> along<00:00:24.420> with<00:00:24.840> your<00:00:25.050> own<00:00:25.289> tripod<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
follow along with your own tripod and

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.630 
follow along with your own tripod and
camera<00:00:26.599> combination<00:00:27.599> if<00:00:27.980> you're<00:00:28.980> doing<00:00:29.400> video

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
camera combination if you're doing video

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.479 
camera combination if you're doing video
it's<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.510> important<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.470> keep<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.980> camera

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
it's really important to keep the camera

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.389 
it's really important to keep the camera
as<00:00:32.640> steady<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.239> possible<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.590> tripod<00:00:34.950> is

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
as steady as possible and the tripod is

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.139 
as steady as possible and the tripod is
a<00:00:35.430> very<00:00:35.910> popular<00:00:36.480> way<00:00:36.660> as<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:38.129> photography<00:00:38.879> if

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
a very popular way as for photography if

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.209 
a very popular way as for photography if
you're<00:00:39.420> taking<00:00:39.870> long<00:00:40.110> exposures<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.040> things

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you're taking long exposures and things

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.810 
you're taking long exposures and things
like<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.399> you'll<00:00:42.329> notice<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.820> tripod

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
like that you'll notice that the tripod

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.500 
like that you'll notice that the tripod
can<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.480> very<00:00:46.170> useful<00:00:46.289> tool<00:00:46.710> also<00:00:47.510> alright

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
can be a very useful tool also alright

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.049 
can be a very useful tool also alright
so<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> lot<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:48.989> tripods<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.890> basically<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
so a lot of tripods have basically the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.080 
so a lot of tripods have basically the
same<00:00:51.449> principle<00:00:51.920> they<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.430> little<00:00:53.850> lever

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
same principle they have a little lever

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.170 
same principle they have a little lever
in<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.780> case<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> side<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.250> so

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
in this case it's on the side here so

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.590 
in this case it's on the side here so
you<00:00:57.239> pulled<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.109> lever<00:00:58.440> away<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.329> then<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
you pulled the lever away and then the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.340 
you pulled the lever away and then the
plate<00:01:00.899> pops<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.719> then<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:04.110> that

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
plate pops up and then you have that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.950 
plate pops up and then you have that
plate<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.970> little<00:01:06.360> screw<00:01:06.659> here

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
plate here so the little screw here

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.630 
plate here so the little screw here
that's<00:01:07.260> what's<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> screw<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
that's what's going to screw in the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.630 
that's what's going to screw in the
bottom<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.180> your<00:01:09.210> camera<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.220> if<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.430> go

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
bottom of your camera and if you go

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.969 
bottom of your camera and if you go
underneath<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:15.290> lot<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.470> them<00:01:16.650> have<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
underneath here a lot of them have a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.270 
underneath here a lot of them have a
little<00:01:17.520> thing<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.630> use<00:01:19.280> to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
little thing like that you can use to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.090 
little thing like that you can use to
help<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.729> screw<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.360> or<00:01:21.619> some<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.740> them<00:01:22.890> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
help you screw it in or some of them you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
help you screw it in or some of them you
might<00:01:23.280> require<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:24.119> screwdriver<00:01:24.750> or<00:01:25.080> something

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
might require a screwdriver or something

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.819 
might require a screwdriver or something
like<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.820> that's<00:01:26.820> where<00:01:27.150> every<00:01:27.619> tripod<00:01:28.619> is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
like that that's where every tripod is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.490 
like that that's where every tripod is
different<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:30.270> basically<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.320> same

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
different but basically it's the same

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.859 
different but basically it's the same
thing<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.950> all<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.280> them<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:35.299> if<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.509> look<00:01:36.689> in

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
thing for all of them and if you look in

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.080 
thing for all of them and if you look in
the<00:01:37.020> bottom<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> camera<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the bottom of the camera you have the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
the bottom of the camera you have the
quarter<00:01:39.630> inch<00:01:39.810> twenty<00:01:40.259> thread<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> bottom

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
quarter inch twenty thread in the bottom

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.639 
quarter inch twenty thread in the bottom
here<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.750> that's<00:01:42.750> where<00:01:43.049> you're<00:01:43.259> going<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
here so that's where you're going to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.550 
here so that's where you're going to
screw<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.340> little<00:01:44.700> screw<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.560> there's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
screw the little screw in and there's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.240 
screw the little screw in and there's
different<00:01:47.009> standards<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.549> sizes<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:49.040> 99%<00:01:50.040> of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
different standards for sizes but 99% of

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.080 
different standards for sizes but 99% of
the<00:01:50.670> tripod<00:01:52.369> mounts<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.490> bottom<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.060> your

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the tripod mounts in the bottom of your

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.469 
the tripod mounts in the bottom of your
camera<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.710> tripods<00:01:56.219> are<00:01:56.520> Porter<00:01:57.119> 20

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
camera and of the tripods are Porter 20

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.440 
camera and of the tripods are Porter 20
thread<00:01:58.009> some<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.040> them<00:01:59.280> are<00:01:59.460> bigger<00:01:59.700> if<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.240> go

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
thread some of them are bigger if you go

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.590 
thread some of them are bigger if you go
with<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.110> larger<00:02:02.100> video<00:02:02.369> cameras<00:02:02.939> especially

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
with the larger video cameras especially

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.059 
with the larger video cameras especially
but<00:02:05.090> most<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> equipment<00:02:06.840> that's

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
but most of the equipment that's

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.650 
but most of the equipment that's
actually<00:02:08.069> affordable<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.849> usually<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
actually affordable is usually the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.800 
actually affordable is usually the
quarter<00:02:10.110> twenty<00:02:10.470> thread<00:02:11.209> so<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.300> just<00:02:12.660> go

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
quarter twenty thread so you just go

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
quarter twenty thread so you just go
like<00:02:12.989> this<00:02:13.050> it

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
like this it

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.380 
like this it
the<00:02:14.270> tread<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.870> put<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.560> hole<00:02:17.390> then

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
the tread you put it in the hole then

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.740 
the tread you put it in the hole then
you<00:02:18.420> twist<00:02:18.960> this<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:20.210> and<00:02:21.210> you're<00:02:21.480> going<00:02:21.720> to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
you twist this in and you're going to

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
there's no issue with that and then you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.170
