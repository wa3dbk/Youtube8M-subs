00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.569
 hello very good everyone here street 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.430
 is commenting on a new video and good 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.490
 in the first all the typical what all 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.560
 the world says okay obviously it's a 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.050
 pleasure is to raise a game like this to 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.350
 polidori channel because the truth is 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.150
 that really is that in this 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.010
 community really if there's nobody 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.750
 offer you opportunities like this is 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.210
 very difficult to grow and the truth is that it is 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.460
 a very good detail on his part 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.100
 we asked if I could sponsor I do not know 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.380
 if any game we liked and 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.930
 others we spend a break you will lose 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.560
 We had this which is what he has said 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.470
 liked more 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.660
 is a 157 to 7 for the final result not 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.280
 I know if it will put the title that but it is 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.230
 a pretty good game 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.630
 the minutes are clear that the record is still 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.620
 easier it is obvious is a map that I already 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.870
 I know a lot about black ops 1 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.930
 are the spaces that I know most about 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.640
 game along with some other map so 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.110
 Well sure there will be some comment 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.110
 that will not seem quite right 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.710
 well, that has been a kind of tie 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.820
 but good as I say that maybe to 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.280
 everyone does not like it but still 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.550
 I think a very good part so 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.630
 good and once said the beginning we're going 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.400
 to see our channel on our channel 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.690
 community vale we are two people me and 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.979
 another friend is worth we raise call games 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.410
 of duty applies particularly useful carlos 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.340
 we also upload speed arts for which 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.200
 do not know what it is, then when you 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.630
 you make a background a background is the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.420
 channel background of a person when you 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.100
 what are you doing someone can you 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.690
 record and then move to the fast camera 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.160
 and put a background song for that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.740
 we do also make valera 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.850
 macros tutorials so that people 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.009
 learn to do them themselves 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.110
 we also come up from time to time slender 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.590
 we have only climbed once and it was in 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.240
 the special one 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.289
 you do not know me and it was in a special I think 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.439
 that can special thousand subscribers 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.480
 but I do not remember so we have 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.130
 pretty variety the truth 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.350
 we have not taken this very seriously 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.630
 upload videos the truth is that a lot 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.280
 people believe that uploading videos is something very 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.480
 easy to touch on the balls and 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.150
 that practically doing nothing 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.620
 or let's say that people like it but 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.849
 it's really not like that you have to get out of 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.409
 the games then record them comment 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.239
 render them and upload them to the best 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.220
 it costs me perfectly three hours 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.750
 and half or four everything is worth 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.270
 whatever it is if you take the game to 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.040
 comment render the upload 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.740
 so it's a way we do but what 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.570
 we do because we like it obviously 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.790
 project in some moments of the video 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.860
 you will see that we move to fast camera 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.950
 because the hard video I think lasted 10 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.190
 minutes and beaks and he told us by mistake and 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.560
 it's good that we passed some parts 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.060
 to faster camera and that's what I've 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.430
 I have done it as I could 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.680
 because I really did not know how to move on 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.660
 fast camera on the sony vegas just use 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.390
 You can now render the video 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.590
 I really do not know what's wrong with me 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.450
 is pasting one of the data to 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.330
 incredible computer 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.860
 we just wanted to comment that 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.319
 all those people who love 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.680
 subscribe it is worth doing so if they are going to see 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.500
 the videos because we really have 1200 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.120
 subscribers worth we have about 200 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.120
 Video visits 200 or 250 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.920
 however daily visits we have 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.210
 almost 1000 that's pretty pretty well 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.460
 so we hope that good with this 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.560
 sponsorship we do not expect to click on 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.540
 subscribers we only hope that if 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.100
 we won 50 that those 50 are visits 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.800
 active means that each video that 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.810
 let's see what you give your opinion on 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.350
 each video either good or bad always 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.620
 with respect it is worth the only and again 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.739
 I 'm starting to worry 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.090
 of the computer of the cojones but good 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.950
 we just wanted to clarify this that to 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.930
 who likes to only subscribe 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.000
 if you are going to watch the videos because the truth 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.190
 is that on youtube it is very difficult to have 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.069
 active visits and our goal is 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.920
 every time having more active visits 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.560
 we are partners we are with sociable and it is 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.299
 a company that in my opinion we made 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.190
 well in catching the partner because it comes 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.970
 very well to grow to be able to program 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.470
 porters are very uploaded thumbnails 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.840
 Well, bad motherfucker by the way 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.060
 here it happened in fast camera it 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.889
 will hear weird I do not know if it will look very very 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.280
 fast because as I see it I see 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.720
 quite slow but I do not know was the first 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.190
 that happened to fast camera the truth that 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.060
 with the thread starmine edge in this 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.130
 game but it 's true I think he pulled me 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.350
 30 casualties in the first of these 28 in the 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.300
 second and 18 in the third is a 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.830
 barbarity practically almost all the 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.120
 low I do it with only the dow 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.430
 distance so just clarify that 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.110
 It's worth kids are half of us 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.660
 doing enough strength to climb a 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.249
 video diary is supposed to be with 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.079
 vacations is easier but really 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.789
 and even less at Christmas, being that 

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:00.219
 many days you have to be with your 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.629
 family more so that effort of 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.460
 moment of the writers that we have what 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:06.400
 they are valuing 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.020
 and good that as I say it is an opportunity 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.419
 the truth very large videos 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:14.139
 this guy are very difficult to comment 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.729
 since they last a lot and sometimes you 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.250
 end the topic because you have me in 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.630
 my head there is a kind of plan what 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.380
 I was going to comment 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.810
 so good 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.000
 that we are going to upload to the channel we have 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.550
 very good quiet games that you go 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.050
 to have more losses or more games 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.270
 as of 100 casualties 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.020
 when we have gone up when it has gone up 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.330
 is by mistake already to your channel in the 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.240
 our already will probably have three 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.330
 videos how to say losses are worth good 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.290
 we have a one hundred to 19 small school 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:51.170
 worth a 109 to 19 with the same weapon with 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.860
 the vector my same accessories and everything 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.820
 because I think the next game 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.720
 you know that I get good games and 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.390
 followed I also have a 101 to 6 in 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.370
 low confirmed that our entire part 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.380
 I do not know please and this is true that I 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.249
 I would like you to comment on it jce I do not know if 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.579
 you will pass 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:13.019
 Suddenly movie mode records us a 

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:15.629
 whole game especially record a chub 

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:16.729
 the truth because I do not understand why by 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:19.069
 what 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.900
 I do not know, you should keep the part but 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:22.879
 good things that happen and only 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.349
 he kept the first four minutes but 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:27.499
 that good also in the result 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:29.349
 final puts 101 to 6 that we did not try 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:32.689
 do the plot or anything like that 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:35.029
 we also have a 127 to 20 does not kill 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:38.150
 quite a few times but it loads me a lot 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:39.770
 it will arise that so good I feel you a 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.539
 siesta is also simple that in the 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.949
 I'm not going to say that the 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:45.319
 games that we upload are in maps 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.430
 small is normal but we have a 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:48.370
 very bad connection 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.960
 ok we have a very very sad connection 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.210
 david has gabi is the other member of the 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.009
 channel has 6 megabytes hired 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.870
 three or four arrive I do not have 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:00.080
 contracted 12 but I get 8 or so 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.210
 quite little and the truth that I think that 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.469
 has enough merit with the connection of 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.120
 shit that we have now our 

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:07.430
 departures this game you will see that I have 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.199
 that had four stripes three four stripes 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.089
 alternating and it's because the host was a 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:13.400
 my friend was Spanish and of course the 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:16.460
 Spanish settings help a lot 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.259
 so we have very good games 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:23.240
 we also have games in other maps 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:25.550
 we have in 2 also in square 63 2 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.310
 with the karachi is the truth and I 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.690
 I can only assure you that it's good if 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.910
 subscribe to the channel a daily video 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.970
 you are going to have safe insurance at least 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.470
 a daily video that all the games 

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.410
 what you see are going to be good games 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.940
 we also go up bounce bounces is the 

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.199
 but it is one from time to time 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.789
 and we got a lot to us because 

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:45.710
 obviously people want to see this 

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:46.970
 game by the way beige that the whole part 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.100
 end of the video we passed it to camera
