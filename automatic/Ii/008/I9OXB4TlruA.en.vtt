Hello and welcome to this short GTA IV tutorial slash help tutorial

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.440
This is supposed to be helping people who have

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.520
constant GTA IV crash after about 10 minutes

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.980
Usually because they've modded their game to an extent

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.700
where the game engine can't handle what they've done.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.040
I have found a workaround for this, and it works for me
