00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.870
 cabin where we are in front of this god 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.210
 rig the red is a bright intense red 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.279
 with the traditional tweet grill 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:22.350
 that he created from the beginning around 1910 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.210
 1900 1903 truth is when you create this 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.820
 great giant grill and since then 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.380
 it's part of the buick tradition and 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.320
 now this new platform is presented 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.530
 it's elvis rigal which I already had 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.390
 opportunity to try in inlet in the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.079
 highway of the valley roads 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.230
 Guadalupe is a very thrifty vehicle 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.300
 in consumption manageable with much 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.440
 precision and perhaps what I like the most 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.180

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.740
 more I liked about this car is the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.470
 suspension 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.800

 aggressive with very expressive lines what 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.420
 You can see how you say from the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.660
 front grill that is shaped like 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.300
 waterfall and also elongated headlights with 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.190
 LED lighting in terms of handling is 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.550
 very agile handling very dynamic as 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.600
 well you say we have also 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.610
 six- speed automatic transmission 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.729
 speeds with modes of changes 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.830
 manuals in the interiors in beige 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.500
 Special leather finished in wood in 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.479
 different ranges of wood motor two 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.820

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.110

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.160
 the belt monito I'm going to stop 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.259
 handle the microphone for the successes that 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.100
 are those of the communication system 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.280

 here we have several cameras let me put 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.980
 the little air we put it to 17 brings a 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.330
 digital board a texture in as a thing 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.360

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.520
 next in high tuesday battery yes of 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.680
 done we have two different interiors 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.720

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.670
 Obviously black leather seats and in 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.280
 wooden place brings finished in black 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.140
 piano that is a little bit brighter in 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.050
 contrast with the keypad that you are 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.700
 mentioning right now is in matte color in 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.260
 this case we brought the color red 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.030
 exterior with camel colored interiors 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.030
 which comes in combination with wood 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.830
 exact matte finish 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.450
 they say that after a glass of wine 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.250
 of table what is a woman in 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.780
 power to verify that different 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.790
 periods and that money handles very well to 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.519
 the right from here goes through all the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.830
 holes exactly how can you see the 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.220
 system of 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.410
 suspension and cushioning is very 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.540
 well tuned and on the other hand 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.390
 we have a lot of technology in the video store 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.160
 as you can see we have a system of 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.820
 intel and links that the system 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.580
 navigation and entertainment in a 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.070
 7 inch screen 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.310
 also in addition to navigation we bring 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.580
 new bugs how can this be is 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.620
 marc de lyon that this radio is via 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.990
 internet when you have your cell phone or your 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.600
 smartphone connected via bluetooth with 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.390
 the radio then also hear stations 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.280
 other countries and say that is super cool 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.990
 and he had not shown it to me on his phone 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.570
 in the next you will turn into u 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:58.310
 and if monism accelerates all the 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:02.570
 four 2 02,020 liters turbo with 220 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.610
 horses and 258 foot-pounds of torque that 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.110
 it's a lot of speed for a woman I do not know 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.380
 if it 's worth it to put yourself 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:13.880

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.740

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.670
 A lot of attention to detail in both 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.790
 the quality of the materials as in the 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.040
 interior space and if you raise the glass 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.470
 we can isolate both omar in the 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.200
 cabin thanks to the insulation system 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.910
 of noise quiet tooling that is 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.920
 characteristic in the brand view I by 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.370
 security brought the window open only 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.990
 in case I had to run 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.280
 because women are driving 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.580

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:33.380
 we put this and also with different 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.960
 textures the right skin brings in 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:40.370
 French stitching that are the edges of

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.210
 commented a little while ago regarding the 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.460
 Intellilink live systems that can be 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.979

 see here in the Spanish central console 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:06.530
 of outdoors and that allows you to drive 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:10.729
 the screen from the comfort of not 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:13.520
 have seven bikes forward keep 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:15.470

 you have to drink more more cabernet wine 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.780
