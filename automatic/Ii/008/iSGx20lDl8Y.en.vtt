00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:46.780 

yeah<00:06:31.410> what<00:06:31.650> an<00:06:31.860> understanding<00:06:32.430> of<00:06:32.720> all<00:06:33.720> this

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
it off Rodney's just ripping the brush

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:06.850 
it off Rodney's just ripping the brush
off<00:06:55.140> himself<00:06:55.350> and<00:06:55.710> ash<00:06:55.920> between<00:06:56.370> flowers
