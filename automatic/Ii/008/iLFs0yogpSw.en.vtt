obviously<00:01:11.460> depending<00:01:11.789> on<00:01:11.880> where<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.149> go<00:01:12.179> and

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
improved a lot from that I think I got

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.210 
improved a lot from that I think I got
it<00:01:17.160> done<00:01:17.240> four<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.450> five<00:01:18.660> times<00:01:18.929> and<00:01:19.289> I'd<00:01:19.950> stop

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it done four or five times and I'd stop

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.680 
it done four or five times and I'd stop
getting<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.550> done<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.450> quite

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
getting it done because it's quite

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.690 
getting it done because it's quite
expensive<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.320> pay<00:01:22.470> every<00:01:22.710> month<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:23.580> your

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
expensive to pay every month for your

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.150 
expensive to pay every month for your
eyebrows<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.659> all<00:01:24.899> I<00:01:24.929> do<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.920> keep<00:01:26.039> the

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
eyebrows so all I do now is to keep the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.729 
eyebrows so all I do now is to keep the
shape<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.459> them<00:01:26.550> I<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.789> tweeze<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.450> any<00:01:28.380> of

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:28.739 
shape of them I just tweeze and any of

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:30.290 
shape of them I just tweeze and any of
the<00:01:28.860> hairs<00:01:29.069> that<00:01:29.220> are<00:01:29.280> growing<00:01:29.550> back<00:01:29.789> from<00:01:30.060> so

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
the hairs that are growing back from so

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.910 
the hairs that are growing back from so
they<00:01:30.450> should<00:01:30.599> be<00:01:30.750> quite<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.170> similar<00:01:31.530> shape<00:01:31.679> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
they should be quite a similar shape and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.979 
they should be quite a similar shape and
also<00:01:32.190> sometimes<00:01:32.670> I'll<00:01:32.819> trim<00:01:33.030> them<00:01:33.239> because

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:33.989 
also sometimes I'll trim them because

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:36.680 
also sometimes I'll trim them because
they<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.349> long<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.759> know<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:36.509> looks

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
they can get long and you know not looks

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.609 
they can get long and you know not looks
good<00:01:36.959> so<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.500> trim<00:01:38.039> them<00:01:38.190> so<00:01:39.060> that's<00:01:39.330> basically

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
good so I trim them so that's basically

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.020 
good so I trim them so that's basically
what<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.649> do<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:41.099> my<00:01:41.130> eyebrows<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:41.940> do

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
what I do with my eyebrows I just do

use and stuff like that she can tell i
look<00:03:09.940> pretty<00:03:09.970> weird<00:03:10.360> without<00:03:10.570> my<00:03:10.810> house<00:03:11.170> on<00:03:11.380> so

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
look pretty weird without my house on so

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.580 
look pretty weird without my house on so
what<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.460> do<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.510> comb<00:03:14.020> them<00:03:14.200> through<00:03:14.380> with<00:03:14.500> a

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
what I do is I comb them through with a

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.530 
what I do is I comb them through with a
spoon<00:03:14.830> late<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.100> just<00:03:15.310> use<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.850> Sedona<00:03:16.300> Lacey

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
spoon late I just use the Sedona Lacey

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.360 
spoon late I just use the Sedona Lacey
b-17<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.410> has<00:03:17.530> actually<00:03:17.830> got<00:03:17.950> an<00:03:18.040> angled<00:03:18.370> brush

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
b-17 it has actually got an angled brush

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.310 
b-17 it has actually got an angled brush
on<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.700> end<00:03:18.790> but<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.360> don't<00:03:19.840> like<00:03:19.960> this<00:03:20.140> one

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
on the end but I don't like this one

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.980 
on the end but I don't like this one
because<00:03:20.440> as<00:03:20.830> you<00:03:20.920> can<00:03:20.950> see<00:03:21.070> it's<00:03:21.520> really<00:03:21.990> like

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
because as you can see it's really like

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.800 
because as you can see it's really like
thick<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.650> it's<00:03:23.980> just<00:03:24.190> not<00:03:24.310> very<00:03:24.340> good<00:03:24.670> at

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
thick and it's just not very good at

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.840 
thick and it's just not very good at
doing<00:03:25.810> what<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:26.020> want<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.350> do<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:26.850> just

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
doing what you want it to do so just

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.540 
doing what you want it to do so just
brush<00:03:28.270> them<00:03:28.510> out<00:03:32.100> now<00:03:33.100> as<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.310> can<00:03:33.490> see

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
brush them out now as you can see

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.580 
brush them out now as you can see
they're<00:03:33.850> really<00:03:34.120> not<00:03:34.240> the<00:03:34.390> same<00:03:34.570> at<00:03:34.840> all<00:03:34.930> and

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
they're really not the same at all and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.930 
they're really not the same at all and
I've<00:03:35.680> never<00:03:35.860> been<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.100> say<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:36.460> were<00:03:36.670> getting

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
I've never been to say we were getting

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.490 
I've never been to say we were getting
on<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.120> they<00:03:37.270> just<00:03:37.690> not<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.870> same<00:03:38.020> if<00:03:38.380> you

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
on the they just not the same if you

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.670 
on the they just not the same if you
apply<00:03:38.890> my<00:03:39.160> power<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:40.210> use<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.840> echo<00:03:41.410> tools

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
apply my power I use the echo tools

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.410 
apply my power I use the echo tools
angled<00:03:42.100> brush<00:03:42.400> I've<00:03:42.730> gone<00:03:42.910> through<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.180> few<00:03:43.210> of

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
angled brush I've gone through a few of

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.460 
angled brush I've gone through a few of
these<00:03:43.540> because<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:43.990> really<00:03:44.230> like<00:03:44.320> the

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
these because I really like the

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.070 
these because I really like the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
different a favorite line HD brow kit

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.640 
different a favorite line HD brow kit
and<00:03:47.290> I<00:03:47.620> use<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.550> mixture<00:03:49.480> of<00:03:49.720> these<00:03:50.290> two<00:03:50.350> which

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
and I use a mixture of these two which

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.750 
and I use a mixture of these two which
have<00:03:50.800> probably<00:03:51.070> already<00:03:51.190> explained<00:03:51.580> in<00:03:51.700> the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
have probably already explained in the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.180 
have probably already explained in the
video<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.470> mixture<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.560> these<00:03:53.710> two<00:03:53.860> so

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
video a mixture of these two so

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.520 
video a mixture of these two so
basically<00:03:54.670> just<00:03:55.360> dab<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.690> in<00:03:55.840> there<00:03:56.050> in<00:03:56.080> there

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
basically just dab it in there in there

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.400 
basically just dab it in there in there
and<00:03:56.770> just<00:03:56.860> kind<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.540> go<00:03:58.540> between<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:58.930> two<00:03:59.200> and

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
and just kind of go between the two and

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.780 
and just kind of go between the two and
then<00:03:59.560> doing<00:03:59.890> shot<00:04:01.200> like<00:04:02.200> little<00:04:02.620> stroke<00:04:03.400> so

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
then doing shot like little stroke so

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.330 
then doing shot like little stroke so
that<00:04:04.030> it's<00:04:04.180> more<00:04:04.390> likely<00:04:05.020> to<00:04:05.440> mimic<00:04:05.800> brochure

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
that it's more likely to mimic brochure

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.680 
that it's more likely to mimic brochure
now<00:04:06.610> i<00:04:06.640> know<00:04:06.730> because<00:04:07.060> i<00:04:07.270> have<00:04:07.300> my<00:04:07.480> eyebrows

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
now i know because i have my eyebrows

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.570 
now i know because i have my eyebrows
quite<00:04:07.900> dad<00:04:08.080> I'm<00:04:08.650> not<00:04:08.860> fooling<00:04:09.160> anyone<00:04:09.340> that

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
quite dad I'm not fooling anyone that

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.920 
quite dad I'm not fooling anyone that
the<00:04:09.670> real<00:04:09.820> but<00:04:10.060> I'd<00:04:10.180> rather<00:04:10.330> they<00:04:10.600> look<00:04:10.780> more

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
the real but I'd rather they look more

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.250 
the real but I'd rather they look more
real<00:04:11.140> than<00:04:11.290> last<00:04:11.740> room<00:04:11.980> so<00:04:12.370> I<00:04:12.810> always<00:04:13.810> start<00:04:14.110> at

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
real than last room so I always start at

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.450 
real than last room so I always start at
the<00:04:14.350> inner<00:04:14.470> corner<00:04:14.830> know<00:04:14.950> some<00:04:15.130> people<00:04:15.340> like

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
the inner corner know some people like

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.690 
the inner corner know some people like
to<00:04:15.520> start<00:04:15.910> further<00:04:16.180> out<00:04:16.390> and<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:17.739> always<00:04:18.370> start

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
to start further out and I always start

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.850 
to start further out and I always start
at<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:18.940> beginning

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.960 

as<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.010> can<00:04:25.100> see<00:04:25.250> i'm<00:04:25.340> doing<00:04:25.520> like<00:04:25.639> short

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
as you can see i'm doing like short

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.150 
as you can see i'm doing like short
motions<00:04:26.540> and<00:04:26.900> it's<00:04:27.199> easier<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.590> control<00:04:27.770> the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
motions and it's easier to control the

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.950 
motions and it's easier to control the
shape<00:04:28.340> as<00:04:28.550> well<00:04:28.699> if<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:28.940> just<00:04:29.090> do<00:04:29.540> one<00:04:29.750> long

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
shape as well if you just do one long

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.879 
shape as well if you just do one long
thing<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.350> you<00:04:30.410> get<00:04:30.560> it<00:04:30.650> wrong<00:04:30.800> with<00:04:32.560> so<00:04:33.560> i<00:04:33.590> do

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
thing and you get it wrong with so i do

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.780 
thing and you get it wrong with so i do
that<00:04:34.190> underneath<00:04:34.490> underneath<00:04:35.000> line<00:04:35.600> first

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.040 

just<00:04:40.790> so<00:04:40.970> that<00:04:41.150> I've<00:04:41.240> got<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.419> shape<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:41.930> it

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
just so that I've got the shape of it

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.070 
just so that I've got the shape of it
and<00:04:42.880> then<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:44.060> drew<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.360> line<00:04:44.479> on<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.690> top<00:04:44.870> and

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
and then I drew the line on the top and

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.700 
and then I drew the line on the top and
then<00:04:45.199> I<00:04:45.229> fill<00:04:45.440> it<00:04:45.560> in<00:04:45.680> so<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.910> what<00:04:47.350> I<00:04:48.350> try<00:04:48.560> not

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
then I fill it in so and what I try not

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.010 
then I fill it in so and what I try not
to<00:04:48.770> do<00:04:49.010> which<00:04:49.550> I<00:04:49.850> tend<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.300> do<00:04:50.449> more<00:04:50.600> on<00:04:50.900> this

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
to do which I tend to do more on this

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.210 
to do which I tend to do more on this
side<00:04:51.260> rail<00:04:51.440> because<00:04:51.530> this<00:04:51.770> one<00:04:51.919> seems<00:04:52.100> to<00:04:52.160> be

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
side rail because this one seems to be

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.730 
side rail because this one seems to be
straighter<00:04:52.550> is<00:04:52.910> i<00:04:53.330> make<00:04:53.540> sure<00:04:53.570> that<00:04:53.780> i<00:04:53.990> try<00:04:54.710> and

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
straighter is i make sure that i try and

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.280 
straighter is i make sure that i try and
keep<00:04:54.860> my<00:04:55.010> face<00:04:55.610> expression<00:04:56.150> normal<00:04:57.020> when<00:04:57.200> I'm

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
keep my face expression normal when I'm

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.420 
keep my face expression normal when I'm
doing<00:04:57.380> it<00:04:57.500> because<00:04:57.530> sometimes<00:04:58.010> tend<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.310> go

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
doing it because sometimes tend to go

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.159 
doing it because sometimes tend to go
like<00:04:58.550> this<00:04:58.729> and<00:04:58.970> then<00:04:59.450> the<00:04:59.540> shape<00:04:59.720> different

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
like this and then the shape different

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.620 
like this and then the shape different
to<00:05:00.500> when<00:05:00.650> out<00:05:00.860> if<00:05:01.070> you<00:05:01.190> can<00:05:01.340> see<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:02.419> want<00:05:02.570> to

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
to when out if you can see you want to

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.180 
to when out if you can see you want to
find<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:02.840> down<00:05:02.990> this<00:05:03.139> one<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.650> I<00:05:03.770> seems<00:05:03.979> to<00:05:04.100> be

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
find it down this one and I seems to be

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.219 
find it down this one and I seems to be
a<00:05:04.370> lot<00:05:04.610> straighter<00:05:05.419> than<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.750> other<00:05:05.870> one<00:05:05.990> so

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
a lot straighter than the other one so

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.540 
a lot straighter than the other one so
if<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:06.590> do<00:05:06.770> your<00:05:06.919> eyebrows<00:05:07.160> like<00:05:07.280> that<00:05:07.460> and

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
if you do your eyebrows like that and

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.530 
if you do your eyebrows like that and
then<00:05:07.639> you<00:05:07.700> put<00:05:07.820> them<00:05:07.940> down<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.180> difference

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
then you put them down the difference

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:17.970 
then you put them down the difference
though<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:10.880> now<00:05:11.030> I'll<00:05:11.150> go<00:05:11.300> along<00:05:11.479> the<00:05:11.660> top

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.100 

and<00:05:18.070> then<00:05:18.790> I<00:05:18.820> get<00:05:19.180> where<00:05:19.450> these<00:05:19.630> heads<00:05:19.960> are

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
and then I get where these heads are

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.530 
and then I get where these heads are
here<00:05:20.170> this<00:05:20.560> is<00:05:20.770> where<00:05:21.360> it's<00:05:22.360> coming<00:05:22.600> down<00:05:22.840> from

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.850 

so<00:05:27.540> the<00:05:27.720> top<00:05:27.900> pipe<00:05:28.110> now<00:05:28.260> and<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.500> line<00:05:28.650> it<00:05:28.800> up

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
so the top pipe now and a line it up

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.290 
so the top pipe now and a line it up
with<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:29.130> top<00:05:29.550> of

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
with the top of

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.429 
with the top of
cuz<00:05:32.300> I've<00:05:32.419> naturally<00:05:32.749> got<00:05:32.869> into<00:05:32.989> brow<00:05:33.139> hairs

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:33.439 
cuz I've naturally got into brow hairs

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.770 
cuz I've naturally got into brow hairs
here

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.890 

and<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.710> tend<00:05:37.920> to<00:05:38.010> fill<00:05:38.190> it<00:05:38.280> in<00:05:38.400> with<00:05:38.550> the

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
and I tend to fill it in with the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.060 
and I tend to fill it in with the
lighter<00:05:39.900> one<00:05:40.170> it's<00:05:40.350> already<00:05:40.620> got<00:05:40.740> some<00:05:40.920> of<00:05:41.010> the

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
lighter one it's already got some of the

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.129 
lighter one it's already got some of the
darker<00:05:41.400> powder<00:05:41.610> like<00:05:42.240> in<00:05:42.480> it<00:05:42.600> so<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.840> is<00:05:42.960> still

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
darker powder like in it so it is still

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.850 
darker powder like in it so it is still
a<00:05:43.200> mixture<00:05:43.470> it's<00:05:43.650> just<00:05:43.830> not<00:05:43.980> as<00:05:44.100> dark<00:05:44.360> and<00:05:45.860> then

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
a mixture it's just not as dark and then

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.220 
a mixture it's just not as dark and then
I'm<00:05:47.040> not<00:05:47.190> as<00:05:47.690> precise<00:05:48.690> with<00:05:48.930> dicks<00:05:49.139> because

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
I'm not as precise with dicks because

00:05:49.230 --> 00:06:04.810 
I'm not as precise with dicks because
you<00:05:49.410> just<00:05:49.560> filling<00:05:49.919> in<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.130> gaps<00:05:50.340> really

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.640 

so<00:06:05.820> now<00:06:05.940> you<00:06:06.030> can<00:06:06.150> see<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:07.110> difference<00:06:07.440> in<00:06:07.560> my

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
so now you can see the difference in my

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.500 
so now you can see the difference in my
eyebrows<00:06:07.980> I<00:06:08.130> always<00:06:08.310> think<00:06:08.520> when<00:06:08.880> you<00:06:09.030> look<00:06:09.060> at

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
eyebrows I always think when you look at

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.060 
eyebrows I always think when you look at
the<00:06:09.600> difference<00:06:09.960> like<00:06:10.290> that<00:06:10.530> this<00:06:10.860> looks

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
the difference like that this looks

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.640 
the difference like that this looks
really<00:06:11.250> hard<00:06:11.550> to<00:06:11.640> actually<00:06:11.820> when<00:06:12.380> you've<00:06:13.380> kind

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
really hard to actually when you've kind

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.180 
really hard to actually when you've kind
of<00:06:13.740> done<00:06:13.800> it<00:06:13.980> all<00:06:14.210> hmm<00:06:15.770> then<00:06:16.770> it<00:06:16.890> doesn't<00:06:17.040> look

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
of done it all hmm then it doesn't look

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.640 
of done it all hmm then it doesn't look
that<00:06:17.250> bad<00:06:17.520> 82<00:06:18.510> smoothly<00:06:18.810> again<00:06:19.140> I<00:06:19.170> just<00:06:19.290> come

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
that bad 82 smoothly again I just come

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.590 
that bad 82 smoothly again I just come
through<00:06:19.680> it<00:06:20.070> not<00:06:20.520> too<00:06:20.730> much<00:06:20.910> just<00:06:20.970> take<00:06:21.510> the

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
through it not too much just take the

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.200 
through it not too much just take the
powder<00:06:21.780> out<00:06:21.990> but<00:06:22.140> it<00:06:22.200> just<00:06:22.610> softens<00:06:23.610> it<00:06:23.910> a<00:06:24.000> bit

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
powder out but it just softens it a bit

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.760 
powder out but it just softens it a bit
and<00:06:25.040> then<00:06:26.040> on<00:06:26.220> to<00:06:26.370> the<00:06:26.460> other<00:06:26.640> eyebrow<00:06:27.410> which<00:06:28.410> I

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.710 
and then on to the other eyebrow which I
do<00:06:29.040> is<00:06:29.190> better<00:06:29.400> come<00:06:29.700> but<00:06:29.880> this<00:06:30.000> is<00:06:30.150> my<00:06:30.300> least

want most of the time so again let's

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.490 
want most of the time so again let's
start<00:06:41.820> with<00:06:41.910> uni<00:06:42.270> but<00:06:42.900> where<00:06:43.080> is<00:06:43.200> with<00:06:43.350> this

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
start with uni but where is with this

one<00:06:43.680> it<00:06:43.800> goes<00:06:43.890> up<00:06:44.160> like<00:06:44.430> there's<00:06:44.640> a<00:06:44.670> big<00:06:44.820> arch

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
one it goes up like there's a big arch

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.370 
one it goes up like there's a big arch
there's<00:06:45.270> really<00:06:45.420> not<00:06:45.600> much<00:06:45.750> of<00:06:45.810> an<00:06:45.990> arch<00:06:46.110> on

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
there's really not much of an arch on

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.270 
there's really not much of an arch on
this<00:06:46.500> one<00:06:47.030> it's<00:06:48.030> really<00:06:48.450> annoying<00:06:48.900> and<00:06:49.290> then

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
this one it's really annoying and then

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.350 
this one it's really annoying and then
what<00:06:50.460> tends<00:06:50.670> to<00:06:50.730> do<00:06:50.790> with<00:06:50.880> this<00:06:50.940> and<00:06:51.120> once<00:06:51.240> I'm

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
what tends to do with this and once I'm

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.060 
what tends to do with this and once I'm
got<00:06:51.510> to<00:06:51.540> like<00:06:51.750> half<00:06:51.960> ways<00:06:52.200> I<00:06:52.230> starting<00:06:52.770> the<00:06:52.860> top

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
got to like half ways I starting the top

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:59.320 
got to like half ways I starting the top
I<00:06:53.220> don't<00:06:53.400> know<00:06:53.520> why<00:06:53.760> I<00:06:53.990> do<00:06:54.990> it<00:06:55.020> that<00:06:55.470> way<00:06:55.650> and

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.240 

then<00:07:00.330> again<00:07:00.660> I<00:07:00.690> find<00:07:00.810> where<00:07:01.290> it's<00:07:01.980> going<00:07:02.160> to<00:07:02.190> go

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
then again I find where it's going to go

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:18.610 
then again I find where it's going to go
up<00:07:02.490> from<00:07:03.440> fill<00:07:04.440> that<00:07:04.620> big
