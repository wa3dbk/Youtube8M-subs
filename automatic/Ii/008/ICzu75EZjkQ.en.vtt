we'll<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.369> play<00:01:35.520> something<00:01:35.790> here

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.050 

so<00:01:42.619> there<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:42.830> go<00:01:42.920> now<00:01:43.100> we<00:01:43.159> can<00:01:43.400> see<00:01:43.700> the

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
so there we go now we can see the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.910 
so there we go now we can see the
difference<00:01:44.450> between<00:01:44.600> these<00:01:44.869> tracks<00:01:45.229> so<00:01:45.710> right

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
difference between these tracks so right

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.429 
difference between these tracks so right
there<00:01:46.220> is<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.970> rig<00:01:47.149> sound<00:01:47.479> you<00:01:48.020> can<00:01:48.170> see<00:01:48.290> that

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
there is the rig sound you can see that

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.330 
there is the rig sound you can see that
much<00:01:48.680> smaller<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:50.350> dry<00:01:51.350> guitar<00:01:51.409> sound<00:01:52.040> and

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
much smaller is the dry guitar sound and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.190 
much smaller is the dry guitar sound and
that's<00:01:52.580> exactly<00:01:52.850> what<00:01:53.119> you<00:01:53.210> would<00:01:53.330> expect<00:01:53.390> so

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
that's exactly what you would expect so

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.570 
that's exactly what you would expect so
now<00:01:54.320> let's<00:01:54.470> say<00:01:54.619> we're<00:01:54.770> ready<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.070> react<00:01:55.369> you

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
now let's say we're ready to react you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.670 
now let's say we're ready to react you
know<00:01:55.640> we<00:01:55.880> don't<00:01:55.970> like<00:01:56.119> this<00:01:56.690> guitar<00:01:57.259> sound<00:01:57.590> we

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
know we don't like this guitar sound we

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.230 
know we don't like this guitar sound we
want<00:01:57.860> a<00:01:57.920> different<00:01:58.190> guitar<00:01:58.610> sound<00:01:58.909> so<00:01:59.149> I'm

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
want a different guitar sound so I'm

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.969 
want a different guitar sound so I'm
going<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.509> go<00:01:59.659> ahead<00:01:59.720> and<00:01:59.960> mute<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.470> track

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
going to go ahead and mute that track

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.830 
going to go ahead and mute that track
I'm<00:02:01.520> also<00:02:01.700> done<00:02:01.939> with<00:02:02.060> my<00:02:02.149> guitar<00:02:02.330> so<00:02:02.509> I<00:02:02.689> can

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
I'm also done with my guitar so I can

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.139 
I'm also done with my guitar so I can
take<00:02:03.289> that<00:02:03.409> off<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.590> set<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:03.920> down<00:02:04.159> now<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:05.060> if

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
take that off and set it down now so if

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.850 
take that off and set it down now so if
we<00:02:05.270> liked<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.750> performance<00:02:06.350> but<00:02:06.590> we<00:02:06.680> just

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
we liked the performance but we just

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.559 
we liked the performance but we just
didn't<00:02:07.070> like<00:02:07.189> the<00:02:07.310> sound<00:02:07.520> we<00:02:07.970> can<00:02:08.119> react<00:02:08.420> and

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
didn't like the sound we can react and

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.690 
didn't like the sound we can react and
here's<00:02:09.200> how<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.470> do<00:02:09.739> that<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.340> very<00:02:10.519> easy

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
here's how to do that this is very easy

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.509 
here's how to do that this is very easy
so<00:02:11.239> first<00:02:11.420> I'll<00:02:11.540> unmute<00:02:11.900> my<00:02:12.350> dry<00:02:12.830> guitar<00:02:13.220> sound

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
so first I'll unmute my dry guitar sound

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.420 
so first I'll unmute my dry guitar sound
and<00:02:13.730> now<00:02:14.060> we<00:02:14.120> need<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.390> change<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.019> output<00:02:15.430> ok

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
and now we need to change the output ok

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.690 
and now we need to change the output ok
so<00:02:17.299> output<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:18.049> now<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:18.500> want<00:02:18.830> reamp<00:02:19.340> now<00:02:19.610> you

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
so output and now I want reamp now you

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.600 
so output and now I want reamp now you
can<00:02:19.850> choose<00:02:20.030> ramp<00:02:20.630> left<00:02:21.290> right<00:02:21.560> rem-1<00:02:22.190> rem-3

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
can choose ramp left right rem-1 rem-3

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.250 
can choose ramp left right rem-1 rem-3
mono<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.269> you<00:02:23.360> know<00:02:23.450> if<00:02:23.540> one<00:02:23.720> sounds<00:02:24.019> better<00:02:24.080> to

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
mono it you know if one sounds better to

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.680 
mono it you know if one sounds better to
you<00:02:24.500> for<00:02:24.739> your<00:02:24.920> particular<00:02:25.610> rig<00:02:25.819> then<00:02:26.390> choose

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
you for your particular rig then choose

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.630 
you for your particular rig then choose
that<00:02:26.870> one<00:02:27.019> it's<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.590> same<00:02:27.799> concept<00:02:28.069> either

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
that one it's the same concept either

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.250 
that one it's the same concept either
way<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.030> then<00:02:29.360> right<00:02:29.390> here<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.900> have<00:02:30.140> another

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
way and then right here I have another

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.860 
way and then right here I have another
mono<00:02:31.130> audio<00:02:31.489> track<00:02:31.910> setup<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:32.510> then<00:02:32.630> here's<00:02:32.810> a

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
mono audio track setup and then here's a

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.320 
mono audio track setup and then here's a
stereo<00:02:33.650> audio<00:02:33.860> track<00:02:34.040> now<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.610> can<00:02:34.790> react<00:02:35.060> to

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
stereo audio track now you can react to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.630 
stereo audio track now you can react to
either<00:02:35.600> one<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:35.959> these<00:02:36.319> a<00:02:36.380> either<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:36.920> mono<00:02:37.280> or

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
either one of these a either a mono or

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.030 
either one of these a either a mono or
stereo<00:02:37.700> all<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.810> need<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:39.049> do<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.500> set<00:02:39.890> the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
stereo all you need to do is set the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.880 
stereo all you need to do is set the
input<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.970> 11<00:02:41.510> rig<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.049> this<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.290> a<00:02:42.320> mono<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:42.829> I

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
input to 11 rig so this is a mono so I

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.650 
input to 11 rig so this is a mono so I
can<00:02:43.040> choose<00:02:43.160> left<00:02:43.400> or<00:02:43.519> right<00:02:43.730> others<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.359> left

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
can choose left or right others to left

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.960 
can choose left or right others to left
and<00:02:44.810> this<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.320> stereo<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.160> input<00:02:46.459> would<00:02:46.880> be

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
and this is a stereo so input would be

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.000 
and this is a stereo so input would be
11<00:02:47.390> rig<00:02:47.720> now<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:48.200> may<00:02:48.320> sound<00:02:48.530> odd<00:02:48.739> that<00:02:48.859> we're

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
11 rig now it may sound odd that we're

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.830 
11 rig now it may sound odd that we're
choosing<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.370> same<00:02:49.579> input<00:02:49.970> we<00:02:50.090> used<00:02:50.329> while<00:02:50.750> we

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
choosing the same input we used while we

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.479 
choosing the same input we used while we
were<00:02:50.959> actually<00:02:51.109> playing<00:02:51.680> physically<00:02:52.220> playing

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
were actually playing physically playing

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.220 
were actually playing physically playing
the<00:02:52.670> guitar<00:02:52.970> but<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.359> difference<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:54.049> come

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
the guitar but the difference is we come

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.800 
the guitar but the difference is we come
up<00:02:54.320> here<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.470> rig<00:02:54.799> input<00:02:55.519> of<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.209> 11<00:02:56.480> track<00:02:56.630> and

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
up here to rig input of the 11 track and

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.360 
up here to rig input of the 11 track and
again<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.109> can<00:02:57.230> do<00:02:57.320> this<00:02:57.410> from<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.100> front

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
again you can do this from the front

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.069 
again you can do this from the front
panel<00:02:58.820> you<00:02:58.940> don't<00:02:59.090> need<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.420> editor<00:02:59.810> to

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
panel you don't need the editor to

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.590 
panel you don't need the editor to
change<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.799> rig<00:03:00.950> input<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:01.640> under<00:03:01.880> rig<00:03:02.150> input

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
change the rig input but under rig input

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.449 
change the rig input but under rig input
simply<00:03:03.079> click<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.380> down<00:03:03.530> arrow<00:03:03.560> or<00:03:04.040> from<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
simply click the down arrow or from the

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.190 
simply click the down arrow or from the
front<00:03:04.640> panel<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.299> want<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.570> choose<00:03:05.810> the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
front panel and you want to choose the

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.699 
front panel and you want to choose the
rig<00:03:06.410> input<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.280> be<00:03:07.459> re<00:03:08.030> ant<00:03:08.299> so<00:03:09.019> now<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.320> dry

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
rig input to be re ant so now this dry

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.250 
rig input to be re ant so now this dry
guitar<00:03:09.920> track<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.519> being<00:03:10.730> sent<00:03:11.269> out<00:03:11.420> into<00:03:11.900> the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
guitar track is being sent out into the

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
if the reamp is muted then the 11 rec is

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.700 
if the reamp is muted then the 11 rec is
not<00:05:23.240> getting<00:05:23.450> signal<00:05:23.870> because<00:05:24.140> again<00:05:24.560> the

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
interface we're choosing a Levin rig and

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.580 
interface we're choosing a Levin rig and
you<00:06:28.630> just<00:06:28.990> start<00:06:29.170> playing<00:06:29.380> your<00:06:29.470> guitar

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
you just start playing your guitar

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.990 
you just start playing your guitar
you're<00:06:30.250> not<00:06:30.400> going<00:06:30.550> to<00:06:30.640> hear<00:06:30.760> anything

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
you're not going to hear anything

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.210 
you're not going to hear anything
because<00:06:31.360> the<00:06:31.870> 11<00:06:32.170> track<00:06:32.350> is<00:06:32.500> not<00:06:32.680> monitoring

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
because the 11 track is not monitoring

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.370 
because the 11 track is not monitoring
the<00:06:33.370> guitar<00:06:33.640> signal<00:06:33.940> so<00:06:34.750> you<00:06:34.780> have<00:06:35.080> to<00:06:35.170> come

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
the guitar signal so you have to come

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.020 
the guitar signal so you have to come
back<00:06:35.560> up<00:06:35.740> here<00:06:35.950> and<00:06:36.130> just<00:06:36.280> change<00:06:36.550> that<00:06:36.790> to

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
back up here and just change that to

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.260 
back up here and just change that to
guitar<00:06:37.720> then<00:06:38.410> you<00:06:38.560> can<00:06:38.680> play<00:06:38.920> as<00:06:39.130> normal<00:06:39.880> so

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
guitar then you can play as normal so

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.180 
guitar then you can play as normal so
that<00:06:40.300> is<00:06:40.540> how<00:06:40.660> you<00:06:40.720> would<00:06:40.930> react<00:06:41.350> with<00:06:41.710> the<00:06:41.890> 11

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
that is how you would react with the 11

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:53.559 
that is how you would react with the 11
rack<00:06:42.430> and<00:06:42.820> Pro<00:06:43.030> Tools<00:06:43.270> 11

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:53.569 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:55.629
