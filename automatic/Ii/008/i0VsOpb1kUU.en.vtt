00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.230
 but 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.209
 she hello my name is vladimir 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:12.259
 serfs 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.470
 you are watching a master class program 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.070
 today, the topic of our programs is a choice 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.720
 jig rod that is a rod for fishing on 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.749
 jeep bait 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:22.859
 but now 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.380
 Russian fishing market 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.039
 just teeming with all sorts of 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.230
 half price there is a huge range as in 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.189
 you don't get lost how to choose yourself 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.430
 business worthy liquid brainchild 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.430
 but first you need to know the percent 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.260
 what conditions are you going to catch 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.859
 first of all if it is coastal fishing 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.300
 then you need to need perfectly 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.670
 minimum 2 72 maximum 3 33 meters that is for 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.530
 in order to 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.820
 and you could get as far as possible 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.420
 casts need to know and what is the strength of the current on 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.699
 pond if this standing date 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.799
 the percentage is enough court judgment with 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:01.879
 standard range yes 30 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.930
 Litvitsky five grams if he catch themselves 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.230
 during 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.100
 then, respectively, and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.960
 I value your deposit overgrowing as 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.550
 example you can take the river of the eye 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.300
 the percentage is interesting to know what is there 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.100
 cases of different conditions if again 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 living sviridov stage avoided catching 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.850
 this rod trick 3 30 meters and in order to 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.310
 make the most cast we need 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.439
 David Dunn long shots or even 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.399
 throw the hoof 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.710
 interesting points mean plus percent 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.899
 since the flow is very strong ground 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.290
 depth reaches 12 and 14 meters 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.460
 not every thrush is especially often black 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.990
 jeep lures every player is able 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.310
 reach the bottom 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.310
 ohh and so we need a rod with 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.210
 the top pick over gram fiction 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.479
 yes fifty to sixty 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.969
 It means oah there is and they are a feature of it 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.289
 live rod never broadcasts 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.420
 fails ie countries for example answer 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.380
 this student has a loan of up to 50 grams 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.289
 we gave you 50 grams 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.170
 calmly toss over long distances 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.739
 bait but while posting the tip 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:10.749
 rods 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:12.619
 sums very much engaged that is, we 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:13.469
 make a turn 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.689
 and the rod as it falls into 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.930
 moment of bite we can not ask 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.789
 so just because you already have the rods 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.969
 as if that is a pretty strong position 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.739
 so 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.130
 it is always advisable to take a rod 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.930
 with a little big tests that is 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.060
 for example if food is up to fifty drama it 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.200
 does not mean that you can use cargo 50 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.830
 gram on this personality you can 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.500
 throw those 50 grams but make normal 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.760
 quality on live wiring will not be possible 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.790
 therefore, for such a child is usually 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.540
 used dose grant from thirty to 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.500
 thirty two in this case food is not 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.560
 fail that is the wiring is obtained 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.679
 fairly accurate clear 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.809
 mean if we catch carry from boat 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:57.089
 then we can choose our rod 

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:58.989
 a little shorter as it is particularly far 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.019
 casting we do not need to do we mobile 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.459
 we can move 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.829
 in the way to the curb on the curb newspaper above 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.100
 the brow is lower than the brow but ryazhenka 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.150
 we can take credit even shorter 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.130
 for example, I use it when fishing 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.020
 reports using 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.139
 size 2 40 to 70 so 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.049
 Dmitrov this article is shamefully chosen in 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.179
 depending on conditions standard 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.559
 medium standard jeruy sharing it 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.219
 five to thirty send ten to 40 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:29.759
 and somewhere there is such a rod 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.059
 Doors kia if we have for example oao 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:33.549
 going fishing 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.609
 on real grandfather 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.139
 If we 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.529
 your standing westbury 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:41.349
 then again we need the far 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.919
 cast because the mainstream shortage 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.039
 interesting plots 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:47.059
 not always passes a newspaper near 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.860
 the shore 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.580
 so again this brainchild of a length of three 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.770
 until June 30 m3 thirty meters fts tone 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.970
 range of drams to thirty usually 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.769
 standing diana 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.359
 but a maximum weight of 18 20 is used 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.430
 gram that is quite enough 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.680
 To achieve the date I wonder what that 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.389
 plots at the bottom that is, let it be 14 12 16 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.129
 meters that they are often found on 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.109
 reservoirs 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.559
 mean percent next moment if 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:17.549
 we see it kia slot 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.549
 on composed water 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.419
 ayal for these conditions using other things 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.210
 maximum length of 22 square meters 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.229
 means space range 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.059
 20 ti and 20 ti to faucet why so 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.839
 shoots when young vodka nadya 

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:37.539
 the best option 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.499
 is a short one personally i need here 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:40.500
 long cast 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.220
 we need maximum 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.190
 sensitivity as light as possible 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.540
 maximum control is 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.409
 respectively 2 40 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.479
 up to 20 years 20 kilograms percentage 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.989
 an important point to me as I was all 

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:53.050
 it is known that 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.159
 different outliers were created 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.030
 specially for different fishing conditions 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.639
 tease bait as for 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.789
 specifically jig it is desirable that here 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.750
 weekend ring then in this case here on 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.719
 these are many things 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.779
 Well done, that is, he was put on two 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:08.989
 boats here in this case even for 3 then 

00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:09.689
 have it look
