00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:10.669
 and you 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:20.340
 hello how are you welcome to my channel 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.480
 from youtube this series of videos about the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.420
 hydraulic ram 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.250
 Well, I want to talk to all of you because 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.380
 well this video has been a has been a 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.169
 I hit the first video I went up on 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.480
 the hydraulic ram there are many 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.720
 there's a lot of interaction with the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.420
 users I have about 20-30 comments to the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.489
 day 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.839
 I love being able to help solve your 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.879
 doubts and good let's make a series 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.879
 complete on the hydraulic ram in 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.460
 the one that we're going to see many things about 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.660
 ideas on how to put it 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.969
 the valve of the bottle how to insure 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.790
 that we always have air inside 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.949
 our tank so that the pressure of the 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.299
 batter be constant 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.560
 let's go good and you buy me again 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.259
 toys this now let's make a 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.110
 video with this ram is pbc of a 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.610
 inch that has thread then well 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.190
 we can disarm it to give it 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.340
 maintenance 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.910
 let's analyze in different videos 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.270
 let's analyze the vertical valves 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.950
 the pichanchas is a pichanga 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.750
 but that is actually a valve 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.700
 vertical turned into pichincha with 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.110
 this one with this one 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.479
 the cap we are going to explain the tf well 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.429
 that is here will agree that a T 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.110
 there are always many comments that 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.610
 they ask me how the screw is put 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.670
 as not because there and can see right now 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.710
 that I have good here will go the tank 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.150
 here the hose is passed and here I am going to 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.340
 put three check valves then 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.810
 this is also there was a video on 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.440
 internet that afterwards I did not return to 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.990
 find about one on one 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.130
 ram 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.620
 of three valves then we're going to 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.360
 to study it we will review it also 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.040
 let's change the configuration let's 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:28.420
 put this over there we're going to measure the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:30.620
 efficiency of the ram and good the series and 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.409
 good the series is going to be very long 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.769
 I hope that at least 10 videos about 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.599
 the hydraulic art we are going to explain the 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.450
 difference between efficiency and effectiveness 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.940
 of the batter because it's different once 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.260
 that both pumps another how efficient 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.000
 is using the water let's explain 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.190
 different different materials 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.640
 techniques how efficiency is measured and the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.819
 Step-by-step efficiency how to arm yourself 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.500
 the battering ram if we have problems during 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.239
 the armed the ram during the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.050
 installation let's record it and let's go the 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.240
 video about it for 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.319
 see how the solutions are solved 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.379
 different problems 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.900
 and the other thing that we are going to do and that 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.000
 start with this video 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.640
 a video blogs 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.870
 once a week or so I think 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.560
 that the faithful week I will record 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.080
 so that Monday is already online 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.099
 this videoblog of questions and answers 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.099
 on the hydric iedt 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.140
 no you can not get water from a well with 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.590
 the hydraulic ram because we need 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.020
 that the water falls to be pumped 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.440
 but if we can draw water for example 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.550
 of a dam if there is a body of 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.640
 water with a wall and then together there's 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.980
 pending there is something below we can 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.140
 make a siphon with hose for 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.180
 feed the battering ram and then if we go 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.180
 to throw water out here outside the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.570
 dam and we will be able to pump certain 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.959
 level but from a blind well no no 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.290
 the ram works we have to use 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:18.530
 a bomb 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.320
 wind rope wind pump 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.940
 something by hand different types of pumping 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.470
 exist 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.380
 I'm going to look for some videos right now 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.570
 I will put in the description then 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.880
 well check these videos and I hope 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.130
 that serves them but but not 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.000
 Unfortunately, it's not good for pumping 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.000
 water from a well 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.800
 you you you 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.100
 the manual that I occupied the most is the 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.710
 super that I appreciate very much that what 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.029
 I have done 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.289
 unfortunately where is it 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:57.610
 right now I think this was something not all 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:00.580
 people can download it what 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.259
 they find then good good super forgiveness 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.550
 buoy 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:09.490
 if you do not like me you tell me and I 'll take it off I'll 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.389
 put it on my personal server inside 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.330
 of my cloud in dropbox so that all 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:18.479
 can download it 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.849
 and good since the description of the video 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.139
 is the good link to the store of something 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.969
 freese and in the store where they are sold 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.490
 these shirts that are fine parents 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:29.870
 there is a puppy peeing and there 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:33.380
 different things are fun 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.930
 there are the manuals review the 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.480
 questions and answers ask more if 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.260
 is that they have doubts 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.170
 there are links maybe to other videos that already 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.500
 they solved something or what they give us 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:51.620
 follow a different discussion about whether 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.710
 art is good or not how it works in 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.770
 finish 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:59.760
 I invite you to like us share 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:03.230
 on facebook to subscribe I already said a 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.230
 once a week will see new videos 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:10.240
 and I think that's all good, because many 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.229
 thanks for watching this and I hope in the 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.229
 next video coming soon 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:19.009
 and you
