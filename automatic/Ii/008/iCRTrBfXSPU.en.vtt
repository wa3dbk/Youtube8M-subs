00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.150
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.210
 Today we do have to roasted onions 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.820
 I pulled off a vegetable onion 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.650
 Halves then quartered and 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.650
 then cut into strips 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.680
 the onions then move into one 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.680
 bowl 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.770
 Half a teaspoon of salt over it 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.930
 Sprinkle the salt, remove the onion 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.650
 Moisture so the flour stays later 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.650
 adhere better 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.810
 Now the onion pieces with a fork 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.000
 maybe again something apart 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.630
 pull and then for five to six 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.840
 minutes 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.090
 after five minutes about two to three 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.659
 heaped tablespoon flour over the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.659
 give onions 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.429
 go through the bowl a little bit now 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.960
 shake or panning so that 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:54.459
 the flour around all onions pieces 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:01.390
 can act then the floured onion 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:03.850
 Put pieces in a noodle sieve and that 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.799
 Excess mail just something 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.799
 tap or shake off 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.939
 Oil in a pot or pan 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:20.470
 heat and then to test if that 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.290
 rather hot enough is just one 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.220
 Put the onion in and see if it is 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.720
 bubbles are the case can 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.720
 we fry the onions 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.319
 just the desired amount into the hot 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:42.870
 give oil and to the desired 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:45.549
 browning degree frying to completion 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.480
 the fried onions then on kitchen paper 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.480
 Drain 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.550
 and then as a side dish to hot dogs or 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.060
 enjoy diverse citizens 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.720
 I wish a lot of fun while copying 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.720
 Until next time
