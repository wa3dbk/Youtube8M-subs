the boat until we had to there's five of
us

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
us

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.130 
us
only<00:01:44.840> four<00:01:45.110> had<00:01:45.860> their<00:01:46.130> suits<00:01:46.430> on<00:01:46.640> one<00:01:46.970> guy<00:01:47.180> he

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
only four had their suits on one guy he

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.420

we're<00:03:37.430> lucky<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.820> some<00:03:38.239> reason<00:03:38.600> they

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
we're lucky that some reason they
