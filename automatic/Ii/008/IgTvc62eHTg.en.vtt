bit<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:06.120> when<00:05:06.330> you're<00:05:06.449> trying<00:05:06.629> to<00:05:06.719> get<00:05:06.870> out<00:05:06.930> of

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
bit so when you're trying to get out of

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.050 
bit so when you're trying to get out of
there<00:05:07.319> it's<00:05:07.469> like<00:05:07.590> man<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:08.009> this<00:05:08.219> this<00:05:08.610> this

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
there it's like man this this this this

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.149 
there it's like man this this this this
is<00:05:09.120> hard<00:05:09.479> so<00:05:10.020> you<00:05:10.080> have<00:05:10.289> to<00:05:10.409> figure<00:05:10.650> it<00:05:10.860> out<00:05:10.949> as

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
is hard so you have to figure it out as

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.860 
is hard so you have to figure it out as
you<00:05:11.190> start<00:05:11.729> doing<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.090> more<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:12.419> more<00:05:12.629> and

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
you start doing it more and more and

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.839 
you start doing it more and more and
start<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.349> you<00:05:13.800> know<00:05:13.919> your<00:05:14.099> skills<00:05:14.370> start<00:05:14.699> to

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
start to you know your skills start to

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.760 
start to you know your skills start to
improve<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.479> then<00:05:15.629> you<00:05:15.930> know<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.139> get<00:05:16.590> out<00:05:16.740> of

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
improve and then you know you get out of

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.100 
improve and then you know you get out of
there<00:05:17.009> and<00:05:17.129> then<00:05:17.219> the<00:05:17.400> last<00:05:17.699> board<00:05:18.240> where<00:05:19.080> you

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
there and then the last board where you

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.369 
there and then the last board where you
have<00:05:19.319> to<00:05:19.469> figure<00:05:19.800> out<00:05:19.860> where<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.610> go<00:05:21.090> I<00:05:21.449> don't

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
have to figure out where to go I don't

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:23.510 
have to figure out where to go I don't
want<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:22.590> give<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:22.800> away<00:05:22.889> because<00:05:23.129> you<00:05:23.370> haven't

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
through these different chambers and you

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.219 
through these different chambers and you
you<00:05:37.650> try<00:05:37.889> to<00:05:37.919> you<00:05:38.610> know<00:05:38.639> unlock<00:05:39.150> it<00:05:39.360> to<00:05:39.599> drop

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
you try to you know unlock it to drop

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.370 
you try to you know unlock it to drop
the<00:05:40.740> fire<00:05:41.009> down<00:05:41.340> in<00:05:41.699> order<00:05:41.940> for<00:05:42.090> you<00:05:42.180> to<00:05:42.380> find

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
the fire down in order for you to find

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.899 
the fire down in order for you to find
what<00:05:43.500> you<00:05:43.770> need<00:05:43.800> to<00:05:44.159> get<00:05:44.310> out<00:05:44.430> of<00:05:44.550> y'all<00:05:44.729> want

that's the premise of end that was very

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.559 
that's the premise of end that was very
difficult<00:05:50.069> to<00:05:50.490> figure<00:05:50.639> out<00:05:50.789> where<00:05:51.029> to<00:05:51.060> go<00:05:51.300> and

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
difficult to figure out where to go and

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.110 
difficult to figure out where to go and
and<00:05:52.139> get<00:05:52.380> all<00:05:52.529> this<00:05:52.759> at<00:05:53.759> the<00:05:53.879> full

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:38.499 
uh me personally just because I enjoyed

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.739 
uh me personally just because I enjoyed
the<00:06:38.680> game<00:06:38.830> a<00:06:38.860> lot<00:06:39.189> I<00:06:39.369> give<00:06:39.639> it<00:06:39.729> a<00:06:39.819> solid<00:06:40.029> eight

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:40.749 
the game a lot I give it a solid eight

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:43.649 
the game a lot I give it a solid eight
and<00:06:40.960> a<00:06:40.990> half<00:06:41.020> nine<00:06:41.439> okay<00:06:42.369> yeah<00:06:42.909> I<00:06:42.939> would<00:06:43.449> say<00:06:43.479> so

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:43.659 
and a half nine okay yeah I would say so

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:45.179 
and a half nine okay yeah I would say so
just<00:06:44.050> from<00:06:44.169> when<00:06:44.319> I<00:06:44.349> played<00:06:44.649> I<00:06:44.800> thought<00:06:45.009> it<00:06:45.099> was

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:45.189 
just from when I played I thought it was

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:47.700 
just from when I played I thought it was
really<00:06:45.430> well<00:06:45.610> done<00:06:45.639> it's<00:06:46.119> difficult<00:06:46.659> so<00:06:47.259> if

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
really well done it's difficult so if

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.790 
really well done it's difficult so if
you're<00:06:47.949> easily<00:06:48.939> frustrated<00:06:49.469> you<00:06:50.469> might<00:06:50.619> want

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
you're easily frustrated you might want

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.320 
you're easily frustrated you might want
to<00:06:50.889> give<00:06:50.979> it<00:06:51.099> a<00:06:51.159> pass<00:06:51.369> until<00:06:51.759> maybe<00:06:51.999> it's<00:06:52.180> on

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
to give it a pass until maybe it's on

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.029 
to give it a pass until maybe it's on
sale<00:06:52.569> or<00:06:52.689> whatever<00:06:52.930> it's<00:06:53.050> twenty<00:06:53.349> dollars<00:06:53.740> but

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 
sale or whatever it's twenty dollars but

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.769 
sale or whatever it's twenty dollars but
I<00:06:54.279> supported<00:06:55.029> them<00:06:55.089> right<00:06:55.300> away<00:06:55.419> you<00:06:55.569> know<00:06:55.749> I

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:55.779 
I supported them right away you know I

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:58.200 
I supported them right away you know I
think<00:06:55.899> that<00:06:56.259> is<00:06:56.529> it's<00:06:57.069> a<00:06:57.159> bold<00:06:57.430> thing<00:06:57.699> you<00:06:58.089> know

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.210 
think that is it's a bold thing you know

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.179 
think that is it's a bold thing you know
it's<00:06:58.360> something<00:06:58.629> it<00:06:59.110> took<00:06:59.319> the<00:06:59.439> studio<00:06:59.830> four

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:00.189 
it's something it took the studio four

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:01.559 
it's something it took the studio four
