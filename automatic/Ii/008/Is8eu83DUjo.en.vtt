00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
what's happening when you do this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.889 
what's happening when you do this
procedure<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.629> why<00:00:52.110> it's<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.680> important<00:00:53.899> in

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
procedure and why it's so important in

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.720 
procedure and why it's so important in
order<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> brain<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.890> function<00:00:56.070> properly

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
order for the brain to function properly

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.060 
order for the brain to function properly
it<00:00:57.300> has<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.660> manage<00:00:57.930> input<00:00:58.440> from<00:00:58.680> both<00:00:58.859> our

the cortices technique we call it
tapping<00:03:51.480> out<00:03:51.840> because<00:03:52.829> we<00:03:52.980> use<00:03:53.100> one<00:03:53.370> hand<00:03:53.700> to

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
tapping out because we use one hand to

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.370 
tapping out because we use one hand to

connect the two hemispheres of the brain

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.220 
connect the two hemispheres of the brain

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.650 
and the other hand to tap over the head
in<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.560> heart<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:59.639> tapping<00:04:00.180> creates<00:04:00.510> an

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
in the heart the tapping creates an

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.809 
in the heart the tapping creates an
interference<00:04:01.380> pattern<00:04:01.650> which<00:04:02.400> sends<00:04:02.760> a

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
then you're going to pick up where you

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.530 
then you're going to pick up where you
left<00:04:40.440> off<00:04:40.889> we're<00:04:41.370> basically<00:04:41.520> heading<00:04:42.090> towards
