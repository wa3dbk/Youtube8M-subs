little<00:00:22.140> bit<00:00:22.380> lag<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.220> know<00:00:23.340> considering

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
little bit lag but you know considering

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.330 
little bit lag but you know considering
the<00:00:23.970> fact<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.650> there's<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.949> know<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.220> just

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the fact that there's you know it's just

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.589 
the fact that there's you know it's just
the<00:00:26.519> beginning<00:00:26.640> ports<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.330> I'm<00:00:27.420> pretty

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
the beginning ports of it I'm pretty

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.939 
the beginning ports of it I'm pretty
sure<00:00:27.720> they<00:00:27.810> don't<00:00:27.900> improve<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.289> upon<00:00:28.560> updates

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
sure they don't improve it upon updates

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.070 
sure they don't improve it upon updates
and<00:00:29.099> stuff<00:00:29.250> like<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:29.789> right<00:00:30.599> now<00:00:30.660> it

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
and stuff like that but right now it

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.040 
and stuff like that but right now it
works<00:00:31.289> much<00:00:31.890> more<00:00:32.099> better<00:00:32.809> than<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
works much more better than the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.930

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
is a PlayStation Vita so it's not 1080p

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.760 
is a PlayStation Vita so it's not 1080p
it's<00:05:33.840> less<00:05:34.170> than<00:05:34.320> that<00:05:34.440> but<00:05:34.620> it's

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
it's less than that but it's

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.140 
it's less than that but it's
understandable<00:05:35.340> if<00:05:35.550> you<00:05:35.640> know<00:05:35.730> the<00:05:35.820> Vita<00:05:35.970> can

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
do 1080p I don't know what I know what

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.400 
do 1080p I don't know what I know what
what<00:05:39.270> is<00:05:39.390> a<00:05:39.660> pleasure<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:40.230> meet<00:05:40.320> us

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
what is a pleasure to meet us

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:57.820 
what is a pleasure to meet us
resolutions<00:05:40.980> it's<00:05:41.610> 900<00:05:42.180> by<00:05:42.240> something

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.320 

although<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:58.950> buns<00:05:59.190> to<00:05:59.400> look<00:05:59.640> really<00:05:59.970> smaller

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
although the buns to look really smaller

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.600 
although the buns to look really smaller
so<00:06:00.630> it's<00:06:00.750> kind<00:06:00.990> of<00:06:01.020> hard<00:06:01.230> if<00:06:01.590> you<00:06:01.650> can't<00:06:01.890> go

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
so it's kind of hard if you can't go

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.070 
so it's kind of hard if you can't go
then<00:06:03.000> it<00:06:03.150> kind<00:06:03.300> of<00:06:03.330> makes<00:06:03.390> sense<00:06:03.690> into<00:06:03.990> the

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
then it kind of makes sense into the

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.080 
then it kind of makes sense into the
Vita<00:06:04.230> has<00:06:04.920> meant<00:06:05.190> to<00:06:05.310> have<00:06:05.430> but<00:06:05.580> right<00:06:05.970> now<00:06:06.060> I

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
Vita has meant to have but right now I

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.520 
Vita has meant to have but right now I
