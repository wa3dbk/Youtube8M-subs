00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.040
 I went short track somewhere at the end of the years 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.690
 seventy was a small job and 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.550
 that's a lot of meters outside our journey 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.990
 on your job and I saw a few 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.429
 a boy short track i think hey that 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.920
 is my thing 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.330
 nice inside no wind and just against 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.160
 someone else skate instead of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.420
 by the time 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.850
 short track is a long course they hate 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.769
 very difficult to compare the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.449
 short trackers is really kind of work soon 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.310
 more than that speed skating 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.810
 because that tactical aspect that comes 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.149
 there is always a weather to look at you 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.820
 can still train so much and so hard moment 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.380
 that you are in the lead and the person behind you 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.670
 who waits and waits and waits and who goes 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.800
 the final round for almost that anyway 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.390
 lost so now evidence speak just like that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.309
 often for your viewers behind you me one 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.520
 little chess must be a step forward 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.230
 think only two steps or three steps 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.550
 have never been in in my career as 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.079
 skating thought I was at all 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.270
 coach would they be a bit out of the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.910
 frustration that the Netherlands lagged behind 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.410
 in the facilities around the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.670
 development of sport 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.440
 supporting the athletes 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.309
 short trackers and also specified and 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.710
 decided okay 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.360
 know that otherwise we could have done better 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.280
 that much proof as a coach to have my own 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.570
 study of economics 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.240
 it is sometimes said that we are in 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.860
 have the Netherlands in national coach 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.270
 brought in those that just that little bit 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.890
 train differently than the others 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.299
 coaches in the world for me 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.229
 it very very important as a like suffering 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.820
 comes in 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.110
 I don't care how good they are 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.340
 as members, but how well does it want 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.750
 actually become 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.550
 top athlete ultimately that is not 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.950
 born but that is made that goes 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.420
 not about how much talent that mine has 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.560
 having ambition actually here 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.229
 what is it the key to eventually 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.729
 reach the top and I dare to think so 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.229
 distinguish that is to believe 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.800
 important also in our society and 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.080
 certainly now the and the situation in the Netherlands 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.970
 economically speaking, it is not ideal 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.979
 and I think the society more to 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.170
 top sport looks more sees things 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.190
 are malleable you do n't have all it 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.110
 are talents 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.659
 dare to change yourself every day 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.580
 dares to use them grim floating 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.369
 challenge it at work but also at home 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.319
 your family at school grows 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.679
 society so incredibly fast and that 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:08.880
 bv the netherlands will soon be a nv we 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.880
 win an incredible amount with sports
