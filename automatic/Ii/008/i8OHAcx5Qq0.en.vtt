00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.460
 an accessory for iphone ipod touch ipad 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.970
 and appliances that use the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.920
 android is the ipad arrives from the tuf controller 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.289
 which is a control that you connect with 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.359
 your device and you can play the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.460
 games by physical buttons without being 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.680
 used a touch on the screen which is very 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.240
 best if you play the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.790
 appliances like me né 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:38.070

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.430
 then you revised it, this is the box of the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.180
 control as you can see we have the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.750
 carry it if you put it on the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.750
 computer usb 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.110
 there are also the two analogues the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.390
 and the normal buttons that 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.550
 I woke up and one and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.559
 we also have rails or captives 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.100
 that go behind url 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.750
 he has a little chicken that you can 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.000
 place the appliances when placing the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.610
 an iphone or an ipod galaxy 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.369
 some very large soldiers do not 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.290
 I entered as for example the galaxy note the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.570
 control has four modules 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.110
 you can change the modes by pressing the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.210
 chievo x ou y yo while connecting 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.130
 pressing the other one we will connect by calling 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.590
 the product of our device choose a 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.530
 noisy if I will push it with my 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.740
 to enter the so called hot al 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.689
 What is this kid and boy talking about? 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.540
 There, it will start to blink with you. 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.450
 see who you choose from your list of 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.170
 positive boto fruit game pad 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.810
 can get this game that I 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.579
 I'm playing it 's olive grove and saw only that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.520
 contract works in other games 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:02.220
 however it is not not a very large list 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.770
 yesterday others like gang live zone 45 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.590
 among others but how you can see or 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.660
 the control speed is very good right 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.519
 responds almost immediately and also 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.650
 depends on the control tv if the battery 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.450
 you're weak will be giving you a 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.519
 bit of a law but only you put 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.830
 USB port on your computer and loads 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.260
 very fast and the battery lasts very 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.049
 You get practically one day playing 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.260
 with groups connected to the regulator or 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.940
 anything else any other 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.269
 using the so-called blue troll you 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.849
 can use the ipad control in 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.410
 other games that are not compatible and 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.150
 also residents as it is in my case that 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.590
 I'm using an emulator here 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.450
 Super Nintendo 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.040
 But for this you have to have to fight. 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.239
 it's because it's a club that's available 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.829
 on the site 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.900
 I highly recommend you to buy 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.639
 out of control it is not too expensive 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.609
 here in brazil they can find in 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:57.480
 free market around 90 80 reais 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:03:00.870
 but I paid about $ 27 in the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.459
 site called mars br is that the link from the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.079
 control is in the description the link of the 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.730
 site also has other accessories 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.040
 like iphone and other hoods 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.680
 bluetooths advisors cases to 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.250
 smartphones in general and many others 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.530
 things lenses films etc 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.609
 recommends focusing on olhão then this 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.459
