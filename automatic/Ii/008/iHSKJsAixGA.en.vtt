00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 everyone will ask several things about 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.200
 Adventure time several mysteries and 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.530
 unknowns the past of many 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.660
 characters or even their origins but 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.059
 not many are asked questions by the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.100
 little things in the series like I could 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.350
 be the origin of the amulet of hudson 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.140
 laundry how many glass dimensions 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.779
 but today we will not talk about those 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.449
 themes but from a little forgotten topic or 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.529
 ignored he told them about the glove of 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.529
 episode you made me 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.059
 the lemon castle glove sour to 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.030
 simple sight may seem like something 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.370
 much importance in fact this glove 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.949
 It has no importance in the series 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.649
 but what if the glove represents 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.390
 something something very deep that leaves you 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.729
 think for several minutes and that 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.759
 possibly the cause of the evil 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.619
 of lemon sour as many will notice the 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.810
 glove is a simple baseball glove 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.060
 who poses on a shelf of each 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.060
 sour lemon castle room before 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.460
 that it was more populated but also 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.909
 many will remember that baseball is something 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.619
 very representative there in North America 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.750
 tell me who does not remember the typical 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.569
 movie or series scene where a 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.060
 boy and his father play baseball and if 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:34.270
 these are not playing is because it happened 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.590
 something that sentimentally affected 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.939
 you know what I'm trying to explain now 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.369
 Imagine a child a simple and 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.500
 innocent child waiting for his father 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.079
 come home to play baseball with 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.210
 him as all parents do but 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.009
 when his father arrives he tells his 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.399
 son that leaves his house and that 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.560
 get a job now imagine that the 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.679
 child is sour lemon and that the father is the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.719
 sweet princess that explains the 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.270
 conflict that has sour lemon with its 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.399
 mother as they remember lemon sour was a 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.280
 wrong experiment of the sweet princess 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.610
 and this was treated as such a simple 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.920
 failed experiment so the sweet 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.590
 princess did not give friendship honey and 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.630
 much less a worthy childhood which 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.880
 could explain why the sweet 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.010
 princess did not understand her agree death 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.340
 besides explaining why sour lemon 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.410
 acts in a very childlike way with 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.840
 This would also explain why he 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.420
 like to create new sour life but not 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.720
 take care of this one since practically its 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.750
 mother taught her that create and abandon 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.700
 Now let's see very well about the glove 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.160
 glove holds it sour lemon and the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.640
 sweet princess has the ball but the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.590
 sweet princess never threw the ball 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.450
 maybe watch him take or any other 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.760
 this was adventure time wanted us to 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.100
 imply that if you take care 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.440
 good of your son teaching him the values 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.780
 necessary this one will grow as a man 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.240
 worthy of life but if you do not 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.730
 it will grow and become a nuisance 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.640
 for humanity as the saying goes 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.640
 Raise crows and they will take out your eyes
