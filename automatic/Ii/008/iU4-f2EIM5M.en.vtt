00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.520
 via the internet Okay, here I 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.200
 pay attention already added to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 Selected those people who use 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.159
 pam father that is in this case 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.549
 two hundred sixty six seven people this 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.340
 those who have already installed on ihnem 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.710
 vatsap smartphone and they activated it 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.829
 Now I can simply this person 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.200
 write a message over the internet is not 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.270
 paying for it absolutely a dime if i'm 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.920
 I'm sitting in the wi-fi zone, then I think that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.640
 it is clear yes I have internet 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.729

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.380
 and if you use your sim 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.380

 or for m with a message of two hryvnia 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.890
 so today it is the most 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.650
 popular messenger though to be honest 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.230
 I don't really like his sounds 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.850
 Weber is much nicer to use 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.670
 But today, however, is in the father 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.940
 you have status, you can change them at 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.709
 that is, either write some 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.600

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.220
 in contacts you can see those who 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.620
 signed and at the very bottom under the names this 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.050
 those who have already installed Watsup they have 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.989
 displayed in your favorites completely immediately 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.030
 yes you can swap them bostroma 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.530
 do not crawl on y order or delete 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.840
 absolutely everything and expose only those 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.580
 which ones do you want and which ones 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.700
 ordinary contacts you can search 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.340
 search for those you want there quickly 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.050
 find chat with them further chat and 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.370
 you will already be written here well 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:15.570
 let's find 6 for example 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.760
 friend write hi to him 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.940
 I sent everything now I can't 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.800
 correspond and in fact do not pay 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.600
 for that not a penny more than that I can 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.810
 sends for example some photos 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.450
 I recently found good girls 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.910
 downloaded and here i can send here here 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.580
 I don't like this sound in me 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.600
 what is it full honest some 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.910
 dead March 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.620
 here but nevertheless he is here you 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.180
 can use the newsletter you can 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.510
 create a group of several 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.550
 participants and you can write to him also 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.770
 through the settings you can add 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.900
 for example in the profile your photo 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.240
 which will be displayed at all here 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.319
 as in this case, Victor has more 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.450
 when he prints 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.629
 how would you sit on it all things 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.079
 see now chat settings you can 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.840
 to set 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.090
 chateau wallpaper that you can see 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.959
 but for example they go standard now 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.209
 I will explain if I expose this one here 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.340
 I can now see in this picture 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.009
 print so you can choose 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.769
 from photographic film or photographic archive 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.870
 we generally have in this case I 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.970
 probably choose this will be enough 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.099
 beautiful here I think it's quite 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.930
 adequately and you can choose yourself 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.240
 wallpaper you want here you can 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.370
 set the message time which will be 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.750
 see and save attached files from 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.300
 pay attention that i'm in this case 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.590
 sent him a photo he can me 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.190
 send a video naturally from me 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.620
 also blocked and video will be saved 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.970
 These are the ones you for example do not want with 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.130
 them to communicate in their can simply 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.470
 just block in this case 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.479
 sit down I have no such my room 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.820
 phone but of course the font size i 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.220
 leave too small because principle y 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.680
 my eyes are good enough if u 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.199

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.520

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.620

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.810
 in a way that is more convenient for you 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.970
 In order to connect but also many many 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.490

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.800
 further it is a messenger which 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.400
 allows you to save a huge amount 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.889
 money and correspond with a person not 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.720
 important in which country or city 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.090
