back<00:02:56.860> in<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.310> second

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.630 

now<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.709> in<00:03:04.459> ways<00:03:04.670> should<00:03:05.030> be<00:03:05.180> paid<00:03:06.640> you'll

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
now the in ways should be paid you'll

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.100 
now the in ways should be paid you'll
simply<00:03:07.940> check<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.599> by<00:03:08.720> clicking<00:03:08.959> f5<00:03:12.430> and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
simply check that by clicking f5 and

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.539 
simply check that by clicking f5 and
there<00:03:15.110> we<00:03:15.230> go<00:03:15.379> order<00:03:15.700> confirmation<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:18.549> we

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
there we go order confirmation and we

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.119 
there we go order confirmation and we
can<00:03:19.700> go<00:03:19.879> back<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.480> client<00:03:20.690> area<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.860> NY

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
can go back to the client area the NY

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.900 
can go back to the client area the NY
should<00:03:22.459> say<00:03:22.640> now<00:03:22.849> paid<00:03:23.890> under<00:03:24.890> my<00:03:25.129> services<00:03:25.700> it

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
should say now paid under my services it

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.300 
should say now paid under my services it
will<00:03:26.060> probably<00:03:26.540> say<00:03:27.459> successful<00:03:28.459> it's<00:03:29.330> active

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
will probably say successful it's active

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.339 
will probably say successful it's active
okay<00:03:31.310> so<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.450> next<00:03:32.629> step<00:03:32.959> for<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.319> is

the process and say please try later

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:35.580 
the process and say please try later
again<00:05:32.580> you<00:05:33.580> should<00:05:33.789> just<00:05:34.060> go<00:05:34.330> at<00:05:34.539> and<00:05:34.870> try<00:05:35.529> it

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
again you should just go at and try it

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.159 
again you should just go at and try it
after<00:05:35.740> 30<00:05:36.129> minutes<00:05:36.460> or<00:05:36.729> so<00:05:36.999> again<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.599> it<00:05:38.050> will

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
after 30 minutes or so again and it will

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:46.750 
after 30 minutes or so again and it will
probably<00:05:38.439> work

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.140 

you

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.129 

now<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:50.780> seam<00:05:51.169> update<00:05:51.530> is<00:05:51.710> finished<00:05:53.139> it's

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
now the seam update is finished it's

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.850 
now the seam update is finished it's
done<00:05:54.410> and<00:05:55.630> the<00:05:56.630> game<00:05:56.870> server<00:05:57.229> should<00:05:57.410> still<00:05:57.740> be

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
done and the game server should still be

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.280 
done and the game server should still be
online<00:05:58.220> which<00:05:58.430> is<00:05:58.639> refreshing<00:05:59.150> fast<00:06:02.139> and<00:06:03.139> here

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
online which is refreshing fast and here

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.450 
online which is refreshing fast and here
we<00:06:03.410> can<00:06:03.560> say<00:06:03.740> it's<00:06:04.010> still<00:06:04.250> running<00:06:06.280> in<00:06:07.280> the

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
we can say it's still running in the

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.850 
we can say it's still running in the
next<00:06:07.760> tutorial<00:06:08.210> I<00:06:08.389> will<00:06:08.720> explain<00:06:08.780> how<00:06:09.229> to

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860
