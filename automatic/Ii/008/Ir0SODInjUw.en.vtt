the<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.170> fast<00:00:46.440> corners<00:00:46.860> or<00:00:46.980> slow<00:00:47.100> corners

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
the the fast corners or slow corners

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:58.569 
the the fast corners or slow corners
it's<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.880> lot<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.060> fun<00:00:51.770> combination<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.829> section

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.430 

pretty<00:00:59.579> daunting<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.630> guess<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.140> half<00:01:01.320> an

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
pretty daunting but I guess it half an

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:21.970 
pretty daunting but I guess it half an
hour<00:01:01.590> although<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.100> tail

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.110 

it<00:01:22.980> was<00:01:23.130> good<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:23.640> very<00:01:23.850> different

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
it was good it was very different

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.030 
it was good it was very different
because<00:01:24.480> it's<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.870> new<00:01:25.020> track<00:01:25.260> so<00:01:25.560> very<00:01:25.860> busy

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
because it's a new track so very busy

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.060 
because it's a new track so very busy
very<00:01:26.190> hard<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.760> lot<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.910> a<00:01:27.600> lot<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.440> trying<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:28.890> on

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
very hard a lot of a lot of trying to on

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.770 
very hard a lot of a lot of trying to on
the<00:01:29.220> lines<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.880> working<00:01:30.540> through<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the lines and working through the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.270 
the lines and working through the
corners<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.260> it'll<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.620> good<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.980> know<00:01:32.070> once

out there to be honest said certain
parts<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.060> tracks<00:01:51.300> ten<00:01:51.540> tints<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.410> think

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.840 
pieces it's changed a lot so you're on
this<00:02:36.500> enjoying<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.220> more<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.640> more<00:02:37.730> every

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
this enjoying it more and more every

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.370 
this enjoying it more and more every
time<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.390> on<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.630> tracks<00:02:38.870> it's<00:02:39.110> tricky

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
time you on the tracks it's tricky

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.990 
time you on the tracks it's tricky
actually<00:02:39.890> it's<00:02:39.980> not<00:02:40.069> an<00:02:40.220> easy<00:02:40.370> place<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.850> learn

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
actually it's not an easy place to learn

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.699 
actually it's not an easy place to learn
so<00:02:41.510> getting<00:02:41.840> more<00:02:42.019> likes<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.349> more<00:02:42.500> laps

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
so getting more likes and more laps

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:43.960 
so getting more likes and more laps
getting<00:02:42.980> to<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.130> confidence<00:02:43.610> it's<00:02:43.760> bloody

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
getting to the confidence it's bloody

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.309 
getting to the confidence it's bloody
cool

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.559 

but<00:02:49.650> though<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.280> did<00:02:50.579> qualify<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.209> then<00:02:51.360> it

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
but though I did qualify in just then it

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.940 
but though I did qualify in just then it
was<00:02:51.659> pretty<00:02:51.810> good<00:02:51.989> able<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.319> push<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.650> limits

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
was pretty good able to push the limits

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.619 
was pretty good able to push the limits
get<00:02:53.159> a<00:02:53.189> lot<00:02:53.370> faster<00:02:53.819> than<00:02:53.939> we<00:02:54.090> originally<00:02:54.209> were

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
get a lot faster than we originally were

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.300 
get a lot faster than we originally were
