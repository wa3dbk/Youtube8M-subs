00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hello youtube as a chimpanzee dog 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.560
 Welcome to an exciting round 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.510
 domination on the map golmud there is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.309
 Of course, the titles already read in the title 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.120
 the community web or the night maps 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.219
 or open 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.809
 yes the classic map so the prototypes 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.859
 the last few days can play 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.930
 but what is it ? 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.300
 easter egg from the megalodon of persia storm 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.350
 and what is with it now at all 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.840
 battlefield 4 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.460
 Well, long talk short sense I'll me 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.140
 not want to break off here either 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.220
 and try again over has one or 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.810
 I'll talk something like that 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.460
 in between increasingly profitable 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.840
 bring a channel because I think so 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.820
 It has become a pretty cool game 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.320
 but on the pc game especially easy 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.059
 nobody should do that now but not the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.020
 title or respectively see this 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.340
 his videos here 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.070
 I just wanted to ask for a moment 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.140
 what's the situation with the others? 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.820
 maps remember there were times 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.660
 this community member was this thing 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.700
 I already have a few videos about this 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.050
 have done and also finds 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.850
 to the videos and in the video 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.350
 description or I'll blind you if 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.550
 I'll talk about that here again 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.199
 as note 1 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.910
 what I did on my channel 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.530
 and how I feel about it 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.180
 what I think of it because the whole 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.739
 Things are actually there in there 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.110
 you have to think big stromer 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.460
 the stuff is really horny fuck that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.650
 is driven right 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.320
 First, the community with yes there could 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.549
 to have a say in how we feel 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.350
 to imagine that or in which direction 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.580
 the whole thing should go if that's him 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.140
 bit of jungle or whatever 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.460
 should have been and I found that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.229
 really model I have as I said 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.960
 also makes bios and that has me 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.400
 pretty much, I'll say hello again 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.780
 the feedback has been received and 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.460
 then again briefly as pointing to 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.960
 it can not always be on everything 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.369
 So yes, if you are 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.439
 now, for example, for the west 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.060
 will keep a lot of players in the world and 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.500
 a lot, even for the world's biggest sellers 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.700
 franchise and such and wishes 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.619
 then now, for example, a feature 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.299
 that maybe you yourself very much 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.560
 but cool finds in the unit so 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.930
 in the general in the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.850
 in the big total, there's no such thing 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.920
 many people do the same thing then 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.270
 think then it is logical that the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.799
 developer so in the case then stop there 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.600
 is somehow a step back 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.579
 and think well maybe one is 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
 cool feature but if it is the most 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.979
 not really wanting people 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.179
 or want to have then 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.619
 we just need that too 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.390
 not at first but how does she look 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.270
 now with the community with last 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.009
 It was just that we were already 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.149
 a lot of new textures all over 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.530
 have gotten world that is quite 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.239
 Well it looks like he's still a bit 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.680
 has been braked back and forth so yes 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.260
 say that, for example, the temple 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.330
 right in the back in the back 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.440
 area of ​​the factory with built in where he 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.360
 but that was not the newest 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.010
 that was already I say already 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.530
 a two weeks before it is now 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.970
 currently the info flow in the area 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.709
 a bit dried up, too 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.660
 understandable is because it is just 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.489
 currently the classic web so the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.870
 first prototype of dragon rallye the 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.819
 we play for a short time now 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.010
 can and that is in principle a remake 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.840
 or should I say it better the map 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.660
 remake because there was in advance 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.519
 just a few to ask how or 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.440
 which web would you pitt as brad 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.000
 player again in battlefield 4 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.500
 then stop and I have to go now 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.109
 unfortunately a bit silly 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.260
 criticize because there you could probably on 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:57.630
 all the sites of Battlefield 942 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.329
 march to battlefield 3 website 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.280
 from very early to very old 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.660
 and there was first evaluated yes what 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.590
 because it came out and I have 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.090
 honestly, that's not the case 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.470
 but I am one hundred persecuted 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.390
 Just tell it like me 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.310
 completely over come because we are 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.380
 come on all websites and only 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.980
 after being published now 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.989
 what was being booted, etc. is now 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.069
 at least for me at least it looked like that 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.569
 so are a few out 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.340
 selection criteria so a few 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.989
 Exclusion rules are still in place 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.180
 afterwards, how come 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.620
 for example well of the so 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.389
 we want to share the latest battlefield 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.340
 that of course does not have any 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.750
 Battlefield 3 Mass no web company 2 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.489
 maps and so on and so forth 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.530
 and then there were more stuff 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.450
 halt excluded resp 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.980
 Not at all with approved I think 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.540
 personally a great pity because I belong 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.549
 to those who are on new channels 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.560
 have really looked forward to it and 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.960
 have almost assumed that 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.610
 of course one 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.740
 a huge number of participants also have 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.630
 the polls are held by explorer channels 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.850
 voted and well I am now 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.320
 just a little bit lost the wrong one 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.210
 but already a bit 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.910
 disappointed with the then the night maps 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.790
 year of course from seed of shanghai 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.380
 capsules night map versions there were 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.760
 stop playing in the city which became 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.770
 a bit adapted there was with the 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.540
 then played 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.180
 we played gold railway we have 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.830
 once also call market in the 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.360
 light version stop in the city 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.489
 in between times can play and so 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.840
 continue and so far everything right 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.730
 cool but what about the now 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.920
 fight when do you come out there is 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.550
 Unfortunately, no public 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.560
 statement 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.330
 and then I just think okay 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.800
 I am I understand that it is 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.780
 Creating maps takes a long time and 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.030
 certainly also until the final version 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.680
 really takes a few months up to 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.730
 but one is finished with who 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.290
 community more we have the 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.510
 different sorrow maps we have the 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.830
 you get a classic map and in between 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.450
 then stop to information with how 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.670
 for example, well , there's stop 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.350
 this easter egg from the megalodon on 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.180
 perrys storm has been installed 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.110
 but you only play in the city 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.270
 can and only under very specific 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.250
 conditions also first of all 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.740
 But carriers can become a finished game 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.000
 that does not come in, so that's okay 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.620
 ever be a lot of work because 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.060
 I really want to do that 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.220
 somehow fall not misunderstood 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.380
 but I think that is on the 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.880
 what has been thought wrong 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.830
 You write this to me please in the 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.480
 comments and of course you will find all 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.710
 videos that I have addressed this 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.120
 on a canal is nice again 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.190
 club linked in the description or 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.930
 as previously said very briefly as 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.490
 notes my name is 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.050
 jim rumba i say thank you for watching 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.760
 and we always see each other in the next 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.290
 video maybe there's already one 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.570
 few updates to the community web too 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.490
 classic map or even to the apps skin 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.490
 pure and have fun with brad pitt
