00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.759
 so big 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.729
 in general, everything is almost all that is possible 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.329
 write such a small device here 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.829
 chapters gave sun rhythm let's see 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:38.430
 on the device itself, this is my own watch 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.970
 and here we have equipment comes to her 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.420
 snakes and micro so thin to charge 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.720
 hours themselves 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:54.869

 watch with white strap sent to us 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.000
 now look at the external strap 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.900
 strap such oak oak oak 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.390
 different unbutton 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.730
 strap naturally not goats although it was 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.560
 stated that it is not stated written 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.540
 leather strap on this is not leather this 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.720
 Chinese skin they are not in general themselves 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.340
 watch this we are 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.820
 sticker on the screen yes here we are 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.000
 we remove apparently such a black screen here 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:31.800
 button it does not turn it just 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.560
 click so here we have a hole for 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:42.930
 probably the sound I do not know what now 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:47.040
 let INCLUDING so well that 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.120
 We see the clock is ticking clock time is not 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.240
 they lied that 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.600
 finger movement can change the dial 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.070
 as you can see now he is so red 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.740
 red became green that's how such 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.320
 desktop can be with a butterfly with such 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.750
 butterfly and such options 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.370
 hours to choose well let them dear to vodka 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.200
 this is the main to the main 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.050
 the display shows the time date 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.840
 bluetooth setting music connects 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.910
 to the phone via bluetooth it has 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.220
 bluetooth pedometer chronograph calendar 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.830
 stated that it seems like a friend 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.620
 waterproof but something i doubt 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.200
 very much judging by these holes here 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.950
 they are waterproof straight strong 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.989
 strongly doubt that and anti lose 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.269
 there are generally to be found can be 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.830
 control the camera phone connects 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.540
 how umk android connects and can 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.650
 enjoy put this phone on and 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.440
 here press the stop button 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.980
 take a picture also sns comes 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.440
 you can write the monitors text message from here on 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.230
 there is that you can watch there how much you 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.900
 overslept but like smart hours in the morning xiaomi 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.390
 such as the resolution goes 240 by 240 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.650
 but let's go through the menu by the way 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:13.630
 Russian language is already now I wipe 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:17.920
 slapped a little go away 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:21.100
 menu report that due to this it is not us 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.610
 not connected tank music message 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.200
 those. we have so bluetooth pedometer 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.180
 clock face 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:33.850
 contacts camera alarm stopwatch 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.940
 language settings time empty guys in 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.690
 Generally now we are so fugitive let's go 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.870
 we'll see and then when I figure it out and 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.570
 already clearly you walk through the menu and sat down 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.730
 I will tell because now it is so special 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.230
 it's hard for you to tell 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.980
 for example such a display yes 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:59.590
 to see the time you need to click on 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:02.890
 This button should be a little bit. 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.590
 long and press not just not 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:11.490
 principle yes in 1 click 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.490
 Well, Che is not the first time so 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.840
 somehow buggy them a little in my 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:30.800
 all worked out shorter they see 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:37.670
 some buggy came through through goes 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:40.940
 one time it turns on and I understand everything 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.940
 look to 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:48.169
 just to see the time you click 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.209
 this button appears hard to 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.419
 go to the menu click this big one 

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:55.159
 button here and here you already 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:58.579
 everything is displayed in principle the display 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:06:01.939
 there is no gps matrix, so of course 

00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:07.309
 nothing really can be seen if if 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:09.979
 tilt but by and large by 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:12.199
 largely seen well at kranchik 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.569
 responsive to finger very uncomfortable 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:16.759
 well managed package turns over 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.919
 ok so here you can dial 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:22.759
 You can call through them but this of course 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.319
 for an amateur but it's all such a watch on 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:27.409
 We sent a review will understand 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:29.179
 we will test connect and everything is all 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:32.059
 all all all all as they will on let's 

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:33.019
 hand at believe at least see how they 

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:38.479
 look on hand 

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:40.369
 but the strap is up to econom option well 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:43.089
 Something like that, in principle, there is 

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:46.399
 style is somehow not so unusual 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:49.189
 This screen is cool principle 

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:51.709
 cool well the main thing is that there functions 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:53.809
 a bunch of them stated that they have four 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:57.679
 hours of work you can talk in 

00:06:53.809 --> 00:07:00.439
 four hours standby 

00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:02.059
 about 100 to 120 hours but always language 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:03.739
 russian interface ok venus translation to 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:06.409
 principle x ok everything is translated by 

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:08.749
 godly general then the idea should be 

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:11.179
 interesting device that is, if you too 

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:13.549
 they had to be somewhere in your bag 

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:15.829
 rules in terms of for me what will he be 

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:18.679
 Dubin for example if you are driving 

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:21.019
 the phone lies bags and you come and sms and 

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:22.999
 you can just look at and there is no place 

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:25.249
 that I received a message there, come in 

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:27.110
 in and here you can read 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:29.539
 if something important you can already call back 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:32.059
 there forest also incoming call sure 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:33.979
 have a look and someone calling you there 

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:37.069
 god shows them the phone number all 

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:38.389
 everything is such a handy thing of course we are 

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:40.399
 we will test it to understand 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:42.649
 see how what works how much 

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:44.599
 keeps therefore thank you for watching 

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:46.110
 if not yet signed and subscribe 

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:47.910
 necessarily 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.390
 this is still a large number of both contests and 

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:53.040
 draws and interesting products therefore 

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.740
 thank you for watching and wish you 

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.880
 health great positive luck 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.880
 life bye bye
