badi<00:03:21.489> batteries<00:03:22.209> pretty<00:03:22.540> quickly<00:03:23.040> one<00:03:24.040> thing

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
badi batteries pretty quickly one thing

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.010 
badi batteries pretty quickly one thing
is<00:03:24.489> is<00:03:24.700> when<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.000> batteries<00:03:25.360> run<00:03:25.570> low<00:03:25.600> it

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
is is when the batteries run low it

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.020 
is is when the batteries run low it
tells<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.530> batteries<00:03:27.220> are<00:03:27.370> running<00:03:27.459> low<00:03:27.790> and

tells you batteries are running low and

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.729 
tells you batteries are running low and
it<00:03:28.330> gives<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:28.810> message<00:03:28.989> about<00:03:29.350> twice

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
it gives you that message about twice

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.910 
it gives you that message about twice
and<00:03:30.100> then<00:03:30.430> it'll<00:03:30.880> it'll<00:03:31.660> turn<00:03:31.900> off<00:03:32.080> or<00:03:32.380> on<00:03:32.560> you

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
and then it'll it'll turn off or on you

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.120

so<00:03:33.130> if<00:03:33.280> you're<00:03:33.520> in<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:34.330> middle<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:34.660> a<00:03:34.750> game<00:03:35.130> it

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
so if you're in the middle of a game it

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.430 
so if you're in the middle of a game it
will<00:03:36.430> shut<00:03:36.940> off<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.239> audio<00:03:37.540> on<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:37.930> so<00:03:38.290> that

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
will shut off the audio on you so that

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.220 
will shut off the audio on you so that

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
Evans and then I went up to the next

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.479 
Evans and then I went up to the next
pair<00:03:49.270> which<00:03:49.450> was<00:03:49.630> an<00:03:49.780> x<00:03:49.959> 41<00:03:50.500> which<00:03:51.070> is<00:03:51.250> what<00:03:51.459> I

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
pair which was an x 41 which is what I

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.180 
pair which was an x 41 which is what I
have<00:03:51.910> been<00:03:51.940> using<00:03:52.330> I<00:03:52.750> want<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.709> try<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:53.950> next

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
have been using I want to try the next

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.860 
have been using I want to try the next
generation<00:03:54.820> so<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.030> went<00:03:55.270> out<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:55.570> got<00:03:55.600> these

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
generation so I went out and I got these

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.710 
generation so I went out and I got these
XP<00:03:56.320> five<00:03:56.500> hundreds<00:03:56.950> some<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.120> pros<00:03:58.360> about

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
XP five hundreds some of the pros about

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.990 
XP five hundreds some of the pros about
them<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.680> presets<00:04:00.130> are<00:04:00.250> great<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.700> can't

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
them the presets are great you can't

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.630 
them the presets are great you can't
beat<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.570> is<00:04:01.900> completely<00:04:02.650> wireless<00:04:03.040> you<00:04:03.520> can

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
beat it is completely wireless you can

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.949 
beat it is completely wireless you can
get<00:04:03.730> up<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.000> walk<00:04:04.120> away<00:04:04.330> you<00:04:04.450> don't<00:04:04.660> have<00:04:04.840> to

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
get up and walk away you don't have to

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.870 
get up and walk away you don't have to
take<00:04:05.140> your<00:04:05.320> controller<00:04:05.680> with<00:04:05.920> your<00:04:06.130> unplug<00:04:06.670> it

take your controller with your unplug it
it's<00:04:07.600> programmable<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.950> if<00:04:09.100> you're<00:04:09.280> an<00:04:09.310> audio

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
it's programmable so if you're an audio

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.120 
it's programmable so if you're an audio
themed<00:04:10.300> you<00:04:10.900> can<00:04:11.019> go<00:04:11.170> in<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.530> get<00:04:11.950> those

morphing voices and if you think that

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.349 
morphing voices and if you think that
that's<00:04:17.440> funny<00:04:17.769> or<00:04:17.950> whatever<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.910> sound<00:04:19.180> on

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
that's funny or whatever the sound on

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.240 
that's funny or whatever the sound on
them<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.630> unbelievable<00:04:20.320> each<00:04:20.500> cup<00:04:20.799> has<00:04:21.010> its

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
them is unbelievable each cup has its

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.659 
them is unbelievable each cup has its
own<00:04:21.430> set<00:04:21.730> of<00:04:23.070> speakers<00:04:24.070> so<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.340> can<00:04:24.490> hear

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
own set of speakers so you can hear

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.420 
own set of speakers so you can hear
things<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.270> then<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.350> microphone<00:04:26.890> is<00:04:26.919> really

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
things and then the microphone is really

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.330 
things and then the microphone is really
great

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
great

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.220 
great
you<00:04:28.520> can't<00:04:28.850> hear<00:04:29.030> yourself<00:04:29.150> when<00:04:29.510> you<00:04:29.810> talk<00:04:30.020> in

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
you can't hear yourself when you talk in

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.020 
you can't hear yourself when you talk in
it<00:04:30.320> there's<00:04:30.530> no<00:04:30.770> echo<00:04:31.130> you<00:04:31.699> can<00:04:31.820> go<00:04:31.910> and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
it there's no echo you can go and

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.129 
it there's no echo you can go and
actually<00:04:32.270> program<00:04:32.990> it<00:04:33.020> for<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.440> threshold<00:04:34.430> and

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
actually program it for a threshold and

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.560 
actually program it for a threshold and
the<00:04:36.250> microphone<00:04:37.250> will<00:04:37.580> not<00:04:37.760> come<00:04:38.060> on<00:04:38.210> unless

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
the microphone will not come on unless

the microphone will not come on unless
that<00:04:38.630> audio<00:04:39.380> is<00:04:40.370> met<00:04:41.030> for<00:04:41.510> that<00:04:41.660> threshold

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
that audio is met for that threshold

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.280 
that audio is met for that threshold
some<00:04:42.949> of<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.160> negatives<00:04:43.639> using<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.449> USB<00:04:44.750> port

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
some of the negatives using the USB port

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.540 
some of the negatives using the USB port
and<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.530> computer<00:04:46.040> can<00:04:46.220> be<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.340> little

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
and the computer can be a little

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.219 
and the computer can be a little
difficult<00:04:46.760> trying<00:04:47.479> to<00:04:47.600> understand<00:04:48.020> how<00:04:48.169> to

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
difficult trying to understand how to

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.140 
difficult trying to understand how to
get<00:04:48.440> those<00:04:48.650> programs<00:04:49.220> on<00:04:49.460> there<00:04:49.610> working<00:04:50.030> with

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
get those programs on there working with

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.560 
get those programs on there working with
Pete<00:04:50.770> PDF<00:04:51.770> files<00:04:52.040> it<00:04:52.639> could<00:04:52.910> be<00:04:53.000> a<00:04:53.030> little<00:04:53.300> a

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
Pete PDF files it could be a little a

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.610 
Pete PDF files it could be a little a
little<00:04:54.370> challenging<00:04:55.370> but<00:04:55.660> if<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:57.470> have<00:04:57.590> a

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
little challenging but if you have a

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.560 
little challenging but if you have a
quick<00:04:58.250> learning<00:04:58.460> curve<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:58.940> can<00:04:58.970> overcome<00:04:59.510> it

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
quick learning curve you can overcome it

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.090 
quick learning curve you can overcome it
you<00:04:59.870> can<00:05:00.020> set<00:05:00.260> it<00:05:00.290> up<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.590> way<00:05:00.620> that<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:00.919> want

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
you can set it up the way that you want

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.100 
you can set it up the way that you want
it<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:01.400> it<00:05:01.520> really<00:05:01.970> does<00:05:02.300> make<00:05:02.630> it<00:05:02.840> quite

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
it and it really does make it quite

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.280 
it and it really does make it quite
enjoyable<00:05:03.620> so<00:05:04.280> those<00:05:04.460> are<00:05:04.610> some<00:05:05.360> of<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:05.990> pros

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
enjoyable so those are some of the pros

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.440 
enjoyable so those are some of the pros
that<00:05:06.680> go<00:05:07.130> along<00:05:07.340> with<00:05:07.550> this<00:05:08.000> piece<00:05:08.270> of

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
that go along with this piece of

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.440 
that go along with this piece of
equipment<00:05:08.570> and<00:05:09.260> I<00:05:10.220> find<00:05:10.580> that<00:05:10.790> overall<00:05:11.300> the

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
equipment and I find that overall the

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.190 
equipment and I find that overall the
sound<00:05:11.900> on<00:05:12.080> it<00:05:12.229> is<00:05:12.380> is<00:05:12.590> very<00:05:12.860> good<00:05:13.460> you<00:05:14.450> can't

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
sound on it is is very good you can't

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.370 
sound on it is is very good you can't
really<00:05:15.889> get<00:05:16.550> any<00:05:16.790> better<00:05:16.910> audio<00:05:17.600> than<00:05:17.960> what

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
really get any better audio than what

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.469 
really get any better audio than what
you<00:05:18.530> have<00:05:18.680> through<00:05:18.889> there<00:05:19.070> right<00:05:19.250> now<00:05:19.430> some<00:05:20.389> of

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
the negatives that I encountered well to

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.500 
the negatives that I encountered well to
finish<00:05:25.280> up<00:05:25.430> some<00:05:25.580> of<00:05:25.639> the<00:05:25.729> positives<00:05:26.180> the

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
finish up some of the positives the

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.379 
finish up some of the positives the
