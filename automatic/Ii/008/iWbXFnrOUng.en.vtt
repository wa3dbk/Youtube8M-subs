00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
could be that you're shifting too far

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.810 
could be that you're shifting too far
forward<00:01:30.570> with<00:01:30.689> your<00:01:30.869> lower<00:01:31.020> body<00:01:31.670> now<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.700> think

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
forward with your lower body now I think

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.480 
forward with your lower body now I think
we<00:01:33.090> all<00:01:33.119> know<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:34.350> there's<00:01:34.560> no<00:01:34.710> secret<00:01:35.280> move

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
we all know but there's no secret move

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.100 
we all know but there's no secret move
that<00:01:35.759> we<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:35.970> apply<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.270> our<00:01:36.450> game<00:01:36.780> that's

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
that we can apply to our game that's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.080 
that we can apply to our game that's
just<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.500> fix<00:01:37.740> all<00:01:37.920> everything<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.060> us

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
just going to fix all everything for us

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.310 
just going to fix all everything for us
and<00:01:39.240> we're<00:01:39.329> gonna<00:01:39.420> start<00:01:39.630> playing<00:01:39.840> fantastic

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and we're gonna start playing fantastic

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.530 
and we're gonna start playing fantastic
golf<00:01:40.710> I've<00:01:41.400> never<00:01:41.610> heard<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.909> anybody<00:01:42.150> that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
golf I've never heard of anybody that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.170 
golf I've never heard of anybody that
was<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> 20<00:01:43.200> handicap<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:44.340> found<00:01:44.610> out<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.000> one

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
was a 20 handicap that found out the one

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.510 
was a 20 handicap that found out the one
little<00:01:45.450> secret<00:01:45.840> move<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.979> catapulted

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
little secret move and it catapulted

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.789 
little secret move and it catapulted
them<00:01:47.640> onto<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:47.970> PGA<00:01:48.299> Tour<00:01:48.380> you'll<00:01:49.380> never<00:01:49.619> hear

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
them onto the PGA Tour you'll never hear

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.679 
them onto the PGA Tour you'll never hear
that<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.579> how<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.880> works<00:01:51.090> it's

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that it's just not how it works it's

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.020 
that it's just not how it works it's
about<00:01:51.810> building<00:01:52.229> an<00:01:52.619> entire<00:01:52.799> swing<00:01:53.430> that's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
about building an entire swing that's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.580 
about building an entire swing that's
fundamentally<00:01:54.720> solid<00:01:54.930> that's<00:01:55.380> going<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
fundamentally solid that's going to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.969 
fundamentally solid that's going to
allow<00:01:55.680> us<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.009> play<00:01:56.310> well<00:01:56.610> day<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.689> day<00:01:57.780> out

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
allow us to play well day in and day out

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.249 
allow us to play well day in and day out
now<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.159> said<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.850> think<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.390> Hogan<00:02:00.810> had

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
now that said I do think that Hogan had

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.830 
now that said I do think that Hogan had
some<00:02:01.500> secret<00:02:01.920> keys<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.490> he<00:02:02.610> used<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.540> become

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
some secret keys that he used to become

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.289 
some secret keys that he used to become
a<00:02:03.869> much<00:02:04.200> better<00:02:04.469> golfer<00:02:04.950> than<00:02:05.060> most<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.210> his

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
a much better golfer than most of his

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.399 
a much better golfer than most of his
counterparts

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
counterparts

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.070 
counterparts
one<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.069> these<00:02:08.220> secret<00:02:08.640> keys<00:02:08.879> was<00:02:09.360> eliminating

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
one of these secret keys was eliminating

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.720 
one of these secret keys was eliminating
one<00:02:10.410> side<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.769> the<00:02:10.830> golf<00:02:10.979> course<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.580> he

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
one side of the golf course and he

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.210 
one side of the golf course and he
practiced<00:02:12.269> doing<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.260> daily<00:02:13.590> basis

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
practiced doing this on a daily basis

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.250 
practiced doing this on a daily basis
and<00:02:14.489> I'm<00:02:14.940> positive<00:02:15.750> that's<00:02:15.870> one<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and I'm positive that's one of the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.690 
and I'm positive that's one of the
things<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.560> helped<00:02:16.830> him<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.129> become<00:02:17.220> such<00:02:17.670> a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
things that helped him to become such a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.280 
things that helped him to become such a
great<00:02:17.970> golfer<00:02:18.390> i'm<00:02:18.900> going<00:02:19.049> to<00:02:19.140> show<00:02:19.260> you

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
great golfer i'm going to show you

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.900 
great golfer i'm going to show you
exactly<00:02:19.470> how<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.160> practice<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.819> on

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
exactly how you can practice that on

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.059 
exactly how you can practice that on
your<00:02:21.030> own<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.680> go<00:02:22.769> out<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
your own so that you can go out on the

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.009 
your own so that you can go out on the
course<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:24.180> there's<00:02:24.360> trouble<00:02:24.569> on<00:02:24.810> one

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
course and if there's trouble on one

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.900 
course and if there's trouble on one
side<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.560> other<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.129> can<00:02:26.280> eliminate<00:02:26.519> that

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
side of the other you can eliminate that

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.000 
side of the other you can eliminate that
side<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.299> golf<00:02:27.480> course<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.049> make<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.709> much

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
side of the golf course and make it much

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.809 
side of the golf course and make it much
easier<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:30.209> make<00:02:30.360> pars<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.989> lot<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.170> birdies

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
easier to make pars and a lot of birdies

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.309 
easier to make pars and a lot of birdies
I'm<00:02:32.819> also<00:02:33.030> going<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.390> go<00:02:33.510> over<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:33.930> video

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
I'm also going to go over in this video

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.770 
I'm also going to go over in this video
how<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:34.980> tone<00:02:35.340> down<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.670> our<00:02:36.269> shot<00:02:36.540> shaping

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
how to tone down that our shot shaping

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.570 
how to tone down that our shot shaping
so<00:02:37.230> we<00:02:37.349> talked<00:02:37.530> about<00:02:37.769> how<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.920> hit<00:02:38.099> these<00:02:38.220> big

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
so we talked about how to hit these big

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.640 
so we talked about how to hit these big
hooks<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.180> these<00:02:39.269> big<00:02:39.510> slices<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.349> they're

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
hooks and these big slices and they're

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.930 
hooks and these big slices and they're
really<00:02:40.769> learned<00:02:41.040> how<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.220> manipulate<00:02:41.459> your

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
really learned how to manipulate your

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.210 
really learned how to manipulate your
hands<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.480> body<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:43.319> get<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.650> ball<00:02:43.829> moving

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
hands and body to get that ball moving

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.589 
hands and body to get that ball moving
now<00:02:44.760> we're<00:02:44.940> going<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.090> talk<00:02:45.239> about<00:02:45.360> how<00:02:45.510> to

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
now we're going to talk about how to

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.569 
now we're going to talk about how to
tone<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.049> down<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.860> shot<00:02:47.069> can<00:02:47.250> be<00:02:47.400> a

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
tone that down so the shot can be a

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.400 
tone that down so the shot can be a
pretty<00:02:47.849> straight<00:02:48.180> shot<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.780> fall<00:02:49.110> to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
pretty straight shot and this fall to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.530 
pretty straight shot and this fall to
the<00:02:49.530> left<00:02:49.739> or<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.099> right<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.610> it's<00:02:51.450> going

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
the left or to the right and it's going

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.360 
the left or to the right and it's going
to<00:02:51.599> be<00:02:51.720> much<00:02:51.989> more<00:02:52.019> consistent<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:52.860> much<00:02:53.160> more

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
to be much more consistent and much more

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.559 
to be much more consistent and much more
effective<00:02:53.879> when<00:02:54.030> you're<00:02:54.150> actually<00:02:54.269> playing

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
effective when you're actually playing

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.420 
effective when you're actually playing
around<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.959> golf<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.950> if<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.099> want<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.340> learn

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
around a golf so if you want to learn

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.220 
around a golf so if you want to learn
how<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.670> incorporate<00:02:57.239> one<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.870> Hogan's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
how to incorporate one of Hogan's

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.259

do here is that we're going to actually

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.760 
do here is that we're going to actually
adjust<00:04:49.820> our<00:04:50.000> stance<00:04:50.390> for<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.750> first<00:04:50.990> time<00:04:51.230> to

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
adjust our stance for the first time to

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.130 
adjust our stance for the first time to
start<00:04:51.980> to<00:04:52.100> tone<00:04:52.310> down<00:04:52.340> these<00:04:52.730> shots<00:04:53.030> now<00:04:53.870> in

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
start to tone down these shots now in

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.200 
start to tone down these shots now in
the<00:04:54.230> past<00:04:54.530> I<00:04:54.950> had<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.550> keep<00:04:55.730> your<00:04:55.910> stance

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
the past I had you keep your stance

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.210

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
hands and arms and Club to swing out to

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.610 
hands and arms and Club to swing out to
the<00:05:01.190> right<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.960> reason<00:05:03.290> that<00:05:03.320> we<00:05:03.470> don't

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
the right and the reason that we don't

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.440 
the right and the reason that we don't
want<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:03.950> do<00:05:04.100> this<00:05:04.280> other<00:05:04.700> than<00:05:04.970> just<00:05:05.270> learning

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
want to do this other than just learning

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.960 
want to do this other than just learning
the<00:05:05.780> move<00:05:06.020> is<00:05:06.350> that<00:05:06.770> that<00:05:07.280> can<00:05:07.430> get<00:05:07.580> that<00:05:07.700> Club

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
the move is that that can get that Club

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.360 
the move is that that can get that Club
working<00:05:08.360> too<00:05:08.570> far<00:05:08.840> in<00:05:09.020> behind<00:05:09.350> our<00:05:09.500> body<00:05:09.710> so<00:05:10.310> if

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
working too far in behind our body so if

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.130 
working too far in behind our body so if
I<00:05:10.460> need<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.640> swing<00:05:11.060> 20<00:05:11.480> yards<00:05:11.750> out<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:12.020> the
