00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello friends and welcome to 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.000
 another wolf creation the map 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.059
 at ebel objects from the north portal point 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.250
 he comes the blue baby 210 has me 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.230
 asked to make a video he 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.330
 like first to 1 5 counter 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.859
 the total of faith then writes 40 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.949
 long lines was the sensual 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.439
 description must honestly say little 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.720
 understood nothing of it as you see 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.420
 I got changed immediately and it 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.130
 works friends and we look 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.809
 the one on the far herrenhausen 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.480
 map this is for example web where this 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.219
 map be integrated with block 6 and the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.780
 map is actually only relatively young though 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.969
 You really have to be very popular 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.530
 say and we have almost at 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.770
 state you live this contract 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.510
 you will be offered that provide object 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.219
 they have to buy first 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.510
 this requires a lot of diligence so far all 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.430
 bought objects 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.590
 We can then decide if you want 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.680
 that of course want to install or not 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.489
 with the key pekinger the install and 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:09.210
 it is then available or confessed 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.130
 or we let know with the c so 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.560
 ignore quasi makes little sense that 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.409
 means we decide for the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.590
 precious objects with the us dp and us 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.240
 already have the first neighbors objects 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.439
 behind us had such a quasi 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.180
 objects how not to do that 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.979
 So you are right to it then 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.320
 winterbikes theme can buy and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.079
 let's see here, and we could 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.400
 buy now at wind farm and then 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.200
 a description also pretty nice 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.439
 description will be four wind wheels 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.299
 constructed which their income from 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.329
 To secure 2000 euro per hour that is 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.210
 Insane would have scared and that is 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.070
 important friends would only have a preview 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.119
 on subject attention please do not on it 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.130
 press or 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.820
 nice that the b because gamer comes 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.820
 music that is 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.179
 It does not matter to me, but for me it is 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.420
 no matter who does not get locked up 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.460
 the topic but for all the videos 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.320
 would not do anything with it there 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.149
 who proposes the db of his known 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.549
 the whole purchase with at &amp; t if we have money 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:14.040
 But we did not have that meaning 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.040
 We look at each other like that 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.330
 or friends one again 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.459
 bisserl already there again something like that jumps 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.269
 we build energy for you biogas 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.390
 technology 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.040
 we could use the biogas plant 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.620
 herrenhausen buy this quasi 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.959
 bargain or always nearly 800,000 the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.209
 It's not bad by itself 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.130
 You also have to buy some objects 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.849
 bgh complete bgh 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.440
 Let's see what we have 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.510
 actually now we only have more 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.400
 objects are so nice but they exist 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.489
 but only the bda dgb the bgh now and the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.840
 wind wheels start to start and we 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.819
 Now just try where it is 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.950
 to sell us the bga to buy 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.760
 let's see how it works have 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.650
 a beauty soon 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.160
 Sold tractors and now you do 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.810
 the cup of tea and there is now 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:16.889
 a wg is always then he opens it 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.650
 very much or broke the sluggish murder 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:24.010
 and then we bought a bga dirk 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.569
 adams us logically here fund purchased with 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.269
 it was possible to work better 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.609
 pretty much the first money then the second 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.380
 she looks good with the beautiful ones 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.389
 Silos I like it personally 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.370
 good season 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:38.400
 but it really is a pity looks good 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:44.680
 from there is nothing to complain about quite a few 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:49.510
 Silos back to old machines 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.090
 Unterstand Kemmer buy there some 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.609
 dragees small to the bg one 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.560
 machine shelter we see with one 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.770
 workbench this nice detail on each 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.900
 case and 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:06.240
 Here we have our own bgh 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.190
 It is always cool that is a visual 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.440
 which is different than the standard ways 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.850
 In any case cool thing I would him 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.890
 recommend that he try it himself 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.350
 friends it is not the point of the matter 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.239
 was now every object is buying team 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.739
 to discover what's next for objects 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.080
 There are only a few more 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.850
 and the appreciation to invite friends 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:31.500
 that you try the same I believe there 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:34.260
 in the back maybe in the distance 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.190
 just take a quick look that's really 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.650
 cool thing the map at apple objects 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.250
 according to the really fun and there 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.960
 As worried now several times more 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.920
 Objects forgive more objects that you 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.710
 can buy a quasi even to 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.470
 discover it is even colder 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:59.150
 galler webby awards thanks for watching 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.150
