00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
one level which is called Kingdom Valley

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.429 
one level which is called Kingdom Valley
this<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.730> area<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.660> huge<00:00:31.080> map

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
this is one of the area of the huge map

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.340 
this is one of the area of the huge map
which<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.130> included<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.180> Sonic<00:00:38.239> the

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
which is included in Sonic the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.410 
which is included in Sonic the
developers<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.680> coming<00:00:41.370> back<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> really

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
beginning of the Sonic so they are

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.619 
beginning of the Sonic so they are
trying<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.379> show<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.890> graphics<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.030> also<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
benefits of the next generation console

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.590 
benefits of the next generation console
they<00:00:52.320> want<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> show<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.160> real<00:00:53.579> speed<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
they want to show the real speed of the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.650 
they want to show the real speed of the
Sonic

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.469 
titles are really like kind of like game
like<00:01:07.010> Sonic<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.910> can<00:01:09.120> feel<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
like Sonic and then you can feel the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.750 
like Sonic and then you can feel the
speed<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.710> better<00:01:10.979> with<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
speed but it's better with the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.630 
speed but it's better with the
next-generation<00:01:12.660> console<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.370> next

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
next-generation console with the next

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.230 
next-generation console with the next
generation<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:16.140> feel<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.430> realistic

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
generation you can feel the realistic

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.359 
generation you can feel the realistic
wall<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:19.260> you<00:01:19.410> can<00:01:19.619> feel<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.340> are

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
fund site and also cool side of Sonic

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.590 
fund site and also cool side of Sonic
with<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.140> next-generation<00:01:43.970> console<00:01:44.970> they

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
with the next-generation console they

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.520 
with the next-generation console they
wanted<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.320> make<00:01:46.680> Sonic<00:01:47.430> really<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:49.170> going

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
wanted to make Sonic really to going

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.529 
wanted to make Sonic really to going
back<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.640> beginning<00:01:50.910> of<00:01:51.300> the

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
back to the really beginning of the

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:52.670 
back to the really beginning of the
Sonics

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
Sonics

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.779 
Sonics
concept<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.520> also<00:01:54.090> they<00:01:54.479> wanted<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.789> include

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
concept and also they wanted to include

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.310 
concept and also they wanted to include
the<00:01:57.509> new<00:01:58.520> consumers<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.940> they<00:02:00.420> changed<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the new consumers so they changed the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.490 
the new consumers so they changed the
design<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> Sonic<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.970> it<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.930> more

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
design of the Sonic of it to be more

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.240 
design of the Sonic of it to be more
like<00:02:04.670> adult<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.940> kind<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.619> make<00:02:07.619> him<00:02:07.860> taller

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
like adult like kind of make him taller

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.110 
like adult like kind of make him taller
and<00:02:08.580> also<00:02:09.179> make<00:02:09.390> cooler<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:11.099> they<00:02:11.670> believe

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and also make cooler so they believe

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.620 
and also make cooler so they believe
they<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.690> bring<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.860> new<00:02:14.209> consumers<00:02:15.209> and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
they can bring the new consumers and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.170 
they can bring the new consumers and
also<00:02:15.810> old<00:02:16.349> consumers<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.670> next

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
also old consumers to this next

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.820 
also old consumers to this next
generation

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.400 

the<00:02:25.250> sword<00:02:25.580> is<00:02:25.840> necessary<00:02:26.840> they're<00:02:27.170> not

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
the sword is necessary they're not

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.190 
the sword is necessary they're not
really<00:02:27.800> different<00:02:28.430> between<00:02:28.640> 360<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.840> also

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
really different between 360 and also

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.100 
really different between 360 and also
PSE<00:02:30.740> but<00:02:31.210> compared<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.600> current

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
PSE but compared to the current

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.160 
PSE but compared to the current
generation<00:02:33.290> they<00:02:34.160> have<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> lot<00:02:35.150> work<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.930> they

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
generation they have a lot work and they

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.610 
generation they have a lot work and they
have<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.410> lot<00:02:36.710> of<00:02:36.740> level<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.750> kind<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.810> stage<00:02:39.200> of

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
have a lot of level of kind of stage of

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.490 
have a lot of level of kind of stage of
development<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.670> in<00:02:41.360> terms<00:02:41.570> of<00:02:41.810> graphics<00:02:42.290> and

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
development and in terms of graphics and

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.190 
development and in terms of graphics and
also<00:02:42.740> in<00:02:42.950> terms<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.370> physics<00:02:43.820> calculation<00:02:44.540> the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
also in terms of physics calculation the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.120 
also in terms of physics calculation the
more<00:02:45.440> they<00:02:45.860> have<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.460> do<00:02:46.670> it's<00:02:47.210> kind<00:02:47.990> of<00:02:48.130> it's

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
more they have to do it's kind of it's

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.270 
more they have to do it's kind of it's
getting<00:02:49.550> more<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.600> more<00:02:50.710> things<00:02:51.710> they<00:02:52.100> have

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
getting more and more things they have

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.610 
getting more and more things they have
to<00:02:52.460> develop<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.270> then<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:53.630> kind<00:02:53.960> of<00:02:54.050> getting

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
to develop and then it's kind of getting

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:07.110 
to develop and then it's kind of getting
deeper<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.070> deeper<00:02:55.280> for<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.210> developers

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.870
