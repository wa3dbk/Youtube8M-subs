00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 3 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.930
 hello youtube friends how are you 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.139
 We continue with our course of 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.670
 introduction to juniti 4.3 in the video 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.160
 previous we learned how to create a 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.620
 third person controller character 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.340
 in init and will allow us to have here 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.920
 our character 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.550
 and be able to move with the keys 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.230
 double usb now we will see how to import 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.000
 the animations that we have done in maya 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.400
 example of the animation that the 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.920
 character is running 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.440
 so to do this we go to juniti 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.810
 we had already seen so much import the 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.060
 character as the animal character 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.770
 this animated character is important 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.540
 what can week 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.180
 in the type of animation we select 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.670
 generic mechanical animation since 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.060
 let's use the mechanics system 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.980
 of unity to do the animations what 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.290
 next we go to animation if we go to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.910
 start creating animation clips if 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.500
 here we look we have all the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.720
 animations of our character 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.949
 then the first one that we are going to use 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.949
 it is the idol 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:19.850
 the static that is this that we see here in 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.850
 maya that goes from frame 2 to front 16 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.000
 which is when the character is still 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.240
 before he does anything 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.030
 then frame 2 goes frame 16 what 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.960
 that we have to place here in unity that 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.960
 start in frame 2 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.980
 up to 16 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.890
 if we play here we can see the 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.110
 preview of the animation 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.810
 and we say that they are adopted so that 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.640
 repeat again and again selection of sac 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.640
 bake in your post 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.230
 that this 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.110
 will allow us what 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.330
 when you rotate you also run the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.960
 animation of both rotation and 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.740
 position and we say it here that 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.709
 facebook position we do it so that 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.780
 when a-rod and when you move 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:17.790
 continue making the animation 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.790
 and we give here to play 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.400
 and we have already created the first animation 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.680
 if we give him play 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.900
 it still does not reproduce because this 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.520
 we have to do in the next video 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.260
 in this case we are only going to load 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.840
 the animation clips to create the 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.840
 next let's call when I take 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.319
 but let's go back to maya 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.180
 for from the inventive end not 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.180
 until 3 46 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.460
 and here until the cycle when he 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.670
 is running 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.750
 from 21 to 46 then here that starts in 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.340
 the 21st 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.160
 and go to 46 just like a loop 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.390
 to be repeated again and again 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.760
 again the picking to post so that 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.080
 do it regardless of the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.080
 rotation or movement 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.129
 if it's not beach 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.370
 let's play here we see the 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.920
 preview of the current object and 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.800
 now the last one is the jump we see 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.069
 again amaya jump goes from the 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.040
 frame 50 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:40.480
 until frame 77 I think we did good 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.480
 50 to 77 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:53.450
 from 50 to 77 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.450
 here we click on add another jump 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.340
 start in 50 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.400
 and goes to 77 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.250
 in this case we do not want it to be a loop 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.200
 since we are not interested in being repeated 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.510
 again and again and again but simply 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.370
 when we press space jump once 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:19.700
 and no longer keep jumping another and another 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:23.770
 we say that he sees quintuples 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.770
 both in rotation and in position mind 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.960
 and we tell him to play and ready 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.539
 we have here our three clips of 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.310
 animation in the next video we will see 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.439
 how will I call your clips using the 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.360
 system of mechanics in such a way that 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.889
 when he walks, the 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.889
 animation of 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.389
 ran and when it comes out the 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.979
 jump animation 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.509
 then do not forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.229
 to the facebook page and see you in 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.229
 the next video
