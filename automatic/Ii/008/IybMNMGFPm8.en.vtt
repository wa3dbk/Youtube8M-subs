 What is fish thank people. Fishtanktv.com, Dustin's aquariums will take you on a Sunday. It's kind of a Sunday. I have so many species from my ears. I'm just going to see you all of them. Give you a small taste of what's going on. Do the species separately. Love your feedback on some of the fish I have. Luckily for lying around fluently cause these things have been a lifesaver. Okay, so where do I start? Let's take a look here. The most common fish I saw in Peru were these Apistogrammas. I believe a bitaeniata there. "Bi" means two lines. Many women and men. There is the random corydoras, whitesman corydoras that I actually bought at the wholesaler. I'll show you his entire school that he lives with. Look at that apisto there. I've got a ton of apistos here that I'm going to have to separate them once they start causing the males to get angry and start beating on each other. But there is a lot of Apistogramma here so I am really excited about that. It is one of those fish that I knew would ship well, really hardy. Check out the fins on that one. And they are only better, with a better color. So they ate, that's huge. I fed them with a bunch last night, red mosquito larvae, so they are rocking. There is also a show of various catfish here, there is another Apisto there. The tanks are all murky, just the fronts of them because I have been working in and out on doing them a lot of water changes. Take a look at these Whitesman cory cats. I went to buy this and the man was like, "Those are special". And I was like "Really, tell me why". It seems that there are twice as many as there is because of the reflection and that is what they are loving. They have not left this corner, but they sat in this corner and just played and played. I bought as, one, two, three, four, five and six. I bought like seven of them and they said these corys are great because they like cold water. My tank's kind of cold, so I'm really excited about that. They come from the lakes in the Andes, and the water freezes at night. So they are a potential to go out in the greenhouse this winter so I am very excited. Anyone who knows anything about Whitesman Cory Cats let me know. Here are a few Apistogrammas just right now dominating. As far as victims go, um I just had. Ah, you're amazing, I'm so glad I brought .. And I didn't see these fish, they just woke up for a while. That's a nice looking Apistogramma bitaeniata there. These fish already acclimatize, I floated them for 6 hours, added about 8 grams to each bag, then removed part of the water if I did. Slowly, slowly they acclimatize, then I just have them in. A few floaters in the pockets, which makes me nervous that there is an ammonia peak or whatever. It's funny because it's old. I love dirt, I love it for almost everything, except for fish in the wild that naturally dig up like this catfish here that just digs under it. I'm not sure if you can see him there. So I have a lot of people in there. They are like a family member of cichlids. I also really stumbled out. Oh, this little guy here. I forget what it's called. Brian loves it, it actually goes into Brian's tank for all his help. I had made six of them just one of them. And then I also had six of these guys. No Altums, but I had six of these, but three of them made it, and they ate bloodworms last night so I'm really jacked about it. Really cool, I mean these fish were all over the place down there. And I love their long fins and they are going to be very sweet once they get used to me, but they need a water change. I have about fifty Loretta Ensis I believe is what you say, the Cory cats. I'm not sure if you can see it. I actually caught about having this myself, and the other half Devon, whose info by the way, the information about this trip is in the body of these comments. Sorry the body of the writeup on this Devon's email is there so you can get it. So many of these Cory Cats. It's funny that she actually came from a beach, I'm actually thinking about adding some white sand. You can see their color very well matched, they sit there. My Swartz and Sturbays directly SCAME from this tank, it was hilarious. I added a bunch of Cory Cats and boom, she dove. There's those guys. So that's what's down here people. Really excited. I probably need about 40% water change in this sucker here, and then a 40 on the other. Just cause there is so much more ammonia in these tanks. And I keep my tanks fairly lightly filled as you all know, so I definitely have some work ahead of me tonight. But that's what's going on. I wanted to share. For some reason these two Cory cats don't hang out with the rest. Just like these, they are just like crazy. So that's what I do people. I'm really excited. I appreciate all feedback on the latest video. Barowello there. And I'm just having a good time. It's a little stressful as I have to get used to them all, you know, and keep doing water changes so it's a lot higher fish stock and a little more work, but, you know, it's worth the work. That's what's up. Whitesman Cory Cats. Tell me about them.
