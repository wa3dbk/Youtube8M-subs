this<00:00:32.669> video<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.650> I<00:00:34.650> don't<00:00:34.890> know<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.310> think<00:00:35.370> this

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
this video so I don't know I think this

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.760 
this video so I don't know I think this
is<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> glitch<00:00:36.090> hungry<00:00:36.600> or<00:00:36.780> maybe<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.530> in

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
is a glitch hungry or maybe it's just in

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.610 
is a glitch hungry or maybe it's just in
the<00:00:37.950> new<00:00:38.100> update<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.760> something<00:00:39.140> but<00:00:40.140> when<00:00:40.440> you

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the new update or something but when you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.890 
the new update or something but when you
fuse<00:00:40.860> two<00:00:41.190> epics<00:00:41.640> together<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.450> get<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
fuse two epics together you get a

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.530 
fuse two epics together you get a
guaranteed<00:00:43.770> epic<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.879> think<00:00:44.970> that<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
guaranteed epic so I think that is

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.720 
guaranteed epic so I think that is
totally<00:00:46.050> amazing<00:00:46.350> tell<00:00:46.950> me<00:00:47.100> guys<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.550> he

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
about this so if we go here and fuse to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.430 
about this so if we go here and fuse to
Legendary's<00:00:54.000> together<00:00:54.449> you'll<00:00:55.110> see<00:00:55.320> it's

Legendary's together you'll see it's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.860

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
not this curse man shrouds but I don't

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.910 
not this curse man shrouds but I don't
use<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.420> got<00:01:15.630> from<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.080> boss<00:01:16.320> collection

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
use what I got from the boss collection

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.130 
use what I got from the boss collection
event<00:01:17.510> and<00:01:19.790> why<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.150> our<00:01:21.330> Brazil<00:01:21.750> Vanguard

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
event and why not be our Brazil Vanguard

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.680 
event and why not be our Brazil Vanguard
because<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.530> am<00:01:22.979> currently<00:01:23.400> using<00:01:23.690> aquatic

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
because I am currently using aquatic

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.920 
because I am currently using aquatic
battle<00:01:24.960> gear<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.880> my<00:01:27.090> opinion<00:01:27.570> that's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
battle gear and and in my opinion that's

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.039 
battle gear and and in my opinion that's
quite<00:01:28.469> better<00:01:28.740> than<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> Zune<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:30.049> also

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
quite better than the Zune and also

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.550 
quite better than the Zune and also
stats<00:01:31.350> wise<00:01:31.560> its<00:01:31.829> betters<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:33.000> because<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.229> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
stats wise its betters so because of a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.350 
stats wise its betters so because of a
new<00:01:34.740> glitch<00:01:34.950> or<00:01:35.159> maybe<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:36.000> been<00:01:36.149> one

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360

like I know Co zinc and captain court I

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.749 
like I know Co zinc and captain court I
think<00:02:01.439> that's<00:02:01.829> his<00:02:02.009> name<00:02:02.159> sorry<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.640> I'm

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
think that's his name sorry if I'm

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.719 
think that's his name sorry if I'm
pronouncing<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.509> wrong<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.799> they<00:02:05.009> uploaded<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
pronouncing it wrong but they uploaded a

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.330 
pronouncing it wrong but they uploaded a
video<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.179> this<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.740> chosing<00:02:07.740> she<00:02:07.920> feels<00:02:08.160> like

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
video on this and chosing she feels like

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.070 
video on this and chosing she feels like
a<00:02:08.399> bunch<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.880> epics<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.630> that<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.020> think

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
a bunch of epics like that and I think

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.370
