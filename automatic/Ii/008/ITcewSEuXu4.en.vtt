you<00:02:29.819> can<00:02:30.000> see<00:02:30.269> they<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.780> curds<00:02:31.049> separating

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
you can see they the curds separating

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.720 
you can see they the curds separating
from<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.130> way<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.390> greenish<00:02:33.900> liquid<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.129> the

moment we don't want any more curdling

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.860 
moment we don't want any more curdling
to<00:02:43.620> happen<00:02:44.010> otherwise<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.299> paneer<00:02:45.630> will

to happen otherwise the paneer will

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.069 
to happen otherwise the paneer will
become<00:02:46.230> very<00:02:46.799> hard<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.849> is<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.090> time<00:02:48.450> when<00:02:49.049> I

this

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
this

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.090

that I kept the paneer pressed under
heavy<00:06:00.940> weight<00:06:01.350> let's<00:06:02.350> check<00:06:02.620> on<00:06:02.770> it<00:06:02.890> it's

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
heavy weight let's check on it it's

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.840 
heavy weight let's check on it it's
spongy<00:06:04.660> which<00:06:05.620> means<00:06:05.920> that<00:06:06.220> it's<00:06:06.370> moist

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
spongy which means that it's moist

enough let's cut a slice out of this

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.570 
enough let's cut a slice out of this
this<00:06:11.509> is<00:06:11.719> how<00:06:11.930> it<00:06:12.139> is<00:06:12.169> looking<00:06:12.619> like<00:06:12.680> from<00:06:13.460> the
