00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.500
 you see a new format with giga me 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.540
 could swing big talk by now 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.649
 explain why this is the best video 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.120
 will what he will ever see 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.120
 instead dragon ball z 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.359
 how many of you do I have one 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.199
 a lot of nostalgic feelings 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.390
 dragon ball z 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.859
 It was the perfect mix from after easy 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.810
 funny story to be understood 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.670
 character and incredible coal fighting 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.679
 for a youthful little the question 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.510
 is when today in trance vol at film 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.340
 It could always appear to me 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.340
 still packing time for battle of god 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.510
 Yes / Yes 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.460
 About 17 years this year appeared 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.899
 with dragonball seattle on god finally 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.579
 again new movie to the series 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.440
 unlike the 13 before 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.030
 published films battle of gods firmer 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.800
 Part of the series action and is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.989
 shortly after the fight against bout 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.769
 settled also in big reason 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.870
 to the anticipation 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.309
 while both dragonball wti as well 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.049
 the other dragon ball z movies 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.659
 produced only by third persons 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.509
 were serial inventor akira toriyama 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.740
 for battle of gods solid component 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.509
 the author team 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.860
 So I was really curious I have 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.990
 nothing for many years 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.610
 seen rainbow set and now there akira 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.440
 toriyama finally back row of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.700
 creative teams was I thought the 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.659
 There is not much that can go wrong 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.460
 or 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.590
 both the title fight of the gods as 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.690
 also the fact that serial inventor akira 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.369
 even part of the creative team is 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.140
 lets hope for that us with 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.630
 dragonball you battle of course 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.530
 incredibly epic masterpiece expected 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.479
 that is not the case 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.090
 in fact, metal is very very godly 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.830
 unlike, is nevertheless but was 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.179
 really cool the story of battle 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.039
 of gods is much less 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.240
 epic as it is from the title fight 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.130
 the gods would expect 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.780
 while sonoco of chaos planet 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.789
 He gets the message he trains 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.079
 virus of god destruction after 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.450
 decades of sleep again 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.280
 woke up his call hastened ahead of him 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.110
 Although he does not seem to be angry 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.609
 to be when he is in a bad mood 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.500
 can it ever happen that 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:06.329
 he destroys another planet 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.920
 virus has from a cent in god 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.640
 dreamed and set himself on the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.440
 away to the earth 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.600
 where should kokos kinship straight 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.560
 celebrating Burma's birthday and doing that 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.450
 actually already with the story 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.280
 the only threat arises from it 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.049
 that we are the god of destruction 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.970
 is and when we get in a bad mood 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.810
 then, of course, destroyed in this case 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.030
 the earth 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.769
 there is no big plan to earth 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.450
 there is no big will to destroy 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.130
 absolutely killing designer jeans 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.660
 instead, Russ could just get up 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.769
 the earth sees the powder there 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.900
 birthday celebrates and wants with her 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.730
 celebrate and in the future the people have to stop 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.049
 necessarily prevent offices 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.850
 because of this bad mood gets 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.590
 dragonball reminds you the medium too 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.829
 actually much more dragon 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.319
 ball 1 man's origin dragonball as 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.630
 At Tracy, there is only one really 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.269
 Great spectacular fight the rest of the 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.920
 time is dedicated to walk in and ulmer 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.340
 and all the other characters just 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.840
 talks 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.879
 comedy relief it's just about it 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.099
 that you see the characters again 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.530
 Her character gets her own laughter 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.910
 and you laugh a lot but when it does 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.310
 then finally come to fight 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.290
 then show you battle of course 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.239
 with the most spectacular thing he's ever been to 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.040
 dragon ball sets universe have seen 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.840
 Of course there are immense technical ones 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.379
 progress compared to the 90s 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.819
 years 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.980
 and that also happens every second 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.230
 noticeable in anime this anime movie 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.849
 it is incredibly spectacular if one 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.650
 somehow new kamehameha about the 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.790
 screen flickers it looks so much 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.440
 better than before 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.940
 while in the series the people 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.310
 you fought and you did not fight 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.410
 has seen except fast lines the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.450
 to represent the fists and the legs 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.819
 should now be every movement sequence 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.810
 really accurate animated it moves 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.150
 incredible fast 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.980
 There are many funds supported by iii 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.540
 camera rides a special highlight 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.430
 of dragonball are of course the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.440
 There are also transformations 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.860
 a new one is actually a new one 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.860
 platform next superstar john 1234 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.390
 ultra and 15 intermediate levels 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.430
 where I have long been the overview 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.200
 admittedly there are lost 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.269
 now also the 2 j 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.980
 in fact, this new sargent will be from 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.780
 but also needs to be needed 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.549
 villain virus is very very much 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.049
 stronger than any of us so far 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.739
 known characters in dragon ball 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.209
 universe 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.069
 that even leads to a lot 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.170
 nice talk at the end of the history of the 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.639
 if he is not very typical for the series 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.019
 I just assume that from 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.970
 where does the new form come from? 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.010
 must be superior to its opponents 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.729
 as it always was in the series of the Wirt 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.729
 to experience the surprise 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:39.129
 in 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.129
 here we are free 

00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:46.449
 and to go 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:47.800
 such wonderful nostalgic is again 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.969
 a few kamehameha it for the 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.740
 see screen flicker 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.599
 means on god celebrates the bulk of 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.550
 Just time its characters 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.409
 nobody gets forgotten everyone gets 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.729
 something to say it was a trip back 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.289
 in my childhood the perfect one 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.849
 entertained for 90 minutes 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.620
 it was less epic than I suspected 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.389
 I would like to have that 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.979
 forgive because instead I have a lot 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.659
 laughed a lot and just a wonderful 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.580
 Feel the whole thing 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:10.689
 presumably once again 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.240
 last time to see 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.740
 so if you are from previous gold fansite 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.659
 has grown up with it from the past 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.979
 since then you should dragonball the 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.229
 battle of gods in no case 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.340
 just do not expect to miss 90 minutes 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.139
 to see action 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.879
 because you do not get that bad here 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.150
 I do not think that's great anyway 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.150
 Movie 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.759
 I like it very much 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.259
 I hope you have this format too 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.729
 like about it as well if you 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.689
 you liked it then you write that in 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.979
 the comments if it is not you 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.539
 liked or if you still have one 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.740
 few things did not please then 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.229
 Write to me so synonymous with the 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.699
 comments or to robin giga.de because 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.599
 if that arrives well with you the format 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.860
 then maybe we want in the future 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.990
 make a little more often 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.180
 so please write me that if 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.680
 the theme says to you then anime 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.330
 you should check this article below 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.610
 click data namely the tom and me 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.169
 a bit too much 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.590
 written that is a mega blatant 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:16.900
 fannie mae from japan says that straight 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.400
 finished and then have the tom and 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.349
 I also dragon a few months ago 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.789
 played ball z times which was very funny 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:23.319
 because we had no idea what was 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.909
 actually have done quite a bit of fun 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:27.419
 goodbye a bit today 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.419
 urge wool
