00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.360
 then this is a practice before 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.420
 a photo resistance and a photodiode that 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:29.650
 It is made up of a resistance 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:34.160
 a kilo of 4.7 kilos a kilo and 330 we go 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.720
 here we have a transistor a relay and a 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.210
 led 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.579
 we connect the photo resistance to a 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.970
 one kilo resistance that goes to voltage 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.270
 and a photodiode carried a resistance 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.950
 It is 4,200 kilos 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.090
 we connect a 748 transistor to 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.090
 amplify the relay and that you had 5 you 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.090
 you were 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.790
 to connect a resistor in 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.260
 parallel to the relent 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.050
 as we see below 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.180
 with supply voltage to the relay it 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.780
 he wants to learn to read 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:18.500
 in this part where this transmitter 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:23.060
 we have connected the connector to the relente 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.230
 the advance to the photodiode and the limit the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.090
 land 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.610
 well we will pass below what is 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.450
 the critic where we will learn the source 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.450
 voltage and asia 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.400
 good our voltage source that 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.530
 power the circuit 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.340
 well here below we have the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.860
 off when we put the card 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.890
 interrupting the podium and the future 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.100
 intention to learn to read 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.540
 or we have here learned to read because 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.580
 we have connected to the really 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.860
 closed and we have the why is that 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.900
 turn on and off in the good to 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.640
 then the verification by means of 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.650
 of a multimeter we will see what is the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.700
 voltage of a photodiode 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.319
 to a transmitter 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.810
 and we see that those axes 4.99 that means 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.440
 that is short and new so part 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.730
 of the voltage 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.100
 alves and therefore when we put the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.830
 card 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.780
 Learn to read and measure what is the 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.780
 voltage again 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.460
 and we see that the voltage has decreased to 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.480
 1.10 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.810
 this means that it is saturated and 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.990
 it turns on power totally with another 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.990
 time
