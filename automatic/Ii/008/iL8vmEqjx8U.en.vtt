00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.600
 Hi, I'm Saia Marina, I'm going to give four 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:27.610
 very basic tips to improve the 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:29.380
 technique improving climb on the train 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.300
 the climb technique consider three 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.600
 very important advantages in the train that 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.379
 is the power the strength in the stride and 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.379
 the agility in the step 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.530
 to improve the technique we will start by 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.239
 the central torso especially 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.089
 inclination has to be 45 degrees 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.890
 respect to the ground always very important 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.750
 looking at the ground and a half height and 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.750
 we can always help a little with 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.989
 the hands on the quadriceps and pulling 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.989
 up 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.030
 a very important part for the technique 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.950
 of your life are your knees the more 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.660
 inclination there is in the terrain more 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:32.420
 we will raise the knees and so we 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:34.520
 will greatly facilitate the step in the rise and 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.010
 another very important step to make a 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.710
 good stride in your life is entering 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.300
 always with pointed toe tips, then 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.300
 heel and in steps always short 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.240
 and one last detail the arms always 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.260
 they help us to push us by forcing 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.260
 body movements
