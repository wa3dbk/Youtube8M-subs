00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
quick review considering that there

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.799 
quick review considering that there
isn't<00:00:45.250> much<00:00:45.460> to<00:00:45.730> this<00:00:45.850> device<00:00:46.180> especially

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
isn't much to this device especially

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.299 
isn't much to this device especially
since<00:00:47.019> I<00:00:47.110> didn't<00:00:47.559> get<00:00:47.650> into<00:00:47.890> more<00:00:48.010> feature

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
since I didn't get into more feature

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.119 
since I didn't get into more feature
pack<00:00:48.670> order<00:00:49.089> brother<00:00:49.360> which<00:00:49.930> is<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.170> FX<00:00:50.620> cube

pack order brother which is the FX cube

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.369 
pack order brother which is the FX cube
so<00:00:51.640> as<00:00:51.760> far<00:00:51.940> as<00:00:52.000> looks<00:00:52.329> go<00:00:52.420> it's<00:00:52.690> quite<00:00:52.960> simple

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
so as far as looks go it's quite simple

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:54.990 
so as far as looks go it's quite simple
I<00:00:53.470> mean<00:00:53.500> it's<00:00:53.830> not<00:00:54.040> like<00:00:54.309> it<00:00:54.519> should<00:00:54.790> be

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
I mean it's not like it should be

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.030 
I mean it's not like it should be
overboard<00:00:55.600> but<00:00:55.930> I<00:00:55.989> like<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.440> black<00:00:56.739> sleek

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.810 
about his size ladies I think if it was
a<00:01:53.170> little<00:01:53.560> bit<00:01:53.680> smaller<00:01:54.070> it<00:01:54.400> would<00:01:54.520> be<00:01:54.610> way

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
a little bit smaller it would be way

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.440 
a little bit smaller it would be way
better

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
better

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.050 
better
I<00:01:55.480> would<00:01:56.350> even<00:01:56.500> settle<00:01:56.950> for<00:01:56.980> a<00:01:57.190> flat<00:01:57.640> design

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
I would even settle for a flat design

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.730 
I would even settle for a flat design
because<00:01:58.480> the<00:01:58.570> back<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.020> mixer<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.470> bigger

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
because the back of the mixer is bigger

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.110 
because the back of the mixer is bigger
than<00:01:59.980> the<00:02:00.070> front<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.550> there<00:02:00.670> is<00:02:00.760> an<00:02:00.850> eclipse

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
than the front and there is an eclipse

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.330 
than the front and there is an eclipse
like<00:02:01.450> drop<00:02:01.810> on<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.140> upper<00:02:02.440> half<00:02:02.680> of<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.950> mixer

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
like drop on the upper half of the mixer

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.160 
like drop on the upper half of the mixer
the<00:02:04.090> reason<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.480> this<00:02:04.600> is<00:02:04.750> kind<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.050> a

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
the reason that this is kind of a

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.080 
the reason that this is kind of a
problem<00:02:05.560> for<00:02:05.710> me<00:02:06.010> is<00:02:06.160> that<00:02:06.400> it<00:02:06.580> doesn't<00:02:06.790> really

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
problem for me is that it doesn't really

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.570 
problem for me is that it doesn't really
fit<00:02:07.420> well<00:02:07.780> under<00:02:08.170> my<00:02:08.290> monitor<00:02:08.740> like<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.070> wanted

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
fit well under my monitor like I wanted

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.270 
fit well under my monitor like I wanted
it<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:10.780> usually<00:02:11.260> put<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.500> over<00:02:11.710> to<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.070> right

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
it so I usually put it over to the right

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.830 
it so I usually put it over to the right
of<00:02:12.430> my<00:02:12.550> monitor<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.210> really<00:02:13.450> clutters

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
of my monitor and that really clutters

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.990 
of my monitor and that really clutters
on<00:02:13.990> my<00:02:14.110> desk<00:02:14.380> face<00:02:14.680> since<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.400> still<00:02:15.640> have<00:02:15.820> my

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
on my desk face since I still have my

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.720 
on my desk face since I still have my
DIY<00:02:16.450> headphone<00:02:16.930> stand<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.590> my<00:02:17.740> PC<00:02:18.160> over<00:02:18.550> there

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
DIY headphone stand and my PC over there

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.510 
DIY headphone stand and my PC over there
too<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.500> all<00:02:20.650> in<00:02:20.830> all<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:20.980> think<00:02:21.100> that<00:02:21.310> this

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
too so all in all I think that this

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.670 
too so all in all I think that this
thing<00:02:21.790> will<00:02:22.030> load<00:02:22.180> myself<00:02:22.420> could<00:02:23.140> benefit

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
thing will load myself could benefit

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.310 
thing will load myself could benefit
from<00:02:23.890> using<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.340> little<00:02:24.490> wink<00:02:24.790> as<00:02:25.600> far<00:02:25.930> as<00:02:26.050> sound

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
from using a little wink as far as sound

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.650 
from using a little wink as far as sound
goes<00:02:26.620> things<00:02:27.130> aren't<00:02:27.430> too<00:02:27.730> overbearing<00:02:28.300> and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
goes things aren't too overbearing and

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.330 
goes things aren't too overbearing and
it<00:02:28.840> gives<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.140> base<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.350> more<00:02:29.650> precise<00:02:29.980> kick

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
it gives the base a more precise kick

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.890 
it gives the base a more precise kick
than<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.700> get<00:02:30.880> from<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> built-in<00:02:31.390> sound<00:02:31.750> card

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
than I get from the built-in sound card

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.260 
than I get from the built-in sound card
on<00:02:32.170> my<00:02:32.230> PC<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:33.310> interface<00:02:33.700> makes<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.060> sound

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
on my PC this interface makes you sound

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.720 
on my PC this interface makes you sound
more<00:02:34.570> immersive<00:02:35.020> as<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.470> whole<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:36.310> first<00:02:36.550> time

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
more immersive as a whole the first time

more immersive as a whole the first time

really any cons the problems that I

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.610 
really any cons the problems that I
