00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
chemically is very easy you just force

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.960 
chemically is very easy you just force
them<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.729> container<00:02:05.640> always<00:02:06.640> read<00:02:06.850> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
them in a container always read the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.260 
them in a container always read the
directions<00:02:07.330> you<00:02:09.119> may<00:02:10.119> want<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.540> use<00:02:10.690> gloves

with<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.510> use<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.230> little<00:02:14.560> paintbrush

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:33.140 

basically<00:02:23.849> just<00:02:24.560> start<00:02:25.560> putting<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:32.150> so

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
basically just start putting it on so

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.970 
basically just start putting it on so
with<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.450> chemical<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.409> get<00:02:34.650> into

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
with the chemical you can get into

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.220 
with the chemical you can get into
little<00:02:35.310> spots<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.239> crevices<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.840> you

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
little spots and crevices that you

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.190 
little spots and crevices that you
wouldn't<00:02:37.530> be<00:02:37.650> able<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.480> with<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> wire<00:02:39.780> brush

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
wouldn't be able to with a wire brush

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.119 
wouldn't be able to with a wire brush
and<00:02:41.150> for<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.299> product<00:02:42.599> we<00:02:43.019> wait<00:02:43.260> 15<00:02:43.830> minutes

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129

and for this product we wait 15 minutes
and<00:02:45.379> then<00:02:46.379> we<00:02:46.530> come<00:02:46.739> back<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:50.209> wash<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.420> off

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.840 

may<00:03:10.540> take<00:03:10.780> more<00:03:11.050> than<00:03:11.110> one<00:03:11.340> application<00:03:12.340> and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
may take more than one application and

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.720 
may take more than one application and
how

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:30.900

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.730 

this<00:03:31.420> will<00:03:31.570> stop<00:03:31.780> rusting<00:03:32.200> again<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.680> about

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
this will stop rusting again and about

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.970 
this will stop rusting again and about
24<00:03:33.400> hours<00:03:33.640> since<00:03:34.030> we<00:03:34.320> cleaned<00:03:35.320> off<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.680> naval

jelly with water but even if you use a
wire<00:03:38.950> brush<00:03:39.100> method<00:03:39.910> it's<00:03:40.210> a<00:03:40.450> good<00:03:40.660> idea<00:03:40.840> to
