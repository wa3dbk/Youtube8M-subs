00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
for the site so I wanted to just take

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.810 
for the site so I wanted to just take
what<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.300> had<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.950> put<00:00:49.950> something<00:00:50.190> down<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
what we had and put something down on a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.580 
what we had and put something down on a
plate<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.390> how<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.629> tastes<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.289> think

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
plate and see how it tastes but I think

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.010 
plate and see how it tastes but I think

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
the store I was at so I was like well

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.510 
the store I was at so I was like well
let's<00:04:42.449> get<00:04:42.930> this<00:04:43.110> one<00:04:43.320> although<00:04:43.860> this<00:04:44.130> is<00:04:44.280> not

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
let's get this one although this is not

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.100 
let's get this one although this is not
something<00:04:45.060> that<00:04:45.090> is<00:04:45.330> literally<00:04:45.720> an<00:04:45.810> approved

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
something that is literally an approved

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.900 
something that is literally an approved
we<00:04:46.289> definitely<00:04:46.710> don't<00:04:46.800> yeah<00:04:46.979> and<00:04:47.610> it's<00:04:47.789> not

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
we definitely don't yeah and it's not

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.520 
we definitely don't yeah and it's not
likely<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.449> prove<00:04:48.690> because<00:04:49.080> look<00:04:49.320> at<00:04:49.380> the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
likely to prove because look at the

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.950 
likely to prove because look at the
ingredients<00:04:50.160> or<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.340> nutrition<00:04:50.940> facts<00:04:51.210> in

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
ingredients or the nutrition facts in

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.129 
ingredients or the nutrition facts in
one<00:04:52.259> cup<00:04:52.620> of<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:53.190> almond<00:04:53.759> milk<00:04:53.970> we<00:04:54.630> got<00:04:54.660> 90

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
one cup of this almond milk we got 90

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.060 
one cup of this almond milk we got 90
calories<00:04:55.320> which<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:55.770> may<00:04:55.860> be<00:04:55.919> thinking

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
calories which you may be thinking

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.950 
calories which you may be thinking
that's<00:04:56.280> not<00:04:56.400> that<00:04:56.610> bad<00:04:56.849> if<00:04:57.449> you<00:04:57.599> work<00:04:57.780> out<00:04:57.930> the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
that's not that bad if you work out the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.390 
that's not that bad if you work out the
percentage<00:04:58.500> of<00:04:58.590> where<00:04:58.740> those<00:04:58.860> calories<00:04:59.130> are

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
percentage of where those calories are

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.159 
percentage of where those calories are
coming<00:04:59.490> from<00:04:59.789> it's<00:05:00.060> all<00:05:00.180> coming<00:05:00.660> from<00:05:00.690> sugar

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
coming from it's all coming from sugar

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.120 
coming from it's all coming from sugar
which<00:05:01.320> is<00:05:01.349> 16<00:05:01.860> grams<00:05:02.070> so<00:05:02.250> multiply<00:05:02.580> that<00:05:02.669> by<00:05:02.729> 4

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
which is 16 grams so multiply that by 4

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.150 
which is 16 grams so multiply that by 4
64<00:05:05.130> grams<00:05:05.460> or<00:05:05.880> 64<00:05:06.300> calories<00:05:06.740> you<00:05:07.740> know<00:05:07.860> so

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
64 grams or 64 calories you know so

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.980 
64 grams or 64 calories you know so
basically<00:05:08.520> two<00:05:08.940> thirds<00:05:09.180> of<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.389> calories<00:05:09.810> are

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
basically two thirds of the calories are

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.180 
basically two thirds of the calories are
from<00:05:10.349> the<00:05:11.300> sugar<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:12.539> 16<00:05:13.530> grams<00:05:13.740> of<00:05:13.919> sugar<00:05:14.099> and

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
from the sugar and 16 grams of sugar and

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.890 
from the sugar and 16 grams of sugar and
an<00:05:14.370> upcoming<00:05:14.490> episode<00:05:15.060> of<00:05:15.090> live<00:05:15.270> link<00:05:15.449> TV<00:05:15.599> I'm

from the American Heart Association that
women<00:05:20.729> only<00:05:21.419> get<00:05:21.630> 20<00:05:22.110> grams<00:05:22.289> of<00:05:22.440> sugar<00:05:22.680> a<00:05:22.800> day

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
women only get 20 grams of sugar a day

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.790 
women only get 20 grams of sugar a day
and<00:05:23.400> men<00:05:24.180> get<00:05:24.479> 32<00:05:24.960> grams<00:05:25.199> or<00:05:25.470> somewhere<00:05:25.740> around

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
and men get 32 grams or somewhere around

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.370 
and men get 32 grams or somewhere around
32<00:05:26.159> grams<00:05:26.430> so<00:05:27.060> basically<00:05:27.419> by<00:05:27.630> having<00:05:27.930> one<00:05:28.139> cup

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
32 grams so basically by having one cup

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.589 
32 grams so basically by having one cup
of<00:05:28.530> this<00:05:28.650> almond<00:05:29.009> milk<00:05:29.220> you<00:05:29.490> are<00:05:29.880> having

need for a day and for kids you should
only<00:05:35.699> have<00:05:35.849> I<00:05:36.000> think<00:05:36.120> it's<00:05:36.300> about<00:05:36.449> 16<00:05:36.960> grand<00:05:37.229> or

only have I think it's about 16 grand or
18<00:05:37.770> grams<00:05:37.979> of<00:05:38.130> sugar<00:05:38.370> a<00:05:38.400> day<00:05:38.460> so<00:05:39.060> giving<00:05:39.330> your

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
18 grams of sugar a day so giving your

kids<00:05:39.659> one<00:05:39.870> cup<00:05:40.139> of<00:05:40.259> this<00:05:40.440> almond<00:05:40.770> milk<00:05:40.979> is

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
kids one cup of this almond milk is

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.510 
kids one cup of this almond milk is
enough<00:05:42.539> sugar<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:43.500> last<00:05:43.710> them<00:05:43.889> for<00:05:43.919> a<00:05:44.099> full<00:05:44.340> day

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
enough sugar to last them for a full day
