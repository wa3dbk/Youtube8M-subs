00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.860
 and good hello to all and all 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.849
 friends this is captain life who speaks to you on 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.379
 finds himself today for a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.939
 new video of the channel and I'm going 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.200
 present you a little tip that will 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.050
 allow you to listen to music 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.630
 from youtube but you will be able to leave 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.189
 the application you surely know but 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.019
 on the youtube app when you 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.970
 start a video and you're not going 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.160
 not be able to leave the application 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.930
 otherwise the sound will cut itself so I 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.550
 today offers you a method that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.550
 will just allow you 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.290
 to listen to or watch a video of 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.899
 leave the app and you will have 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.940
 always the sound that will be listening 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.020
 behind in the background so here I go 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.190
 show you how to do so you 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.920
 go go on safari 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.199
 and you go on youtube.com so 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.329
 there I'm going to leave this tab up and I 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.070
 go on youtube right here 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.770
 so there you go find your 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.170
 music me for example i 'm going to take 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.399
 the example with one of my videos for 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.920
 to show you that it works so I 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.350
 tape captain city i have on my channel and 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.729
 we will launch any video so 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.600
 will have to get it in full 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.520
 screen here you have the sound you the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.799
 pause you will come back to you 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.659
 on your springboard as worrying you 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.830
 open here the multitasking and there you 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.630
 see that it's marked access a 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.009
 session windows 7 so that's the title 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.530
 of the video I launch it and I can go 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.520
 red the really I run the app 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.200
 that I want and it will work and there 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.850
 I can pause as I want 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.759
 so it's really a very good 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.530
 tip that I think you will like but 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.840
 that hardly anyone knows so 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.860
 here I present it to you anyway 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.659
