00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.260
 have some with us a 4 days of Bernd Reder the bag interesting 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.540
 appeared on 19 7 November in Unterwössen in the indoor pool and the 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.510
 Vandal previous day something with us already thought if man 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.469
 yes Cellular and Higher she liked to call it a meaner one 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.690
 Country doctor around 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.550
 Lecturer for children will be a bit casual around the other side 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.930
 she before that only the German research society for in movies 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.520
 around 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.040
 how does it work together on the one hand Schlöder Landrat doctor on the other 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.070
 Page yes so a bit percent volunteer research 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.560
 in high-tech medicine, if you will 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.760
 Year my situation was just too quiet% qoq studied normal medicine 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.560
 my home village Unterwössen and 9 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.590
 my feel-good place so to speak and it invites one percent Porsche me 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.500
 even 21 years in the field ignited 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.020
 that's because of it 21 years ago my dad state and a very famous one 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.910
 Scientist Professor Dr. Karl Hans Berger on the Sinn Rosenheimer 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.920
 Arndt heads the cynical addition to the research society worldwide 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.980
 Has made lectures on this topic and also large enzyme preparations 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.340
 developed 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.930
 and started to Berger has taken me a bit under the wing and 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.290
 also enabled me to study medicine 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.230
 and so suddenly two things came in parallel on one side of course 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.310
 first so classic country doctor activity with emergency services in 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.360
 Unterwössen 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.789
 and then also the leadership of the German in ten research society 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.559
 where I do yes and a lot of lectures on the subject 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.689
 «Possibilities and limits 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.310
 For example, of enzymes time for the sick as well as their great mentor in the 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.329
 World history was on the way so now they are also in the world history 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.099
 on the way and return now on 19 11 neither 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.259
 also recite meets if it is a premiere 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.429
 for the first time back home 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:36.209
 yes so that 's how it is but you can in Cape Town percent in New York in 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.479
 Berlin we give lectures everywhere for as a rare doctors pharmacist 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.409
 but somehow never in their own village in Unterwössen 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.689
 and together with the hand under the topic pharmacy the wreath pharmacy 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.269
 Machnig on 19 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.480
 November evening at 19 o'clock in the reading room in the indoor pool a topic at how can 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.849
 one the sound 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:57.720
 stay 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.319
 or if you're sick of being healthy, Brigitte will promise as the whole lot 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.459
 or as the promise of prude medicine often has to do with Kimi 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.329
 and with percent of big appliances 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.439
 and on the other hand, what I said at the beginning of the hall as 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.599
 promising is also surrounding in the supermarket 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.480
 there in the pharmacy not prescription there is then 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.849
 again less on or the trains 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.230
 Percent Boll as a layman can draw the line between 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:28.979
 what do we have charlatanism percent and serious 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.519
 promise of salvation 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.009
 by referring to professionals com and to my talk the comparative value 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.900
 Percent I give him completely right that is always a balancing act 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.149
 around 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:45.219
 you have to combine today I think I Blige so if you stay healthy 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.579
 she wants a good lifestyle 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:48.479
 for example 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.929
 drink enough liquid two and a half liters a day 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:55.709
 a lot of raw food this is simply my pharmacy Les gets over at home from the 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.839
 Water pipe in the very same we have our Bavarian water is yes 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:02.460
 Not one of the world's best water ever when you see that 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.659
 Unfortunately, we often do not use it 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.280
 Five times a day, so a handful of euros cost an apple banana 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.029
 Dale Salates Issinbayeva's fool folk 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:14.209
 then I already had 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.979
 then I have the base supply of vitamins trace elements minerals 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.419
 These are so-called microclimate substances 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.520
 Secondary plant substances are added 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.699
 In the end, digestion also promotes the intestinal flora 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.280
 then I should move athletically 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.770
 then I have the basic measures 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.080
 Now, of course, in this day and age, we have increased environment top 10 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.249
 Stress we have a lot of stress 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:41.659
 Often we do not live in biorhythms anymore 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:44.449
 Look now is November the wheels and collectors 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.659
 If you are the one about a fictional here just the rather and collector Lahr on the very 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.039
 At the end of the harvest, the crop had harvested and percent could 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.179
 three times four months from Rome 

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:57.979
 AZ VI r while we had really sleep well less than 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.659
 years or decades ago, then, the recovery phases in our modern day 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.029
 Life is getting smaller 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:04.259
 Nevertheless, it is getting older 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.240
 because the work is very high 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.090
 Kery percent we have no neighbor today, we did not fight back 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.680
 he has no problem solving who we directly on rest 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.799
 What I would like to say today with heavy stress 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:21.680
 but mostly always with diseases 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.840
 It is very important in addition to the human immune system 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.909
 Support efficiency 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.620
 And now comes the point there must talk about seriousness 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.370
 then it is important to get advice from a good doctor or a doctor 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.379
 Advice from good pharmacists 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:39.860
 to inform yourself 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.440
 what kind of ignite and what kind of micronutrients are those now 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:49.270
 for my personal situation at what time or right 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.570
 For which period 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.740
 to recommend 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.280
 Vossen application examples from where you can use an enzyme actual 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.280
 medical progress 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.429
 um so maybe i have to showcase so extreme shows 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:06.330
 the competitive athlete 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.340
 under cancer patient who owns the object that Isar 1 percent after 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.780
 times he quietly says athlete well the cancer patient relief team actually 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.460
 it was not better middle classical cinema therapy therefore begins around Demag 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.520
 resulted in starting a cancer patient 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.770
 Delon all cancer patients basically have a problem 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:29.009
 doing the body's own tumors activities or just doing it 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.379
 is considered as the body's immune defense activity 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:36.919
 Glass and would have no cancer kick 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.779
 now it is very important me Schiele 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:41.380
 also to save the nerves 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.289
 First and foremost, my cancer patients would basically 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:47.749
 op e Kimo get radiation 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:51.080
 and to reduce the tumors activity 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.050
 Unfortunately 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.330
 Often after the last irradiation the tumor activities are even higher 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.589
 still higher than the given in the month 

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:03.929
 We also know today stick in the judgment, the massively has never made a person 2 p 

00:07:03.929 --> 00:07:07.929
 So does a sinking of the white blood cells why so well 

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:12.229
 an immune system in the Reichenau a decrease in immune response ability 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:18.059
 That's why I think it's very important to work in two phases 

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:21.119
 «Necessary and correct» important conventional medicine 

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:25.240
 and now he's building up in the second phase after that 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:29.469
 that is, one tries the efficiency of the immune system 

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:32.889
 For example, by enzymes that have proven very useful here 

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:36.419
 for example by micronutrients, maybe even by a simple one 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:37.520
 Ladies renovation 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.580
 to increase it 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.759
 The patient has a better quality of life and has a better quality of life 

00:07:44.319 --> 00:07:48.729
 and we penalties with a holistic therapy concept that means already with the 

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:49.379
 toes 

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:52.399
 Plus a month on construction 

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:55.330
 very interesting results for some severely ill people
