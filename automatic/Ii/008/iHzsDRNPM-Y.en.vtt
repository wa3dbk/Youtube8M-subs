00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.450
 first of all , our first 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.740
 Rescheduled we wanted in the 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.120
 middlefield pressing and act 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.160
 put pinpricks that we succeeded 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.510
 in the superc apparently have the defensive 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.970
 we do not say so much admitted exactly 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.200
 we imagined that and then it was 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.450
 of course, the harder with the first 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.220
 actions eleven meters against us and then good 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.110
 against a very strong team here 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.059
 still take the point and 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.190
 to counter it and is in luck to 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.290
 we managed to succeed in the end 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.640
 have tried to do well in the beginning 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.499
 First we have a good action 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.109
 recordings that pushed us forward 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:43.160
 to the gate of course 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.449
 and then we tried from 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.249
 to start the fight 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.949
 you have to play the game pretty strong though 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.699
 also fighting and fighting very 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.179
 are engaged 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.329
 it was once accepted and countered in the 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.519
 end effect and perhaps in the end 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.409
 need to be dirty but deserved point 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.479
 brought 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:06.020
 a little different than usual 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:08.590
 the part was at ksc that 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.180
 can not dictate play 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.100
 and therefore it was important for us 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.869
 still really compact defensive too 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.509
 to take work in the dressing 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.049
 really always in the fight too 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.090
 come 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.680
 may be the best course to ksc 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.899
 to keep one's own 16er 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.670
 in the first half the opponent can 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.390
 but you are very happy 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.280
 then of course made the first 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.340
 chance for us to decide benefit 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.090
 a nice goal by ksc standard 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.200
 ultimately, through the forces of nature, he tells 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.609
 against two three opponents 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.710
 enforce and then considered from 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.030
 shut down his security given 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.719
 really believe what to take here 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.210
 to be able to 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.729
 if you then for us time twice 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.439
 as quasi in the first minute the same 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.770
 is the elfmetersituation comes and that 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.350
 1 1 2 and then it was clear now it works 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.420
 why bring in dirty spot 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.090
 we are right and pirate at problems 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.950
 Of course, the ksc had to be kept away from 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.690
 our own there were many scenes about 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.600
 the wings in the center we have ourselves 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.310
 but in the last consequence before that 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.100
 own gate thrown in every room 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.900
 many wave blog could with and yes it 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.850
 then also for me from my 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.950
 two clear chances and the clear view 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.620
 rest was good too 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.590
 defended and therefore certainly 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.030
 when you get so under pressure 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.950
 maybe a bit happy but still 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.420
 not undeserved because you are with the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.650
 which one believes new available 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.090
 from our point of view this point 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.220
 took with a strong opponent 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.460
 Often you often have these 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.130
 220 game to win but we are happy 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.470
 us about the point abroad and people 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:52.160
 markus in his group almost everything good 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:52.160
 to feel for the rest of the season 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:03.830
 we have the first counter immediately 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.820
 in residue 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.670
 a bit used to it to 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.160
 free then you are actually quiet 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.520
 this clear position also has 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.310
 many second balls lost 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.620
 under the stroke of the half-time speech 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.230
 then built a lot to find 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.680
 in the second half the pace 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.430
 played and played 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.430
 to have 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.890
 Overall I am with the appearance in 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.050
 the second half is satisfied everything 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.900
 done to win the viewer 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.920
 years of not being able to do this 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.920
 powerplay 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.750
 was earned because he just did not 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.830
 have done over two halves of 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.989
 the pace to go what we actually do 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.760
 We can do this pace, however 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.220
 over and entire playing time that's us 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.290
 failed 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.480
 also chalk yourself that is here 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.250
 has reached to the point also with it 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.489
 can survive if i just now 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.849
 more the whole constellation already 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.500
 decided 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:13.260
 then there are musical ones he as as 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:19.799
 than that now but I think we will 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:21.979
 but of course also constant 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.979
 retrieve
