00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
I love the curl pattern the hair was

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.039 
I love the curl pattern the hair was
very<00:02:21.150> soft<00:02:21.540> when<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.930> got<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.409> it<00:02:22.620> was<00:02:22.680> very<00:02:23.129> fine

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
very soft when I got it it was very fine

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.229 
very soft when I got it it was very fine
no<00:02:25.049> rough<00:02:25.409> tangles<00:02:25.920> or<00:02:26.040> anything<00:02:26.370> one<00:02:26.970> thing

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
no rough tangles or anything one thing

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.410 
no rough tangles or anything one thing
though<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.900> was<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.409> little<00:02:28.799> thin<00:02:29.129> but<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:30.150> did

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
though it was a little thin but I did

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.860 
though it was a little thin but I did
get<00:02:30.629> longer<00:02:30.840> inches<00:02:31.319> so<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.530> was<00:02:31.769> expected

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
get longer inches so that was expected

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.069 
get longer inches so that was expected
these<00:02:33.870> are<00:02:34.200> all<00:02:34.530> three<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.250> bundles<00:02:35.760> uh

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
these are all three of the bundles uh

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.209 
these are all three of the bundles uh
altogether<00:02:37.079> though<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.379> feel<00:02:37.799> as<00:02:37.920> though<00:02:37.950> when

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
altogether though I feel as though when

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:39.709 
altogether though I feel as though when
I<00:02:38.310> play<00:02:38.549> with<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.849> then<00:02:39.000> tease<00:02:39.299> it<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.540> little

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
I play with it then tease it a little

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.780 
I play with it then tease it a little
bit<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.230> know<00:02:40.409> for<00:02:40.859> a<00:02:40.889> fact<00:02:41.129> is<00:02:41.370> gonna<00:02:41.579> become

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
bit I know for a fact is gonna become

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.030 
bit I know for a fact is gonna become
thicker<00:02:42.239> like<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.629> can<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:42.989> tell<00:02:43.230> because

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
thicker like I can just tell because

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.490 
thicker like I can just tell because
it's<00:02:44.189> just<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.519> type<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.849> curl<00:02:45.060> pattern<00:02:45.500> but

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
it's just that type of curl pattern but

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.890 
it's just that type of curl pattern but
the<00:02:46.620> ends<00:02:47.040> however<00:02:47.189> I<00:02:47.489> hate<00:02:47.909> the<00:02:48.090> ends<00:02:48.510> and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
the ends however I hate the ends and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.009 
the ends however I hate the ends and
here's<00:02:49.260> one<00:02:49.680> strand<00:02:50.099> that<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.310> got<00:02:50.639> as<00:02:51.540> far<00:02:51.900> as

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
here's one strand that I got as far as

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.039 
here's one strand that I got as far as
shedding<00:02:52.470> goes<00:02:53.150> but<00:02:54.150> other<00:02:54.329> than<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.599> I

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
shedding goes but other than that I

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.349 
shedding goes but other than that I
probably<00:02:55.470> overall<00:02:55.859> here<00:02:56.189> to<00:02:56.310> be<00:02:56.430> very<00:02:56.819> pretty

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
probably overall here to be very pretty

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.289 
probably overall here to be very pretty
actually<00:02:57.680> it's<00:02:58.680> not<00:02:58.919> too<00:02:59.220> much<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.909> kinky

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299
