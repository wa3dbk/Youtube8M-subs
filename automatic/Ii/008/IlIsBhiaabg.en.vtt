here on the top came with two other

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.870 
here on the top came with two other
reservoirs<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.730> were<00:00:24.150> previously<00:00:25.880> charcoal

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
reservoirs that were previously charcoal

filters<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> watering<00:00:28.109> system<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.710> just

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
filters for a watering system I just

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.250 
filters for a watering system I just
chopped<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.939> chopped<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> bottom<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.080> off

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
chopped and chopped the bottom of it off

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.139 
chopped and chopped the bottom of it off
flipped<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.309> over<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:33.800> so<00:00:34.800> now<00:00:34.950> I've<00:00:35.160> got<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
flipped it over and so now I've got the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.700 
flipped it over and so now I've got the
top<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.570> used<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> be<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.020> top<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.410> now<00:00:37.559> on

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
top what used to be the top is now on

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.100 
top what used to be the top is now on
the<00:00:37.739> bottom<00:00:38.160> going<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.700> cap<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.840> top

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the bottom going to cap that on the top

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.190 
the bottom going to cap that on the top
and<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:41.010> will<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.790> where<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> gas<00:00:42.780> actually

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
and that will be where the gas actually

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.000 
and that will be where the gas actually
goes<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.680> intake<00:00:44.239> I<00:00:45.620> decided<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.770> go<00:00:46.890> with

the saturated system to mr. scarecrow if

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.459 
the saturated system to mr. scarecrow if
you<00:00:51.300> mr.<00:00:52.140> smart<00:00:52.440> scarecrow<00:00:53.719> if<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.350> are

scarecrow<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.140> advice<00:01:16.759> now<00:01:17.810> my<00:01:18.810> system

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
scarecrow for the advice now my system

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.460 
scarecrow for the advice now my system
is<00:01:19.680> totally<00:01:20.220> saturated<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.119> said

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
is totally saturated like I said

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.440 
is totally saturated like I said
everything<00:01:22.470> over<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.700> either<00:01:23.909> stainless

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
everything over here is either stainless

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.219 
everything over here is either stainless
steel<00:01:24.720> or<00:01:25.759> PVC<00:01:26.810> fittings<00:01:28.159> on<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:30.540> my

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
steel or PVC fittings on the my

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.039 
steel or PVC fittings on the my
reservoir<00:01:31.799> tank<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.829> all<00:01:34.829> PVC<00:01:35.630> no<00:01:36.630> metal

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
reservoir tank here is all PVC no metal

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.710 
reservoir tank here is all PVC no metal
so<00:01:37.350> no<00:01:37.560> sparks<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.490> those<00:01:39.240> parks<00:01:39.570> can

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
so no sparks up in those parks can

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.050 
so no sparks up in those parks can
happen<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.170> here<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.500> an<00:01:40.619> area<00:01:40.799> where<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.880> big

for<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> second<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.270> see<00:01:57.420> yeah<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.469> running

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
for a second and see yeah it's running

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.999 
for a second and see yeah it's running
just<00:01:59.960> not<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.200> thought<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.469> haven't<00:02:01.890> I

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009

just not like I thought I haven't I
didn't<00:02:02.250> add<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> whole<00:02:02.549> lot<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.729> baking<00:02:03.119> soda

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
didn't add a whole lot of baking soda

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.240 
didn't add a whole lot of baking soda
and<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.630> may<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.810> part<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> problem<00:02:04.469> as

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
and that may be part of the problem as

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.469 
and that may be part of the problem as
far<00:02:05.340> catalyst<00:02:06.299> goes

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
far catalyst goes

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.330 
far catalyst goes
and<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:09.560> don't<00:02:09.800> know<00:02:09.860> if<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.009> can<00:02:10.069> see<00:02:10.220> the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
and you don't know if you can see the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.160 
and you don't know if you can see the
battery<00:02:10.610> charger<00:02:11.000> in<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.180> back<00:02:11.390> that's<00:02:11.690> what

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
battery charger in the back that's what

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.940 
battery charger in the back that's what
I'm<00:02:12.260> running<00:02:12.560> off<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.709> six<00:02:13.430> amps<00:02:13.760> there<00:02:14.950> last

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
I'm running off of six amps there last

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.860 
I'm running off of six amps there last
time<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.159> hooked<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.849> system<00:02:17.209> up<00:02:17.330> in<00:02:17.450> my<00:02:17.569> truck

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
time I hooked the system up in my truck

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.309 
time I hooked the system up in my truck
it<00:02:18.019> ran<00:02:18.200> really<00:02:18.500> well<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:20.390> produced<00:02:20.840> all<00:02:21.019> kinds

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
it ran really well it produced all kinds

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.930 
it ran really well it produced all kinds
of<00:02:21.379> hydrogen<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.040> for<00:02:22.250> those<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.730> who
