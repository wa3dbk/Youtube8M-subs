00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
believed him and it made the treatment

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.520 
believed him and it made the treatment
made<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.510> much<00:00:54.719> sense<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.949> me<00:00:56.280> because<00:00:57.379> when<00:00:58.379> I

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
made so much sense to me because when I

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.420 
made so much sense to me because when I
was<00:00:58.770> reading<00:00:59.250> about<00:00:59.489> dr.<00:01:00.120> Beecher's

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
was reading about dr. Beecher's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.840 
was reading about dr. Beecher's
treatment<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.379> Los<00:01:04.379> reports<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.670> was

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
treatment in the Los reports it was

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.969 
treatment in the Los reports it was
explaining<00:01:06.390> how<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.170> low-dose<00:01:07.920> radiation

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
explaining how it was low-dose radiation

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.210 
explaining how it was low-dose radiation
and<00:01:08.909> hypothermia<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.619> made<00:01:10.860> sense

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and hypothermia and it just made sense

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.780 
and hypothermia and it just made sense
to<00:01:11.430> me<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.810> those<00:01:12.810> two<00:01:13.400> treatments<00:01:14.400> together

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
to me that those two treatments together

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.499 
to me that those two treatments together
would<00:01:15.299> kill<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.020> cancer<00:01:16.259> cells<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:18.360> know

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
would kill the cancer cells and you know

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.859 
would kill the cancer cells and you know
that<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.250> knew<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> had<00:01:21.840> a
