00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
Excalibur and fortunately they do have a

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.740 
Excalibur and fortunately they do have a
like<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> selection<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.180> use<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
like a selection you can use in the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.509 
like a selection you can use in the
beginning<00:01:04.140> there's<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> tutorial<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.280> how<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
beginning there's a tutorial and how to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.130 
beginning there's a tutorial and how to
use<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.760> controls<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.659> everything<00:01:06.960> but

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
use it controls and everything but

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.929 
use it controls and everything but
there's<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.400> your<00:01:08.520> own<00:01:08.610> primary

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
there's you can have your own primary

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.120 
there's you can have your own primary
weapons<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.710> compare

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
weapons and you can see you can compare

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.800 
weapons and you can see you can compare
their<00:01:11.310> statistics<00:01:11.850> right<00:01:12.000> there<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.450> damage

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
their statistics right there the damage

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.039 
their statistics right there the damage
18<00:01:13.290> 216<00:01:13.950> fire<00:01:14.280> rate<00:01:14.490> accuracy<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.570> clip<00:01:15.810> size

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
18 216 fire rate accuracy and clip size

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.140 
18 216 fire rate accuracy and clip size
and<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> think<00:01:17.490> that's<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:17.850> really

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
and so I think that's a really really

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.609 
and so I think that's a really really
good<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.780> feature<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> can

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
good you know feature how you can

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.080 
good you know feature how you can
compare<00:01:19.920> everything<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.670> buy<00:01:20.820> them

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
kind of like confusing is that Venus

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.710 
kind of like confusing is that Venus
some<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.760> levels<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:49.090> Venus<00:02:49.390> or<00:02:49.510> actually

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
some of the levels of Venus or actually

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.270 
some of the levels of Venus or actually
snow<00:02:49.900> levels<00:02:50.230> which<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.500> kind<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.709> like<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:50.950> flaw

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
snow levels which is kind of like a flaw

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.070 
snow levels which is kind of like a flaw
in<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.550> game<00:02:51.580> another<00:02:52.390> flaw<00:02:52.600> would<00:02:52.780> be<00:02:52.900> that

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
in the game another flaw would be that

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.530 
in the game another flaw would be that
the<00:02:53.260> audio<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.190> very<00:02:54.459> repetitive<00:02:54.760> as<00:02:55.239> well<00:02:55.420> as

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
the audio is very repetitive as well as

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.930 
the audio is very repetitive as well as
the<00:02:55.750> enemy<00:02:56.290> audio<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:57.100> just<00:02:57.370> really<00:02:57.790> really

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
the enemy audio it just really really

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.460 
the enemy audio it just really really
gets<00:02:58.180> repetitive<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.810> they<00:02:58.930> say<00:02:59.110> pretty<00:02:59.319> much

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
gets repetitive and they say pretty much

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.620 
gets repetitive and they say pretty much
the<00:02:59.650> exact<00:02:59.860> same<00:03:00.040> thing<00:03:00.250> like<00:03:00.489> there<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.330> or
