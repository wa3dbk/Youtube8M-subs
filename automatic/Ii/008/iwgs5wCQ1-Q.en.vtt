these<00:00:36.030> cars<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.690> working<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.079> them<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.530> so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
these cars as to working on them for so

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.380 
these cars as to working on them for so
many<00:00:37.710> years<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.730> throttle<00:00:39.059> body<00:00:39.149> can

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
many years is that the throttle body can

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.119 
many years is that the throttle body can
actually<00:00:39.719> get<00:00:39.899> dirty<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.950> cause

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
actually get dirty and that can cause

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.360 
actually get dirty and that can cause
your<00:00:42.379> fluctuation<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:43.950> you've<00:00:44.040> tried<00:00:44.190> all

have been installed we can go ahead and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.000 
have been installed we can go ahead and
talk<00:00:48.539> about<00:00:48.570> how<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.440> rectify<00:00:49.620> this

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
bit about how this one's fluctuating

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.090 
bit about how this one's fluctuating
we'll<00:00:54.480> see<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.840> fix<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:55.289> cleaning

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
we'll see if we can fix it by cleaning

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:06.190 
we'll see if we can fix it by cleaning
the<00:00:56.190> throttle<00:00:56.579> body

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.090

throttle body this is an on turbo so it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.219 
throttle body this is an on turbo so it
sits<00:01:10.909> out<00:01:11.000> right<00:01:11.210> here<00:01:11.420> if<00:01:11.840> it's<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.050> turbo

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
sits out right here if it's a turbo

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.370 
sits out right here if it's a turbo
model<00:01:12.620> it's<00:01:12.710> going<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:12.890> be<00:01:12.950> underneath<00:01:14.380> I'm

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.170 
I sprayed into the throttle body it is
going<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.760> have<00:02:54.849> a<00:02:54.879> little<00:02:55.060> bit<00:02:55.150> of

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
going to have a little bit of

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.759

fluctuation<00:02:55.420> right<00:02:55.840> off<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.049> bat<00:02:56.230> but<00:02:56.709> it

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
fluctuation right off the bat but it

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:31.199 
fluctuation right off the bat but it
should<00:02:57.069> level<00:02:57.250> out<00:02:57.400> let's<00:02:57.609> see<00:02:57.730> if<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:57.849> works

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.199 

right<00:03:31.390> now<00:03:31.569> they've<00:03:31.810> had<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:31.989> chance<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:33.209> the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
right now they've had a chance to the

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.429 
right now they've had a chance to the
subsequent<00:03:34.629> systems<00:03:34.959> you<00:03:35.049> can<00:03:35.200> tell<00:03:35.319> that

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
subsequent systems you can tell that

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:36.690 
subsequent systems you can tell that
it's<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.620> much<00:03:35.799> smoother<00:03:36.159> idle<00:03:36.280> than<00:03:36.519> it<00:03:36.579> was

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
it's a much smoother idle than it was

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.380 
it's a much smoother idle than it was
