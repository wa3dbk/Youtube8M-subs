is this an allusion to the fact that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.560 
is this an allusion to the fact that

guerra could potentially be Garrick

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.470 
guerra could potentially be Garrick
relentless<00:00:48.570> or<00:00:49.219> an<00:00:50.219> alternate<00:00:50.850> version<00:00:50.879> of

remembering our plan list made 22 wolf
tokens<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.699> don't<00:00:56.699> think<00:00:56.760> they're<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
tokens I don't think they're going to

put a flip card in 15 abeer a discuss

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.220 
put a flip card in 15 abeer a discuss
that<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.370> they<00:00:59.489> could<00:00:59.640> very<00:00:59.850> well<00:00:59.910> make<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.629> new

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
that but they could very well make a new

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.560 
that but they could very well make a new
garrett<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.710> makes<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.340> do<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:03.270> makes<00:01:03.420> will

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
garrett that makes to do that makes will

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.420 
garrett that makes to do that makes will
tokens<00:01:03.930> period<00:01:04.350> i<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:05.100> that's<00:01:05.220> kind<00:01:05.400> of

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
tokens period i think that's kind of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.789 
tokens period i think that's kind of
neat<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.080> otherwise<00:01:07.080> what's<00:01:07.350> interesting<00:01:07.560> is

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
neat and otherwise what's interesting is

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.250 
neat and otherwise what's interesting is
that<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.900> block

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that this is going to be like a block

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.160 
that this is going to be like a block
set<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> corset<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> strained

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
set but for a corset which is strained

exam as i said i don't think we've had
that<00:01:14.970> before<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.810> don't<00:01:15.990> know<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.259> it'll<00:01:16.380> be

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that before and I don't know if it'll be

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.190 
that before and I don't know if it'll be
or<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.390> feels<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.659> kind<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.960> getting<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
little stale especially now that people

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.940 
little stale especially now that people
are<00:01:21.360> finding<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:22.409> can't<00:01:22.680> get<00:01:22.830> the

that<00:01:28.650> color<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.520> make<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> lot<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.820> people

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that color it can make a lot of people

that color it can make a lot of people
feel<00:01:30.180> locked<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.020> don't<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.560> aspect

really<00:03:13.829> cool<00:03:14.040> other<00:03:14.370> creatures<00:03:14.579> you<00:03:14.790> control

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
really cool other creatures you control

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.849 
really cool other creatures you control
dethrone<00:03:15.479> whenever<00:03:16.409> a<00:03:16.470> creature<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.829> control

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
dethrone whenever a creature you control

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.770 
dethrone whenever a creature you control
as<00:03:17.220> long<00:03:17.340> as<00:03:17.430> one<00:03:17.549> counter<00:03:17.849> dies<00:03:18.090> return<00:03:18.659> that

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
as long as one counter dies return that

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.330 
as long as one counter dies return that
card<00:03:18.989> 2000<00:03:19.379> year<00:03:19.560> control<00:03:19.889> at<00:03:19.979> the<00:03:20.040> beginning

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
card 2000 year control at the beginning

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.330 
card 2000 year control at the beginning
of<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.549> next<00:03:20.729> end<00:03:21.060> step<00:03:21.739> that's<00:03:22.739> very<00:03:23.099> very

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
of the next end step that's very very

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.830 
of the next end step that's very very
interesting<00:03:23.879> so<00:03:24.120> as<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.269> competitor<00:03:24.659> what's

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
interesting so as a competitor what's

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.899 
interesting so as a competitor what's
cool<00:03:25.049> about<00:03:25.079> dethrone<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.889> that<00:03:26.129> it<00:03:26.459> works

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
cool about dethrone is that it works

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.420 
cool about dethrone is that it works
well<00:03:27.209> in<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.389> multiplayer<00:03:27.659> board<00:03:28.229> because<00:03:29.010> it

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
well in a multiplayer board because it

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.800 
well in a multiplayer board because it
makes<00:03:29.639> everyone<00:03:30.120> want<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.419> attack<00:03:30.659> the

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
makes everyone want to attack the

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.409 
makes everyone want to attack the
strongest<00:03:31.079> player<00:03:31.500> not<00:03:31.949> drive<00:03:32.729> a<00:03:32.760> weak<00:03:33.150> player

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419

out<00:03:33.629> of<00:03:33.659> the<00:03:33.840> game<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.650> course<00:03:34.680> because

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
out of the game and of course because

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.949 
out of the game and of course because
the<00:03:35.459> strongest<00:03:35.909> players<00:03:36.120> suddenly<00:03:36.540> becomes

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
the not a strong player it circulates

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.580 
the not a strong player it circulates
the<00:03:39.269> board<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.750> doesn't<00:03:40.019> make<00:03:40.079> anyone<00:03:40.290> feel

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
the board and doesn't make anyone feel

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.229 
the board and doesn't make anyone feel
specifically<00:03:41.250> attacked<00:03:41.639> unless<00:03:41.939> they<00:03:42.060> die

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
specifically attacked unless they die

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.149 
specifically attacked unless they die
immediately<00:03:42.829> but<00:03:43.829> overall<00:03:44.129> you<00:03:45.060> benefit<00:03:45.540> from

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
immediately but overall you benefit from

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.110 
immediately but overall you benefit from
focusing<00:03:47.159> on<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.549> best<00:03:47.699> player<00:03:47.849> not<00:03:48.000> the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
focusing on the best player not the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.869 
focusing on the best player not the
worst<00:03:48.269> player<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:49.590> really<00:03:50.340> reads<00:03:50.609> a<00:03:50.759> little

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
worst player it really reads a little

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.610 
worst player it really reads a little
bit<00:03:51.090> like<00:03:51.209> sublime<00:03:51.449> archangel<00:03:51.689> and<00:03:52.199> that<00:03:52.379> it

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
bit like sublime archangel and that it

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.719 
bit like sublime archangel and that it
has<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.829> ability<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.310> gives<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.639> ability

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
has the ability that gives the ability

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.300 
has the ability that gives the ability
to<00:03:53.939> everything<00:03:54.239> else<00:03:54.359> but<00:03:55.040> overall<00:03:56.040> i<00:03:56.280> really

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
to everything else but overall i really

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.679 
to everything else but overall i really
like<00:03:56.729> that<00:03:56.909> mechanic<00:03:57.329> will<00:03:57.419> be<00:03:57.479> very

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
like that mechanic will be very

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.689 
like that mechanic will be very
interesting<00:03:58.139> 1+1<00:03:58.769> counters<00:03:59.280> don't<00:03:59.549> usually

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
interesting 1+1 counters don't usually

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.939 
interesting 1+1 counters don't usually
go<00:04:00.030> with<00:04:00.060> this<00:04:00.299> color<00:04:00.509> combination<00:04:00.840> like<00:04:01.739> at

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
go with this color combination like at

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.420 
go with this color combination like at
all<00:04:02.209> but<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.810> still<00:04:04.709> works<00:04:04.979> interestingly

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
all but it still works interestingly

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.089 
all but it still works interestingly
with<00:04:06.000> its<00:04:06.599> like<00:04:06.720> undying<00:04:07.139> and<00:04:07.379> persist<00:04:07.769> even

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
with its like undying and persist even

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.249 
with its like undying and persist even
though<00:04:08.759> those<00:04:08.909> are<00:04:08.970> mainly<00:04:09.449> not<00:04:09.989> in<00:04:10.169> these

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:10.259 
though those are mainly not in these

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:13.309 
though those are mainly not in these
colors<00:04:11.540> which<00:04:12.540> again<00:04:12.750> makes<00:04:12.959> it<00:04:13.139> kind<00:04:13.259> of

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
colors which again makes it kind of

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.479 
colors which again makes it kind of
strange<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.680> we're<00:04:13.889> messing<00:04:14.189> with<00:04:14.280> 11

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
strange that we're messing with 11

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.580 
strange that we're messing with 11
counters<00:04:14.909> when<00:04:15.389> its<00:04:15.750> abilities<00:04:16.139> we<00:04:16.259> most

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
counters when its abilities we most

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.250 
counters when its abilities we most
powerful<00:04:17.099> in<00:04:18.109> grain<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.349> be<00:04:19.440> honest<00:04:19.709> degree

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
powerful in grain to be honest degree

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.230 
powerful in grain to be honest degree
but<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.380> still<00:04:22.590> is<00:04:22.710> fascinating<00:04:23.310> ability<00:04:23.790> you

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
but it still is fascinating ability you

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.670 
but it still is fascinating ability you
can<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:24.480> course<00:04:24.510> have<00:04:24.900> one<00:04:25.050> plus<00:04:25.200> one<00:04:25.230> counter

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
can of course have one plus one counter

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.180 
can of course have one plus one counter
is<00:04:25.770> going<00:04:25.800> on<00:04:26.160> with<00:04:26.400> other<00:04:26.610> stuff<00:04:27.120> that<00:04:28.190> has

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
is going on with other stuff that has

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.430 
is going on with other stuff that has
nothing<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.460> do<00:04:29.580> with<00:04:29.700> undying<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.320> work<00:04:31.320> with

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
nothing to do with undying and work with

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.680 
nothing to do with undying and work with
a<00:04:31.530> wealth<00:04:31.680> sage<00:04:32.100> at<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.340> hours<00:04:32.640> of<00:04:32.850> you<00:04:33.000> forgot

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
a wealth sage at the hours of you forgot

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.050 
a wealth sage at the hours of you forgot
he's<00:04:33.930> a<00:04:33.960> new<00:04:34.140> card<00:04:34.410> he's<00:04:34.650> blue<00:04:35.040> he<00:04:35.790> would<00:04:35.910> work

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
he's a new card he's blue he would work

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.350 
he's a new card he's blue he would work
very<00:04:36.120> well<00:04:36.360> in<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.200> deck<00:04:37.410> with<00:04:37.620> her<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:39.150> 11

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
very well in a deck with her and the 11

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.270 
very well in a deck with her and the 11
counters<00:04:39.690> just<00:04:40.050> scale<00:04:40.320> up<00:04:40.500> so<00:04:41.160> I<00:04:41.190> think

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
counters just scale up so I think

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.590 
counters just scale up so I think
they'll<00:04:41.490> be<00:04:41.520> very<00:04:41.640> interesting<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.360> just

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
they'll be very interesting and just

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.990 
they'll be very interesting and just
overall<00:04:42.780> seems<00:04:43.380> really<00:04:43.800> really<00:04:43.920> neat<00:04:44.220> maybe<00:04:44.910> a

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
overall seems really really neat maybe a

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000 
overall seems really really neat maybe a
proliferate<00:04:45.540> build<00:04:45.750> maybe<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.740> planeswalker

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
proliferate build maybe a planeswalker

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.150 
proliferate build maybe a planeswalker
his<00:04:47.400> group<00:04:47.640> hug<00:04:47.820> pull<00:04:48.120> afraid<00:04:48.450> built<00:04:49.160> could

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
his group hug pull afraid built could

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.950 
his group hug pull afraid built could
potentially<00:04:50.580> work<00:04:50.730> very<00:04:51.120> interestingly<00:04:51.480> so

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
potentially work very interestingly so

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.780 
potentially work very interestingly so
I'd<00:04:52.080> like<00:04:52.200> to<00:04:52.320> see<00:04:52.470> kind<00:04:52.710> of<00:04:52.830> some<00:04:53.100> designs<00:04:53.550> of

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
I'd like to see kind of some designs of

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.390 
I'd like to see kind of some designs of
with<00:04:54.090> her<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.560> I'm<00:04:55.560> sure<00:04:55.830> people<00:04:56.040> have<00:04:56.370> a

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
with her and I'm sure people have a

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.100 
with her and I'm sure people have a
creative<00:04:56.700> time<00:04:57.000> with<00:04:57.150> her<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:57.270> like<00:04:57.600> again<00:04:57.960> that

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
creative time with her I like again that
