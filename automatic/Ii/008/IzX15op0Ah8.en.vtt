he does ten stairs in rouen I don't

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.389

think<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.679> hard<00:02:07.799> enough<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.190> don't<00:02:08.250> think

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
think it's hard enough I don't think

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.509 
think it's hard enough I don't think
it'sit's<00:02:08.879> got<00:02:09.179> him<00:02:09.390> mentally<00:02:10.519> pushing

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
it'sit's got him mentally pushing

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.070 
it'sit's got him mentally pushing
himself<00:02:11.819> enough<00:02:12.060> oh<00:02:12.209> maybe<00:02:12.480> I'll<00:02:12.660> say<00:02:12.840> all

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
himself enough oh maybe I'll say all

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.960 
himself enough oh maybe I'll say all
right<00:02:13.230> take<00:02:13.410> some<00:02:13.560> dumbbells<00:02:13.950> run<00:02:14.220> them<00:02:14.400> up<00:02:14.549> a

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
right take some dumbbells run them up a

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.630 
right take some dumbbells run them up a
few<00:02:15.569> more<00:02:15.720> times<00:02:15.989> he<00:02:16.440> puts<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.950> all<00:02:17.160> out<00:02:17.190> during

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
few more times he puts it all out during

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.460 
few more times he puts it all out during
his<00:02:17.819> workouts<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.540> when<00:02:18.840> he's<00:02:18.989> done<00:02:19.019> he's

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
his workouts and when he's done he's

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.070 
his workouts and when he's done he's
spent<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.069> by<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.030> time<00:02:21.239> Fight<00:02:21.599> Night<00:02:21.629> comes

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
spent so by the time Fight Night comes

00:02:22.080 --> 00:03:26.840 
spent so by the time Fight Night comes
he's<00:02:22.500> at<00:02:22.769> that<00:02:23.040> peak

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.850 

I<00:03:26.910> think<00:03:27.210> Brock<00:03:27.420> wants<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:27.990> fight<00:03:28.260> against

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
I think Brock wants this fight against

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.590 
I think Brock wants this fight against
Frank<00:03:29.070> Mir<00:03:29.280> more<00:03:29.670> than<00:03:29.850> any<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.360> those<00:03:30.450> other

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
Frank Mir more than any of those other

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.470 
Frank Mir more than any of those other
fights<00:03:30.990> and<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.950> think<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.610> time<00:03:32.820> he<00:03:33.060> he

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
fights and I think this time he he

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.370 
fights and I think this time he he
really<00:03:33.870> really<00:03:34.410> wants<00:03:34.710> to<00:03:34.740> win<00:03:34.950> this<00:03:35.100> fight
