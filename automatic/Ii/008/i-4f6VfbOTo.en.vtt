this<00:07:35.659> track<00:07:35.929> it's<00:07:36.139> too<00:07:36.319> rough<00:07:36.619> I<00:07:36.949> think<00:07:37.309> it's

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:37.639 
this track it's too rough I think it's

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:41.079 
this track it's too rough I think it's
unsafe<00:07:38.119> to<00:07:38.329> run<00:07:38.479> on<00:07:38.629> that<00:07:39.289> rail<00:07:39.619> is<00:07:39.649> good<00:07:40.219> but

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:41.089 
unsafe to run on that rail is good but

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:42.789 
unsafe to run on that rail is good but
there<00:07:41.239> just<00:07:41.389> isn't<00:07:41.599> any<00:07:41.839> road<00:07:42.079> bed<00:07:42.349> underneath

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:42.799 
there just isn't any road bed underneath

00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:45.699 
there just isn't any road bed underneath
it<00:07:42.979> you<00:07:43.459> don't<00:07:43.669> build<00:07:43.939> highways<00:07:44.269> on<00:07:44.719> mud<00:07:45.019> and

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:45.709 
it you don't build highways on mud and

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:48.099 
it you don't build highways on mud and
that's<00:07:45.859> what<00:07:46.069> this<00:07:46.279> is<00:07:46.459> done<00:07:46.669> but<00:07:47.629> we<00:07:47.779> got<00:07:47.959> the

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:48.109 
that's what this is done but we got the

00:07:48.109 --> 00:07:49.629 
that's what this is done but we got the
equipment<00:07:48.649> that<00:07:48.709> they're<00:07:48.979> talking<00:07:49.129> about<00:07:49.339> new

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:51.589 
equipment uh you know passenger Clinton

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:53.169 
equipment uh you know passenger Clinton
which<00:07:51.709> i<00:07:51.859> think<00:07:51.919> is<00:07:52.249> fine<00:07:52.519> but<00:07:52.759> of<00:07:52.849> course<00:07:53.029> we

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:53.179 
which i think is fine but of course we

00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:54.579 
which i think is fine but of course we
don't<00:07:53.299> know<00:07:53.449> nothing<00:07:53.749> about<00:07:53.779> passenger<00:07:54.409> we're

00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:54.589

00:07:57.969 --> 00:07:57.979 
afraid men but we got the equipment to

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:01.839 
afraid men but we got the equipment to
take<00:07:58.339> these<00:07:58.519> trains<00:07:58.849> cross<00:07:59.179> the<00:07:59.419> track
