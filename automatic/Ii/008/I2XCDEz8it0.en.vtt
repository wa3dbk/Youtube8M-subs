00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello spider arms from valeo news.de 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.599
 today from the beautiful city of atlanta 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.629
 Georgia today I want you 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.790
 Although five things explain the people of 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.660
 the panini but not claim 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.460
 vote number one our political 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.619
 ancestors come very early 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.460
 why should we have her 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.529
 Eating habits copy this thought 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.150
 is justified but also relative 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.519
 easy to refute 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.920
 our political ancestors were 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.019
 dangers 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.549
 which we in our today 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:44.269
 companies simply do not have anymore 

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:47.839
 or less examples are high 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:52.290
 child mortality tribesman 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:54.449
 other violent acts and of course one 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.790
 working insurance if you are 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.830
 these factors have involving our 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.350
 ancestors about the same age 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.420
 achieved as we do today and what 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.390
 more important is that they do this 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.680
 age would have reached or this 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.640
 civilization diseases like us today 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.610
 plague such as diabetes heart disease 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.160
 obesity autoimmune disease 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.980
 number two is the paleo diet 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.830
 dangerous because of their high courses 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.790
 this correct is globalized on 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.410
 the idea that a lot of protein 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.270
 kidney problems triggers what alps 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.510
 However, studies have been suspected 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.450
 long refuted with new studies 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.300
 The paleo diet can have a lot of protein 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.330
 but it must be the vision of 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.430
 Protein content can be between 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.090
 Ten percent of the daily calories up 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.000
 towards 25 percent of your daily calories 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.880
 depending on the individual person 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.380
 whatsoever and wholegrain is wholesome and healthy 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.649
 essential for the health 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.340
 how many of shots and 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.119
 cereal products no case of 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.789
 cardiology 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.829
 next to gluten that's not so good for 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.039
 body is around in the other video of 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.310
 I have also been treated very carefully 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.610
 We spent about two million years 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.480
 relatively well without the existence of 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.000
 grain products wholegrain lived 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.170
 In addition, studies are that 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.500
 cereal products one of the nutrients 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.160
 poorest food groups is different 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.690
 Foods look like meat vegetables 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.269
 and even dairy products are a lot 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.780
 more nutritious than people number 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.450
 four 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.459
 valeo its only flash-based 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.140
 going 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.030
 Of course, this idea is the image 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.819
 what the media are trying to do 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.150
 Report in which you hello lena so 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.010
 people in paléo are like that 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.709
 as if they were Neanderthals only 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.170
 eat meat if you like that 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.350
 typical food of a palio store 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.780
 look can fail that two thirds 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:09.269
 plant it and it is one 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.940
 Mixture of nuts and meat 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.680
 starchy tubers 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.620
 one should note that that 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.590
 meat from free-running healthy 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.980
 animals in no way in connection 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.889
 There are many with war 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.170
 Persons that is not wrong but always 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:32.120
 still on paléo they are replacing that 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.400
 Bavarian by fish crustaceans and 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.080
 claims over 5 are the paleo diet 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.970
 a fashion like many others 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.500
 if the quality would be a motivated 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.730
 she would probably be the longest in the 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.980
 history of humanity 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.080
 because we should consider that the 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.700
 time their existence for the people 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.800
 most of the time endured at similar times 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.110
 only in the last 10,000 years has 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.860
 ours changed a lot and 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.640
 10,000 years are an instant in the 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.440
 biological evolution things like 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.070
 cereal products refined alcohol 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.950
 sugar flour industrial height have become 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.500
 crept into our diets and 70 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.920
 percent of our calories come exactly 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:23.510
 of these things so the question is what 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.290
 Exactly the molli, it is the parody 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.680
 or is it the same as most 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:34.520
 actual the truth is the paléo the 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.040
 very nutritious is that many 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.720
 Calories have turned out very well for less 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.920
 tired are losing weight and disease pictures 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.680
 not only be improved but 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.520
 The results are completely reversed 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.260
 So speak for yourself 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.730
 that were five false allegations about 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.590
 the parody if you like the video 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.290
 parts and maike there are no comments 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.790
 and do not forget all - pit.de too
