00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.950
 hello again and welcome to this new 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.930
 video more we follow with the latest news 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.930
 important the e3 where we left yesterday 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.299
 really how is the people you have seen 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.850
 which they have left parked here in the 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.360
 Main hall of the e3 as to get us 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.360
 a fine 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.949
 this is the southern pavilion of the 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.949
 video game 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.870
 to my back battlefield 4 almost 100 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.940
 people fighting against each other 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.530
 others 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.910
 that is not much quieter 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.620
 because they are playing each one in their 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.199
 site 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 red against blue and I'm going to go to 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.780
 another place a little quieter than 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.780
 I do not want to get involved in any war 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.320
 the attempt 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320
 to 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.329
 The e3 is celebrated in the USA where one of 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.939
 every two houses has a console 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:05.520
 dedicated to video games the average age 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:10.300
 of the gamers is about 30 years 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:15.270
 we are not very very divided a 55 are 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.270
 men and 45 of the people that we are 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.459
 since the first statistics is 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.110
 perfect here at any fair of 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.030
 video games that also boasts us 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.550
 We find classics like 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.920
 for example these machines in this case 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.019
 is the deadly kombat and to facilitate me 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.700
 the task I have given the players but 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.049
 deep down I'm playing alone with what 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.049
 which I will win 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.640
 but among all these people with what 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:51.270
 which I keep the 2600 and its game 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.190
 master 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:58.620
 the truth is that leaving because maybe 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.860
 with its year of creation in 1977 a good 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.860
 year 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.140
 good bad I am 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.409
 in e3 we do not deprive ourselves of anything or 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.780
 even to have zombies and less those of 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.329
 racing 3 that have brought here a small 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.099
 family selection on earth and 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.939
 let's see if we can engage a little 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.939
 of friendship with them 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:53.150
 for some food to go 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.790
 there are many 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.070
 and there it goes more serene 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.160
 ay ay ay ay ay vos 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.920
 I see them as altered 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.990
 in a few hours 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.760
 have a plant to save my life 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.509
 thank goodness the zombies are slow 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.060
 the new order and to see the characters 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.670
 we have this weird thing about this cube 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.780
 we can turn we can rotate for by 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:21.190
 example we are seeing here faus 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.190
 and that we turn around 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.150
 we can see it in all its glory we 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.150
 to change character 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.400
 since we even have one of the bugs 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:35.280
 but do not worry it's plastic 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.280
 it's the panzer 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.280
 1960 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.110
 the mind 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.639
 this exit usually from the fairs of 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.310
 three days that presents to be the 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.850
 ghostly adventures with all this 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.380
 with music same ditches with tips 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.380
 it's hard to keep up 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.810
 with this a cake ends the e3 in the 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.370
 angels we return the connection to the 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.900
 central studies of clicks artemadrid 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.590
 by God I do not want to go back to 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.580
 trip again 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.930
 you had clients 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.729
 yes I know it has been a little weird 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.530
 because I'm wearing the same shirt 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.940
 second day but not the first 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.360
 is that I did not know that I'm going to be left 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.780
 video so long then I cut in 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.780
 Two parts
