all right I went over the controls but

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400 
all right I went over the controls but
that<00:02:20.580> doesn't<00:02:20.850> mean<00:02:20.940> it's<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.150> bad<00:02:21.180> game<00:02:21.780> croc

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
that doesn't mean it's a bad game croc

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.290
