00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.910
 so let's go already recording in sequence 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:24.480
 there were number 30 of the project my 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.850
 book and teacher level teacher pick up 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.410
 following here in the book on the 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:34.260
 brazil on page 342 take a look here 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.970
 on page 342 which proposes a 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.910
 question is the proposal of an issue 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.920
 next to do something cool already 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.900
 that there were 29 we did a review 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.750
 who are the independents 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.930
 in this number 30 we do this again 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.800
 review and responds to the Annie question 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.829
 proposed on page 342 and so I go 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.720
 do so with you if you saw the number 37 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.210
 a subject I consider to be very important 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.899
 John is dependent on who the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.940
 dependent on those insured 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.000
 people who are entitled to pension 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.690
 death and confinement-dependencies 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.270
 are divided into three classes 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.000
 they are divided into three classes and have 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.130
 preference between them is not a toy 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.770
 this order the class dependents 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.140
 above is preferred over the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:35.159
 dependent on the later classes but 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:37.680
 independent movement according to the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.070
 parents and who are the dependents of 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:46.680
 First class, I'll put it here. 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:51.900
 provision for the law of conversion of 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.909
 mb 664 is not and the presidential sanction is 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.689
 running there already this second week of 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.340
 June 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:04.159
 so look what does not change spouse 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.579
 how to bathroom companion companion 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.610
 children 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.819
 looks only from any condition under 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.209
 21 years is no longer that thing of 21 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.250
 years of any condition of any 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.090
 Commission no longer has that provision 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.830
 not emancipated is not cool 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.530
 if you think of one of the causes of 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.260
 emancipation, for example, is the marriage 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.080
 then the parents have a certain child and 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.769
 a 19-year-old daughter and that 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.510
 daughter home beauty quality 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:42.930
 dependent because then why? 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:45.299
 marriage is one of the ways to 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.840
 entitles pensioners to receive pensions 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.840
 by death 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:01.860
 finally whether or not it was difficult 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.040
 in attendance 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.440
 another cause, for example the beginning of 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.530
 job is to have a job 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.989
 worsened even more at the age of 19 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.410
 been dismissed at the age of 20 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.269
 parents died unless impose and 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.299
 Once lost independent quality does not 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.400
 if the fight is recovered it can not be enabled 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.720
 I want you to say it the guy there with 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:32.400
 19 years he goes there predicted if it qualifies 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:35.370
 informal heart work was not 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.620
 on the outside i am reaction then it left 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.530
 that thing will at least leave then 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.780
 linked in the law of conversion is 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.780
 then companion spouse or companion 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:04:02.950
 invalid or invalid or that has 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:02.950
 or who is mentally disabled 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:34.720
 relatively new and severe 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.720
 who has severe disability well brothers 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.770
 very quickly then he was calm 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.770
 quiet 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:07.490
 Let's see how this was charged in 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:12.280
 Proof is not an issue on screen 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.280
 I'll show you there on the screen that 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.639
 it's not like this 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.639
 despite being part of the second class 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.810
 be entitled to the receipt of the 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:34.370
 since it proves the dependence 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.240
 insured to them 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.000
 they still 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.380
 that there are dependents who pick up the 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.150
 first class 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.860
 this is true or false of course 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.539
 This is false 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.960
 of course this is false because 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:50.330
 dependents are preferably themselves not 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.599
 is whether it exists independent of the first 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.060
 class enabled the dependents of the 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:06:00.199
 subsequent calls will not be entitled to 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:04.490
 receive the beauty all mass benefit 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:06.710
 so this was another video of the 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.789
 our project which is a mass project is 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:15.849
 cool cool is heard number 31 logo 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:15.849
 in the sequence we return doubt or 31
