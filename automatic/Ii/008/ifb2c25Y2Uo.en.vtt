the<00:01:53.100> tips<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.549> lashes<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:55.280> I<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.340> this

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the tips of my lashes and I do this

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.190 
the tips of my lashes and I do this
along<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.090> whole<00:01:57.240> thing<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.930> then<00:01:58.110> I'll

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
along the whole thing and then I'll

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.899 
along the whole thing and then I'll
invert<00:01:58.590> my<00:01:58.770> brush<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.729> inner

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
invert my brush so I can get that inner

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.520 
invert my brush so I can get that inner
corner

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.509 

and<00:02:07.530> that's<00:02:07.710> what<00:02:07.890> your<00:02:07.979> lack<00:02:08.129> should<00:02:08.310> should

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
and that's what your lack should should

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.320 
and that's what your lack should should
look<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.300> far<00:02:09.810> with<00:02:10.170> one<00:02:10.440> coat<00:02:10.879> now<00:02:11.879> I'm

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
look like so far with one coat now I'm

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.509 
look like so far with one coat now I'm
going<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.870> take<00:02:13.080> off<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.769> rest<00:02:14.129> of<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
going to take off the rest of the

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.330 
going to take off the rest of the
mascara<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.209> mean<00:02:15.450> like<00:02:15.660> almost<00:02:16.530> all<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.860> it

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
mascara and I mean like almost all of it

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.000 
mascara and I mean like almost all of it
in<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:18.000> next<00:02:18.239> shot<00:02:18.720> you'll<00:02:18.930> see<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.440> when<00:02:19.980> I

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
in the next shot you'll see that when I

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.400 
in the next shot you'll see that when I
hold<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.459> tissue<00:02:20.700> paper<00:02:21.030> against<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.930> spoolie

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
hold a tissue paper against the spoolie

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.410 
hold a tissue paper against the spoolie
background<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.160> as<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> backdrop<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.269> can

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
background like as a backdrop you can

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.210 
background like as a backdrop you can
see<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.870> between<00:02:25.290> all<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.650> bristles<00:02:26.069> so

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
see in between all the bristles so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.500 
see in between all the bristles so
that's<00:02:26.370> kind<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.610> what<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.849> want<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.209> want<00:02:27.420> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
that's kind of what you want you want it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.990 
that's kind of what you want you want it
to<00:02:27.629> be<00:02:27.780> more<00:02:28.019> of<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.459> separating<00:02:29.459> brush<00:02:29.760> as

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
to be more of like a separating brush as

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.160 
to be more of like a separating brush as
to<00:02:30.150> pose<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.540> something<00:02:30.810> that's<00:02:30.930> going<00:02:31.080> to

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
to pose to something that's going to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.080 
to pose to something that's going to
apply<00:02:31.349> your<00:02:31.379> mascara<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.280> now<00:02:32.610> as<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:32.940> can

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
apply your mascara and now as you can

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.630 
apply your mascara and now as you can
see<00:02:33.209> I'm<00:02:33.780> much<00:02:34.260> more<00:02:34.590> rigorously<00:02:35.129> going<00:02:35.489> in

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
see I'm much more rigorously going in

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.100 
see I'm much more rigorously going in
there<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:35.970> wiggling<00:02:36.330> through<00:02:36.599> with<00:02:36.720> my<00:02:36.840> brush

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
there and wiggling through with my brush

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.100 
there and wiggling through with my brush
I'm<00:02:37.860> more<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:38.610> separating<00:02:39.269> than<00:02:39.420> coating<00:02:39.870> so

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
I'm more so separating than coating so

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.080 
I'm more so separating than coating so
I'm<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.410> making<00:02:41.040> sure<00:02:41.220> all<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.610> lashes<00:02:41.760> are

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
I'm just making sure all the lashes are

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.490 
I'm just making sure all the lashes are
individually<00:02:42.599> coated<00:02:42.959> but<00:02:43.110> making<00:02:43.470> sure

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
individually coated but making sure

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.140 
individually coated but making sure
they're<00:02:43.709> not<00:02:43.739> stuck<00:02:44.160> together<00:02:44.310> either<00:02:44.819> and

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
they're not stuck together either and

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.319 
they're not stuck together either and
then<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.079> very<00:02:46.170> key<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.890> go<00:02:47.190> behind<00:02:47.489> my

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
then this is very key I go behind my

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.270 
then this is very key I go behind my
lashes<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:49.140> very<00:02:49.319> tips<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.680> them<00:02:49.829> behind<00:02:50.069> them

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
lashes the very tips of them behind them

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.789 
lashes the very tips of them behind them
only<00:02:50.519> once<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.390> don't<00:02:52.170> want<00:02:52.440> them<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.680> look

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
only once I don't want them to look

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.710 
only once I don't want them to look
super<00:02:53.010> thick<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.400> spidery<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.180> only<00:02:54.420> go

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
super thick and spidery so I only go

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.630 
super thick and spidery so I only go
behind<00:02:55.049> them<00:02:55.170> once<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:56.160> kind<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.430> helps

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
behind them once and that kind of helps

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.250 
behind them once and that kind of helps
seal<00:02:56.940> them<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.420> way<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.569> don't<00:02:57.870> know<00:02:58.019> if<00:02:58.140> that

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
seal them in a way I don't know if that

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.869 
seal them in a way I don't know if that
makes<00:02:58.440> sense<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:58.950> kind<00:02:59.129> of<00:02:59.190> seals<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.700> tip

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
makes sense but it kind of seals the tip

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.280 
makes sense but it kind of seals the tip
so<00:03:00.120> there's<00:03:00.269> no<00:03:00.420> flaking<00:03:00.690> or<00:03:00.959> anything<00:03:01.110> like

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
so there's no flaking or anything like

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.319 
so there's no flaking or anything like
that<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:01.739> then<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.400> also<00:03:02.549> just<00:03:02.790> lengthens

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
that and then it also just lengthens

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.869 
that and then it also just lengthens
them<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.720> much<00:03:03.959> more<00:03:07.220> again<00:03:08.220> just<00:03:08.670> going

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
them that much more again just going

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.670 
them that much more again just going
behind<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.329> lashes<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.750> each<00:03:09.959> little<00:03:10.200> section

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
behind the lashes in each little section

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.910 
behind the lashes in each little section
and<00:03:11.030> also<00:03:12.030> behind<00:03:12.540> them<00:03:12.810> once<00:03:13.260> in<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.650> front

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
and also behind them once in the front

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.050 
and also behind them once in the front
as<00:03:14.040> well<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.400> can<00:03:14.430> see<00:03:14.549> it<00:03:14.790> just<00:03:14.819> makes

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
as well and you can see it just makes

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.460 
as well and you can see it just makes
the<00:03:15.209> world<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.630> difference<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:16.109> just<00:03:16.139> makes<00:03:16.410> it

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
the world of difference it just makes it

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.080 
the world of difference it just makes it
look<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:16.650> much<00:03:16.889> more<00:03:17.010> put<00:03:17.340> together<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:17.880> not

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
look so much more put together but not

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.080 
look so much more put together but not
crazy<00:03:18.630> huge<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.410> thick<00:03:22.280> this<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.459> an<00:03:23.579> optional

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
crazy huge and thick this is an optional

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.500 
crazy huge and thick this is an optional
step<00:03:24.389> if<00:03:25.139> you<00:03:25.200> don't<00:03:25.500> have<00:03:25.709> super<00:03:26.099> long<00:03:26.510> lower

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
step if you don't have super long lower

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.449 
step if you don't have super long lower
lashes<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:28.170> will<00:03:28.380> be<00:03:28.500> very<00:03:28.709> frustrating<00:03:29.340> to

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
lashes this will be very frustrating to

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.490 
lashes this will be very frustrating to
do<00:03:29.609> like<00:03:29.849> for<00:03:30.030> me<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.389> my<00:03:30.810> right<00:03:31.049> eye<00:03:31.079> which<00:03:31.349> I'm

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
do like for me on my right eye which I'm

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.990 
do like for me on my right eye which I'm
doing<00:03:31.739> now<00:03:31.859> it's<00:03:32.010> much<00:03:32.370> easier<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:32.880> me<00:03:32.940> to

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
doing now it's much easier for me to

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.170 
doing now it's much easier for me to
apply<00:03:33.180> mascara<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:34.109> have<00:03:34.319> more<00:03:35.220> lash<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:35.940> much

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
apply mascara I have more lash and much

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.140 
apply mascara I have more lash and much
longer<00:03:36.690> lash<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.139> work<00:03:37.319> with<00:03:37.609> but<00:03:38.609> on<00:03:38.819> my<00:03:38.910> left

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
longer lash to work with but on my left

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.089 
longer lash to work with but on my left
eye<00:03:39.299> I<00:03:39.329> don't<00:03:39.569> have<00:03:39.810> as<00:03:39.989> much<00:03:40.169> as<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.650> can<00:03:40.829> see

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
eye I don't have as much as you can see

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.890 
eye I don't have as much as you can see
I'm<00:03:41.430> like<00:03:41.880> wiggling<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:42.450> wiggling<00:03:42.780> and

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
I'm like wiggling and wiggling and

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.839 
I'm like wiggling and wiggling and
nothing's<00:03:43.230> happening<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:44.609> is<00:03:44.730> an

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
nothing's happening so this is an

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.099 
nothing's happening so this is an
optional<00:03:45.239> step<00:03:45.450> if<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:45.690> don't<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:45.900> time<00:03:46.079> for

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
optional step if you don't have time for

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.720 
optional step if you don't have time for
it<00:03:46.349> you<00:03:46.440> don't<00:03:46.590> have<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.799> do<00:03:46.919> it<00:03:47.069> but<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.459> think

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
it you don't have to do it but I think

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.479 
it you don't have to do it but I think
if<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.030> take<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.569> time<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.739> really

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
if you take the time to and you really

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.949 
if you take the time to and you really
work<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.880> into<00:03:51.030> those<00:03:51.239> lashes<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:51.720> can<00:03:51.840> have<00:03:51.930> a

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
work it into those lashes you can have a

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.720 
work it into those lashes you can have a
really<00:03:52.200> great<00:03:52.349> effect<00:03:53.389> and<00:03:55.190> now<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.519> time

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
really great effect and now it is time

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.180 
really great effect and now it is time
for<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.090> dangerous<00:03:57.540> part<00:03:57.810> we<00:03:58.500> are<00:03:58.530> going<00:03:58.650> to

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
for the dangerous part we are going to

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.449 
for the dangerous part we are going to
separate<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.209> lashes<00:04:00.329> with<00:04:00.569> a<00:04:00.720> lash<00:04:00.959> comb

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
separate the lashes with a lash comb

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.490 
separate the lashes with a lash comb
this<00:04:02.459> I<00:04:02.639> got<00:04:02.819> from<00:04:03.090> morphe<00:04:03.450> brushes<00:04:03.690> calm<00:04:04.200> it's

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
this I got from morphe brushes calm it's

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.920 
this I got from morphe brushes calm it's
just<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.859> metal<00:04:05.250> brush<00:04:05.639> that<00:04:06.239> helps<00:04:06.569> separate

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
just a metal brush that helps separate

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.470 
just a metal brush that helps separate
your<00:04:07.049> lashes<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.769> when<00:04:08.519> I<00:04:08.549> do<00:04:08.669> this<00:04:08.940> I<00:04:09.120> start

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
your lashes and when I do this I start

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.170 
your lashes and when I do this I start
at<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.750> bottom<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.349> work<00:04:10.919> my<00:04:10.950> way<00:04:11.280> up<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.849> never

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
at the bottom and work my way up I never

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.819 
at the bottom and work my way up I never
go<00:04:12.569> behind<00:04:12.750> my<00:04:13.019> lashes<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.379> go<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.650> down

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
go behind my lashes and go it down

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.649 
go behind my lashes and go it down
because<00:04:14.069> that<00:04:14.340> can<00:04:14.519> kind<00:04:14.909> of<00:04:14.969> ruin<00:04:15.239> your<00:04:15.390> curl

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
because that can kind of ruin your curl

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.719 
because that can kind of ruin your curl
and<00:04:16.169> can<00:04:16.440> bring<00:04:16.680> your<00:04:16.829> lashes<00:04:17.190> down<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.549> drag

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
and can bring your lashes down and drag

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:18.590 
and can bring your lashes down and drag
them<00:04:18.000> down

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.780 
them down
so<00:04:19.290> I'm<00:04:19.350> just<00:04:19.500> brushing<00:04:19.680> up<00:04:19.980> through<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.640> make

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
so I'm just brushing up through to make

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.030 
so I'm just brushing up through to make
sure<00:04:20.910> there<00:04:21.060> are<00:04:21.150> no<00:04:21.500> lashes<00:04:22.500> that<00:04:22.650> are<00:04:22.800> stuck

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
sure there are no lashes that are stuck

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.610 
sure there are no lashes that are stuck
together<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.760> then<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.270> will<00:04:24.660> go<00:04:24.870> along<00:04:25.260> them

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
together and then I will go along them

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.830 
together and then I will go along them
in<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:26.190> sideways<00:04:26.760> motion<00:04:27.000> just<00:04:27.510> make<00:04:27.690> sure

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
in a sideways motion just make sure

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.180 
in a sideways motion just make sure
they're<00:04:27.990> all<00:04:28.080> fanned<00:04:28.440> out<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.710> I'll<00:04:28.980> show<00:04:29.160> you

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
they're all fanned out and I'll show you

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:39.510 
they're all fanned out and I'll show you
that<00:04:29.310> in<00:04:29.610> just<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:30.120> second

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.850 

so<00:04:40.120> now<00:04:40.330> I'm<00:04:40.509> doing<00:04:40.720> that<00:04:40.960> Fanning<00:04:41.319> motion<00:04:41.770> I'm

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
so now I'm doing that Fanning motion I'm

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.800 
so now I'm doing that Fanning motion I'm
just<00:04:42.009> going<00:04:42.250> along<00:04:42.400> my<00:04:42.880> lashes<00:04:43.120> side<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.630> side

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
just going along my lashes side to side

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.779 
just going along my lashes side to side
and<00:04:44.050> this<00:04:44.590> helps<00:04:44.889> separate<00:04:45.250> them<00:04:45.400> even<00:04:45.610> more

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
and this helps separate them even more

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.939 
and this helps separate them even more
and<00:04:45.849> also<00:04:46.419> helps<00:04:46.960> knock<00:04:47.259> off<00:04:47.500> any<00:04:47.770> little

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
and also helps knock off any little

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.650 
and also helps knock off any little
flakes<00:04:48.400> that<00:04:48.580> may<00:04:48.970> have<00:04:49.090> been<00:04:49.270> structure

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
flakes that may have been structure

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.680 
flakes that may have been structure
lashes<00:04:50.169> and<00:04:50.639> you'll<00:04:51.639> notice<00:04:51.849> this<00:04:52.120> yes<00:04:52.419> it

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
lashes and you'll notice this yes it

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.600 
lashes and you'll notice this yes it
does<00:04:52.930> kind<00:04:53.349> of<00:04:53.500> get<00:04:54.039> rid<00:04:54.250> of<00:04:54.370> some<00:04:54.490> of<00:04:54.550> the

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
does kind of get rid of some of the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.370 
does kind of get rid of some of the
mascara<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.300> makes<00:04:55.569> it<00:04:55.720> go<00:04:55.840> away<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.169> little

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
mascara and it makes it go away a little

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.900 
mascara and it makes it go away a little
bit<00:04:56.470> but<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:57.009> flutters<00:04:57.400> them<00:04:57.580> out<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:57.849> it

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
bit but it flutters them out and it

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.550 
bit but it flutters them out and it
makes<00:04:58.060> them<00:04:58.270> look<00:04:58.389> much<00:04:58.630> more<00:04:58.840> natural<00:04:59.080> while

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
makes them look much more natural while

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.510 
makes them look much more natural while
