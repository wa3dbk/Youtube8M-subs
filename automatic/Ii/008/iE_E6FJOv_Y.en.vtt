00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.590
 Welcome to your play of the only 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.930
 station dedicated to the cinema today you 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.820
 we present the explanation of the scene 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.129
 post credits of guardians of the 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.390
 galaxy when I was sitting in the room 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.820
 cinematographic waiting for 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.070
 will finish the credits I imagined that 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.360
 will be what I'm going to see I assured that 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.730
 We were going to see some scene 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.640
 that will deal with the Armenians but not 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.410
 it was like that I loved seeing the faces of the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.840
 people in the film who stayed in 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.340
 what the hell is happening 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.829
 definitely the movie of 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.470
 guardians of the galaxy is the sheep 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.079
 Black Marvel Family James Bond 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.600
 did what he wanted he appropriated the 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.300
 scene post credits that the only thing that 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.910
 does present us two characters from the 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.160
 expanded universe of marvel of the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.469
 which I will speak next in 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.140
 this scene we see three characters one 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.850
 we already know him is the collector who 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.790
 is interpreted by benicio del toro lo 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.890
 we have even seen his debut was in 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.789
 a scene post credits of some other 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.200
 marvel movie and we see it there goes out 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.300
 the scene that does not matter what it is 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.550
 doing not to not spoil 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.860
 and suddenly we see a dog that has 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.780
 an astronaut suit we identify 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.880
 perfectly that is Russian and I loved it 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.160
 people said it is secular he told the 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.870
 children is secular is laica the first dog 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.900
 Russian that went in space and it 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.150
 lost today I do not know how many things but not 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.190
 it's like this character is called cosmo 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.380
 the space dog and it's a character 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.260
 usual of the guardians of the galaxy 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.650
 in fact he lives on this planet head 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.210
 asteroid that is called neuer in fact he 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.210
 he is the head of security 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.610
 the dog talks did not do it in the movie 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.440
 and this and it's also like telepath and in 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.280
 some time help the guardians 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.990
 knows unnoba and so on 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.670
 the most interesting is the second 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.590
 character that is an extraterrestrial duck 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.119
 that I did not see since 1986 they do a panning and 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.570
 nothing less than jaguar 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.040
 for those of us who grew up in the 80s 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.920
 we know we saw this movie is a 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.080
 movie that curiously marvel thought 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.790
 in the 80s this is the best option 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.580
 we have the marvel universe to do 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.760
 a movie 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.070
 and this was produced by george lucas as a 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.600
 additional data the movie is 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.400
 considered one of the worst 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.640
 movies that you have done when you do not 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.630
 is in the top 10 however 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.550
 has a lot of followers has 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.740
 turned into a cult movie and I 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.100
 Proud to say I am one of your 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.290
 factual followers -has saved that 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.200
 belongs to my private collection of 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.990
 movies and taking advantage of it coming out in 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.120
 this scene as credits explores because 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.420
 I'm going to talk about this movie in some 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.410
 in a subsequent video we are going to present 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.970
 the trailer tells us about things 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.520
 interesting the five things 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.380
 interesting hardware tag who is 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.810
 this very simple duck is a pad 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.430
 extraterrestrial that grew on a planet 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.950
 very similar to the land where the ducks 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.410
 evolved has no superpowers it 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.630
 he thinks he has magical powers but 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.280
 So far he has not developed them 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.230
 what it is that is a teacher of 4 who 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.930
 it's a dark martial art that 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.459
 only waterfowl can do 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.459
 imagine them a duck 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:27.030
 but then it's quite interesting and 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.710
 this character has been a joke or the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.130
 sequel to this movie has been a 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.360
 eternal joke for marvel but with james 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.960
 bond after seeing what he did with 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.250
 guardians of the galaxy that 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.050
 It is clear from what we are 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.110
 accustomed to seeing marvel and sends 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.140
 to another address not astonish me that 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.050
 suddenly we 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.730
 let's have an independent film of 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.970
 jaguar of said I'm imagining the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.060
 titles and with this I'm going to close the video 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:00.630
 Water of attack according to qua qua 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.930
