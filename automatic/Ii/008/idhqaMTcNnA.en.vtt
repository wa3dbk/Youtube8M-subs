00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.899 
was pretty decent I mean I said there's
this<00:01:13.860> team<00:01:14.070> look<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.340> much<00:01:14.400> better<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.670> paper

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
this team look so much better on paper

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.330 
this team look so much better on paper
but<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.240> me<00:01:15.390> today<00:01:15.650> fever<00:01:16.650> has<00:01:16.799> been<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
but for me today fever has been just a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.679 
but for me today fever has been just a
pile<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> sheets<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.299> mean<00:01:18.450> there's<00:01:18.600> there's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
pile of sheets I mean there's there's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.780 
pile of sheets I mean there's there's
trouble<00:01:19.049> everywhere<00:01:19.530> servers<00:01:20.070> gameplay<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
trouble everywhere servers gameplay and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.060 
trouble everywhere servers gameplay and
a<00:01:21.509> lot<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.840> disconnections<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.470> well<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
a lot of disconnections as well so it

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
a lot of disconnections as well so it
could<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.390> majority<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.450> things<00:01:24.659> adding<00:01:25.020> up

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
could be majority of things adding up

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.320 
could be majority of things adding up
and<00:01:25.350> making<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> players<00:01:25.920> worse<00:01:26.520> net<00:01:26.759> gr<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.270> I

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and making the players worse net gr so I

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.539 
and making the players worse net gr so I

over again I think three games how the
six-hour<00:01:46.470> played<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.950> way<00:01:47.040> he<00:01:47.130> got<00:01:47.280> injury

over<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.450> place<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.870> defense

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
over the place and defense

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.160

that<00:03:11.920> sums<00:03:12.280> up<00:03:12.430> giving<00:03:12.820> COEs<00:03:13.090> five<00:03:13.989> foot<00:03:14.260> six<00:03:14.500> I

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
that sums up giving COEs five foot six I

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.490 
that sums up giving COEs five foot six I
think<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.280> Bali<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.090> six<00:03:16.330> or<00:03:16.420> five<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:17.050> it's

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
think and Bali is six or five so it's

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.410 
think and Bali is six or five so it's
near<00:03:17.680> foot<00:03:17.980> difference<00:03:18.130> in<00:03:18.489> there<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.880> ego

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
near foot difference in there and ego

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.850 
near foot difference in there and ego
