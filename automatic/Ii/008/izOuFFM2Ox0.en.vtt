 releasing enough information year 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.929
 Following 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.240
 Microsoft is very excited about the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.890
 cloud processing scheme 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.650
 the water you should know is already coming 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.289
 It is said from the beginning of the student leave 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.539
 started talking about xbox itself 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.550
 one and now the following they commented 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.920
 that the system has both potential and 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.359
 so complex that it gets even difficult 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.000
 explain what you can do with it 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.590
 is so much you guys lose their reason 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.630
 calm down when commenting on some things 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.270
 interesting first is that it will be 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.850
 used since the tasks and resources 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.829
 simpler is how it is like pink 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.440
 conversations to other things more 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.020
 elaborated as who knows the streaming of 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.920
 a complete game is what she leaves is that the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.960

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.079
 retrocompatibility, that is, to rotate the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.480
 xbox 360 games an xbox onu to what 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.820
 happens with the gaikai in country 4 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.710
 can be so short that the microsoft 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.420
 calmly because they are exploring 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.769
 system is well aware of the system and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.930
 I do not want to say anything so let's give 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.850
 calm and lucky because there was the question 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.909
 giving something very big but it has to have 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.909
 patience and give it to those who do not know 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.130
 is the producer of the neighborhood of 4 revealed that 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.360
 We're going to have a testing ground there. 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.070
 for vehicles 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.380
 or just to play there with 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.659
 helicopters with aircraft with tanks 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.990
 jeeps and everything you have in the game 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.340
 before leaving for online matches 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.110
 face is that you know it's complicated to be 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.579
 playing online there and getting one 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.710
 helicopter and did not have a chance to

 The opportunity for the guys there is to train. 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.170
 You're not going to become a real pilot like that. 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.880
 Who knows, I do not know. 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.820
 Helicopter made a good game but at least 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.950

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.990

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.590
