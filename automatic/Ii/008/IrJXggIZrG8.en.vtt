00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
ever saw my Dale series before I had to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.220 
ever saw my Dale series before I had to
remove<00:02:30.960> all<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.260> videos<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.880> basically<00:02:33.750> was

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
remove all the videos it basically was

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.750 
remove all the videos it basically was
an<00:02:34.470> absolute<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:36.840> was<00:02:36.990> just<00:02:37.260> chaos<00:02:37.680> it<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.520> it

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
an absolute it was just chaos it just it

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.590 
an absolute it was just chaos it just it
just<00:02:38.790> crashed<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.870> broke<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:41.150> ruined<00:02:42.150> the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
just crashed and broke and ruined the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.590 
just crashed and broke and ruined the
Dale<00:02:42.780> series<00:02:43.320> essentially<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:45.090> I'm<00:02:45.360> hoping

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
Dale series essentially so I'm hoping

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.060 
Dale series essentially so I'm hoping
that<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.900> divide-and-conquer<00:02:46.290> mod<00:02:46.830> will<00:02:46.950> be

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
that the divide-and-conquer mod will be

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.430 
that the divide-and-conquer mod will be
a<00:02:47.100> bit<00:02:47.250> better<00:02:47.400> as<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.270> far<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.780> haven't<00:02:49.020> had<00:02:49.290> any

gone into the veil of the onion just to

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.470 
gone into the veil of the onion just to
have<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.519> look<00:03:47.730> at<00:03:47.880> where<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.180> starting

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
have a look at where the starting

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.050 
have a look at where the starting
position<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:48.989> on<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.260> campaign<00:03:49.680> map<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.940> the

I've<00:04:13.290> also<00:04:13.410> noticed<00:04:13.650> with<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.130> faction<00:04:14.459> as

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
I've also noticed with the faction as

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.479 
I've also noticed with the faction as
well<00:04:14.730> it's<00:04:15.330> kind<00:04:15.600> of<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:17.070> starting

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
well it's kind of like the starting

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.670 
well it's kind of like the starting
units<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:17.850> Gondor<00:04:18.390> with<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:19.200> recruitment

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
units of Gondor with the recruitment

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.400 
units of Gondor with the recruitment
pace<00:04:20.070> of<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.370> elves<00:04:20.789> so<00:04:21.539> it<00:04:21.870> can<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.289> be<00:04:22.380> a

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
pace of the elves so it can it be a

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.080 
pace of the elves so it can it be a
little<00:04:22.500> bit<00:04:22.979> of<00:04:23.070> an<00:04:23.160> interesting<00:04:23.370> twist<00:04:23.880> to

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
little bit of an interesting twist to

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.050 
little bit of an interesting twist to
this<00:04:24.240> faction

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
this faction

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.690 
this faction
but<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.200> think<00:04:26.470> it's<00:04:26.620> gonna<00:04:26.740> be<00:04:26.860> pretty<00:04:27.010> cool

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
but I think it's gonna be pretty cool
