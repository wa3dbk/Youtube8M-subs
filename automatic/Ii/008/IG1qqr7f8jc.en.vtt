00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 while to most societies 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.480
 they are explained the mysteries that we 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.090
 surround invoking a god a group of 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.370
 gods a number of scientists work 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.530
 to offer objective answers about 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.960
 the infinity of space and on the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.460
 internal machinery of the atom robert la 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.160
 nhfa is a renowned scientist 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.960
 world that has covered many fields and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.880
 one of the brightest minds in 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.070
 our time your theory of 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.800
 biocentrism is in tune with the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.570
 oldest traditions in the world its 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.940
 new theory of the universe has in 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.730
 account for all the knowledge we have 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.770
 acquired during the last centuries 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.899
 Robert Spear claims that according to the theory 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.809
 of biocentrism death is a 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.750
 illusion life creates the universe and not the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.700
 backwards space and time do not exist 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.250
 in the linear form we think that what 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.559
 does and if space and time are not 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.170
 linear then death can not 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.600
 exist in the real sense robert throws 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.120
 he says he has tests to confirm 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.399
 the existence beyond the grave and it 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.559
 they find in quantum physics the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.659
 biocentrism shows that such death 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.299
 as we know it is an illusion 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.520
 by our conscience spear says that 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.829
 as human beings we believe in death 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.899
 because they have taught us that we die and 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.479
 our consciousness associates life with the 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.789
 biological body biocentrism is 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.340
 classified as a theory of everything and 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.740
 comes from the words and their life and center 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.079
 is the belief here the life and the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.090
 biology are central to reality and 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.670
 that life creates the universe and not the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.829
 reverse lance uses the example of the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.950
 way we perceive the world that we 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.719
 a person surrounds a blue sky and he 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.090
 tells him that the color that is also of 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.310
 saul but the cells in the brain of 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.439
 a person could be changed to 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.840
 that the sky looked green or 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.030
 red in an experiment when 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.670
 scientists see passing particles to 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.069
 through two slits the particle passes 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.469
 through one slot to the other but 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.329
 without any person observing him they act 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.179
 as a wave can go through the 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.560
 two slits at the same time this 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.229
 shows that matter and energy 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.780
 can be displayed with characteristics of 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.569
 wave or particle you go to perfection and 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.290
 the consciousness to a person the space and 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.780
 time 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.760
 the instruments to our mind at 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.129
 observe the universe from the point of 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.439
 biocentric view this also means 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.629
 that space and time do not 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.370
 behave in the hard and fast way that 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.920
 our conscience tell us that what 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.500
 they do in short space and time 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.269
 they are mere instruments to our mind and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.459
 this implies that the idea of 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.519
 immortality exists in a world without 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.069
 boundaries of space and time itself 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.049
 way theoretical physicists believe that there 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.969
 infinity of universes with different 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.459
 variations that take place at the same 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:49.230
 launch time and today everything 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.790
 possibly it can happen is 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.310
 happening at some point in this 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.129
 multiverse and this means death does not 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.840
 the 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.150
 idea that consciousness creates the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.099
 reality has quantum support and 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.139
 It is also consistent with some of the 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.450
 things that biology and neuroscience 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.970
 is informing us about the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.340
 structures to our being points out ronald 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.470
 green director of the ethics institute 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.930
 the University of Darmouth on the 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.579
 spear work in the 15th century it 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.319
 he claimed that if the land were 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.420
 really round 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.209
 it's the people from the bottom of it 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.459
 would fall the biocentrism revolutionizes the 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.290
 vision of the world turning the planet 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.180
 upside down again with the vision 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.849
 revolutionary here life creates the 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.430
 universe rather than backwards at the same 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.590
 time these findings have increased the 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.810
 doubt and uncertainty about 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.109
 traditional physical explanations of 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.000
 the genesis and the structure of the universe 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.989
 while to most societies 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.989
 they are explained
