00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.740
 is 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:21.380
 Do you know the audi rs6 v8 now? 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.599
 the fastest in the world to vote if car 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.230
 arriving now in Brazil arriving now 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.940
 In Brazil we had the opportunity to 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.400
 allow you to try the on 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.230
 three models we made just for 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.510
 this purpose of germany but we already have 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.280
 the first units in port to 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.550
 to be licensed is a family car 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.830
 has all the characteristic of the vehicle of 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.239
 mixed utility I can load a 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.400
 outboard 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.989
 I can carry a basket of 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.750
 A little bigger picnic 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.760
 fit the junk all the children 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.920
 stepchildren and so on 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.269
 and I will not be ashamed on the road 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.460
 even if everyone is inside the 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.760
 car a really quite family 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.060
 dynamics and 560 horsepower of 0 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.770
 to 100 in less than four seconds 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.320
 furthermore you mentioned 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.750
 We also have a car in this car. 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.060
 disconnected are said remember I can 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.340
 turn off the car four cylinders 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.920
 works with only four cylinders per 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.680
 example at a constant speed of 120 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.210
 km per hour on a highway and do more than 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.570
 10 kilometers per liter 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.759
 then it is really 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.829
 that wider, more familiar car 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.880
 which allows me flexibility of 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.799
 higher load 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.600
 without consuming too much 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.549
 fuel even talking about the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.320
 structure of development 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.259
 They spoke to me in the presentation. 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.380
 structure and life that's that 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.749
 the hybrid usually means that the 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.740
 I use two components that are 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.619
 to the other 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.109
 we use a basic structure of steels 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.109
 various types of steel as is traditional 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.240
 in our monoblocs but all the 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:04.549
 possible components in the case of 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.159
 car slid front for slats 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.440
 front doors and doors 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.250
 only fully fabricated 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.800
 aluminum with this despite 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.870
 increase the amount of equipment 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.599
 systems security systems 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.860
 night vision cameras system 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.470
 maintenance camera 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.750
 the rolling range for example knots 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.610
 we can even increase the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.530
 amount of equipment thousand and 40 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.090
 compared to the model 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.680
 immediately above 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.600
 So let's talk about efficiency of 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.280
 an item that is arriving each 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.980
 more is approaching the cars 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.070
 In Brazil it's a start stop system and you 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.890
 already a new system that has changed in 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.810
 star stop system I can keep 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.350
 all car equipment 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.730
 running fan television radio 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.280
 if there is one when the car is stopped 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.560
 obviously it's any kind of 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.070
 equipment that is plugged in 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.590
 in the car electronic games anyway 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.200
 When the car leaves again I do not 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.090
 I have no type of power outage 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.280
 of course there are some premises that 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.080
 need to be respected 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.030
 I have to have the engine in 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.130
 something normal operating temperature 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.130
 close to 90 degrees 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.390
 and I have to be with my battery 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.340
 well loaded 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.140
 if I just left the car 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.290
 station with the radio connected by a 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.970
 at that moment the start stop did not 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.910
 will work only when the battery has 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.100
 sufficient load and for us to use the 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.920
 direct injection of fuel 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.040
 our response to the resumption of 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.600
 movement is much milder much less 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.840
 It is noticeable that the engines with 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.120
 direct with 560 horsepower 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.160
 eight-speed transmission as 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.090
 do to distribute all this power 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.130
 in suspension on wheels 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.590
 initially all our cars to 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.380
 from sports models s 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.630
 traditional models can also 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.989
 four-wheel drive from 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.330
 the customer the bother that way the 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.190
 sporting events all have 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.220
 four wheel drive 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.820
 in the case of sports cars also the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.829
 sports rear axle how 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.590
 this works when the vehicle 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.000
 realizes entering a curve 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.460
 electronically speaking neither the sensors 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.060
 and accelerator are indicating that it will 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.360
 make a curve turn right 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.270
 the rear axle having a pump 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.250
 some clutches and some 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.580
 power multiplier 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.190
 can take a preventive and 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.200
 transfer ringtone to the wheel that goes 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.900
 stay for the outside of the curve 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.419
 with this when the car goes to bed like 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.070
 people say upon that wheel she already 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.930
 will be far stronger than the 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.169
 Inner wheel the car will make the plug 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.730
 of the curve in an even more secure way 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.740
 another highlight of your mother's one 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.000
 parking system because I know that 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.800
 I got what changed 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.320
 the head- up display that is still there 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.300
 screen is the head up display we 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.190
 incorporated from other cars is that 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.590
 system looking out the window 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.260
 I see the numbers as floating 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.389
 over the hood and inside my field 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.150
 peripheral will not disturb 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.310
 my view the parking system 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.889
 plus how do I use the direction now 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.620
 also I can simply 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.570
 push buttons and the car parks 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.520
 alone without which I need to touch the 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.860
 steering wheel if I put the steering wheel 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.900
 it stops working with all this 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.820
 speed power must also have 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.240
 a greater care in safety brakes 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.919
 we use ceramics in this car that we 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.380
 We are bringing to Brazil that we do not 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.720
 has a speed limiter that 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.690
 reaches 300 five years per hour 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.600
 we will always have the audio discs 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.150
 ferran can see me written on the easel 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.120
 brakes that are made of ceramic 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.100
 so they have not done so 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.350
 quickly withstand braking 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.639
 somewhat stronger availability by 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.539
 to have this information 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:13.750
 we have 550 thousand reais 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:17.100
 is our firm proposal if there is no 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.100
 large market oscillations
