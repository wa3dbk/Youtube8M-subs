this<00:00:13.410> video<00:00:13.650> I'm<00:00:13.740> going<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.009> be<00:00:14.130> using<00:00:14.519> maple

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
this video I'm going to be using maple

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.439 
this video I'm going to be using maple
as<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.660> main<00:00:16.170> as<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> primary<00:00:17.100> example<00:00:17.760> just

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
as a main as like a primary example just

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.060 
as a main as like a primary example just
because<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.380> encounter<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
because it's the one I encounter the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.800 
because it's the one I encounter the
most<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.029> starting<00:00:21.359> one<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:21.630> it's

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
most and it's the starting one so it's

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.179 
most and it's the starting one so it's
the<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.109> all<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.470> us<00:00:22.680> should<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the one that all of us should be the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.769 
the one that all of us should be the
most<00:00:23.340> familiar<00:00:23.670> with<00:00:24.150> there<00:00:24.359> will<00:00:24.480> be<00:00:24.510> some

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
most familiar with there will be some

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.019 
most familiar with there will be some
other<00:00:24.900> examples<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.560> here<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.670> video

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
other examples in here so this video

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.150 
other examples in here so this video
does<00:00:27.300> apply<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:28.019> all<00:00:28.260> types<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.740> wood<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
does apply for all types of wood I

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.220 
does apply for all types of wood I
suppose<00:00:29.789> all<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.029> my<00:00:30.330> farming<00:00:30.720> videos<00:00:31.019> do

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
suppose all of my farming videos do

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.680 
suppose all of my farming videos do
apply<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> all<00:00:32.009> types<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.969> material<00:00:33.570> I

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
apply to all types of that material I

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.959 
apply to all types of that material I
just<00:00:33.719> tend<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.680> use<00:00:34.860> one<00:00:35.160> type<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.430> material<00:00:35.880> as

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
just tend to use one type of material as

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.240 
just tend to use one type of material as
an<00:00:36.090> example<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.989> yes<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.620> video<00:00:37.920> I'm

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
an example so yes in this video I'm

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.400 
an example so yes in this video I'm
going<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.850> show<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.180> how<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> farm<00:00:39.840> wood<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
going to show you how to farm wood and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.709 
going to show you how to farm wood and
some<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:40.980> tips<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.399> tricks<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.059> actually

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
some little tips and tricks to actually

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.630 
some little tips and tricks to actually
making<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> bit<00:00:43.649> easier<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:44.010> yourself<00:00:44.219> to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
making it a bit easier for yourself to

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.970 
making it a bit easier for yourself to
find<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.059> stuff<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.899> when<00:00:46.260> you're<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
find this stuff so when you're out and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.889 
find this stuff so when you're out and
about<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.579> Tamriel<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.360> will<00:00:48.539> come<00:00:48.780> across

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
about in Tamriel you will come across

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.779 
about in Tamriel you will come across
logs<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> ground<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.399> will<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.700> an

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
logs on the ground you will have an

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.330 
logs on the ground you will have an
option<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.420> cut<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.289> logs<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.739> therefore

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
option to cut the logs and therefore

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
option to cut the logs and therefore
harvesting<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> raw<00:00:54.329> wood<00:00:54.660> materials<00:00:55.230> from

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
harvesting the raw wood materials from

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.650 
harvesting the raw wood materials from
this<00:00:55.829> log<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.940> beach<00:00:57.149> log<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
this log so if it's a your beach log you

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660 
this log so if it's a your beach log you
chop<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:58.410> get<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:59.370> will<00:00:59.550> get

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
chop it up you will get you will get

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.720 
chop it up you will get you will get
beach<00:00:59.940> from<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.660> particular<00:01:01.410> beach<00:01:01.859> log<00:01:02.250> if

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
beach from that particular beach log if

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.670 
beach from that particular beach log if
you<00:01:02.940> cut<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> maple<00:01:03.480> log<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.019> will<00:01:04.140> end<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.500> with

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you cut a maple log you will end up with

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.469 
you cut a maple log you will end up with
getting<00:01:04.979> maple<00:01:05.489> from<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.210> works<00:01:06.390> like

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
getting maple from that so it works like

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.910 
getting maple from that so it works like
that<00:01:06.750> whatever<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.200> log<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> you'll<00:01:07.650> get<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that whatever the log is you'll get the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.890 
that whatever the log is you'll get the
corresponding<00:01:08.189> wood<00:01:08.760> from<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.090> okay<00:01:09.840> so

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
corresponding wood from that okay so

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.630 
corresponding wood from that okay so
what<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.290> want<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.950> want<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> run<00:01:11.610> out

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
what you want to do you want to run out

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.700 
what you want to do you want to run out
of<00:01:11.850> City<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.689> actually<00:01:12.960> find<00:01:13.380> logs

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
of City you can actually find logs

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.890 
of City you can actually find logs
inside<00:01:14.159> cities<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:14.729> found<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.150> couple<00:01:15.390> inside

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
inside cities I've found a couple inside

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.200 
inside cities I've found a couple inside
some<00:01:16.110> cities<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.740> definitely<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.820> like

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
some cities but it's definitely not like

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.420 
some cities but it's definitely not like
it<00:01:18.360> rely<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.170> know<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.530> want<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> go<00:01:19.979> find<00:01:20.159> some

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it rely you know I want to go find some

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.859 
it rely you know I want to go find some
wood<00:01:20.549> I'm<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.000> hang<00:01:21.180> around<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.630> town

found<00:01:30.900> heaps<00:01:31.259> while<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.530> was<00:01:31.680> questing<00:01:32.220> just

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
found heaps while I was questing just

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.850 
found heaps while I was questing just
knocking<00:01:32.790> around<00:01:32.909> doing<00:01:33.420> things<00:01:33.860> exploring

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
knocking around doing things exploring

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.190 
knocking around doing things exploring
doing<00:01:35.460> gymnastics<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> grass<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.780> mean

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
doing gymnastics on the grass I mean

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.450 
doing gymnastics on the grass I mean
whatever<00:01:37.530> you're<00:01:37.770> doing<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.220> probably

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
whatever you're doing you will probably

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.280 
whatever you're doing you will probably
run<00:01:38.700> into<00:01:38.759> these<00:01:39.090> same<00:01:39.689> goes<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.079> any

run into these same goes with any
farmable<00:01:40.710> material<00:01:41.430> now<00:01:42.030> these<00:01:42.240> usually

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
farmable material now these usually

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.060

in certain locations they're not made

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.350 
in certain locations they're not made
too<00:01:52.049> hard<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.470> find<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.549> do<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.180> use

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
too hard to find but you do have to use

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.389 
too hard to find but you do have to use
your<00:01:54.570> brain<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:55.409> okay<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.829> just

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
your brain and kind of go okay so just

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.370 
your brain and kind of go okay so just
check<00:01:56.759> out<00:01:56.939> some<00:01:57.329> over<00:01:57.719> there<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.170> over<00:01:58.350> here

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
check out some over there and over here

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.190 
check out some over there and over here
you<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.610> go<00:01:59.729> oh<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:00.750> run<00:02:00.960> forward

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
you just go oh and just run forward

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.630 
you just go oh and just run forward
you're<00:02:01.409> probably<00:02:01.799> not<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> find<00:02:02.490> that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you're probably not going to find that

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.969 
you're probably not going to find that
much<00:02:02.850> wood<00:02:03.090> now<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.810> these<00:02:04.020> being<00:02:04.290> logs<00:02:04.680> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
much wood now with these being logs it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.010 
much wood now with these being logs it
does<00:02:05.250> make<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.579> harder<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.880> find<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.450> lot<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
does make it harder to find a lot of the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.050 
does make it harder to find a lot of the
other<00:02:07.229> farmable<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:08.009> materials<00:02:08.520> stick<00:02:08.879> out<00:02:09.030> a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
other farmable of materials stick out a

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.200 
other farmable of materials stick out a
bit<00:02:09.179> because<00:02:09.390> you're<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.690> oh<00:02:09.780> that's<00:02:09.959> weird

bit because you're like oh that's weird
that<00:02:11.360> bit<00:02:11.540> of<00:02:11.630> rock<00:02:11.900> looks<00:02:12.190> very<00:02:13.190> odd<00:02:13.730> oh<00:02:13.760> it's

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
that bit of rock looks very odd oh it's

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.170 
that bit of rock looks very odd oh it's
ional<00:02:14.570> that's<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.320> weird-looking<00:02:15.950> fluo<00:02:16.790> blue

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
ional that's a weird-looking fluo blue

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.180 
ional that's a weird-looking fluo blue
mushroom<00:02:17.600> oh<00:02:17.750> it's<00:02:17.960> an<00:02:18.080> alchemy<00:02:18.440> gritty<00:02:18.680> but

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
mushroom oh it's an alchemy gritty but

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.370 
mushroom oh it's an alchemy gritty but
with<00:02:19.460> wood<00:02:19.880> it's<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.360> log<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.960> kind<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.230> just

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
with wood it's a log you kind of just

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.980 
with wood it's a log you kind of just
run<00:02:21.680> past<00:02:21.710> it<00:02:22.250> because<00:02:22.370> it's<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.790> log<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.570> there

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
run past it because it's a log so there

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.070 
run past it because it's a log so there
is<00:02:24.140> one<00:02:24.440> way<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.880> absolutely<00:02:25.880> demolish<00:02:26.840> and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
is one way to absolutely demolish and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.280 
is one way to absolutely demolish and
delete<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.190> issue<00:02:28.700> from<00:02:29.330> just<00:02:29.810> running<00:02:30.140> past

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
delete that issue from just running past

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.480 
delete that issue from just running past
the<00:02:30.410> log<00:02:30.620> because<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:31.070> think<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.400> is

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
the log because you think it is

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.340 
the log because you think it is
genuinely<00:02:31.970> just<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.360> log<00:02:32.540> on<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.750> ground<00:02:32.990> now

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
genuinely just a log on the ground now

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.470 
genuinely just a log on the ground now
this<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.950> can<00:02:34.160> find<00:02:34.520> in<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.910> woodworking

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
this you can find in the woodworking

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.350 
this you can find in the woodworking
skill<00:02:36.050> tree<00:02:36.320> it's<00:02:36.650> called<00:02:36.950> Kenai<00:02:37.430> wood<00:02:38.000> so

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
skill tree it's called Kenai wood so

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.930 
skill tree it's called Kenai wood so
it's<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.990> Kenai<00:02:39.380> perk<00:02:39.710> specifically<00:02:40.670> for

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
it's the Kenai perk specifically for

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.910 
it's the Kenai perk specifically for
wood<00:02:41.150> what<00:02:41.600> this<00:02:41.780> will<00:02:41.990> do<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.230> when<00:02:42.710> you're

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
wood what this will do is when you're

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.090 
wood what this will do is when you're
within<00:02:43.190> 20<00:02:43.580> yards<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.570> piece<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.350> farmable

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
within 20 yards of a piece of farmable

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.520 
within 20 yards of a piece of farmable
wood<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.000> log<00:02:47.300> on<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.540> ground<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:48.110> can<00:02:48.320> cut

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
wood so a log on the ground you can cut

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.830 
wood so a log on the ground you can cut
and<00:02:48.770> get<00:02:49.310> some<00:02:49.550> raw<00:02:49.820> wood<00:02:50.120> from<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.630> will

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
and get some raw wood from it will

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.840 
and get some raw wood from it will
highlight<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.410> it'll<00:02:51.680> give<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:52.160> kind<00:02:52.640> of

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
highlight this it'll give it a kind of

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.420 
highlight this it'll give it a kind of
magical<00:02:53.480> glow<00:02:53.930> like<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.260> light<00:02:54.590> essence<00:02:55.100> coming

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
magical glow like a light essence coming

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.310 
magical glow like a light essence coming
off<00:02:55.550> of<00:02:55.580> it<00:02:55.790> now<00:02:56.270> as<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.690> put<00:02:56.900> more<00:02:57.080> points

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
off of it now as you put more points

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.320 
off of it now as you put more points
into<00:02:57.710> this<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:58.010> increases<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.640> range<00:02:58.910> so

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
into this it increases the range so

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.570 
into this it increases the range so
you're<00:02:59.780> running<00:03:00.050> on<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.230> path<00:03:00.410> 40<00:03:01.070> yards<00:03:01.430> away

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
you're running on the path 40 yards away

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.370 
you're running on the path 40 yards away
in<00:03:02.030> either<00:03:02.240> direction<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.870> can<00:03:03.050> see<00:03:03.080> two

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
in either direction you can see two

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.170 
in either direction you can see two
glowing<00:03:03.740> things<00:03:03.980> these<00:03:04.250> are<00:03:04.310> some<00:03:04.760> farmable

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
glowing things these are some farmable

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.140 
glowing things these are some farmable
logs<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.410> really<00:03:06.770> really<00:03:07.400> does<00:03:07.610> help<00:03:07.880> you

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
logs so it really really does help you

due<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.700> this<00:03:16.940> Kenai<00:03:17.390> perk<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.440> in<00:03:18.770> my<00:03:18.950> opinion

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
due to this Kenai perk so in my opinion

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.950 
due to this Kenai perk so in my opinion
it's<00:03:19.730> definitely<00:03:19.850> worth<00:03:20.510> putting<00:03:20.720> some

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
it's definitely worth putting some

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.900 
it's definitely worth putting some
points<00:03:21.260> into<00:03:21.440> this<00:03:21.530> Kenai<00:03:21.860> tree<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:22.400> even

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
points into this Kenai tree and even

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.280 
points into this Kenai tree and even
when<00:03:23.030> you're<00:03:23.150> just<00:03:23.180> out<00:03:23.420> questing<00:03:23.900> or<00:03:24.050> doing

when you're just out questing or doing
something<00:03:24.590> like<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.250> will<00:03:25.430> find<00:03:25.790> that

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
something like this you will find that

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.240 
something like this you will find that
the<00:03:26.330> amount<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.960> wood<00:03:27.320> that<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:27.680> find<00:03:28.010> when
