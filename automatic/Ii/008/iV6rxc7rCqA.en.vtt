00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
probably English then you're gonna

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.080 
probably English then you're gonna
choose<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:07.890> destination<00:01:08.490> file<00:01:11.090> just

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
decrypt it into a couple different files

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.920 
decrypt it into a couple different files
so<00:01:17.880> you're<00:01:18.000> gonna<00:01:18.119> probably<00:01:18.390> want<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> make<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
so you're gonna probably want to make a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.460 
so you're gonna probably want to make a
new<00:01:19.140> folder<00:01:19.970> to<00:01:20.970> hold<00:01:21.000> them<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.720> label<00:01:22.350> it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
new folder to hold them just label it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.160 
new folder to hold them just label it
the<00:01:22.950> movie<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.610> you're<00:01:23.810> decrypting<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.960> fine

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
the movie that you're decrypting is fine

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.039 
the movie that you're decrypting is fine
once<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.970> Go<00:01:30.270> button<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
once you do that you the Go button and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.710 
once you do that you the Go button and
then<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.470> will<00:01:31.590> start<00:01:31.979> its<00:01:32.579> process<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
then it will start its process this

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.560 
then it will start its process this
process<00:01:34.350> will<00:01:34.500> take<00:01:34.729> probably<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:36.060> couple<00:01:36.360> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
process will take probably a couple of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.499 
process will take probably a couple of
hours<00:01:36.930> I've<00:01:37.200> got<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.470> sped<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:37.979> here<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.210> so

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
hours I've got it sped up here and so

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.590
