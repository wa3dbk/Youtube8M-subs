00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.920

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.320
 time with a super simple and super tip 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.839
 quick to do so I was still going to 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.789
 you a technique that I learned call 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.800
 the loc that means liquid oil and cream 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.420
 this was not developed by me in the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.699
 truth has not been developed here in the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.010
 Brazil I 've been reading on some blogs 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.260
 among them love your curly 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.739
 I read in ronaldo's blog the man his 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.800
 curls and they learned neither with a 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.219
 how do you keep hydration 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.950
 and its replacement indicates nutrition as well 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.500
 with much more time in your hair a 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.840
 space between a wash other is well 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.270
 simple you will need to first wash 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.590
 conditions your normal hair or vice 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.899
 versa and treat 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.949
 Usually we end and go straight 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.350
 pro combing cream 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.660
 there is no locke technique it consists of 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.579
 that's precisely what I'm going to get into 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.799
 they knew site saved 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.479
 today I did a mass replacement for 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.060
 this time we'll need 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.600
 a spray I do this way 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.869
 I put some water preferably 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.409
 filtered 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:20.250
 I'll put a little too much theron 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:23.280
 It hurts but will have a little white only 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.920
 they try to get water dripping 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.729
 that end of dripping and hair 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.650
 I'm going to put some glycerin and a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.350
 bit of botton little thing 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.570
 now I'll shake those three 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:47.210
 net elements do i'll pass this 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.210
 I prepare in the fulfillment of my hair 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.970
 already applied in all my hair 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.780
 We're going to take some time now and what? 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.390
 we are going to do the part what is the oil 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.550
 so you go the eyes that you need 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.680
 only you can use whatever oil you want 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.910
 that this oil be vegetable 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.220
 In my case, use castor oil that 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.330
 I concentrated that oil packing that 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.550
 it's over and a little coconut oil 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.100
 there you will also pass the extension of the 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.400
 your hair and leave it where you can 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:42.450
 half an hour of coconut 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:45.030
 he is aged and I am applying you 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.430
 average trade concentrates this part of the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.430
 oil mainly at school 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.530
 a layer of cream that is part and which is 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.360
 cream before applying a leave-in 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.430
 For you who have thin hair that does not 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.310
 has dry hair 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.599
 You can go straight to step one. 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.370
 comb cream 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:29.129
 so I'll move on now to close 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.129
 to cast off a little more of the cream
