00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
paper let's get started so when I first

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.880 
paper let's get started so when I first
saw<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:42.989> image<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> water<00:00:43.559> lily<00:00:43.739> that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
saw this image of the water lily that

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.080 
saw this image of the water lily that
you<00:00:44.040> see<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.280> front<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> thought

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
you see in front of you here I thought

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.139 
you see in front of you here I thought
oh<00:00:45.360> my<00:00:46.230> goodness<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.219> really<00:00:47.789> complex

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
oh my goodness that is really complex

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.760 
oh my goodness that is really complex
but<00:00:48.480> then<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.719> remembered<00:00:49.140> back<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> tiger

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
but then I remembered back to a tiger

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250 
but then I remembered back to a tiger
lily<00:00:50.070> tutorial<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:50.789> did<00:00:50.940> earlier<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.629> I

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
lily tutorial that we did earlier and I

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.500 
lily tutorial that we did earlier and I
remembered<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.160> basic<00:00:53.640> foundation<00:00:54.420> of

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
remembered that the basic foundation of

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.380 
remembered that the basic foundation of
the<00:00:54.660> tiger<00:00:54.989> lily<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.949> groups<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.879> three

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the tiger lily was groups of three

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.790 
the tiger lily was groups of three
leaves<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> just<00:00:58.440> sat<00:00:58.770> down

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
leaves like this one I just sat down

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.250 
leaves like this one I just sat down
before<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.480> got<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.780> thinking<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.230> I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
before you so I got to thinking and I

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.750 
before you so I got to thinking and I
looked<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.559> couple<00:01:01.680> more<00:01:01.859> pictures<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
looked at a couple more pictures of the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
looked at a couple more pictures of the
water<00:01:03.030> lily<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.899> realized<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.680> that's

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
water lily and I realized that that's

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.000 
water lily and I realized that that's
pretty<00:01:05.339> much<00:01:05.549> all<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:07.229> group<00:01:07.830> of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
pretty much all this is is a group of

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.950 
pretty much all this is is a group of
four<00:01:08.670> leaves<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.390> case<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.780> what<00:01:09.930> I

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
four leaves in this case is what I

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.289 
four leaves in this case is what I
decided<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.409> go<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.970> that's<00:01:12.150> how

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
decided to go with and so that's how

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.929 
decided to go with and so that's how
we're<00:01:12.450> gonna<00:01:12.510> approach<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:13.640> now<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.700> first

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
we're gonna approach this now the first

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.840 
we're gonna approach this now the first
thing<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.150> would<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:16.490> get<00:01:17.490> your<00:01:17.670> regular

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
thing I would do is get your regular

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.960 
thing I would do is get your regular
white<00:01:18.540> piece<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.720> paper<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.970> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
white piece of paper like this and you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.480 
white piece of paper like this and you
want<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> draw<00:01:21.360> six<00:01:21.750> circles<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.619> think<00:01:22.920> maybe

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
want to draw six circles so think maybe

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.789 
want to draw six circles so think maybe
like<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> piece<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> dice<00:01:24.390> okay<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
like a piece of dice okay so you have a

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.390 
like a piece of dice okay so you have a
die<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:27.180> draw<00:01:28.170> six<00:01:28.470> circles<00:01:28.799> make<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.280> as

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
die and draw six circles make it as

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.679 
die and draw six circles make it as
close<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.930> center<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:32.689> it's

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
close to to the center as you can it's

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.069 
close to to the center as you can it's
close<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> mid<00:01:34.320> lines<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.990> then<00:01:36.990> what

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
close to the mid lines and then what

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.499 
close to the mid lines and then what
you're<00:01:37.200> gonna<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.939> draw<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.299> straight

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
you're gonna do is draw just a straight

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.149 
you're gonna do is draw just a straight
line<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> way<00:01:40.049> through<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.710> both<00:01:40.890> sides

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
line all the way through on both sides

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.530 
line all the way through on both sides
and<00:01:41.490> then<00:01:42.350> draw<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> straight<00:01:43.680> line<00:01:43.710> down<00:01:44.540> and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and then draw a straight line down and

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.270 
and then draw a straight line down and
these<00:01:45.659> are<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.020> your<00:01:46.140> guidelines

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.580

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
flower now this is what you're going to

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.780 
flower now this is what you're going to
ultimately<00:02:00.509> attach<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.140> flower<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.740> once<00:02:02.670> you

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
ultimately attach the flower to once you

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.910 
ultimately attach the flower to once you
have<00:02:02.969> all<00:02:03.119> these<00:02:03.270> parts<00:02:03.570> cut<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.469> here's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
have all these parts cut out so here's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.010 
have all these parts cut out so here's
what<00:02:05.009> you're<00:02:05.100> gonna<00:02:05.159> do<00:02:05.450> starting<00:02:06.450> from<00:02:06.689> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
what you're gonna do starting from a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.249 
what you're gonna do starting from a
little<00:02:07.560> bit<00:02:07.680> out<00:02:07.829> from<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.970> center<00:02:09.479> you're

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
little bit out from the center you're

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.809 
little bit out from the center you're
gonna<00:02:10.379> draw<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.250> basic<00:02:11.760> u-shape

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.259 

and<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:16.120> can<00:02:16.269> do<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:16.650> six<00:02:17.650> times<00:02:18.000> now<00:02:19.000> don't

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
and you can do this six times now don't

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.720 
and you can do this six times now don't
worry<00:02:19.450> if<00:02:19.810> it's<00:02:19.989> not<00:02:20.140> exact<00:02:20.560> because<00:02:21.250> again

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
worry if it's not exact because again

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.220 
worry if it's not exact because again
not<00:02:22.720> all<00:02:22.959> flowers<00:02:23.500> are<00:02:23.980> going<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.370> be<00:02:24.489> exactly

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
not all flowers are going to be exactly

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
they are living things just like we are

a<00:02:34.150> little<00:02:34.239> lower<00:02:34.569> on<00:02:34.840> one<00:02:35.049> side<00:02:35.260> than<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.650> is

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
a little lower on one side than it is

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.460 
a little lower on one side than it is
the<00:02:35.890> other<00:02:36.040> or<00:02:36.640> maybe<00:02:37.329> he's<00:02:37.569> got<00:02:37.720> like<00:02:37.989> one

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
the other or maybe he's got like one

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.979 
the other or maybe he's got like one
crazy<00:02:38.829> eye<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:40.180> just<00:02:40.329> kind<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.540> goes<00:02:40.659> every

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
crazy eye and it just kind of goes every

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.539 
crazy eye and it just kind of goes every
which<00:02:41.140> way<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:41.859> plants<00:02:42.159> are<00:02:42.220> much<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.400> same

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
which way so plants are much the same

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.369 
which way so plants are much the same
way<00:02:42.879> like<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.329> plant<00:02:43.569> right<00:02:43.750> here<00:02:43.780> maybe

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
way like this plant right here maybe

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:45.839 
way like this plant right here maybe
this<00:02:44.620> has<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.769> crazy<00:02:45.010> leaf<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:45.489> comes<00:02:45.700> out

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
this has a crazy leaf that comes out

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:46.649 
this has a crazy leaf that comes out
this<00:02:46.030> way<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.239> little<00:02:46.390> bit

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
this way a little bit

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:47.970 
this way a little bit
and<00:02:47.019> that's<00:02:47.140> totally<00:02:47.349> fine<00:02:47.680> you're<00:02:47.950> just

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
and that's totally fine you're just

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.050 
and that's totally fine you're just
using<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.459> as<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> guideline<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:51.549> once<00:02:51.970> you

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
using this as a guideline so once you

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.119 
using this as a guideline so once you
have<00:02:52.150> these<00:02:52.299> six<00:02:52.540> drawn<00:02:53.639> cut<00:02:54.639> them<00:02:54.790> out<00:02:56.129> and

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
have these six drawn cut them out and

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.050 
have these six drawn cut them out and
again<00:02:57.280> you're<00:02:57.459> just<00:02:57.489> using<00:02:57.700> them<00:02:57.940> as

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
again you're just using them as

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.520 
again you're just using them as
guidelines<00:02:58.299> you<00:02:58.690> got<00:02:58.780> another<00:02:58.959> crazy<00:02:59.260> leaf

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
guidelines you got another crazy leaf

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.160 
guidelines you got another crazy leaf
there<00:02:59.739> it's<00:02:59.920> totally<00:03:00.310> okay<00:03:00.549> don't<00:03:00.849> get<00:03:01.000> too

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
there it's totally okay don't get too

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.110 
there it's totally okay don't get too
don't<00:03:02.170> get<00:03:02.260> too<00:03:02.409> excited<00:03:02.530> if<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.069> if<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.579> mess

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
don't get too excited if you if you mess

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.059 
don't get too excited if you if you mess
up<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.389> little<00:03:04.599> bit<00:03:04.750> because<00:03:05.230> it's<00:03:05.680> going<00:03:05.950> to

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
up a little bit because it's going to

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.960 
up a little bit because it's going to
just<00:03:06.280> add<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.519> it

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
just add to it

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.300 
just add to it
all<00:03:07.720> right<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.170> then<00:03:08.349> we<00:03:08.829> want<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.040> cut<00:03:09.190> these

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
all right so then we want to cut these

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.830 
all right so then we want to cut these
out<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.670> make<00:03:09.819> sure<00:03:09.849> if<00:03:10.329> you're<00:03:10.480> cutting<00:03:10.690> on

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
out and make sure if you're cutting on

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.330 
out and make sure if you're cutting on
your<00:03:10.959> kitchen<00:03:11.079> table<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.500> use<00:03:11.739> a<00:03:11.769> cutting

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
your kitchen table you use a cutting

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.740 
your kitchen table you use a cutting
surface<00:03:12.519> this<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.090> just<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.359> back<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.569> a

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
surface this is just the back of a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.080 
surface this is just the back of a
notebook<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.530> I'm<00:03:15.310> gonna<00:03:15.489> cut<00:03:15.670> each<00:03:15.849> one<00:03:16.000> of

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
notebook and I'm gonna cut each one of

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.110 
notebook and I'm gonna cut each one of
these<00:03:16.180> out<00:03:16.359> individually<00:03:17.639> which<00:03:18.639> as<00:03:18.879> you<00:03:19.060> can

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
these out individually which as you can

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.110 
these out individually which as you can
see<00:03:19.209> I've<00:03:19.510> already<00:03:19.690> done<00:03:19.810> here<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:21.120> once

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
see I've already done here and once

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.439 
see I've already done here and once
they're<00:03:22.299> cut<00:03:22.510> out<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:23.790> want<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.849> to<00:03:24.970> take<00:03:25.180> and

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:25.449 
they're cut out I want you to take and

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:31.099 
they're cut out I want you to take and
arrange<00:03:26.019> them<00:03:26.319> by<00:03:26.590> size<00:03:28.799> biggest<00:03:29.799> to<00:03:30.190> smallest

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
arrange them by size biggest to smallest

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.210 
arrange them by size biggest to smallest
and<00:03:32.109> as<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.319> can<00:03:32.379> see<00:03:32.440> I've<00:03:32.739> got<00:03:32.859> a<00:03:32.889> couple<00:03:32.949> of

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
and as you can see I've got a couple of

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.500 
and as you can see I've got a couple of
different<00:03:33.459> sizes<00:03:33.579> here<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.030> just<00:03:34.180> happened<00:03:34.480> to

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
different sizes here it just happened to

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.119 
different sizes here it just happened to
work<00:03:34.569> out<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:35.049> way<00:03:35.230> I<00:03:35.470> started<00:03:35.980> actually

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
work out that way I started actually

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.589 
work out that way I started actually
running<00:03:36.430> out<00:03:36.579> of<00:03:36.639> room<00:03:36.849> on<00:03:36.970> my<00:03:37.060> original<00:03:37.239> piece

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
running out of room on my original piece

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.490 
running out of room on my original piece
of<00:03:37.720> paper<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:39.329> these<00:03:40.329> in<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.019> center<00:03:41.319> are

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
of paper so these in the center are

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.740 
of paper so these in the center are
actually<00:03:41.889> quite<00:03:42.099> small<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:43.299> once<00:03:43.540> we<00:03:43.629> have

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
actually quite small and once we have

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.170 
actually quite small and once we have
them<00:03:43.900> arranged<00:03:44.260> according<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.650> size<00:03:44.919> take<00:03:45.760> all

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
them arranged according to size take all

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.979 
do this is put a finger down the end of
the<00:03:50.799> leaf<00:03:50.949> and<00:03:51.160> just<00:03:51.489> squish<00:03:51.879> the<00:03:52.540> leaf<00:03:52.750> up

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
single leaf okay once you have that done

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.000 
single leaf okay once you have that done
and<00:03:58.000> all<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.199> edges<00:03:59.319> of<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.650> leaves<00:03:59.799> are

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
and all the edges of the leaves are

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.520 
and all the edges of the leaves are
wrinkled<00:04:00.310> a<00:04:00.370> little<00:04:00.579> bit<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:02.019> again<00:04:02.290> we're

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
wrinkled a little bit and again we're

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.599 
wrinkled a little bit and again we're
just<00:04:02.560> we're<00:04:02.859> just<00:04:03.010> putting<00:04:03.159> them<00:04:03.340> in<00:04:03.459> and

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
just we're just putting them in and

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:04.800 
just we're just putting them in and
pushing<00:04:03.940> them<00:04:04.060> in<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.299> curling<00:04:04.629> them<00:04:04.750> a

pushing them in and curling them a

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.809 
pushing them in and curling them a
little<00:04:05.019> bit<00:04:05.109> like<00:04:05.260> you<00:04:05.379> see<00:04:05.530> here<00:04:05.819> then

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
little bit like you see here then

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.839 
little bit like you see here then
arrange<00:04:07.449> them<00:04:07.690> inside<00:04:08.680> one<00:04:08.889> another<00:04:09.159> from

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
arrange them inside one another from

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:10.920 
arrange them inside one another from
smallest<00:04:10.209> to<00:04:10.359> largest

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
smallest to largest

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.710 
smallest to largest
and<00:04:11.019> try<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.650> vary<00:04:11.919> the<00:04:12.010> leaves<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.790> if<00:04:13.510> you've

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
and try and vary the leaves so if you've

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.539 
and try and vary the leaves so if you've
got<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.989> first<00:04:14.139> one<00:04:14.470> going<00:04:15.069> straight<00:04:15.310> up<00:04:15.400> and

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
got the first one going straight up and

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:16.529 
got the first one going straight up and
down<00:04:15.579> you've<00:04:15.879> got<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.030> second<00:04:16.329> one<00:04:16.359> in<00:04:16.510> the

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
down you've got the second one in the

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.899 
down you've got the second one in the
shape<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:16.870> an<00:04:16.959> X<00:04:17.109> and<00:04:17.590> make<00:04:18.430> it<00:04:18.549> so<00:04:18.729> that<00:04:18.760> you

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
shape of an X and make it so that you

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.479 
shape of an X and make it so that you
can<00:04:19.060> see<00:04:19.269> basically<00:04:19.570> all<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:20.079> leaves<00:04:20.489> now

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
can see basically all the leaves now

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.360 
can see basically all the leaves now

get this shape here and just spread
those<00:04:45.509> leaves<00:04:45.780> out<00:04:45.930> a<00:04:45.990> little<00:04:46.169> bit<00:04:46.610> okay

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
those leaves out a little bit okay

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.460 
those leaves out a little bit okay
spread<00:04:48.539> them<00:04:48.720> out<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:49.020> that<00:04:49.139> there's<00:04:49.319> a<00:04:49.380> little

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
bit of distance between each leaf and

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.210 
bit of distance between each leaf and
each<00:04:51.509> other<00:04:51.690> leaf<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.229> make<00:04:52.650> sure<00:04:52.800> again<00:04:53.039> you

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
each other leaf and make sure again you

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.640 
each other leaf and make sure again you
turn<00:04:53.699> them<00:04:53.910> so<00:04:54.900> that<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.110> can<00:04:55.139> see<00:04:55.410> all<00:04:55.530> the

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
turn them so that you can see all the

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.779 
turn them so that you can see all the
leaves<00:04:55.770> so<00:04:56.039> they're<00:04:56.160> not<00:04:56.250> on<00:04:56.400> top<00:04:56.550> of<00:04:56.699> one

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
leaves so they're not on top of one

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.650 
leaves so they're not on top of one
another<00:04:56.819> take<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.900> last<00:04:58.110> two<00:04:59.479> place<00:05:00.479> them

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
another take the last two place them

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.510 
another take the last two place them
like<00:05:00.810> that<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.229> take<00:05:01.440> this<00:05:01.590> one<00:05:01.800> place<00:05:02.250> it<00:05:02.400> in

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
like that and take this one place it in

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.550 
like that and take this one place it in
the<00:05:02.610> center<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.030> there<00:05:03.900> you<00:05:04.020> have<00:05:04.169> it<00:05:04.320> there

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
the center and there you have it there

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.890 
the center and there you have it there
is<00:05:04.590> a<00:05:05.250> water<00:05:05.699> lily<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.330> now<00:05:06.599> what<00:05:06.780> I<00:05:06.810> would

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
is a water lily and now what I would

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.870 
is a water lily and now what I would
recommend<00:05:07.110> is<00:05:07.530> that<00:05:07.560> you<00:05:07.680> just<00:05:07.919> take<00:05:08.070> a<00:05:08.099> tack

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
recommend is that you just take a tack

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.580 
recommend is that you just take a tack
or<00:05:09.060> something<00:05:09.389> stick<00:05:09.870> it<00:05:09.990> straight<00:05:10.169> down<00:05:10.440> the

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
or something stick it straight down the

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.589 
or something stick it straight down the
center<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:10.889> you<00:05:11.190> can<00:05:11.220> attach<00:05:11.639> that<00:05:11.910> to<00:05:11.970> a

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
center and you can attach that to a

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.770 
center and you can attach that to a
board<00:05:12.960> or<00:05:13.349> you<00:05:13.620> can<00:05:13.770> attach<00:05:14.009> it<00:05:14.039> to<00:05:14.419> say<00:05:15.419> like<00:05:15.750> a
