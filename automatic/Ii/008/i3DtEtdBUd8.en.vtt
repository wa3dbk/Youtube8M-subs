00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.589 

well<00:02:36.859> he's<00:02:37.040> chosen<00:02:37.280> not<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.670> take<00:02:37.819> any<00:02:38.180> risk

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
well he's chosen not to take any risk

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.530 
well he's chosen not to take any risk
with<00:02:38.870> his<00:02:39.019> positional<00:02:39.650> play<00:02:40.150> he<00:02:41.150> may<00:02:41.329> be<00:02:41.390> a

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
with his positional play he may be a

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.720 
with his positional play he may be a
long<00:02:41.870> way<00:02:41.900> away<00:02:42.379> but<00:02:42.560> he's<00:02:42.890> on<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.189> right<00:02:43.370> side

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
long way away but he's on the right side

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.369 
long way away but he's on the right side
of<00:02:43.909> the<00:02:44.060> three<00:02:44.359> I<00:02:44.540> think<00:02:44.900> he's<00:02:45.049> going<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.230> come

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
of the three I think he's going to come

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.300 
of the three I think he's going to come
and<00:02:45.560> have<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.680> look<00:02:45.799> at<00:02:45.950> this

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.309 
and have a look at this
and<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:47.180> think<00:02:47.510> he's<00:02:47.689> going<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.900> play<00:02:48.049> this

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
and I think he's going to play this

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.259 
and I think he's going to play this
where<00:02:48.560> he's<00:02:48.680> going<00:02:48.859> to<00:02:48.920> use<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.250> eight<00:02:52.269> just

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
where he's going to use the eight just

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.009

flicking<00:02:53.659> the<00:02:53.930> three<00:02:54.230> off<00:02:54.889> the<00:02:55.310> eight<00:02:56.019> and

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
flicking the three off the eight and

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.490

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
cutting it in the other option is just

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.179 
cutting it in the other option is just
to<00:03:10.849> try<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.090> cut<00:03:11.419> it<00:03:11.540> in<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:11.959> maybe<00:03:12.439> spin<00:03:13.010> the

see what Thorsten prefers or maybe go

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:29.229

all<00:03:21.349> the<00:03:21.500> way<00:03:21.530> up<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:21.950> down

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.420 

what<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.810> great<00:03:30.049> shot<00:03:30.290> spinning<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.010> cue<00:03:31.219> ball

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
what a great shot spinning the cue ball

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.449 
what a great shot spinning the cue ball
that<00:03:32.390> should<00:03:32.689> be<00:03:32.870> Jerry<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.769> he<00:03:33.859> had<00:03:34.069> to<00:03:34.189> spin

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
that should be Jerry and he had to spin

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.869 
that should be Jerry and he had to spin
the<00:03:34.579> cue<00:03:34.730> ball<00:03:35.469> to<00:03:36.469> get<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:36.890> three<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.579> hold

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
the cue ball to get that three and hold

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:44.789 
the cue ball to get that three and hold
for<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.209> four<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:42.099> the<00:03:43.099> five<00:03:43.430> seven

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
for the four and the five seven

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.949 
for the four and the five seven
certainly<00:03:45.799> looked<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.189> be<00:03:46.340> on<00:03:46.549> offer<00:03:47.000> bottom

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
certainly looked to be on offer bottom

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:57.020 
certainly looked to be on offer bottom
left

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.880 

yeah<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:57.630> don't<00:03:57.840> think<00:03:57.990> he's<00:03:58.200> got<00:03:58.320> enough<00:03:58.380> angle

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
yeah I don't think he's got enough angle

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.260 
yeah I don't think he's got enough angle
to<00:03:58.980> do<00:03:59.100> anything<00:03:59.310> else<00:03:59.640> he's<00:03:59.850> gonna<00:03:59.970> have<00:04:00.180> to

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
to do anything else he's gonna have to

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.350 
to do anything else he's gonna have to
settle<00:04:00.510> for<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:00.840> combo<00:04:04.850> getting<00:04:05.850> closer<00:04:06.090> do

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
settle for that combo getting closer do

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.770 
settle for that combo getting closer do
the<00:04:06.480> work<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:08.430> straighter<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.360> he<00:04:09.450> can<00:04:09.630> get

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
the work the straighter that he can get

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.320 
the work the straighter that he can get
on<00:04:09.960> this<00:04:10.170> means<00:04:11.040> he<00:04:11.190> can<00:04:11.340> pull<00:04:11.550> this<00:04:11.730> back<00:04:12.030> and

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
on this means he can pull this back and

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:22.580 
on this means he can pull this back and
play<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.600> five<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.990> the<00:04:13.080> same<00:04:13.290> pocket

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
mind you doesn't look like he's dead

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.960 
mind you doesn't look like he's dead
straight<00:04:24.750> no<00:04:25.440> I'm<00:04:25.680> afraid<00:04:25.830> he's<00:04:26.310> got<00:04:26.910> a
