00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that gear pair and tailor it down

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.469 
that gear pair and tailor it down
through<00:01:28.890> our<00:01:29.040> needs<00:01:29.280> make<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.000> multiple

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
through our needs make it have multiple

through our needs make it have multiple
uses<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.320> make<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.470> smaller<00:01:31.799> and

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
uses and then make it smaller and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.740 
uses and then make it smaller and
lighter<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.790> turn<00:01:33.000> they<00:01:33.270> take<00:01:33.509> what

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
lighter that in turn they take what

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.929 
lighter that in turn they take what
we've<00:01:33.960> modified<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.130> take<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.430> back<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> their

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939

we've modified and take it back to their
places<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.720> work<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.140> utilize<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:37.950> so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
places of work and utilize it there so

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.160 
places of work and utilize it there so
it's<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.520> collaborative<00:01:39.180> process<00:01:39.360> between<00:01:39.750> the
