drove good except for it does have an
issue<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.710> brakes<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.460> when<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> say

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
issue with the brakes and when I say

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.790 
issue with the brakes and when I say
issue<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.290> mean<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.890> pedal<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.460> kind<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.000> soft

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
issue I mean the pedal is kind of soft

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.260 
issue I mean the pedal is kind of soft
and<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.980> takes<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.340> lot<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.550> pressure<00:00:41.879> though<00:00:42.210> to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and it takes a lot of pressure though to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.959 
and it takes a lot of pressure though to
get<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.809> stop<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.469> when<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:44.670> stood

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
get it to stop and when I really stood

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.600 
get it to stop and when I really stood
on<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> pedal<00:00:45.600> hard<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.170> could<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.309> front

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
on the pedal hard I could get the front

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.350 
on the pedal hard I could get the front
brakes<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.120> lock<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.680> think<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.360> it's

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
brakes to lock up so I think that it's

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.750 
brakes to lock up so I think that it's
just<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:52.199> issue<00:00:52.379> as<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> rear<00:00:53.039> brakes<00:00:53.340> aren't

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
just the issue as the rear brakes aren't

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.200 
just the issue as the rear brakes aren't
working<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:55.160> but<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.250> did<00:00:56.460> drive<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.030> took

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
working so but we did drive it we took

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.170 
working so but we did drive it we took
it<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.510> about<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> 15<00:00:58.559> 18<00:00:58.829> mile<00:00:59.219> drive<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.030> I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it on about a 15 18 mile drive and I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.939 
it on about a 15 18 mile drive and I
mean<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.690> drivable<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.350> could<00:01:01.530> travel<00:01:01.800> with

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
mean it's drivable you could travel with

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.219 
mean it's drivable you could travel with
it<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.340> sure<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.420> let's<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:03.750> around<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> whole

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.109 
it for sure so let's go around the whole
thing<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.650> I'll<00:01:04.769> explain<00:01:05.100> some<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> ins

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119

heater and it turned on okay it's got

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.930 
heater and it turned on okay it's got
about<00:02:15.320> a<00:02:15.380> half<00:02:15.620> tank<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:16.010> propane<00:02:16.160> in<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.820> i

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
about a half tank of propane in it i

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.940 
about a half tank of propane in it i
also<00:02:17.090> ran<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.540> furnace<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.380> furnace<00:02:18.710> ran

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
also ran the furnace the furnace ran

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.000 
also ran the furnace the furnace ran
good<00:02:19.190> heated<00:02:19.760> up<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.910> coach<00:02:20.240> nice<00:02:20.800> one<00:02:21.800> thing

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
good heated up the coach nice one thing

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.570 
good heated up the coach nice one thing
I'll<00:02:22.130> say<00:02:22.160> too<00:02:22.430> is<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.950> opened<00:02:24.950> up<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.340> don't

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
I'll say too is that I opened up I don't

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.610 
I'll say too is that I opened up I don't
there's<00:02:25.850> any<00:02:26.030> left<00:02:26.240> yet<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.810> opened<00:02:27.320> up<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
there's any left yet I opened up the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.230 
there's any left yet I opened up the
water<00:02:27.800> system<00:02:28.340> here<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.820> there's<00:02:29.000> still

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
water system here and there's still

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.120 
water system here and there's still
pressure<00:02:29.570> on<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.020> so<00:02:30.170> we<00:02:30.290> haven't<00:02:30.590> tested<00:02:30.800> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
pressure on it so we haven't tested the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.850 
pressure on it so we haven't tested the
water<00:02:31.310> system<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.060> coach<00:02:32.300> but<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.650> does

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
water system on this coach but it does

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.470 
water system on this coach but it does
seem<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.100> be<00:02:34.190> holding<00:02:34.400> pressure<00:02:34.790> which<00:02:35.240> means

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
seem to be holding pressure which means

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.060 
seem to be holding pressure which means
it<00:02:35.630> was<00:02:35.750> probably<00:02:36.040> properly<00:02:37.040> winterized<00:02:39.070> this

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
it was probably properly winterized this

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.690 
it was probably properly winterized this
has<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.340> 4,000<00:02:41.239> watt<00:02:41.390> onan<00:02:41.989> generator<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.920> tried

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
has a 4,000 watt onan generator I tried

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.080 
has a 4,000 watt onan generator I tried
to<00:02:43.880> start<00:02:44.209> the<00:02:44.270> unit<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:46.220> did<00:02:46.459> not<00:02:46.640> start

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
to start the unit and it did not start

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.229 
to start the unit and it did not start
doesn't<00:02:47.660> turn<00:02:47.840> over<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:49.160> sound<00:02:49.580> is<00:02:49.880> just<00:02:50.120> the

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
doesn't turn over that sound is just the

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.949 
doesn't turn over that sound is just the
solenoid<00:02:50.750> chattering<00:02:51.350> so<00:02:52.660> may<00:02:53.660> be<00:02:53.720> as<00:02:53.930> simple

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
solenoid chattering so may be as simple

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.440 
solenoid chattering so may be as simple
as<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.410> low<00:02:54.650> battery<00:02:54.890> or<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.670> needs<00:02:55.850> some<00:02:56.180> a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
as a low battery or it needs some a

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.290 
as a low battery or it needs some a
starter<00:02:57.050> part<00:02:57.350> but<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.340> don't<00:02:58.970> know<00:02:59.090> if<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
starter part but I don't know if the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.290 
starter part but I don't know if the
generator<00:02:59.720> works<00:03:02.709> okay<00:03:03.709> overall<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:05.060> cab

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
generator works okay overall the the cab

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.910 
generator works okay overall the the cab
and<00:03:05.540> chassis<00:03:05.570> looks<00:03:05.959> pretty<00:03:06.380> good<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.709> coach

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
and chassis looks pretty good the coach

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.580 
and chassis looks pretty good the coach
isn't<00:03:07.280> rusty<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.910> there's<00:03:08.390> about<00:03:08.590> 58,000

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
isn't rusty and there's about 58,000

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.810 
isn't rusty and there's about 58,000
miles<00:03:09.769> on<00:03:10.100> it<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:15.250> let's<00:03:16.250> just<00:03:16.340> take<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.610> quick

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
miles on it and let's just take a quick

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:24.330 
miles on it and let's just take a quick
look<00:03:17.060> under<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.510> hood<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.370> this<00:03:22.549> is<00:03:22.730> a<00:03:22.760> Ford

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
look under the hood so this is a Ford

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:32.000 
look under the hood so this is a Ford
v10

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.890 

okay<00:03:33.010> make<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.210> I<00:03:34.390> need<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.660> make<00:03:34.870> a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
okay make that I need to make a

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.990 
okay make that I need to make a
correction<00:03:35.260> that's<00:03:35.560> actually<00:03:35.920> afford<00:03:36.190> 460

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
correction that's actually afford 460

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.710 
correction that's actually afford 460
it's<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.210> 7.5<00:03:38.170> liter<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:39.220> v10<00:03:39.640> is<00:03:39.790> 6.8<00:03:40.450> leader

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
it's a 7.5 liter the v10 is 6.8 leader

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.040 
it's a 7.5 liter the v10 is 6.8 leader
so<00:03:41.380> this<00:03:41.530> is<00:03:41.740> a<00:03:41.770> fuel-injected<00:03:42.670> Ford<00:03:43.240> 460

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
so this is a fuel-injected Ford 460

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.680 
so this is a fuel-injected Ford 460
actually<00:03:44.800> a<00:03:44.830> really<00:03:45.070> good<00:03:45.190> engine<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.420> last

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
actually a really good engine the last

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.860 
actually a really good engine the last
of<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:46.960> four<00:03:47.170> 60s<00:03:47.680> were<00:03:47.830> in<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.100> 90s<00:03:48.580> and<00:03:48.870> they

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
of the four 60s were in the 90s and they

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.890 
of the four 60s were in the 90s and they
were<00:03:49.930> made<00:03:50.200> pretty<00:03:50.440> well<00:03:51.540> all<00:03:52.540> right<00:03:52.690> let's

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
were made pretty well all right let's

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:06.990 
were made pretty well all right let's
take<00:03:53.020> a<00:03:53.080> look<00:03:53.350> inside

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.330 

one<00:04:07.780> thing<00:04:07.960> I<00:04:08.020> want<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.230> point<00:04:08.290> out<00:04:08.560> also<00:04:08.800> is

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
one thing I want to point out also is

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.760 
one thing I want to point out also is
that<00:04:09.840> even<00:04:10.840> though<00:04:11.050> we're<00:04:11.200> in<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.410> northern

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
that even though we're in a northern

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.160 
that even though we're in a northern
climate<00:04:11.980> we<00:04:12.400> had<00:04:13.120> this<00:04:13.240> unit<00:04:13.570> inside<00:04:13.930> all

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
climate we had this unit inside all

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.710 
climate we had this unit inside all
night<00:04:14.410> a<00:04:14.440> nice<00:04:14.770> warm<00:04:15.040> shop<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:15.730> we<00:04:16.209> ran<00:04:16.540> the

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
night a nice warm shop and we ran the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.300 
night a nice warm shop and we ran the
air<00:04:16.840> conditioner<00:04:17.350> this<00:04:17.500> morning<00:04:17.920> it<00:04:18.070> cooled

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
air conditioner this morning it cooled

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.060 
air conditioner this morning it cooled
like<00:04:18.519> a<00:04:18.549> charm<00:04:18.910> so<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:20.109> water<00:04:20.440> heater<00:04:20.739> works

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
like a charm so the water heater works

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.580 
like a charm so the water heater works
the<00:04:21.549> furnace<00:04:21.970> works<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:23.320> air

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
the furnace works and the air

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.410 
the furnace works and the air
conditioner<00:04:24.250> works<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.790> there<00:04:25.090> was<00:04:25.210> also

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
conditioner works and there was also

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.680 
conditioner works and there was also
pressure<00:04:25.870> on<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.230> water<00:04:26.410> system<00:04:27.270> as<00:04:28.270> far<00:04:28.540> as

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
pressure on the water system as far as

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.320 
pressure on the water system as far as
interior<00:04:29.110> condition<00:04:29.620> it's<00:04:30.490> pretty<00:04:30.790> worn<00:04:31.120> out

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
interior condition it's pretty worn out

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.750 
interior condition it's pretty worn out
in<00:04:31.570> here<00:04:31.870> there's<00:04:32.440> signs<00:04:32.770> of<00:04:33.040> leakage<00:04:33.430> in<00:04:33.640> the

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
in here there's signs of leakage in the

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.700 
in here there's signs of leakage in the
front<00:04:34.030> cap<00:04:34.300> mostly<00:04:34.780> just<00:04:34.990> on<00:04:35.170> the<00:04:35.320> bottom

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
front cap mostly just on the bottom

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.220 
front cap mostly just on the bottom
under<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.070> mattress<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.720> top<00:04:37.960> looks

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
under the mattress and the top looks

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.690 
under the mattress and the top looks
decent<00:04:38.470> but<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:38.890> does<00:04:39.040> look<00:04:39.190> like<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.490> front

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
decent but it does look like the front

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.409 
decent but it does look like the front
panel<00:04:39.970> was<00:04:40.300> replaced<00:04:41.250> so<00:04:42.250> in<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:43.030> test<00:04:43.270> drive

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
panel was replaced so in the test drive

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.510 
panel was replaced so in the test drive
and<00:04:43.660> all<00:04:43.780> it<00:04:43.930> still<00:04:44.140> seemed<00:04:44.740> pretty<00:04:44.919> solid<00:04:45.400> up

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
and all it still seemed pretty solid up

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.190 
and all it still seemed pretty solid up
here<00:04:45.730> and<00:04:45.850> this<00:04:45.910> is<00:04:45.970> aluminum<00:04:46.630> framing<00:04:46.960> in

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
here and this is aluminum framing in

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.230 
here and this is aluminum framing in
there<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.310> should<00:04:48.520> be<00:04:48.550> pretty<00:04:48.669> strong

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
there so it should be pretty strong

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.350 
there so it should be pretty strong
still<00:04:53.280> okay<00:04:54.280> this<00:04:54.460> spot<00:04:54.790> right<00:04:54.820> here<00:04:55.060> this

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
still okay this spot right here this

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.960 
still okay this spot right here this
open<00:04:55.750> spot<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.290> where<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.980> refrigerator<00:04:57.640> used

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
open spot is where the refrigerator used

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.240 
open spot is where the refrigerator used
to<00:04:58.120> be<00:04:58.300> so<00:04:58.930> you<00:04:59.020> could<00:04:59.230> use<00:04:59.410> this<00:04:59.590> for<00:04:59.770> storage

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
to be so you could use this for storage

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
to be so you could use this for storage
or<00:05:00.460> put<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.030> 110<00:05:01.570> volt<00:05:01.810> refrigerator<00:05:02.440> in<00:05:02.710> here

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
or put a 110 volt refrigerator in here

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.270 
or put a 110 volt refrigerator in here
you<00:05:04.270> got<00:05:04.390> a<00:05:04.419> microwave<00:05:04.780> here<00:05:05.290> so<00:05:05.860> I'm<00:05:06.130> sure

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
you got a microwave here so I'm sure

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.830 
you got a microwave here so I'm sure
this<00:05:06.460> works<00:05:06.760> I<00:05:06.970> haven't<00:05:07.210> tested<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.630> though

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
this works I haven't tested it though

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.930 
this works I haven't tested it though
and<00:05:08.080> the<00:05:08.620> ovens<00:05:08.980> here<00:05:09.280> these<00:05:09.580> are<00:05:09.640> usually

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
and the ovens here these are usually

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.320 
and the ovens here these are usually
pretty<00:05:10.240> simple<00:05:10.780> and<00:05:10.900> they<00:05:11.440> work<00:05:11.620> too<00:05:12.180> then<00:05:13.180> in

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
pretty simple and they work too then in

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.050 
pretty simple and they work too then in
the<00:05:13.419> back<00:05:13.660> oh<00:05:14.010> wait<00:05:15.010> let's<00:05:15.280> just<00:05:15.550> back<00:05:15.760> up<00:05:15.790> a

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
the back oh wait let's just back up a

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.180 
the back oh wait let's just back up a
little<00:05:16.210> bit<00:05:16.419> want<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.500> point<00:05:17.710> out<00:05:17.860> on<00:05:18.070> the

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
little bit want to point out on the

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.370 
little bit want to point out on the
ceiling<00:05:18.640> the<00:05:18.880> panels<00:05:19.660> are<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.810> little<00:05:20.080> soft

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
ceiling the panels are a little soft

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.690 
ceiling the panels are a little soft
here<00:05:22.560> but<00:05:23.560> again<00:05:23.770> these<00:05:23.950> are<00:05:24.010> all<00:05:24.250> usually

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
here but again these are all usually

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.880 
here but again these are all usually
steel<00:05:25.060> or<00:05:25.330> aluminum<00:05:25.750> frame<00:05:26.050> so<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.410> framing

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
steel or aluminum frame so the framing

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.820 
steel or aluminum frame so the framing
should<00:05:27.100> be<00:05:27.190> fine<00:05:27.870> this<00:05:28.870> coach<00:05:29.080> has<00:05:29.110> a<00:05:29.380> shower

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
should be fine this coach has a shower

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.800 
should be fine this coach has a shower
on<00:05:30.460> one<00:05:30.820> side<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:33.360> toilet<00:05:34.360> on<00:05:34.450> the<00:05:34.630> other

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
on one side and toilet on the other

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.500 
on one side and toilet on the other
looks<00:05:35.500> like<00:05:35.590> a<00:05:35.680> walkthrough<00:05:36.220> bath<00:05:39.300> and<00:05:40.300> then

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
looks like a walkthrough bath and then

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.080 
looks like a walkthrough bath and then
back<00:05:40.750> here<00:05:41.080> is<00:05:41.140> a<00:05:42.540> queen<00:05:43.540> bed<00:05:44.669> and<00:05:45.669> you<00:05:45.910> got<00:05:46.060> a

back here is a queen bed and you got a

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.969 
back here is a queen bed and you got a
little<00:05:46.210> bit<00:05:46.360> of<00:05:46.390> storage<00:05:46.720> underneath<00:05:47.020> there's

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
little bit of storage underneath there's

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:53.490 
little bit of storage underneath there's
the<00:05:48.160> freshwater<00:05:48.669> tank<00:05:49.830> and<00:05:51.300> right<00:05:52.300> here<00:05:52.500> this

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.580 
the freshwater tank and right here this
back<00:05:53.860> wall<00:05:54.720> seems<00:05:55.720> to<00:05:55.900> have<00:05:55.990> gotten<00:05:56.200> some

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
back wall seems to have gotten some

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:02.790 
back wall seems to have gotten some
leakage<00:05:56.950> under<00:05:57.310> the<00:05:57.430> window<00:06:01.470> okay<00:06:02.470> let's<00:06:02.680> go

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
leakage under the window okay let's go

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.100 
leakage under the window okay let's go

take this RV for a dry all right we're
driving<00:06:05.500> along<00:06:05.590> in<00:06:05.770> the<00:06:06.160> Dutchman<00:06:06.870> we're

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
driving along in the Dutchman we're

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.190 
driving along in the Dutchman we're
going<00:06:08.080> 50<00:06:08.590> miles<00:06:08.800> an<00:06:09.100> hour

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
going 50 miles an hour

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.800 
going 50 miles an hour
and<00:06:10.320> it<00:06:10.470> drives<00:06:10.680> along<00:06:11.040> real<00:06:11.340> nice<00:06:11.580> it<00:06:12.540> seems

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
and it drives along real nice it seems

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.110 
and it drives along real nice it seems
like<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:13.170> steering<00:06:13.710> and<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.490> transmission

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
like the steering and the transmission

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.950 
like the steering and the transmission
and<00:06:15.630> the<00:06:15.660> chassis<00:06:16.290> they<00:06:16.560> all<00:06:16.680> feel<00:06:16.980> real<00:06:17.280> good

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
and the chassis they all feel real good

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.660 
and the chassis they all feel real good
again<00:06:18.960> the<00:06:19.110> only<00:06:19.230> issue<00:06:19.560> that<00:06:20.070> the<00:06:20.190> coach<00:06:20.400> has

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
again the only issue that the coach has

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.650 
again the only issue that the coach has
is<00:06:21.240> with<00:06:21.630> the<00:06:21.900> brakes<00:06:22.320> so<00:06:23.040> I<00:06:23.460> think<00:06:24.360> whoever

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
is with the brakes so I think whoever

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.840 
is with the brakes so I think whoever
wins<00:06:24.960> is<00:06:25.110> coach<00:06:25.380> is<00:06:25.650> going<00:06:25.860> to<00:06:25.920> get<00:06:26.100> a<00:06:26.160> real

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
wins is coach is going to get a real

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.840 
wins is coach is going to get a real
good<00:06:26.880> value<00:06:27.360> on<00:06:27.480> this<00:06:27.630> one
