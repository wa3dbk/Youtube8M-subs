00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 angola is a very ugly face market 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.810
 beauty today monday is a holiday on 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.670
 calabar on May 18 is a holiday each 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.530
 win there in Canada 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.450
 so we will not have news of that 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.549
 today a lot of people were waiting for riocard 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.139
 remember break coming today is not from 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.420
 none of this can be that we have 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.130
 this week even because two 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.350
 records were broken in this final 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.680
 the first week the record was broken is 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.510
 the sound anec has scored three goals in two 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.609
 minutes and 56 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.949
 the guy now owns the record of hits 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.800
 get faster in the history of 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.020
 barclays premier league then a record 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.910
 there he probably comes in the team of 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.260
 week up because he got 3 1 in a rout 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.270
 anyone at all 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.489
 another guy broke kevin records of 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.469
 bruno bruno was there and broke the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.809
 Record of highest number of assists 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.489
 in fact butt of history 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.530
 history is not a season of 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.300
 bundesliga is another record because I 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.789
 I'm saying that, I used to not 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.590
 release both record break 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.840
 doing this year so I guess 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.030
 they should seize this moment and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.489
 cast several cards of this type other 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.040
 face that must break a record in the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.439
 final of the champions league is xavi the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.560
 xavi is tied at a time like 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.939
 face number one of more presence in games 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.009
 from the league of champions 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.900
 so he steps on the field in the final 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.540
 so barcelona will face the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.880
 youth he saw the number 1 in the world of 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.040
 league history of champions with more 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.080
 times appeared in the field 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.710
 Another cool guy there for people with 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.259
 Brasileirada is diego alves o diego 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.450
 alves is currently tied with 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.549
 the highest number of penalties defended in 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.549
 Spanish league history without defending 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.090
 One more penalty, she goes there and appears 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.649
 also on top there another one that is a bit 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.509
 more difficult but it would be very 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.329
 people see the guy broke a record 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.820
 is also the vitti job and awarded 20 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.710
 He has three goals at the moment. 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.170
 less than the highest scorer of the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.460
 psg history not it was there i went there and 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.259
 made three goals 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.030
 the guy in ducks he makes four goals 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.649
 it passes will hardly pass only have 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.750
 one more game to make him hardly 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.459
 It will make four civilians and four people 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.110
 already have the iff of it might come 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.420
 record break I'm talking about this 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.970
 because there you are releasing many houses 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.160
 still coming 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.110
 sell packages as hell then they are 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.980
 very different letters that are 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.590
 interesting if they arrive in fifa if there 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.200
 had used this trick there in the 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.210
 we might start coming to diego costa 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.250
 and Diego Costa had the best start of the 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.990
 history of any player 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.480
 At what time do you get fucking goal? 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.900
 in the first games there was no such 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.430
 kind of letter was not so common yet and 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.650
 he ran out of this 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.930
 another guy I'd like to see one 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.270
 remember well that is the general cerrado 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.820
 deserves a record break just because it is 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.800
 a guy who spent most in the history of 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.440
 But we know it's not like this. 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.410
 that works then it may be that there it is 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.400
 fits a riocard for him by 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.840
 all that he did in the history of the book 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.180
 profile jewelry and liked the video of your 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.130
 Judgment, you like this quickness. 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.600
 here I only speak a quick talk 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.370
 to leave you inside everything 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.740
 who's been rolling in the ultimate team since 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.600
 negative if you do not like my 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.600
 information is coming
