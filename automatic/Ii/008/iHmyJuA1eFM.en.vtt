00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.180 

the<00:00:01.390> reason<00:00:01.750> I<00:00:01.870> love<00:00:02.110> the<00:00:02.260> you<00:00:02.350> VAR<00:00:02.560> is<00:00:02.800> that

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:03.190 
the reason I love the you VAR is that

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.160 
the reason I love the you VAR is that
well<00:00:03.970> compared<00:00:04.240> to<00:00:04.270> other<00:00:04.480> universities<00:00:04.750> it's

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.170 
well compared to other universities it's

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.690 
well compared to other universities it's
not<00:00:05.319> one<00:00:05.529> of<00:00:05.559> the<00:00:05.649> smaller<00:00:05.920> universities<00:00:06.490> and

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:06.700 
not one of the smaller universities and

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.160 
not one of the smaller universities and
some<00:00:06.819> of<00:00:07.059> the<00:00:07.120> larger<00:00:07.420> ones<00:00:07.599> it's<00:00:07.930> somewhere

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
some of the larger ones it's somewhere

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.329 
some of the larger ones it's somewhere
in<00:00:08.260> the<00:00:08.320> middle<00:00:08.530> so<00:00:08.559> what<00:00:08.830> you<00:00:08.889> get<00:00:09.040> is<00:00:09.129> a<00:00:09.160> nice

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:09.339 
in the middle so what you get is a nice

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:11.850 
in the middle so what you get is a nice
balance<00:00:09.549> between<00:00:09.849> a<00:00:10.780> large<00:00:11.230> University<00:00:11.530> where

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
balance between a large University where

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.799 
balance between a large University where
you<00:00:11.950> get<00:00:12.040> diversity<00:00:12.580> among<00:00:12.700> students<00:00:13.150> and<00:00:13.419> a

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
you get diversity among students and a

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.209 
you get diversity among students and a
smaller<00:00:14.110> University<00:00:14.620> where<00:00:14.799> you're<00:00:14.950> getting

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
smaller University where you're getting

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.640 
smaller University where you're getting
a<00:00:15.400> nice<00:00:15.940> community<00:00:16.180> feel<00:00:16.420> that<00:00:17.109> balance<00:00:17.529> is

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
a nice community feel that balance is

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.900 
a nice community feel that balance is
very<00:00:17.710> unique<00:00:18.189> to<00:00:18.369> the<00:00:18.460> U<00:00:18.550> bar

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910

and also it's unique to Regina so that's

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.140
