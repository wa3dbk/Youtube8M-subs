00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 welcome to this faq kirby number 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.690
 Do you like the bike difficult to 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.189
 answer this question since I 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.719
 have never done good the question is 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.309
 quite simple how are you organizing for 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.080
 play games especially with the job 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.820
 because I have a lot of consoles but 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.800
 I have not much time well are 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.210
 the time I have is learning to 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.880
 finish the job if I'm not too 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.789
 tired I'm doing a video on youtube and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.560
 after for the chosen game down I see this 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.210
 that kind of life that's all if you had a 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.769
 day do a video interview of a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.269
 great video game designer that would be 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.949
 which 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.540
 I personally 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.000
 video game designers I will not be 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.440
 too try what that will be a report 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 with technical questions and I 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.270
 I'm not too stall on it I 'll be more 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.230
 tried to interview doublers of 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.000
 video game characters 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.289
 I will not ask any questions you do not 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.300
 never take them too bad for 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.489
 do you smoke I've never 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.770
 touched to the cigarette of my life 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.390
 guindo health saving time money saving 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.590
 what do you think of xbox one for 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.789
 the moment of the content of the new 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.800
 microsoft console 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.989
 I am satisfied for the moment after 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.789
 that apples my opinion will depend on 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.739
 future outputs of this console when 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.450
 the 98 kate world cup was in the process 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.700
 to do at that moment if you talk about 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.470
 the final 98 way this is the only moment 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.630
 which I remember and stopped 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.970
 in the family posted to near 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.020
 marseille and we are looking at 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.759
 the match simply 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.830
 do you plan to meet subscribers 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.320
 out of the conventions and well I thought 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.970
 maybe a little day 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.259
 on the side of lyon you plan to do 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.270
 something for fifty thousand 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.530
 subscribers oh no I have nothing planned for them 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.210
 fifty thousand men by cons one 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.640
 very special video for the 5000 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.350
 subscribers the minotaur striptease yes 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.000
 what is the probability of being 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.619
 kill by an activist armed with an anvil 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.240
 falling from the sky with a doha parachute 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.579
 and candy pink fumigants all in 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.259
 firefighters holding 0% the 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.610
 minotaurs it does not exist it comes 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.829
 of Greek mythology and in 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.960
 mythologies there is the word mito you think 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.000
 take pay day 2 on ps3 for ta 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.369
 sony community fully paid for 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.380
 two youngsters love on the a36 so 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.270
 I will necessarily get it for the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 ps3 when will a project with youtuber 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.540
 other than those of your surroundings to such 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.420
 that conqueyrac would be idiots or 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.280
 other equally friendly poor 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.930
 that's the question maybe for 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.429
 you travel super well when I saw your 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.170
 super nes collection I was frankly 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.520
 impressed the problem is that the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.120
 youtube that you quoted me are on the side 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.950
 Of March 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.450
 and I'm for now I'm not 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.890
 too tempted to make a lot of tapes 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.450
 to meet irl 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.250
 I see you do a lot of live 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.030
 are real fusion so and that turns I 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.500
 preferred cold sweat 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.790
 not at all a good favorite game on 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.290
 roanne for now it's killer 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.549
 instinct that it tells you against me 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.049
 on killer instinct that prepares your 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.459
 joystick we'll do it right now 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.709
 how did you become known on 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.599
 youtube has been like that since the beginning 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.019
 2008 that I make videos for my 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.190
 youtube channel and well at the beginning I 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.650
 set records for the video game and 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.230
 that was not what started me it was 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.430
 an old 360 collection video 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.140
 hours it was this one that had me 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.209
 booster is what money earned thanks 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.430
 to youtube makes it possible to compensate t jaz of 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.629
 video game purchases yes of course but to 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.940
 the base this youtube money 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.160
 I used it to invest in gear 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.560
 for example reflexes that you see the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.840
 microphone who is above knows the stuff 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.010
 light is also thanks to the money 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.269
 youtube i was able to buy a new pc 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.700
 for when videos with your brother 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.290
 twin for soon we planned to 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.299
 do several because especially he 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.920
 who when he noticed that a 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.870
 part of the most viewed videos of 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.280
 youtube machines are actually videos 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.900
 that I did in the company of my 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.849
 brother necessarily we will make others 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.919
 are you going to shut up when you see your 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.190
 profile picture will not have homework 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.019
 to do 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.489
 you can tell my home come I have 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.500
 said mounir no problem you me 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.980
 say will you do live live on 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.660
 Youtube 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.459
 I do not see the interest I already use 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.650
 twitch what do you think when his 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.599
 guarantee it will be on ps4 and not on xbox 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.310
 on a good reason again 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.629
 to get me a ps4 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.609
 why not people line with 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.560
 subscribers times I think of hell 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.579
 car bought watchdog as soon as I 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.349
 find cheap in attic lives 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.209
 what was your favorite convention among 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.400
 all the ones you did not 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.829
 hard to say to answer this 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.379
 question since the conventions and well 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.900
 they change from one year to another 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.669
 gold already in terms of content quality 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.709
 for example I tell you bullshit in 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.959
 2010 at my favorite convention it'll be 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.699
 the japan expo in 2011 is going to be japan 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.030
 touch in 2012 that with the paris games 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.250
 weekend 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.199
 it's not at all that but for the year 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.239
 2014 was the paris games week already 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.889
 I was disappointed with the japan expo while 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.840
 japan expo it was my convention 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.519
 prefer previous years 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.199
 it changes so much that difficult to 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.320
 answer your question and you're a fan of 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.540
 bruce who is 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.270
 bruce lee chan am not a big adept 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.410
 but I like the movie the fury of 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.940
 defeat and the fury of the dragon 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.020
 when you continue your career of 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.940
 youtube hours as long as it works 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.170
 why stop how old you wanted 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.240
 start your videos 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.560
 bah when I was very young I 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.350
 I was already having fun making videos with the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.980
 camera my uncle so I was I had 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.940
 to be 11 12 years old my desire to really 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.220
 make videos of them post on 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.230
 low internet it was in late 2007 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.330
 do you suck lollipops or the 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.400
 big question because it makes a 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.930
 big moment that I knew above 7 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.790
 well over 15 years ago I am more 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.880
 attracted by that by cons I prefer 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.020
 another thing minotaur who comes through there 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.970
 what do you think of being in on 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.140
 basically stream what happens to live 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.550
 100 years we get up when the wish is 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.530
 came looking for him and this happens to 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.790
 a lot of American streamer I saw 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.770
 that and frankly the rats have us 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.810
 really that to football but frankly 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.990
 I pity them the American streamer and 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.460
 biblical also frankly I'm 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.890
 I will feel it badly in their place 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.570
 but I expect you are in a vacuum 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.940
 attic, you have 5 euros left 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.170
 seldom I always have reservations but 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.690
 It could happen 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:26.140
 you see there is a ps4 a neo geo 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.870
 aes and a magnavox odyssey which i 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.400
 take well already if I see a ps4 to 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.400
 5 euros I will ask myself a lot of 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.830
 questions in terms of the quality of the 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.270
 console that I think it's a 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.280
 console a leaf that there is a bug and 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.110
 I will be more tempted to neogeo 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.880
 because it is quite possible to 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.230
 find a way out in the usa 5 hours in 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.840
 an empty granaries killer instinct or 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.670
 mortal kombat on super nintendo who have 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.260
 an instinct and after mental for me and 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.550
 my door now low and killer 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.010
 instinct that although I have not yet 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.610
 played at the tenth of mint a fight he 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.380
 is not out yet 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.480
 you prefer super smash bros 3 ds or wii 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.370
 or smash bros at the base it's played on 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.900
 consoles so version wii here you are 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.240
 it's over for this thirteenth episode 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.800
 in my faq kirby do not hesitate to 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.250
 follow my facebook because that's 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.560
 enough 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.120
 it is in this platform that I 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.030
 am going to put a message for me 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.490
 warn of the next faq where it will be necessary 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.830
 ask your questions the next will be 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.930
 for I do not know the least a month in 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.220
 two months it will depend less like 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.220
 usually at the next
