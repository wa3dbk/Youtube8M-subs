 hello to all of you guys and find yourself today 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.730
 as you can see we are in the company of 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.200
 schumi me night we thank hotel for 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.790
 provided it to us very quickly 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.190
 you will find the link for the purchase in 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.830
 description if you want guarantee from italy 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.900
 advice for the nodes just com site 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.870
 sure that it sells devices 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.770
 important from ai valgo many have me 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.510
 asked for a hands on 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.000
 first impressions on this device 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.610
 I'm not used to doing because I like it 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.220
 test devices and give impressions 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.620
 complete and precise, however, he gave the 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.960
 numerous request I decided to make one 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.700
 sgarro this time to tell you about you 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.579
 see how this device 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.770
 after 24 hours of use and how I got there 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.770
 found myself at least for now giving the 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.239
 impressions with these first uses 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.559
 obviously I can't give impressions 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.989
 precise that I will give in a few days the 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.620
 full review but something i can 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.180
 tell 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.340
 no more talk then we move on to 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.329
 our device size will tell you 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.819
 immediately that it holds enough 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.639
 well but it's a nice device so it is 

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:15.259
 nice big to tell you is an iphone 6 

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:17.450
 plus with a slightly more screen 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.539
 big but that holds pretty well 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.009
 thanks to the rounding we have on 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.689
 back cover exactly back here 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.729
 compared instead to my 4 that was 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.950
 completely stiff they ask me if there 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.569
 frame is easily scratched I am 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.630
 using for a day and I have to say that the 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:35.450
 frame is all intact by marrying without 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.770
 cover so it is not in my opinion is it 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.420
 same material as my four then 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.740
 it's not so fragile I show you the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.219
 differences in size compared to a 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.139
 iphone 6 with cover and see that the 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.639
 but there is actually a difference 

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:47.929
 also of screen in how many the screen is 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:51.529
 great and practically like the 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:53.959
 device then a device that is 

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:55.819
 a fa black dual sim then as he said 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.009
 I married this thing with a sim 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.060
 Swiss an Italian ensemble so e 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.630
 see that I get the 4g with vodafone 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.399
 I remember going to see the 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.229
 frequency characteristics because 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.999
 it seems to me that the 800 is not there but of 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.800
 this then we will talk about it better in one 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.260
 full review in a few days 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.240
 just really beautiful screen 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.160
 although I have noticed that tilting it 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.260
 screen especially on whites 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.840
 let's say let's pass a 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.790
 color to fade the economy color 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.480
 was coming to the end I'll show you if you are 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.570
 he can show you this thing on the fly 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.220
 so let's get the palettes of the 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.200
 colors but these then remember that them 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.600
 let 's see the full review you see 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.640
 on blacks it doesn't change that much 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.010
 tends slightly to blue but after one 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.800
 nice inclination while on whites 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.730
 I think it's slightly more accentuated 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.880
 this thing then tends will tend 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.700
 especially laterally in gray 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.440
 arrogance to the bulletin however is not then 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.030
 a defect so obvious in use 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.340
 normal you will not realize this 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.030
 what if not someone and white pages of 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.750
 browser 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.970
 regarding the reception 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.620
 so much better than mi 4 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.020
 the speakers are also improving a lot 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.550
 really impressive I do 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.230
 hearing a random song like it 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.920
 entails what made me wrong 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.920
 we open spotify 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.450
 you can hear we have two cases 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.730
 monstrous this to the first thing that 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.980
 I noticed so much that taking a picture 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.440
 miss scared by the power of shooting 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.129
 the power of the shutter sound 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.790
 camera that also improves here 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:43.180
 very fast during commissioning 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.110
 rapid fire and break- in still 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.730
 faster 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.950
 the photos are very good indeed 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.470
 better than mi4 second also me 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.280
 if doing a couple of tests and yesterday I have 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:57.489
 noticed that the problem remains a little 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.220
 all have android to shoot 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.040
 a bit too heaven so for example 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.980
 see here you can see the clouds though 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.569
 it is not as detailed as for example can 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.670
 be a photo with an iphone so if 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.900
 we focus the background burn us 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.730
 a little the sky this for a while 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.170
 problem of all the android I have to say 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.510
 that anyway as a camera is me 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.340
 I have already said how much I like receiving reception 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.889
 which has improved a lot of camera 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.400
 better enough audio in headphones and 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.320
 speaker improves a lot of portability 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.210
 obviously gets worse because we have a 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.620
 bigger device and so if 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.690
 we want bigger display must 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.070
 however worsen the portability for 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.990
 be a black fa we have a 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.190
 very good portability is slippery like 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.510
 my 4 because we have the same 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.979
 materials but having the side bands 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.530
 blunt you can hold it 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.810
 quite well and also very thin and 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.570
 it is also quite light so a 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.310
 device that surely knows the fact 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.139
 his 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.919
 we say that it is also convenient 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:59.590
 possibility to put the mode one 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.740
 hand if we are left-handed on the left if 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.050
 we are right on here I can not m 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.880
 ok on the right you see it works a lot too 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.320
 well 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.550
 what else to say this is a little mine 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.590
 first hands on I must say that I am 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.010
 finding it very well after 24 hours of 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.900
 utilization 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.539
 the battery still can't tell I can 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.490
 tell you that as a first full charge 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.430
 the 0 to 100 took about three hours 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.740
 three and a half hours so very slow for 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.360
 to discharge you I will let you know in the next ones 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.280
 days now i'm testing with sim 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.380
 primary so we'll go a bit to see 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.840
 how it actually behaves 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.580
 in everyday use 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.840
 one thing I noticed with the firmware 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.350
 Chinese because it has not yet come out 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.980
 multilanguage 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.690
 that the gps in closed places does not fix 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.280
 so this is a bit the problem I have 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.080
 at this time, however, outdoors yesterday 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.760
 I tested in the street it works great 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.310
 instead therefore no kind of problem 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.569
 then in use but this will come 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:55.389
 hopefully solved Friday with the release of 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.979
 new firmware and hopefully it will come out soon 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.159
 lollipop because I want to see it right 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:02.080
 on this schumi well a fable ii me 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.629
 really successful I look forward to 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.270
 try the pro as soon as it comes out because it will have 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:08.740
 we have nothing impressive 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.770
 nfc on the device 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.449
 but we have lte but then the 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.759
 main features I remember the 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.619
 we'll see in the full review 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:19.479
 brightness sensor works fine 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:21.279
 and keys works very well responsiveness 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.569
 much better than device 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:24.669
 mi4 despite having the same 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:27.550
 processor in my opinion is the software on 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:30.129
 this minot has been edited yet in 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.020
 more in depth and therefore if 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:34.240
 manage to give greater fluidity 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.430
 also to our device 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.199
 well this was a little to our in 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.430
 our first impressions after 24 hours of 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.349
 utilization 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.180
 I hope I have done something pleasant 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:44.649
 since you asked me many 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.879
 hello to all guys from daniele for 

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:47.879
 hi tech space
