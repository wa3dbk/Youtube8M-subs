tip that looks like this basically we're

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.980 
tip that looks like this basically we're
going<00:00:20.410> to<00:00:20.470> apply<00:00:20.860> pressure<00:00:21.160> and<00:00:21.550> go<00:00:21.730> in<00:00:22.000> the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
going to apply pressure and go in the

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.349 
going to apply pressure and go in the
horseshoe<00:00:23.349> motion<00:00:24.039> and<00:00:24.849> every<00:00:25.029> time<00:00:25.240> you

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
horseshoe motion and every time you

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.700 
horseshoe motion and every time you
apply<00:00:25.599> pressure<00:00:25.840> when<00:00:26.080> you<00:00:26.170> go<00:00:26.259> up<00:00:26.470> you're

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
apply pressure when you go up you're

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.960 
apply pressure when you go up you're
going<00:00:26.800> to<00:00:26.859> release<00:00:27.130> pressure<00:00:27.369> when<00:00:27.699> you<00:00:27.789> come

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
going to release pressure when you come

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.810 
going to release pressure when you come
down<00:00:28.000> so<00:00:28.900> here<00:00:29.050> we<00:00:29.170> go<00:00:32.340> we're<00:00:33.340> making<00:00:33.670> these

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
to be at a 30-degree angle about and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.490 
to be at a 30-degree angle about and
your<00:01:04.790> tip<00:01:05.030> is<00:01:05.150> actually<00:01:05.660> not<00:01:05.810> ever<00:01:06.050> touching

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
your tip is actually not ever touching

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.900 
your tip is actually not ever touching
the<00:01:06.590> cake<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.010> I'm<00:01:07.070> going<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.310> show<00:01:07.460> this<00:01:07.700> from

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
the cake so I'm going to show this from

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:18.490 
the cake so I'm going to show this from
the<00:01:08.000> backside

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.650 

put<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.160> tip<00:01:19.340> angle<00:01:19.760> when<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.000> comes<00:01:20.360> out<00:01:20.510> is

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
put the tip angle when it comes out is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:27.070 
put the tip angle when it comes out is
at<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.840> 45<00:01:21.080> degree<00:01:21.650> angle<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:26.600> motion<00:01:26.960> we're

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
at a 45 degree angle the motion we're

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.100 
at a 45 degree angle the motion we're
going<00:01:27.230> to<00:01:27.290> use<00:01:27.410> is<00:01:27.560> like<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.710> horseshoe<00:01:28.750> up<00:01:29.750> and

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
going to use is like a horseshoe up and

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.290 
going to use is like a horseshoe up and
down<00:01:30.260> like<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.440> rainbow<00:01:30.770> up<00:01:30.980> and<00:01:31.250> down<00:01:31.580> and<00:01:32.180> when

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
down like a rainbow up and down and when

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.410 
down like a rainbow up and down and when
you<00:01:32.330> go<00:01:32.480> up<00:01:32.690> you<00:01:32.750> apply<00:01:33.200> pressure<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:33.890> then<00:01:34.640> as

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
you go up you apply pressure and then as

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.490 
you go up you apply pressure and then as
you're<00:01:35.600> coming<00:01:35.750> down<00:01:35.840> you're<00:01:36.110> releasing

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
you're coming down you're releasing

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.460 
you're coming down you're releasing
pressure<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:37.760> it's<00:01:37.940> similar<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.900> like<00:01:39.050> yoga

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
pressure so it's similar to like yoga

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.890 
pressure so it's similar to like yoga
breathing<00:01:39.850> inhale<00:01:40.850> exhale<00:01:41.420> we're<00:01:41.660> going<00:01:41.810> to

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
breathing inhale exhale we're going to

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.190 
breathing inhale exhale we're going to
push<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.920> then<00:01:43.220> release<00:01:43.750> pushing<00:01:44.750> release<00:01:44.990> so

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
push and then release pushing release so

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.859 
push and then release pushing release so
here<00:01:45.350> we<00:01:45.440> go<00:01:45.560> first<00:01:46.520> pedal<00:01:46.760> up<00:01:47.480> down<00:01:48.490> up<00:01:49.490> now<00:01:50.330> my

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
here we go first pedal up down up now my

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.730 
here we go first pedal up down up now my
tip<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.260> actually<00:01:51.500> not<00:01:52.040> touching<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.640> cake

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
tip is actually not touching the cake

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.560 
tip is actually not touching the cake
we're<00:01:54.740> going<00:01:54.920> up<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.520> down<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:59.270> then<00:01:59.450> to
