00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
immediate feel to me and I was trying to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.230 
immediate feel to me and I was trying to
make<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.930> baton<00:01:12.350> out<00:01:12.710> of<00:01:12.909> hardwood<00:01:13.909> so<00:01:14.120> it

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
make the baton out of hardwood so it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.910 
make the baton out of hardwood so it
lasts<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.690> while<00:01:14.870> and<00:01:15.110> also<00:01:15.440> it's<00:01:15.530> got<00:01:15.680> pretty

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
lasts a while and also it's got pretty

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.190 
lasts a while and also it's got pretty
good<00:01:15.979> weight<00:01:16.330> this<00:01:17.330> one's<00:01:17.570> a<00:01:17.659> little<00:01:17.810> long<00:01:18.170> to

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
good weight this one's a little long to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.010 
good weight this one's a little long to
be<00:01:18.620> strictly<00:01:19.070> a<00:01:19.190> baton<00:01:19.670> but<00:01:19.970> I've<00:01:20.600> made<00:01:20.870> it

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
be strictly a baton but I've made it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.580 
be strictly a baton but I've made it
into<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.320> digging<00:01:21.620> stick<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:26.170> also<00:01:27.170> something

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
into a digging stick and also something

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.210 
into a digging stick and also something
of<00:01:27.800> a<00:01:27.920> self-defense<00:01:28.610> tool<00:01:29.080> but<00:01:30.080> anyway<00:01:30.740> this

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
of a self-defense tool but anyway this

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.990 
of a self-defense tool but anyway this
is<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.870> way<00:01:32.870> to<00:01:32.930> take<00:01:33.230> down<00:01:33.260> a<00:01:33.790> fairly<00:01:34.790> large

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
is a way to take down a fairly large

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.600 
is a way to take down a fairly large
tree<00:01:35.510> this<00:01:35.990> one<00:01:36.290> being<00:01:36.530> about<00:01:36.830> perfect<00:01:37.430> in

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
tree this one being about perfect in

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.350 
tree this one being about perfect in
height<00:01:37.880> or<00:01:38.560> diameter<00:01:39.580> being<00:01:40.580> about<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:40.940> wrist

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
height or diameter being about a wrist

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.770 
height or diameter being about a wrist
and<00:01:41.780> that's<00:01:42.770> usually<00:01:43.040> as<00:01:43.460> big<00:01:43.730> a<00:01:43.760> bigotry<00:01:44.660> as

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
and that's usually as big a bigotry as

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.750 
and that's usually as big a bigotry as
you<00:01:44.960> want<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.260> try<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.590> tackle<00:01:45.800> on<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.130> survival

you want to try and tackle on a survival

00:01:46.760 --> 00:02:33.520 
you want to try and tackle on a survival
situation

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:55.900 

I<00:02:38.350> want<00:02:39.350> to<00:02:39.440> trim<00:02:39.680> it

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:09.610 

meant<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.690> keep<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.080> up<00:02:57.290> there

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.089 

anyway<00:03:10.519> you<00:03:10.580> get<00:03:10.849> the<00:03:10.909> idea<00:03:13.269> small<00:03:14.269> knife

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
anyway you get the idea small knife

anyway you get the idea small knife
largest<00:03:16.099> tree<00:03:16.629> and<00:03:17.629> this<00:03:17.810> is<00:03:18.019> as<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.560> say<00:03:18.799> about

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
largest tree and this is as I say about

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.380 
largest tree and this is as I say about
as<00:03:19.190> big<00:03:19.370> as<00:03:19.489> you're<00:03:19.610> ever<00:03:19.730> going<00:03:19.940> to<00:03:20.000> need<00:03:20.239> to

do in a survival situation if you're in
the<00:03:24.260> southeast<00:03:25.269> this<00:03:26.269> is<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.510> tulip<00:03:27.230> poplar

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
the southeast this is a tulip poplar

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.270 
the southeast this is a tulip poplar
very<00:03:29.360> distinctive<00:03:30.019> leaf<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:31.720> get<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.900> know<00:03:32.930> it

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
very distinctive leaf and get to know it

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.330 
very distinctive leaf and get to know it
if<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.579> chop<00:03:34.849> down<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.120> small<00:03:35.480> one<00:03:35.690> of<00:03:35.810> these

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
if you chop down a small one of these

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.050 
if you chop down a small one of these
there'll<00:03:37.340> be<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.549> replacement<00:03:38.329> in<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:39.590> year<00:03:40.060> this

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
there'll be a replacement in a year this

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.440 
there'll be a replacement in a year this
tree<00:03:41.360> is<00:03:41.390> probably<00:03:41.780> four<00:03:42.319> or<00:03:42.349> five<00:03:42.709> years<00:03:42.739> old

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
tree is probably four or five years old

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.509 
tree is probably four or five years old
so<00:03:44.450> you're<00:03:44.660> really<00:03:44.840> not<00:03:45.400> causing<00:03:46.400> the

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
so you're really not causing the

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.539 
so you're really not causing the
environment<00:03:47.120> very<00:03:47.329> much<00:03:48.099> also<00:03:49.099> it's<00:03:49.280> very

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
environment very much also it's very

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.449 
environment very much also it's very
soft<00:03:49.790> it's<00:03:50.420> stiff<00:03:50.750> enough<00:03:51.129> to<00:03:52.129> build<00:03:52.310> a

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
soft it's stiff enough to build a
