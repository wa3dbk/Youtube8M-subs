00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.770 
takes it in and then that young person
looks<00:02:04.140> me<00:02:04.259> right<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> eye<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.600> see

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
looks me right in the eye and I can see

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.190 
looks me right in the eye and I can see
that<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.050> doing<00:02:07.170> something<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.710> them

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
that it's doing something to them

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.210

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.630 
they're making an agreement with their
future<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:13.650> think<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> second<00:02:14.340> favorite

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
future and I think the second favorite

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.330 
future and I think the second favorite
moments<00:02:15.030> for<00:02:15.180> me<00:02:15.209> or<00:02:15.390> after<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.780> program

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
moments for me or after the program

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.290 
moments for me or after the program
because<00:02:17.340> after<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.730> program<00:02:17.910> here<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300

hallway for about the last 30 minutes I

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.030 
hallway for about the last 30 minutes I
had<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.730> chance<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.150> be<00:02:21.239> right<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:21.860> with<00:02:22.860> some

had a chance to be right here with some

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.880 
had a chance to be right here with some
incredible<00:02:23.550> human<00:02:23.760> beings<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:25.500> didn't<00:02:25.830> know

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
incredible human beings that didn't know

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.370 
incredible human beings that didn't know
how<00:02:26.010> incredible<00:02:26.370> they<00:02:26.550> really<00:02:26.760> were<00:02:27.380> right

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
how incredible they really were right

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.830 
how incredible they really were right
and<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:29.040> be<00:02:29.160> able<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.430> share<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> moment<00:02:30.630> with

and to be able to share a moment with
them<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> think<00:02:31.470> could<00:02:31.590> leave<00:02:31.799> a<00:02:31.830> deposit

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
them that I think could leave a deposit

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.850 
them that I think could leave a deposit
in<00:02:32.370> their<00:02:32.459> life<00:02:33.290> what<00:02:34.290> do<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.380> think<00:02:34.470> was<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
in their life what do you think was the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.470 
in their life what do you think was the
hardest<00:02:35.220> part<00:02:35.519> about<00:02:35.640> getting<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.120> program

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
hardest part about getting the program

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.350 
hardest part about getting the program
started

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
started

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.660 
started
I<00:02:39.360> think<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.990> hardest<00:02:40.260> part<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:41.010> getting<00:02:41.550> this

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
I think the hardest part of getting this

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.640 
I think the hardest part of getting this
program<00:02:42.060> launched<00:02:42.420> was<00:02:42.630> trying<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.380> take<00:02:43.500> an

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
program launched was trying to take an

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.970 
program launched was trying to take an
idea<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.100> was<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.310> my<00:02:44.460> head<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:44.910> in<00:02:45.300> my<00:02:45.330> heart

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
idea that was in my head and in my heart

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.890 
idea that was in my head and in my heart
that<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.040> knew<00:02:47.310> could<00:02:47.550> be<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.820> whole<00:02:48.360> new<00:02:48.600> level

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that I knew could be a whole new level

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.500 
that I knew could be a whole new level
of<00:02:49.490> experience<00:02:50.490> in<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.060> school<00:02:51.270> assembly

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
of experience in a school assembly

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.970 
of experience in a school assembly
program<00:02:51.960> I<00:02:52.050> don't<00:02:52.200> think<00:02:52.380> any<00:02:52.530> program<00:02:52.830> like

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
program I don't think any program like

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.860 
program I don't think any program like
this<00:02:53.010> exists<00:02:53.550> in<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> country<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.660> try<00:02:54.780> to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
this exists in the country so to try to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.200 
this exists in the country so to try to
explain<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.620> people<00:02:55.880> what<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.000> could<00:02:57.180> be

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
explain that to people what it could be

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.140 
explain that to people what it could be
and<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.990> them<00:02:58.140> get<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:59.280> know<00:02:59.460> what<00:02:59.940> was

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.660 
and have them get it you know what was
not<00:03:00.300> an<00:03:00.420> easy<00:03:00.540> task<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:02.340> was<00:03:02.460> that<00:03:02.610> was

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
not an easy task that was that was

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.910 
not an easy task that was that was
difficult<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:04.050> know<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.260> last<00:03:04.410> 10<00:03:04.770> weeks
