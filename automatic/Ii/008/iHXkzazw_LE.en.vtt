00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.840 

ok<00:00:05.200> the<00:00:05.319> next<00:00:05.350> book<00:00:05.740> algorithm<00:00:06.250> in<00:00:06.370> a<00:00:06.399> gay<00:00:06.609> bar

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850 
ok the next book algorithm in a gay bar

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.680 
ok the next book algorithm in a gay bar
is<00:00:07.090> this<00:00:07.360> one<00:00:07.860> but<00:00:08.860> if<00:00:09.130> you<00:00:09.340> remember<00:00:09.879> in<00:00:10.090> the

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
is this one but if you remember in the

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.090 
is this one but if you remember in the
one<00:00:10.900> of<00:00:10.960> the<00:00:11.020> previous<00:00:11.170> videos<00:00:11.619> when<00:00:11.830> I<00:00:11.860> said

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100 
one of the previous videos when I said

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.340 
one of the previous videos when I said
if<00:00:12.219> you<00:00:12.309> like<00:00:12.520> this<00:00:12.760> one<00:00:13.030> then<00:00:13.930> the<00:00:14.080> algorithm

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.350 
if you like this one then the algorithm

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.079 
if you like this one then the algorithm
will<00:00:14.770> lead<00:00:15.010> into<00:00:15.280> at<00:00:15.969> least<00:00:16.029> two<00:00:16.510> more<00:00:18.089> well

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:19.089 
will lead into at least two more well

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.390 
will lead into at least two more well
this<00:00:19.480> is<00:00:19.750> probably<00:00:20.230> the<00:00:20.410> fourth<00:00:20.830> Calgary<00:00:21.279> room

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
this is probably the fourth Calgary room

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.349 
this is probably the fourth Calgary room
that<00:00:21.580> leads<00:00:21.820> into<00:00:22.060> by<00:00:22.539> now<00:00:22.750> but<00:00:24.089> the<00:00:25.089> length<00:00:25.300> of

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
that leads into by now but the length of

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.880 
that leads into by now but the length of
the<00:00:25.480> big<00:00:25.630> big<00:00:25.929> in<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.140> description<00:00:26.679> to<00:00:26.859> learn

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
the big big in the description to learn

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.370 
the big big in the description to learn
this<00:00:27.189> one<00:00:27.400> if<00:00:27.580> you<00:00:27.669> haven't<00:00:27.999> already<00:00:28.169> but<00:00:29.169> just

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
this one if you haven't already but just

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.440 
this one if you haven't already but just
to<00:00:29.470> go<00:00:29.619> over<00:00:29.650> quickly<00:00:29.949> again<00:00:31.290> it<00:00:32.290> is<00:00:32.439> are<00:00:33.450> you

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
to go over quickly again it is are you

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.260 
to go over quickly again it is are you
to<00:00:34.780> our<00:00:35.309> prime<00:00:36.309> and<00:00:36.670> so<00:00:37.660> Gemma<00:00:37.840> our<00:00:38.649> prime<00:00:39.070> F<00:00:39.370> F

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
to our prime and so Gemma our prime F F

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:49.500 
to our prime and so Gemma our prime F F
prime<00:00:40.719> you<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.890> our<00:00:42.670> prime<00:00:43.149> F<00:00:43.510> our<00:00:44.050> F<00:00:44.770> prime<00:00:48.510> now

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
prime you to our prime F our F prime now

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.830 
prime you to our prime F our F prime now
what<00:00:49.840> this<00:00:49.989> algorithm<00:00:50.350> is<00:00:50.739> is<00:00:51.160> basically<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
what this algorithm is is basically the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.029 
what this algorithm is is basically the
same<00:00:52.870> as<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:54.399> one<00:00:54.670> but<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:56.379> first<00:00:56.649> four

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
same as this one but the first four

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.340 
same as this one but the first four
moves<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:58.629> changed<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.940> how<00:01:01.089> you<00:01:01.149> hold<00:01:01.510> it<00:01:01.690> is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
moves have changed so how you hold it is

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.920 
moves have changed so how you hold it is
with<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.890> diagonal<00:01:03.519> go<00:01:03.850> on<00:01:04.000> top<00:01:04.239> left<00:01:04.570> to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
with the diagonal go on top left to

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.290 
with the diagonal go on top left to
bottom<00:01:04.960> right<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.880> got<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.120> make<00:01:07.270> sure

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
bottom right and you got to make sure

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.040 
bottom right and you got to make sure
that<00:01:07.570> there<00:01:08.020> is<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.170> 1<00:01:08.440> by<00:01:08.650> 2<00:01:08.680> yellow<00:01:09.660> bar<00:01:10.660> here

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
that there is a 1 by 2 yellow bar here

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.280 
that there is a 1 by 2 yellow bar here
or<00:01:11.440> your<00:01:11.680> top<00:01:11.890> color<00:01:12.280> here<00:01:13.020> because<00:01:14.020> if<00:01:14.170> you

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
or your top color here because if you

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.890 
or your top color here because if you
hold<00:01:14.500> it<00:01:14.650> this<00:01:14.830> way<00:01:15.150> there's<00:01:16.150> only<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.570> single

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
hold it this way there's only a single

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.950 
hold it this way there's only a single
dot<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.790> making<00:01:19.000> sure<00:01:19.150> you<00:01:19.450> hold<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:19.750> like<00:01:19.810> this

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
dot so making sure you hold it like this

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.990 
dot so making sure you hold it like this
and<00:01:22.230> it's<00:01:23.230> a<00:01:23.350> trigger<00:01:23.620> this<00:01:24.070> form<00:01:24.550> of<00:01:24.700> trigger

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
and it's a trigger this form of trigger

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.040 
and it's a trigger this form of trigger
at<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.330> start<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:27.250> is<00:01:27.460> are<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.930> are<00:01:29.710> prime<00:01:30.220> you

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
at the start it is are you are prime you

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.840 
at the start it is are you are prime you
then<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.290> same<00:01:32.590> as<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.920> previous<00:01:33.130> algorithm

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
then the same as the previous algorithm

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.680 
then the same as the previous algorithm
