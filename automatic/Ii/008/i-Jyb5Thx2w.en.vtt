00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.620
 hi friends again with you in 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:08.590
 this time I want to show you how to do 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.500
 the best review of a blunt cardboard 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.490
 which is the extreme jockey for galaxy not 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.190
 2 really is a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.880
 with very good let's start let's say 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.390
 how are they going to realize that he has 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.039
 All the appearance of stock rom with some 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.529
 improvements like for example the clock of 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:35.329
 galaxy s 4 notice that the wallpapers is 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.309
 say the wallpaper the wallpaper 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.309
 they are also those of the galaxy s 4g 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.090
 and look 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.370
 that really is very very fluid does not have 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.680
 the truth I did not find the exact one until the 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.219
 moment what has very good lumps 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.199
 for example certain configurations 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.899
 extra like for example the pit my round 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.180
 ping pairo month as enchulada mirror 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.280
 let's say we in Argentina do not say 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.100
 in this way we say tuning 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.020
 it's like you look at our rum 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.470
 but basically what that allows us 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.970
 is to improve and add and remove things that 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.049
 we have in our branch for example 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.049
 we have the cpu bo 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.280
 changer is to say that if we want to have 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.980
 a tablet format a tablet format or a 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.470
 phone format let's say if we want 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.470
 install a dual boot animation is yes 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.710
 we can install two boot animations and 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.060
 when we start the phone they leave 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.370
 they are interspersed between one and the other 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.979
 let's say for example to improve the 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.290
 gps configuration for example i direct 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:50.180
 here and I say that I am in south america and 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.640
 you can install if the local improvements 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.159
 for my gps 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.570
 I have some tweets that have to do 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:02.300
 with the system to clean the multitasking 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.720
 install some tweets to the carmel by 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.259
 example if here let's say you can install 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.769
 and that have to do with blocking 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.790
 let's say the cpu but let's say it's very 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.530
 interesting because it also has 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.319
 explanations of some extra also 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.640
 then we have tower settings the whole 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.730
 refers to this if these settings are 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.769
 here above the short cuts that we have 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.769
 up here and that allows us for example 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.280
 change positions activate and 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.170
 deactivate each of them if by 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.750
 example this to change the position what 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.490
 I can change the position and I can 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.730
 activate and deactivate so that they appear 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.730
 and disappear 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.420
 obviously we have cp he asks 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.900
 settings and what it allows us is how 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.180
 I told them to block or do not want the cpu 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.310
 obviously let's say I'm not a lover 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.150
 of the walk what in seasonal because 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.030
 really let's say it's working more 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.390
 that satisfyingly in my taste and 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.400
 then I do not find it necessary 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.890
 accelerate too much more because it consumes 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.409
 more battery and obviously makes the the 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.120
 cellular gets overheated more than 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.640
 necessary which can affect the 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.480
 functioning and obviously of some 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.160
 way to decrease the lifetime of the CPU 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.120
 which I do not think is necessary and 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.579
 look after you have many say 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.620
 faster hippie is fix or that is what I 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.900
 I told you before you choose the area 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.950
 where they are and install the properties 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.319
 of the gps what is a report in format 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.760
 txt to see the operation in case 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.030
 that there was a malfunction 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.770
 Of something 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.830
 pastor that we have already seen him the 76 the ex 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.930
 that we change the code 6 is to say the 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.360
 sales code that is what 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.940
 identifies a team with a determined 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.700
 region 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.680
 and let's say how they have for the 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.330
 sound system 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.970
 we have the ex post install and the s &amp; p there 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.110
 702 I'm interested in pretty lapse display 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.110
 settings is to change 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.979
 in density 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.250
 let's say some specific application 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:25.060
 to be in tablet format yes that's 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.979
 the display settings and the other is the 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.509
 exhibitor let's talk about that but I'm going 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.789
 to make a proper video 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:36.440
 because that allows us to transform 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:39.020
 a stock rom in a stock gaston rom yes 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.009
 but it's very easy to do it really 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.080
 it's worth dedicating a whole video to 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:48.080
 them and so then we have the city 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.870
 is existential already have a lot 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.070
 of 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.450
 additional in this branch that after 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:05:02.510
 obviously it has all the menus that already 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:05.300
 we know look android 4.1.2 and lk 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:09.680
 5 in the baseband version this 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.880
 is based if in the latest version of 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.740
 may 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:19.250
 From d 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:22.009
 of m 1 yes that is the last update 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.690
 who took samsung and does not have the channel 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.500
 stock but have as you see here the 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:30.440
 network really makes it work very well 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.770
 the equipment the battery life is 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.729
 really very good, look at yourself 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.729
 that making normal use let's say 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:44.150
 team I am not, I am not a heavy user 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:47.630
 But notice that I say 82 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:51.259
 hundred of the battery and I've been 18 hours 23 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.240
 minutes and almost a full day and still 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.669
 I have 80% battery left which makes 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.699
 the battery has a very high lifespan 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.830
 as I showed you if cpi or spice us 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.919
 View and really masters the team 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.530
 enters a fast flip that is to say that 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.440
 when the processor is on standby 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:12.139
 rest and let's say if you want to see 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.729
 say the results show we 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.900
 to make a picture really runs very 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.060
 Quick 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.699
 I'm going to show the results remember 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.180
 than with stock equipment but rooted 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:28.729
 we had got a block value 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:30.530
 of approximately 4,600 4800 if this 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.840
 team was not released or not 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.360
 they strike like this but they really have 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.120
 reptile kernel tweets make 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.310
 that the team works very smoothly and 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.960
 not be now I think the life of the 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.960
 battery is really very good 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.250
 for everyone else they will find that 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:55.600
 there were some changes in the aspects 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:59.900
 visuals is clearly a stoxx rum and 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.470
 preserve the appearance of the roll 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.910
 look 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.910
 we have a benchmark 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:14.320
 note 6,481 is our result 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:17.390
 well from our benchmark I do not know if what 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.240
 they get to see yes 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:22.040
 so it really works very well very 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.840
 cold I told them in life the battery 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.520
 not being blocked 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.889
 and it really works very well and 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.520
 obviously it has to do with the fact 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:34.979
 that the tweets are on the card and it's not 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.479
 the processor acceleration good 

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:38.580
 I hope you liked this error 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:41.460
 he left the address to download 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.560
 as they always have to be they have to 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.530
 have a caston recovery and obviously a 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:51.270
 galaxy together the instructions the 

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:53.520
 can you draw from the poster x of a of x 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:57.080
 extreme brow I hope you forget them 

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.080
 liked and see you next
