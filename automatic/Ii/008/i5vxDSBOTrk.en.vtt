00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
so I held the rope to look to the last

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.790 
so I held the rope to look to the last
second<00:01:14.270> so<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.480> can<00:01:14.600> get<00:01:14.750> speeds<00:01:15.230> it's<00:01:15.590> really

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
second so I can get speeds it's really

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.880 
second so I can get speeds it's really
hard<00:01:16.040> to<00:01:16.130> get<00:01:16.280> to<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.460> bottom<00:01:16.640> it's<00:01:16.940> way

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.480 

I<00:01:21.930> punched<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.200> go<00:01:23.380> try<00:01:24.010> and<00:01:24.130> get<00:01:24.220> up<00:01:24.310> in<00:01:24.370> the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
I punched it to go try and get up in the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.120 
I punched it to go try and get up in the
barrel<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.540> just<00:01:25.720> kind<00:01:25.960> of<00:01:26.080> crumbled<00:01:26.920> and

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
barrel and it just kind of crumbled and

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.359 
barrel and it just kind of crumbled and
landed<00:01:28.030> on<00:01:28.120> me<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.540> came<00:01:28.930> down<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.950> just<00:01:30.130> not

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
landed on me and came down and just not

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.280 
landed on me and came down and just not
a<00:01:30.520> right<00:01:30.790> on<00:01:30.940> my<00:01:31.030> shoulder<00:01:31.570> it<00:01:31.720> felt<00:01:32.050> like<00:01:32.260> a

a right on my shoulder it felt like a

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.890 
a right on my shoulder it felt like a
ton<00:01:32.619> of<00:01:32.680> bricks<00:01:32.860> but<00:01:33.520> I<00:01:33.550> saw<00:01:33.880> myself<00:01:34.150> making

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
ton of bricks but I saw myself making

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.020 
ton of bricks but I saw myself making
and<00:01:35.050> I<00:01:35.110> could<00:01:35.290> feel<00:01:35.650> that<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:36.250> was<00:01:36.460> gonna<00:01:36.700> make

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
and I could feel that I was gonna make

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.480 
and I could feel that I was gonna make
it<00:01:37.270> I<00:01:37.420> knew<00:01:37.690> I<00:01:37.720> was<00:01:38.020> making<00:01:38.440> it<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.590> I<00:01:39.160> kind<00:01:39.430> of

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
it I knew I was making it and I kind of

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.690 
it I knew I was making it and I kind of
just<00:01:39.670> cruised<00:01:40.240> right<00:01:40.390> out<00:01:40.660> to<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.900> shoulder

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.840 

when<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:45.729> rolled<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.270> that<00:01:46.869> way<00:01:47.020> I<00:01:47.380> had<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:47.890> lot

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
when I rolled that that way I had a lot

00:01:48.850 --> 00:02:03.960 
when I rolled that that way I had a lot
bigger<00:01:49.360> wave<00:01:49.630> on<00:01:49.869> my<00:01:50.020> mind<00:01:50.290> a<00:01:50.590> little<00:01:51.040> warmup
