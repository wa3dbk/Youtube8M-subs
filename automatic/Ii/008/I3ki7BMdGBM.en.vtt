00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.230
 Friends are here to record a 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.379
 video of how to clean the motorcycle chain 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.740
 phaser to clean the motorcycle chain 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:21.029
 phaser you will be needing a 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:25.980
 number 10 key and a key 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.919
 mouth number 8 a dish sponge 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.290
 but one that would on the one hand and the rough 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:36.390
 another world a sky water raz border 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.670
 this background is my dog but never to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.660
 There is no name on the team that I'm going to 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.470
 use then as I said let's have that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.340
 to clean 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.430
 for this you need to disassemble the protector 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.610
 of the pawn is where you will use the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.870
 10 and key 8 will also have to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.000
 take the gears off 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.729
 okay I needed to take this piece 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.880
 to take out the pawn protector there 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.240
 then we go to the disassembly of the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.240
 pawn 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.850
 people like the chain of the bike was 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.050
 very dirty 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.780
 I have now decided to use gasoline for 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:54.560
 take the drastic 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:57.560
 Let's see what's going on, we 're going. 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.270
 there really gasoline apparently 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.570
 It was the best 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.530
 Look, I just suggest you already left. 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.340
 you will also need a 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.480
 slit to get the coarser back 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.360
 the bottom of the pawn also needs a 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.430
 cloth and then you 'll have to 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.070
 take your bike I see the state that she 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.030
 It is but apparently giving 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.670
 result 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.060
 Let's continue cleaning up there and see the 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.060
 end result 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:47.550
 well, people, that's the clean pawn. 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.550
 clean current 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:59.480
 I'll ride it right now 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:04.420
 the washing module and I will check the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:10.820
 rock current we delay but also has 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:15.100
 a good time but got in shock people 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.100
 see you soon, it's time to lubricate 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:23.200
 Well, folks, I set the bike there. 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.239
 Now I'm going to wash it for later. 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.600
 lubricate the chain 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.860
 okay I used some methods which were in the 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.690
 Internet 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.220
 however some things were not spoken in the 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.410
 internet how to draw 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.670
 there the pedal of the clutch besides the march 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.220
 in the videoclub did not say that he had to 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.739
 take off the pawn protector 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.030
 I used gasoline that was more efficient. 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:56.480
 than the trawl nÃ© 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.540
 and also a little detergent 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.910
 after I set up the bike to get the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.340
 dirt from part parts 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.160
 So I'm cleaning the motorcycle there. 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.290
 clean and then lubricate the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.540
 with its own lubricant 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.540
 to the current what the personnel or 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:18.799
 finish washing the motorcycle there and then 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.940
 icon again with the video you already 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:27.640
 We are in the final part there. 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:31.600
 You can see there that you gave a 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:35.700
 totally clean bike 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.200
 now we are going to the final part which is what 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.620
 lubricates the chain 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.770
 I'm using a new no 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:51.070
 very appropriate that this one here but that 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:53.920
 he himself is not in the chain either. 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.700
 it is appropriate to own the motorcycle 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.920
 that bike chain would be the way but 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.350
 I did not find 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.310
 so just to finish the video I'll stay 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.110
 with this here 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.740
 who has the possibility to buy 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:12.250
 a motorcycle with the rock promoter and that 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.990
 how do we do with grease right? 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.990
 take this part here 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:29.370
 lubricates all of it even here in the 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:32.940
 part of the crown is riding the bike and one more 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.520
 A little because people hope I have 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:39.120
 helped those who want to save a little 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.660
 more your bike very soon will be 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.520
 posting another video of a 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.220
 automatic lubricator is a gambiarra 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.950
 and that the staff does also through the internet 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.680
 lubricate the ok walking bike will 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:56.760
 test and tell you but the conclusion 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:06:01.110
 It is not difficult to clean the 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:02.220
 bike is a good job but it's okay 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.920
 gratifying 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.220
 let's see the result ok until another video 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.220
 bye
