00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that Lesnar should have done earlier and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.350 
that Lesnar should have done earlier and

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
back two years and now he's finally

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.039 
back two years and now he's finally
getting<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.520> first<00:02:05.700> shot<00:02:06.000> at<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.509> titles

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
getting that first shot at the titles

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.529 
getting that first shot at the titles
but<00:02:08.009> getting<00:02:08.640> away<00:02:08.819> from<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.360> getting

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
but getting away from that and getting

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.749 
but getting away from that and getting
back<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.929> where<00:02:10.050> we're<00:02:10.229> going

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
back to where we're going

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.479 
back to where we're going
I<00:02:10.819> think<00:02:11.569> that<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:11.959> set<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:12.830> guys<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:13.400> the

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
I think that this set of guys in the

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.330 
I think that this set of guys in the
main<00:02:13.640> event<00:02:13.670> is<00:02:14.360> in<00:02:14.599> awesome<00:02:15.019> is<00:02:15.829> an<00:02:16.010> awesome

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
main event is in awesome is an awesome

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.339 
main event is in awesome is an awesome
way<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.519> do<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:16.879> get<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.150> small<00:02:17.840> taste<00:02:18.140> of

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
way to do it you get a small taste of

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.720 
way to do it you get a small taste of
Roman<00:02:18.709> reigns<00:02:18.950> going<00:02:19.310> after<00:02:19.459> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
Roman reigns going after the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.309 
Roman reigns going after the
championship<00:02:20.360> for<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.569> second<00:02:20.930> time<00:02:21.079> in<00:02:21.140> his

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
championship for the second time in his

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.130 
championship for the second time in his
career<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:22.129> do<00:02:22.879> think<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.480> much<00:02:23.720> like<00:02:23.900> with

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
career I do think that much like with

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.229 
career I do think that much like with
the<00:02:24.230> money<00:02:24.409> in<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.590> bank<00:02:24.799> i<00:02:24.980> think<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.459> he

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
the money in the bank i think that he

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.119 
the money in the bank i think that he
does<00:02:26.480> have<00:02:26.629> a<00:02:26.720> chance<00:02:27.049> to<00:02:27.290> win<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.709> never<00:02:27.920> know

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
does have a chance to win you never know

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.530 
does have a chance to win you never know
what<00:02:28.400> could<00:02:28.549> happen<00:02:28.610> once<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.150> get<00:02:29.329> in<00:02:29.420> there

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
what could happen once you get in there

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.800 
what could happen once you get in there
that's<00:02:29.930> why<00:02:30.230> they<00:02:30.500> play<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:30.829> game<00:02:31.390> but<00:02:32.390> when

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
that's why they play the game but when

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.750 
that's why they play the game but when
Roman<00:02:33.170> does<00:02:33.379> it<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.769> needs<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.129> be<00:02:34.310> in<00:02:34.579> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
Roman does it it needs to be in the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.089 
Roman does it it needs to be in the
singles<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.390> think<00:02:36.019> that<00:02:36.200> maybe<00:02:36.409> you<00:02:36.650> might<00:02:36.680> do

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
singles I think that maybe you might do

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.949 
singles I think that maybe you might do
it<00:02:37.280> if<00:02:37.459> he's<00:02:37.879> in<00:02:38.030> his<00:02:38.120> first<00:02:38.450> shot<00:02:38.750> at<00:02:38.900> the

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
it if he's in his first shot at the

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.589 
it if he's in his first shot at the
championship<00:02:39.319> he's<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:39.980> dark<00:02:40.310> horse<00:02:40.609> he<00:02:41.359> just

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
championship he's a dark horse he just

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.349 
championship he's a dark horse he just
you<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.109> wins<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.650> on<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.769> fluke<00:02:43.129> and<00:02:43.430> then

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
you just wins it on a fluke and then

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:45.930 
you just wins it on a fluke and then
you're<00:02:44.540> off<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:44.900> running<00:02:44.989> from<00:02:45.440> there<00:02:45.650> I

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
you're off and running from there I

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.190 
you're off and running from there I
think<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.090> would<00:02:47.180> have<00:02:47.299> been<00:02:47.359> a<00:02:47.420> good<00:02:47.959> way<00:02:48.140> to

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
think that would have been a good way to

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.170 
think that would have been a good way to
do<00:02:48.409> it<00:02:48.560> but<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:48.739> think<00:02:48.799> now<00:02:49.129> with<00:02:49.790> Roman<00:02:50.000> reigns

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
do it but I think now with Roman reigns

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.910 
do it but I think now with Roman reigns
it's<00:02:50.690> going<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:50.989> be<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.170> slow<00:02:51.440> build<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.889> the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
it's going to be the slow build to the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.069 
it's going to be the slow build to the
top<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.459> then<00:02:52.549> once<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.909> get<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.269> once<00:02:53.959> he

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
top and then once you get it once he

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.809 
top and then once you get it once he
gets<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.470> it's<00:02:54.620> going<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:54.829> be<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.519> know<00:02:55.609> no

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
gets it it's going to be you know no

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.280 
gets it it's going to be you know no
doubt<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.180> your<00:02:56.269> mind<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.690> Roman<00:02:57.109> reigns

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
doubt in your mind that Roman reigns

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.860 
doubt in your mind that Roman reigns
going<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.680> be<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.799> good<00:02:58.099> champion<00:02:58.870> John

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
going to be a good champion John

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.039 
going to be a good champion John
honestly<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.549> number<00:03:01.700> one<00:03:02.030> guy<00:03:02.269> you
