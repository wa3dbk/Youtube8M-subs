00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 how to do is to take on a relationship 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:18.029
 seriously operated more questions who 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:19.949
 receives a daily first thing from 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.949
 defined at the beginning of that 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.890
 relationship at the beginning of that relationship to that 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.550
 person is very important because the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.590
 rules are defined there what is the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.989
 What do you want, for example, do you know 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.489
 person what you want that 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.360
 relationship you want it to last 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.120
 You want to have fun only you want. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.300
 just have a night with the person you want 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.950
 spend a long time you want 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.200
 really just have fun if you have that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.980
 sexual attraction you can not handle is 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.110
 next what you do right from the start 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.550
 will really define the future of that 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.280
 relationship 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.980
 if you, for example, have sex with the person 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.949
 soon to face the logo at the beginning 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.979
 the first night or the second meeting 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.280
 such as happens you already go to the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.960
 drain and roll at once you have not had 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.780
 time to create that connection 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.869
 mainly the other is not 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.030
 because the woman the woman was only had only 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.670
 went to bed put she liked it 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.189
 she will be able to create some kind of 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.520
 animal is emotional connection but man 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.960
 then the man he unfortunately is 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.720
 simpler it divided into categories 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.500
 so automatically and 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.630
 unconsciously is not something that 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.740
 he makes conscious that the woman is going to 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.689
 for direct bed 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.299
 usually she goes to the category in the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.950
 his head and fun and that's what 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.049
 she will want only that he will 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.759
 want it more logical there are exceptions 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.040
 not everyone is the same 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.630
 but the great majority behave 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.340
 way and we can not stay 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.229
 based on the exceptions 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.369
 so you have to pay attention if 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.560
 You go to bed with him at the beginning. 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.619
 You can be sure that you can be sure. 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.750
 not perhaps it is a majority of the 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.069
 Men, he does not care. 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.110
 Thinking of you, you have a great 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.180
 possibility or will only want you to 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.350
 this shows the number 2 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.160
 the second tip 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.560
 to do is to take on a relationship 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.600
 serious is not all the benefits of a 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.110
 relationship just because you like the 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.510
 face 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.760
 if you have already given all the benefits of a 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.890
 relationship without it is in 1 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.920
 there it gets more complicated than it does not 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.110
 there's no incentive place to take 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.500
 nothing with you because he already had the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.690
 good part is that he will want to take over the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.490
 bad part is that mike the bad part is 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.740
 it already has all the benefits and already has 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.290
 votes and the time he wants to see if he 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.790
 Can do everything with you if you had 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.680
 his emotion would probably do the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.580
 even not wanting is not creating the part 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.280
 bad 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.310
 You certainly can not, for example, 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.950
 time that he wants to call you and that 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.110
 it is the duty of speaking yes it is logical course you 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.140
 As you run away, you stop. 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.030
 do everything you used to do and 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.900
 runs out to meet him 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.590
 sees in it he does not see a challenge a man 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.290
 it is based is it is moved on the basis of the challenge 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.750
 and it already has all the benefits 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.310
 at the beginning of that interaction all 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.620
 the benefits of a relationship in the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.690
 early admission he loses and horny 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.940
 lose interest this will not help 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.370
 You at all want nothing more than you 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.680
 You can not keep trying to please him. 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.150
 all the ways exactly because 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.670
 doing this you will be going through 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.820
 You too are insufficient. 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.590
 For goodness sake that you do not value yourself 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.720
 does not give priority to his own life 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.950
 and you are always at your disposal. 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.750
 loses value 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.270
 you lose the value it loses interest 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.420
 and it does not even get complicated at all 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.890
 good rule number 3 is to respect the 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.410
 rule of deserving 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.510
 Why is it that the car can feel the 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.720
 desire to spend more time with you 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.880
 you need to limit your time and 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.860
 benefits you 're giving him at 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.060
 beginning of that generation 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.480
 he needs to feel that he is 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.120
 conquering the space of it little by little in the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.100
 your life gradually and not that already has 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.520
 all at once 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.830
 This is how he gave a little bit to you. 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.590
 see a little of his time he takes it 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.479
 It's okay, you have to do the same. 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.630
 you can not see a person who does not 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:29.570
 is able to release the time to place 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.700
 c you do it with her if it is not a 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.700
 unfair exchange and his wife many times 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.320
 she goal she starts to until that 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.050
 emotional connection with the person 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.360
 faster than man was expected 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.670
 too, for example to several questions 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.220
 that we receive is talking about whether the 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.320
 but he says that he works too that 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.480
 He does not have time, I do not know what. 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.620
 and then he does not tactically give me the 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.990
 his time for you 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.030
 But when he calls you, you run out. 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.370
 Imagine your time is a very 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.490
 precious and you can not take it hand in hand 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.130
 kissed for the person knows his life 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.470
 must be in its priority 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.830
 for example if he is investing more 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.620
 time and energy you deserve it there 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.340
 little more of your time is exactly 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.320
 where at least four and invest only 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.000
 person in the same proportion as he or 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.630
 is investing in you that neither Felipe 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.390
 said 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.610
 no more and no less no for your life 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.310
 to donate all your time and this person 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.670
 in mass in that person only if 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.800
 invest in you in the same proportion if 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.900
 He stopped contacting us. He does not stay. 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.780
 pressing does not fill the bag 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.770
 to send a clear message of when 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.600
 to telephone 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.790
 it does not matter if you like it or not 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.980
 this behavior, besides not taking 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.290
 nothing is going to make him sure 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.010
 that you are not the kind of person he 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.320
 would you like 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.190
 and you do not value yourself you need 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.430
 keep your anxiety and your emotional 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.310
 controlled 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.620
 You do not find it here filling the 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.350
 his bag it will hit something 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.230
 on the contrary you will only show all 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.960
 affected emotional side and this is a 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:12.650
 problem for both you and the 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.710
 your potential suitors do not try 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.580
 convince and take on a relationship 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.870
 With you, look, this is one thing. 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.580
 truth everything we're talking about is 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.040
 very important but this is a 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.050
 very decisive thing from the moment 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.810
 that the guy feels that he is you are 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.930
 trying to push comes from a 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.060
 relationship he does not want 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.460
 It's not going to be any good, and one more thing is you. 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.479
 half that builds a wall between you 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.400
 two 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:43.009
 if you have done everything 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.680
 We've talked so far and anyway. 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:47.330
 he wants to be alone in the fun he does not 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.690
 wants to take nothing 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:53.720
 The senate is the wrong person for you. 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:56.300
 only now you have two options to pass 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.120
 on top of what you really want to 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.440
 stay with this person and not happy with 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.150
 This choice 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.080
 knowing that you are losing your 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.430
 time or simply turn the page and 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.020
 goes in search of someone who is 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.350
 really prepared to take on a 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.240
 relationship just as you are and it is 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.750
 this is one of the best tips that 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.750
 people can give 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:33.050
 [Applause]
