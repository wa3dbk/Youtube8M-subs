00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.770
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.969
 explain how to make a foie gras 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.400
 canned 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.590
 for that we need a foie gras 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.650
 400 to 500 grams a teaspoon 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.470
 shaves teaspoon pepper shaves 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.990
 salt and 2 teaspoons slice of 4 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.390
 spices and also glass jars 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.329
 with a seal like this or like those 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.969
 above 200 to 350 milliliters 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.720
 so we'll just cut it out 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.520
 our foie gras in pieces 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.400
 it will allow us to pack it well 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.690
 the inside of our concerns therefore 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.420
 include cuts of large pieces 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.430
 like these the foie gras has already been 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.350
 devee if your faith an ehpad and 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.200
 Come find our tip for 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.820
 learn how to do it so of course 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.130
 before making canned 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.130
 it's important to use equipment 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.759
 clean and have very clean hands 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.790
 also we will now be able to 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.729
 season just pour everything 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.190
 our pepper and property to spread a 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.240
 little on all the pieces 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.960
 now I have a little bit if needed 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.590
 but not too much to do the 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.590
 lint of foie gras 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.640
 here 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.479
 we will also divide the breast 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.610
 important we have the impression of 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.780
 a lot of rooms and is not at all 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.420
 because a foie gras without salt 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:40.440
 it's still pretty fan so you have to 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:43.119
 well salted and finally the 4 spices 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.790
 more of the preserve is that we did not 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.650
 no need to marinate 9 foie gras 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.580
 since during its conservation 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.450
 eva marine and of himself so we 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.490
 mix well here's for our ranks well 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.740
 with small pieces of foie gras in 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.479
 spices one can also if one 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.490
 wish to add a little alcohol 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.259
 I advise you in this case a 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.830
 tablespoon of cognac and a 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.539
 tablespoon of port is not bad 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.790
 we can now fill non jars 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.170
 so of course our jars are good 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.440
 clean we wash them well with water 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.030
 hot 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.320
 if you want we can even scald them 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.260
 so we are sure there is no 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.989
 worries and always we use a seal 9 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.980
 it's very important so we're going to 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.610
 fill a bridge gave up a spoon or 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.610
 a fork 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.310
 what is important then is to 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.310
 fine must be that there are not 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.810
 spaces in the bottom or somewhere else because 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.940
 that in addition the foie gras will reduce a 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.090
 little to cooking so otherwise you will not have 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.330
 nothing is worth about account at this 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.330
 well 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.180
 we go klein down I have plenty of empty 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.180
 so hop 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.680
 Once you've had a good time, you 'll never forget 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.440
 not to let a little bit of space 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.090
 with the top of a can and we can 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.090
 immediately closed 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.939
 we will be able to move on to the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.239
 cooking so for that we will put 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:30.010
 our can in a pot of water 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.750
 cold for now it must be done 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.069
 sure there out at least two 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.609
 centimeters of water above the 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.010
 concerned 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.829
 we will heat up and as soon as it boils 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.569
 we will count 45 minutes 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.609
 our foie gras is now cooked on 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.220
 so cooked it for 45 minutes then 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.010
 then we let cool in 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.290
 water and it comes out only once 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.609
 the water is at room temperature so we 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.840
 can leave it at night like this in 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.409
 the water the time to cool is not there 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.069
 everything and that's our foie gras is ready to 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.959
 savor 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.720
 however, I advise you to wait 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.280
 minimum one month for all the flavors 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.590
 can grow well 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.989
 put it in the refrigerator of course 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.250
 before serving him and going out on the 20th 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.250
 minutes before cutting 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.300
