00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
all right now we need to talk a little

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.080 
all right now we need to talk a little
bit<00:01:30.130> about<00:01:30.450> flexibility<00:01:32.159> very<00:01:33.159> very<00:01:33.640> very

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
bit about flexibility very very very

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.730 
bit about flexibility very very very
into<00:01:34.479> flexibility<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.140> reason<00:01:35.380> being<00:01:35.560> is

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
into flexibility the reason being is

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.950 
into flexibility the reason being is
because<00:01:35.770> as<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.460> put<00:01:36.610> on<00:01:36.729> muscle<00:01:36.970> you<00:01:37.780> lose

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
because as you put on muscle you lose

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.040 
because as you put on muscle you lose
function<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.070> lose<00:01:39.250> mobility<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:40.120> you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
function and you lose mobility and you

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.170 
function and you lose mobility and you
lose<00:01:41.229> flexibility<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:41.979> for<00:01:42.640> me<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:43.119> very

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
lose flexibility and for me it's very

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.530 
lose flexibility and for me it's very
important<00:01:43.690> for<00:01:43.780> me<00:01:43.900> to<00:01:44.050> you<00:01:44.710> know<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:44.860> keep<00:01:45.160> my

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
like if you're losing function of the

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.040 
like if you're losing function of the
body<00:02:03.130> you're<00:02:03.940> going<00:02:04.180> backwards<00:02:04.390> in<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.810> sense

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.580 
dunk a basketball I can run a 4.7 40
believe<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.070> or<00:02:24.160> not<00:02:24.280> but<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.760> can<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:26.380> that's

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
believe it or not but I can and that's

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.840 
believe it or not but I can and that's
just<00:02:26.739> because<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.160> years<00:02:27.340> are<00:02:27.459> stretching

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
just because the years are stretching

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.370 
just because the years are stretching
and<00:02:28.000> staying<00:02:28.180> athletic<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.900> not<00:02:29.080> just

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
and staying athletic and not just

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.320 
and staying athletic and not just
spending<00:02:30.010> all<00:02:30.190> my<00:02:30.370> time<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.850> trying<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.209> get

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
spending all my time and trying to get

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.449 
spending all my time and trying to get
big<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.410> think<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.799> have<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.100> you<00:02:33.280> know<00:02:33.370> you

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
big so I think you have to you know you

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.890 
big so I think you have to you know you
have<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.700> do<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.820> variety<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.299> things<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.660> can't

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
have to do a variety of things you can't

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.170 
have to do a variety of things you can't
just<00:02:35.080> do<00:02:35.200> one<00:02:35.470> thing<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:36.489> flexibility<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.120> very

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
just do one thing so flexibility is very

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.420 
just do one thing so flexibility is very
important<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.110> also<00:02:38.350> flexibility<00:02:39.040> will<00:02:39.160> help

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
important and also flexibility will help

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.660 
important and also flexibility will help
improve<00:02:39.910> muscle<00:02:40.480> growth<00:02:41.250> stretching<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
improve muscle growth stretching the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.699 
improve muscle growth stretching the
FASTA<00:02:43.030> tissue<00:02:43.239> well<00:02:43.720> how<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.049> muscle<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.560> grow

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
FASTA tissue well how the muscle to grow

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.400 
FASTA tissue well how the muscle to grow
at<00:02:44.829> a<00:02:44.890> faster<00:02:44.920> rate<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.989> bring<00:02:46.989> blood<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.230> the

at a faster rate and bring blood to the
muscle<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.799> help<00:02:47.920> heal<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.220> muscle<00:02:48.519> so

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
muscle and help heal the muscle so

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.600 
muscle and help heal the muscle so
stretching<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.870> great<00:02:50.170> thing<00:02:50.410> that's

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
stretching is a great thing that's

powerlifting<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:57.630> my<00:02:58.630> advice<00:02:58.930> start

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
powerlifting so my advice start

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.760 
powerlifting so my advice start
stretching<00:02:59.769> it's<00:03:00.250> going<00:03:00.430> to

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
stretching it's going to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:12.720 
stretching it's going to
make<00:03:01.070> a<00:03:01.100> world<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.490> difference
