00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:23.669
 high level of flamenco 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.849

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.540

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.880
 to me with you marcorÃ¨ that I would like something very fast when it comes to 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880
 flamenco is talk of two inputs flamenco is not 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.450
 solo music is not dance fragments is a philosophy of life 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.100
 flamenco is a way of connecting with one's feelings 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.139
 trilogy 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:57.399
 country music and dance the famous two ante this famous energy that one 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.890
 takes the land this talent would translate into Italian 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.479
 which we say to this very great communication power for TV 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.060
 he participated by looking at this flamenco experience and more 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.660
 own experience 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.720
 to laugh if one always has only one thing to try something a real one 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.290
 communication 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.299
 what are the features 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.920
 of a flamenco dancer 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.650
 flamenco ground and a musician produces piero sounds obviously must 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.670
 being a conscious iacono and the history of flamenco and in any case is part of 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.890
 gypsy culture 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.040
 8 citing 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.140
 which was obviously persecuted for many years 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.240
 that of sun 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.289
 andrea del flamenco is an art of fusion of people you meet 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.280
 musicians 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.140
 I still sing everything starts from the construction site 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.979
 and dance because they blend together to express the great themes that are love 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.530
 and life and death and universal themes 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.450
 the only council 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.880
 for those approaching buy 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.930
 discipline this lazy philosophy you have to choose why 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.609
 it's important to give yourself moments to hear the voices say 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.379
 alessia has to recycle yes 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.519
 to reconnect with one's own feeling we know a lot about this fact in a world 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.340
 very fast now i love you so much input from outside 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.919
 have a moment to evening give us to share later with others 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.079
 a luxury has also become fundamental 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.570
 good and bad silvia you are Italian if Roman 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.989
 how did you approach flamenco instead? 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.579
 I approached flamenco at my dance school in Rome 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.310
 I must say that your vote was love at first sight 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.890
 and therefore despite the prices I studied other pizzaman disciplines how to clean up 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.149
 everything he said or brands 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:58.139
 so that I chose to feel myself * Milan 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.439
 so for you too it is a philosophy of life 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.999
 there is a path of the soul 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.499
 and then the reason 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.639
 yes absolutely yes 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:13.199

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:32.810
