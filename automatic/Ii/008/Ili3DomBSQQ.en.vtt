00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.580 
this let's say this is the wall that you
want<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.880> build<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.240> now<00:01:39.750> normally<00:01:40.439> you'd

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
want to build with now normally you'd

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.230 
want to build with now normally you'd
fill<00:01:40.799> up<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.070> area<00:01:41.310> once<00:01:41.490> again<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.880> make<00:01:42.060> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
fill up this area once again just make a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690 
fill up this area once again just make a
little<00:01:42.479> bit<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.869> an<00:01:43.140> O<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.130> will<00:01:44.340> kind<00:01:44.640> of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
little bit of an O if you will kind of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.639 
little bit of an O if you will kind of
like<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.000> right<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.290> your<00:01:46.439> block

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
like this right this is with your block

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.990 
like this right this is with your block
of<00:01:46.680> choice<00:01:47.009> whatever<00:01:47.310> blocks<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.790> want<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
of choice whatever blocks you want to

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.789 
of choice whatever blocks you want to
make<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.390> wall<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.380> then<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.680> is

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
make the wall out of and then this is

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.560 
make the wall out of and then this is
with<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> lava<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.579> other<00:01:50.670> side<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
with a lava be on the other side for the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.999 
with a lava be on the other side for the
time<00:01:51.600> being<00:01:52.229> we're<00:01:52.439> actually<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> use

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
time being we're actually going to use

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
time being we're actually going to use
glass<00:01:53.399> instead<00:01:53.880> simply<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.750> see

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
glass instead simply so you can see

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.160 
glass instead simply so you can see
what's<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.640> here<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.960> makes

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
what's going on here I think that makes

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.539 
what's going on here I think that makes
a<00:01:58.290> lot<00:01:58.439> easier<00:01:58.500> for<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.100> understand

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
a lot easier for you to understand

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.179 
a lot easier for you to understand
exactly<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.360> process<00:02:00.930> involved<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.469> making

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
exactly the process involved in making

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.580 
exactly the process involved in making
this<00:02:02.460> little<00:02:02.670> secret<00:02:02.969> area<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:04.170> are<00:02:04.259> now<00:02:04.409> on

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
this little secret area so we are now on

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.440 
this little secret area so we are now on
the<00:02:04.649> other<00:02:04.890> side<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.670> where<00:02:06.000> all<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the other side this is where all the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.960 
the other side this is where all the
magic<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.259> happen<00:02:07.320> place<00:02:08.280> three

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
magic is going to happen place three

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.970 
magic is going to happen place three
more<00:02:09.179> blocks<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:09.929> here<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.860> here<00:02:10.890> now

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
more blocks of one here one here now

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.729 
more blocks of one here one here now
there<00:02:12.099> one<00:02:12.370> here<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.909> then<00:02:13.840> one<00:02:14.050> right<00:02:14.260> there

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
there one here and then one right there

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.160 
there one here and then one right there
kind<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.280> making<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.730> little<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.299> lower<00:02:16.870> case

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
kind of making a little you lower case

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.509 
kind of making a little you lower case
you<00:02:17.470> or<00:02:17.709> what<00:02:17.890> have<00:02:18.099> you<00:02:19.799> get<00:02:20.799> it<00:02:20.950> I'm<00:02:21.040> sorry

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
you or what have you get it I'm sorry

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:21.990 
you or what have you get it I'm sorry
I'm<00:02:21.700> sorry

I'm sorry
so<00:02:22.269> go<00:02:22.330> ahead<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.510> break<00:02:22.690> this<00:02:22.840> block<00:02:23.080> now<00:02:23.260> as

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
so go ahead and break this block now as

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.800 
so go ahead and break this block now as
well<00:02:23.799> now<00:02:24.489> you're<00:02:24.670> probably<00:02:24.879> thinking<00:02:25.239> okay

well now you're probably thinking okay
well<00:02:25.959> why'd<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.170> break<00:02:26.500> this<00:02:26.650> block<00:02:26.890> pilot<00:02:27.280> well

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
well why'd I break this block pilot well

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.250 
well why'd I break this block pilot well
let<00:02:27.670> me<00:02:27.700> tell<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.180> because<00:02:28.720> when<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.019> place

chest<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.780> need<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.139> just<00:03:26.470> hit<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.880> fishing

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
chest you need to just hit the fishing

chest you need to just hit the fishing
rod<00:03:29.019> with<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.799> pressure<00:03:30.010> plate<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.519> just

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
rod with the pressure plate and just

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.170 
rod with the pressure plate and just
like<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.389> it<00:03:32.260> opens<00:03:32.609> now<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.940> bobber

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
like that it opens now the bobber

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.479 
like that it opens now the bobber
actually<00:03:34.780> breaks<00:03:35.109> in<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.680> lava<00:03:35.889> which<00:03:36.220> means

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
actually breaks in the lava which means

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.599 
actually breaks in the lava which means
it<00:03:36.700> only<00:03:36.910> opens<00:03:37.630> for<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> very<00:03:38.290> brief<00:03:39.099> amount<00:03:39.310> of

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
it only opens for a very brief amount of

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.300 
it only opens for a very brief amount of
time<00:03:39.669> arguably<00:03:40.560> that's<00:03:41.560> useful<00:03:42.069> you<00:03:42.160> know<00:03:42.220> I

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
time arguably that's useful you know I

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.550 
time arguably that's useful you know I
mean<00:03:42.519> like<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:43.000> want<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.450> I'd<00:03:43.660> say<00:03:43.900> now<00:03:44.440> it

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
can be a little finicky I'm better at

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.180 
can be a little finicky I'm better at
getting<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.359> I'm<00:03:47.139> better<00:03:47.349> getting<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.769> on<00:03:47.980> this

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
use anything else because it'll just

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.480 
use anything else because it'll just
