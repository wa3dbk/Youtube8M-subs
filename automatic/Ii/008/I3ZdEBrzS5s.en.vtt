00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.409
 return your fears to a new video 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.080
 good news the truth enough 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:08.150
 interesting and above all fun good 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.650
 for my return to the future has been the 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.020
 movie of my childhood we could 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.250
 summarize one of the movies that I most 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.080
 have liked and good one of the sagas 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.820
 also that I liked the best 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.220
 it seems that we can revive a 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.820
 important part of the movies and it's 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.250
 how good we can skate 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.050
 we could say with the hover board of 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.500
 this this skate that was flying in the 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.450
 movie with oculus grid and the balance 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.440
 board of wii basically as a 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.390
 kind of developers with a 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.100
 special indie developers 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.660
 they have managed to do this 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.430
 connecting as I say the balance 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.340
 board the wind which is an expression of 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.020
 table we could say and with the oculus 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.910
 digital you can make the feeling that 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.820
 we are floating with with a table and 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.880
 good get inside what would be the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.620
 skateboarding with this scooter that goes 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.020
 about the air that the truth never 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.440
 I noticed that the scooter of the bird of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.510
 brand mattel since I'm seeing it 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.830
 It is doing so quite gracefully 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.270
 good nothing more kids have the video 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.820
 in the description in case you want to throw 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.170
 keep an eye out for now simply a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.900
 demo a demo that seems to be 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.270
 You can download on the same page 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.619
 the creators and as I say good the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.840
 truth oculus reese because it is 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.610
 getting to do certain things like that 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.830
 indies that calls much more attention 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.479
 than other games that really 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.890
 they have a lot more work behind and such 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.430
 because they are pretty 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.320
 funny 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.360
 and we have always wanted to make certain 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.460
 things of which we can not 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.920
 do and logically this helped us in 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.330
 true in a certain way so good 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.070
 nothing more kids this has been everything and 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.560
 as I say the video the description for 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.590
 that you take a look 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.939
 the truth when you sell rif and 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.920
 people start to try this I think that 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.350
 I'm going to give a lot of news from people 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.329
 that knows this the head that has been 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.039
 fallen in his own house and he has broken the 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.170
 head so good to be careful if 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.320
 You have the rif and I'm trying on things 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.720
 so always resting on a table and not 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.280
 quedéis one hostión though good so if 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.140
 it supports you to visit the experience is not the 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.030
 same but good security the most 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.099
 important to at least put on a helmet 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.690
 because sometimes as I say tide and you 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.890
 you can give a cibon wafer so 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.269
 well nothing more kids this has been 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.110
 everything and nothing see you in the next 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.110
 videos to the next chao
