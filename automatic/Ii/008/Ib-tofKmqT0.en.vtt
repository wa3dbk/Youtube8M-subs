in my opinion because when I put on low

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.690 
in my opinion because when I put on low
power<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.530> drive<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.770> spike<00:01:41.159> easily

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
power I can drive to spike easily

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.410 
power I can drive to spike easily

I'm not a huge guy myself and it's
really<00:02:52.810> easy<00:02:53.020> to<00:02:53.140> get<00:02:53.260> on<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.560> off<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:53.800> bike

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
really easy to get on and off this bike

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.650 
really easy to get on and off this bike
it's<00:02:54.910> light<00:02:55.150> easy<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.630> handle<00:02:57.360> one<00:02:58.360> thing<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.600> do

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
it's light easy to handle one thing I do

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.190

like<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.900> point<00:02:59.170> out<00:02:59.320> though<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.560> that<00:03:01.200> this

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
like to point out though is that this

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.810 
like to point out though is that this
bike<00:03:02.530> here<00:03:02.880> handles<00:03:03.880> pretty<00:03:04.420> quickly<00:03:04.780> so<00:03:05.820> if

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
bike here handles pretty quickly so if

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.170 
bike here handles pretty quickly so if

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.699 
you don't know how to corner properly
you<00:03:10.300> might<00:03:10.570> want<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.810> practice<00:03:11.050> more<00:03:11.650> before

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
you might want to practice more before

can't<00:03:39.790> ask<00:03:39.910> for<00:03:40.000> more<00:03:40.500> this<00:03:41.500> bike<00:03:41.860> was<00:03:42.130> a

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
can't ask for more this bike was a

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.350 
can't ask for more this bike was a
little<00:03:42.550> bit<00:03:42.640> pricey<00:03:42.850> though<00:03:43.300> but<00:03:45.090> know<00:03:46.090> for

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
little bit pricey though but know for

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.670 
little bit pricey though but know for
what<00:03:46.720> you<00:03:46.840> get<00:03:46.959> in<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:47.080> package<00:03:47.290> it's

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
what you get in the package it's

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.940 
what you get in the package it's
actually<00:03:47.980> phenomenal

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.440 

let<00:03:52.950> me<00:03:53.040> touch<00:03:53.250> upon<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.520> traction<00:03:53.849> control<00:03:54.420> a

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
let me touch upon a traction control a

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.089 
let me touch upon a traction control a
little<00:03:54.599> bit<00:03:55.130> so<00:03:57.080> this<00:03:58.080> traction<00:03:58.590> control<00:03:58.980> has

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
little bit so this traction control has

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.380 
little bit so this traction control has
three<00:03:59.459> modes<00:03:59.700> as<00:04:00.590> one<00:04:01.590> two<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.280> three<00:04:02.580> three

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
three modes as one two and three three

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.979 
three modes as one two and three three
being<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.720> most<00:04:03.900> intervening<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:05.720> two<00:04:06.720> being

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
being the most intervening and two being

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.330 
being the most intervening and two being
kind<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.230> middle<00:04:07.530> allows<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:07.980> little<00:04:08.220> bit

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
kind of middle allows you a little bit

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.309 
kind of middle allows you a little bit
of<00:04:08.370> tire<00:04:08.700> drift<00:04:09.560> one<00:04:11.959> give<00:04:12.959> it<00:04:13.050> a<00:04:13.080> little<00:04:13.200> bit

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
of tire drift one give it a little bit

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.479 
of tire drift one give it a little bit
more<00:04:13.470> leeway<00:04:13.620> when<00:04:13.920> you're<00:04:14.069> doing<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> hard

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
more leeway when you're doing a hard

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.069 
more leeway when you're doing a hard
corners<00:04:14.880> or<00:04:15.060> let<00:04:15.150> your<00:04:15.239> tire<00:04:15.450> slides<00:04:15.780> more

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
corners or let your tire slides more

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.710 
corners or let your tire slides more
slide<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.440> little<00:04:16.650> bit<00:04:16.739> more<00:04:17.299> or<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:18.480> can<00:04:18.600> turn

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
slide a little bit more or you can turn

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.120 
slide a little bit more or you can turn
completely<00:04:18.959> off<00:04:19.290> for<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.590> track<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:22.130> you

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
completely off for the track and you

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.900 
completely off for the track and you
know<00:04:23.250> honestly<00:04:23.639> if<00:04:25.190> you're<00:04:26.190> just<00:04:26.370> doing<00:04:26.490> city

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
know honestly if you're just doing city

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.460 
know honestly if you're just doing city
and<00:04:27.180> urban<00:04:27.300> street<00:04:27.750> riding<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.110> don't<00:04:28.260> think

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
and urban street riding I don't think

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.870 
and urban street riding I don't think
there's<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.680> reason<00:04:28.979> why<00:04:29.070> you<00:04:29.130> go<00:04:29.400> beyond

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
there's a reason why you go beyond

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.390 
there's a reason why you go beyond
number<00:04:30.360> two<00:04:30.600> or<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.680> medium<00:04:31.950> setting<00:04:32.160> for

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
number two or the medium setting for

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.550 
number two or the medium setting for
traction<00:04:32.610> control<00:04:33.090> anyway<00:04:36.229> now<00:04:37.229> I<00:04:37.260> do<00:04:37.350> it

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
traction control anyway now I do it

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.800 
traction control anyway now I do it
makes<00:04:37.740> your<00:04:37.889> a<00:04:37.979> freeway<00:04:38.550> in<00:04:38.760> city<00:04:39.180> driving<00:04:39.270> and

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
you know with the traction control and

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.750 
you know with the traction control and
all<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.660> usually<00:04:46.139> have<00:04:46.290> it<00:04:46.320> about<00:04:46.530> two<00:04:46.830> or<00:04:46.860> yeah
