00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
into place just like that the next thing

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.710 
into place just like that the next thing
to<00:02:10.019> do<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.679> at<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.979> end<00:02:11.130> we<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.330> these

to do is just at the end we have these
metal<00:02:13.080> hooks<00:02:13.410> here<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:14.489> need<00:02:14.580> to

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
metal hooks here and we just need to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.690 
metal hooks here and we just need to
clip<00:02:14.849> them<00:02:15.030> into<00:02:15.540> place<00:02:16.489> at<00:02:17.489> both<00:02:17.549> ends

mean<00:02:42.510> by<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.750> option<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.410> at<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:43.950> top<00:02:44.190> shelf

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
mean by the option is at the top shelf

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.849 
mean by the option is at the top shelf
you'll<00:02:45.390> see<00:02:45.569> here<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.780> there's<00:02:46.079> a<00:02:46.170> zip<00:02:46.380> that

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
you'll see here that there's a zip that

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.770 
you'll see here that there's a zip that
runs<00:02:47.069> along<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.430> middle<00:02:47.640> if<00:02:47.760> we<00:02:47.880> close<00:02:48.540> that

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
runs along the middle if we close that

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.890 
runs along the middle if we close that
zip<00:02:49.019> like<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.470> then<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.459> means<00:02:50.670> we<00:02:51.480> can<00:02:51.660> place

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
zip like so then that means we can place

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.370 
zip like so then that means we can place
the<00:02:52.890> shelf<00:02:53.130> directly<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.569> top<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.260> it

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
the shelf directly on top of this and it

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.610 
the shelf directly on top of this and it
becomes<00:02:55.680> quite<00:02:55.859> a<00:02:55.920> sturdy<00:02:56.340> shelf<00:02:56.579> or<00:02:57.569> what<00:02:58.500> you

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
becomes quite a sturdy shelf or what you

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.920 
becomes quite a sturdy shelf or what you
can<00:02:58.829> do<00:02:59.040> just<00:02:59.880> show<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.359> this<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.840> other

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
can do just show you this on the other

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.340 
can do just show you this on the other
side<00:03:01.819> there's<00:03:02.819> when<00:03:03.269> we<00:03:03.450> have<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:03.780> opened<00:03:04.230> up

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
side there's when we have this opened up

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.830 
side there's when we have this opened up
just<00:03:04.760> do<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.880> same<00:03:06.060> again<00:03:06.329> pop<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.630> shelf

just do the same again pop the shelf
into<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.290> bottom<00:03:08.540> think<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:10.410> then<00:03:10.560> if<00:03:10.829> you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
into the bottom think so but then if you

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.840 
into the bottom think so but then if you
leave<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.370> unzipped<00:03:11.819> at<00:03:12.389> the<00:03:12.510> top<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:14.430> tilt

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
leave that unzipped at the top just tilt

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.370 
leave that unzipped at the top just tilt
this<00:03:14.970> back<00:03:15.030> hopefully<00:03:15.630> you'll<00:03:15.780> see<00:03:15.959> on<00:03:16.200> the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
this back hopefully you'll see on the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.710 
this back hopefully you'll see on the
inside<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:17.040> we<00:03:17.130> have<00:03:17.310> these<00:03:18.180> hanging<00:03:18.420> rails

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
inside that we have these hanging rails

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.500 
inside that we have these hanging rails
