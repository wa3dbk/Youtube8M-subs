00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello and welcome to china phone 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.730
 house today we represent you the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.889
 hb 9005 more than ios 4 1 for his 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.780
 resemblance os 4 and we will do a test 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.560
 on the games there we will start here by 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.920
 time paul rudd version 2 2 of time 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.920
 paul roll 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.559
 so it's perfectly fluid 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.369
 the accelerometer also responds very well 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.900
 see 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:49.540
 so we will move on to another type of 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:51.130
 game a car game racing series 3 and 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.930
 we will see what gives this smartphone 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.930
 on reed racing 3 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.769
 the graphics on this game are really 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.769
 Great 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:59.100
 we're going to do a little race again because 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.100
 that it was not a race 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.590
 so at first glance everything goes well 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:38.160
 so there are a lot of cars we go 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:44.620
 see what happens in the race with 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:47.340
 this car to handle over the screen hd a 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.340
 game reminds him 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.540
 so there are some small 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.540
 downturns 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.260
 so here we are in a mode where the 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.280
 car accelerates and brakes alone 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.280
 so it's easy enough 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.090
 but now that there is less 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.450
 cars on the screen it's completely 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.450
 fluid 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.510
 so here you are rather successful we note 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.500
 still a few tiny ones 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.020
 downturns 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:53.550
 when there are a lot of cars to handle 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:56.280
 on shore racing May 3 so if ever the 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:00.110
 smartphone arrived at tournai lille racing 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:04.710
 3 properly but that means that 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.250
 95% of the games on the market will run without 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.070
 problem 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.410
 I would say even 98 % there may be a 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.580
 or two games where we will feel 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.030
 but way slowdowns 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.610
 overall 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.229
 there will be no problem here I you 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.700
 see you soon on two new videos 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.700
