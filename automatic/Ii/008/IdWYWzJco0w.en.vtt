00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
carrot hair cleansing cream shampoo I

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.479 
carrot hair cleansing cream shampoo I
bought<00:00:39.570> from<00:00:39.750> Texas<00:00:40.170> beauty<00:00:40.350> supply<00:00:40.680> calm<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.380 
bought from Texas beauty supply calm and
it's<00:00:42.170> basically<00:00:43.170> like<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.680> cream<00:00:44.340> wash<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.910> I

it's time for a new one but it's

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.450 
it's time for a new one but it's
basically<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.440> clean<00:00:49.800> because<00:00:50.129> it's
