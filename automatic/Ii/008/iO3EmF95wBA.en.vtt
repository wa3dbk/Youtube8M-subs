00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
just a cream with some of these little

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.280 
just a cream with some of these little
pink<00:02:56.919> beads<00:02:57.189> in<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.459> usually<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.480> use<00:02:58.689> something

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
pink beads in it usually I use something

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.879 
pink beads in it usually I use something
that's<00:02:59.590> more<00:02:59.829> abrasive<00:03:01.439> it<00:03:02.439> all<00:03:02.620> smells

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
that's more abrasive it all smells

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.460 
that's more abrasive it all smells
really<00:03:03.129> good<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.579> this<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.569> just<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:05.139> doesn't

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
really good and this is just it doesn't

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.110 
really good and this is just it doesn't
seem<00:03:05.680> like<00:03:05.889> it<00:03:06.069> would<00:03:06.099> exfoliate<00:03:06.700> much<00:03:06.909> at<00:03:07.060> all

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
seem like it would exfoliate much at all

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.849 
seem like it would exfoliate much at all
but<00:03:07.329> it<00:03:07.419> really<00:03:07.659> really<00:03:08.049> really<00:03:08.200> did<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.620> good

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
but it really really really did a good

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.039 
but it really really really did a good
job<00:03:08.919> I<00:03:09.250> think<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:09.669> was<00:03:09.909> like<00:03:09.939> the<00:03:10.840> major

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
job I think this was like the major

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.979 
job I think this was like the major
thing<00:03:11.409> that<00:03:11.439> helped<00:03:11.829> my<00:03:11.980> skin<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.659> also<00:03:13.659> got

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
thing that helped my skin I also got

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.550 
thing that helped my skin I also got
this<00:03:14.280> beautiful<00:03:15.280> skin<00:03:15.730> hydration<00:03:16.329> mask<00:03:16.780> give

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
this beautiful skin hydration mask give

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.670 
this beautiful skin hydration mask give
skin<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.159> intense<00:03:18.519> moisture<00:03:19.000> boost<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.680> I

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
skin and intense moisture boost and I

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.219 
skin and intense moisture boost and I
used<00:03:20.889> this<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.699> I<00:03:22.180> really<00:03:22.810> don't<00:03:22.959> think<00:03:23.139> it

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:23.229 
used this and I really don't think it

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.339 
used this and I really don't think it
did<00:03:23.379> a<00:03:23.409> lot<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.949> this<00:03:24.729> was<00:03:24.909> I<00:03:25.060> think<00:03:25.169> 1699<00:03:26.169> this

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
did a lot and this was I think 1699 this

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.250 
did a lot and this was I think 1699 this
was<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.590> most<00:03:26.769> expensive<00:03:27.340> product<00:03:27.729> and<00:03:28.449> it

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
was the most expensive product and it

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.710 
was the most expensive product and it
kind<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.590> burnt<00:03:30.190> my<00:03:30.370> skin<00:03:30.699> a<00:03:30.729> little<00:03:31.120> bit<00:03:31.239> not<00:03:31.690> a

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
kind of burnt my skin a little bit not a

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.559 
kind of burnt my skin a little bit not a
lot<00:03:31.959> just<00:03:31.989> I<00:03:32.440> could<00:03:33.250> feel<00:03:33.519> it<00:03:33.669> on<00:03:33.849> stinging<00:03:34.479> a

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
lot just I could feel it on stinging a

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.710 
lot just I could feel it on stinging a
tiny<00:03:34.810> bit<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.549> you<00:03:36.549> put<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:37.030> on<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.569> then

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
tiny bit and you put this on and then

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.500 
tiny bit and you put this on and then
you<00:03:37.949> wipe<00:03:38.949> it<00:03:39.129> off<00:03:39.310> with<00:03:39.609> a<00:03:39.669> towel<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.329> then

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
you wipe it off with a towel and then

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.960 
you wipe it off with a towel and then
you<00:03:40.629> just<00:03:40.810> rinse<00:03:41.019> your<00:03:41.199> face<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.829> as<00:03:42.760> soon<00:03:42.879> as

it's empty so then I want to go get
something<00:06:09.230> else<00:06:09.350> and<00:06:09.680> that's<00:06:09.770> when<00:06:10.010> I<00:06:10.040> got<00:06:10.250> the

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
something else and that's when I got the

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.240 
something else and that's when I got the
lush<00:06:10.880> ocean<00:06:11.540> salt<00:06:11.810> face<00:06:12.110> scrub<00:06:12.440> and<00:06:12.680> that's
