00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello, I am Martin Chuck. 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.029
 In this Trackman training unit 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.980
 I am going to explain the gear effect 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.780
 And how does this affect the bending of the ball 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.639
 I have some face spray 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.769
 Let me spray a layer 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.150
 On the face of the kicking wood 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.770
 I will play a ball and then explain the gear effect. 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.600
 Let me play a ball 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:30.539
 This ball will hit the ball at the toe 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:31.980
 Let's take a look at this ball 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.770
 Because this ball is very interesting 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.050
 The head track direction is 6.9 degrees to the right 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.700
 The face faces toward the head track 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.770
 7.1 degrees to the right 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.350
 This means that the face starts with the ball. 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.480
 Right side of the head track direction 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.239
 This ball should be a small right song 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.610
 But because I am at the toe 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.350
 Deviate from the sweet spot of the face 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.969
 Half inch or two thirds inch 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.010
 Place to hit the ball 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.410
 Gear effect 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.390
 The ball did not bend to the right 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.340
 And also left a lot of songs 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.750
 I use these lines 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.830
 To present the ball that has just been played 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 The head track direction is 6.9 degrees to the right 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.640
 Then I use the blue line 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.180
 To present 6.9 degrees 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.490
 Head track direction 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.860
 Usually my face is facing the opposite target line 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.720
 Will be slightly to the right of the head track 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.369
 This ball should take off from the red line. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.400
 Then from the opposite direction of the direction of the head track 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.110
 Produce a small right song. But the ball is just a small left song. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.500
 There should be a little too much left song 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.240
 So if you wave a good swing 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.130
 Then did not hit the center of the face 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.320
 Gear effect 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.820
 When I hit the ball at the toe 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.939
 You can see the ball marks on the face on the toe 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.829
 When you hit the ball at the toe 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.810
 Bump toe rebounds after hitting the ball 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.619
 The ball will rotate towards the center of gravity 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.479
 That is, rotating towards a sweet spot 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.000
 This rotation produces a small left song 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.680
 Although the face is facing the opposite target line 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.020
 Let the ball start on the right side as I just demonstrated 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.899
 So the gear effect is very important 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.780
 If using Trackman 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.659
 You will be completely clear 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.719
 Why is the ball flying like this?
