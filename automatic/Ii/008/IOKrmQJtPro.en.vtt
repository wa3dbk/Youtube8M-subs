here on the right and an iphone 2g but

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.580 
here on the right and an iphone 2g but
first<00:00:09.240> let's<00:00:09.450> talk<00:00:09.599> about<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.990> hardware<00:00:10.290> in

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
first let's talk about the hardware in

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.970 
first let's talk about the hardware in
these<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.849> iphone<00:00:12.240> 2g<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> 620

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
these in the iphone 2g you have a 620

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.519 
these in the iphone 2g you have a 620
megahertz<00:00:14.400> cpu<00:00:14.880> that's<00:00:15.120> under<00:00:15.420> clock<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.809> 412

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
megahertz cpu that's under clock to 412

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.099 
megahertz cpu that's under clock to 412
megahertz<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.910> also<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> power<00:00:18.660> vr

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
megahertz and you also have the power vr

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.210 
megahertz and you also have the power vr

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.349 
mb x lite 3d graphics chip and then for
RAM<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.640> 128<00:00:24.390> megs<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.779> ram<00:00:24.890> now<00:00:26.359> people

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
RAM you have 128 megs of ram now people

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.419 
RAM you have 128 megs of ram now people
don't<00:00:27.390> really<00:00:27.840> know<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.710> iphone<00:00:29.130> 2g

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
don't really know this but the iphone 2g

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.590 
don't really know this but the iphone 2g
and<00:00:29.699> 3g<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> same<00:00:31.109> exact<00:00:31.650> cpu<00:00:32.399> GPU<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
and 3g have the same exact cpu GPU and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.840 
and 3g have the same exact cpu GPU and
ram<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.980> lot<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.160> people<00:00:35.460> think<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
ram and a lot of people think that the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.639 
ram and a lot of people think that the
iphone<00:00:36.180> 2g<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.719> slower<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.469> it's

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
iphone 2g is slower just because it's

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.069 
iphone 2g is slower just because it's
older<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.340> they're<00:00:39.120> really<00:00:39.270> exactly<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
older but it they're really exactly the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.880 
older but it they're really exactly the
same<00:00:40.290> thing<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.989> may<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.320> wondering<00:00:43.440> why

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
same thing so you may be wondering why

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.340 
same thing so you may be wondering why
Apple<00:00:44.399> didn't<00:00:44.610> put<00:00:44.789> ios4<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> iphone<00:00:46.079> 2g

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
Apple didn't put ios4 on the iphone 2g

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.979 
Apple didn't put ios4 on the iphone 2g
well<00:00:46.920> simply<00:00:47.850> put<00:00:48.030> they<00:00:48.390> wanted<00:00:48.690> people<00:00:48.719> to

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
well simply put they wanted people to

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.830 
well simply put they wanted people to
upgrade<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.680> new<00:00:49.800> phone<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.660> want

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
upgrade to the new phone so if you want

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.740 
upgrade to the new phone so if you want
the<00:00:51.899> newer<00:00:52.079> features<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> newer<00:00:53.070> phone<00:00:53.750> but

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the newer features get a newer phone but

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.299 
the newer features get a newer phone but
when<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.020> comes<00:00:55.170> down<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.559> iphone<00:00:55.890> 4<00:00:56.160> it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
when it comes down to the iphone 4 it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.010 
when it comes down to the iphone 4 it
has<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.640> arm<00:00:56.850> cortex<00:00:57.539> a8<00:00:57.859> based<00:00:58.859> apple<00:00:59.550> a4<00:01:00.020> 1

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
has the arm cortex a8 based apple a4 1

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.100 
has the arm cortex a8 based apple a4 1
gigahertz<00:01:01.289> CPU<00:01:01.789> then<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.149> 512<00:01:03.899> megs

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
gigahertz CPU then you do have 512 megs

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.500 
gigahertz CPU then you do have 512 megs
of<00:01:04.229> ram<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.489> graphics<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.150> built<00:01:06.360> into

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
of ram and the graphics is built into

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.770 
of ram and the graphics is built into
the<00:01:06.720> CPU<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.130> actual<00:01:08.280> GPU<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.210> not<00:01:09.510> very

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
the CPU so the actual GPU is not very

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.620 
the CPU so the actual GPU is not very
known<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.430> let's<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:11.850> into<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.180> be<00:01:12.360> test

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
known so let's get into this be test

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.450 
known so let's get into this be test

we're<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.970> do<00:01:36.090> some<00:01:36.119> basic<00:01:36.390> speed

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
we're just going to do some basic speed

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.960 
we're just going to do some basic speed
tests<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.650> know<00:01:37.770> loading<00:01:38.159> applications<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
tests you know loading applications and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.300 
tests you know loading applications and
things<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.329> there's<00:01:40.170> no<00:01:40.350> music<00:01:40.770> loaded

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
things like that there's no music loaded

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.800 
things like that there's no music loaded
on<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.820> there's<00:01:41.939> no<00:01:42.119> third-party

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
on this and there's no third-party

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.179 
on this and there's no third-party
applications<00:01:43.799> everything<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.310> stock<00:01:45.170> the

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
applications everything is stock the

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.690 
applications everything is stock the
exception<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.310> cydia<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.950> first<00:01:50.340> let's<00:01:50.579> go

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
exception of cydia so first let's go

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.570 
exception of cydia so first let's go
ahead<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.030> open<00:01:51.149> calendar

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.220 

it's<00:01:55.580> not<00:01:55.730> my<00:01:56.030> thought<00:01:56.600> phone<00:01:56.810> for<00:01:57.020> is<00:01:57.080> not

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
it's not my thought phone for is not

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.320 
it's not my thought phone for is not
that<00:01:57.470> much<00:01:57.620> faster<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:58.550> did<00:01:59.000> notice<00:01:59.180> that

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
that much faster I did notice that

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.150 
that much faster I did notice that
having<00:01:59.780> this<00:01:59.900> one<00:02:00.110> being<00:02:00.320> jailbroken<00:02:00.740> and

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
having this one being jailbroken and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.000

running<00:02:01.730> mobilesubstrate<00:02:02.260> it<00:02:03.260> does<00:02:03.530> bring

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
running mobilesubstrate it does bring

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.970 
running mobilesubstrate it does bring
the<00:02:04.370> speed<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.790> things<00:02:05.000> down<00:02:05.300> a<00:02:05.330> little<00:02:05.540> bit

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
the speed of things down a little bit

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.700 
the speed of things down a little bit
but<00:02:06.980> over<00:02:07.670> here<00:02:07.850> on<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.090> iphone<00:02:08.510> 2g<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:09.380> also

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
but over here on the iphone 2g it also

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.550 
but over here on the iphone 2g it also
has<00:02:10.330> various<00:02:11.330> mobile<00:02:11.540> substrate<00:02:11.840> extensions

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
has various mobile substrate extensions

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.580 
has various mobile substrate extensions
installed<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:13.660> if<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.930> think<00:02:15.110> about<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.380> it's

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
installed so if you think about it it's

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.250 
installed so if you think about it it's
a<00:02:15.650> pretty<00:02:15.830> fair<00:02:16.070> comparison<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:17.810> next<00:02:17.990> let's

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
a pretty fair comparison so next let's

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.810 
a pretty fair comparison so next let's
go<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.440> photos<00:02:23.770> then<00:02:24.770> once<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.400> start<00:02:25.640> loading

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
go to photos then once you start loading

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.340 
go to photos then once you start loading

that<00:02:29.980> it'll<00:02:30.980> probably<00:02:31.040> get<00:02:31.430> considerably

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
that it'll probably get considerably

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.900 
that it'll probably get considerably
slower<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.770> if<00:02:33.770> i<00:02:33.980> install<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.400> same<00:02:34.580> exact

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
slower and if i install the same exact

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.390 
slower and if i install the same exact
jailbroken<00:02:35.480> mullets<00:02:35.810> onto<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.230> 2g<00:02:36.650> as<00:02:36.860> i<00:02:36.920> have

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
jailbroken mullets onto the 2g as i have

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.490 
jailbroken mullets onto the 2g as i have
on<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.640> four<00:02:37.910> then<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:39.020> know<00:02:39.140> this<00:02:39.350> thing

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
on the four then you know this thing

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.620 
on the four then you know this thing
will<00:02:39.650> be<00:02:39.950> pretty<00:02:40.280> darn<00:02:40.490> slow<00:02:40.850> so<00:02:41.240> keep<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.450> in

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
will be pretty darn slow so keep that in

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.190 
will be pretty darn slow so keep that in
mind<00:02:42.400> let's<00:02:43.400> go<00:02:43.550> ahead<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:43.940> open<00:02:44.060> voice<00:02:45.160> memos

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
mind let's go ahead and open voice memos

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.670 
mind let's go ahead and open voice memos
there<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.350> go<00:02:50.170> next<00:02:51.170> up<00:02:51.320> let's<00:02:51.440> go<00:02:51.620> to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
there you go next up let's go to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.660 
there you go next up let's go to
calendar<00:02:52.430> or<00:02:52.700> excuse<00:02:53.180> me<00:02:53.210> calculator<00:02:54.080> and

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
then we'll go to the clock and then

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.250 
then we'll go to the clock and then
we'll<00:03:01.880> go<00:03:02.000> over<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.510> settings

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.179

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
and then we'll go over to contacts and

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:22.069 
and then we'll go over to contacts and
then<00:03:14.909> one<00:03:15.390> more<00:03:15.629> let's<00:03:15.959> go<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.159> Safari<00:03:21.079> pretty

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
then one more let's go to Safari pretty

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.280 
then one more let's go to Safari pretty
big<00:03:22.230> difference<00:03:22.650> there<00:03:23.900> that<00:03:24.900> was<00:03:25.019> just<00:03:25.140> a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
big difference there that was just a

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.800 
big difference there that was just a
quick<00:03:25.500> speed<00:03:25.769> test<00:03:26.010> between<00:03:26.159> the<00:03:26.430> iphone<00:03:26.790> 2g<00:03:27.060> /

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
quick speed test between the iphone 2g /

quick speed test between the iphone 2g /
iphone<00:03:28.290> 3g<00:03:28.709> if<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:28.920> think<00:03:29.099> about<00:03:29.159> it<00:03:29.390> versus

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
iphone 3g if you think about it versus

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.300 
iphone 3g if you think about it versus
the<00:03:30.420> iphone<00:03:30.900> for<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.440> iphone<00:03:31.769> 4<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.159> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
the iphone for the iphone 4 is the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.050 
the iphone for the iphone 4 is the
obvious<00:03:32.459> winner<00:03:32.819> but<00:03:33.030> not<00:03:33.180> by<00:03:33.359> much<00:03:33.769> in<00:03:35.060> some

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
obvious winner but not by much in some

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.460 
obvious winner but not by much in some
ways<00:03:36.209> it's<00:03:36.390> fair<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.629> some<00:03:36.780> ways<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.079> not<00:03:37.260> if

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
ways it's fair in some ways it's not if

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.710 
ways it's fair in some ways it's not if
i<00:03:37.620> put<00:03:37.829> more<00:03:38.340> applications<00:03:38.939> music<00:03:39.329> jailbroke
