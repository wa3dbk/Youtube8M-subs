00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
some loss in the textile so we try to

things together most of the hardware we

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.409 
things together most of the hardware we

to wear out most of our cord locks you

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.879 
to wear out most of our cord locks you
could<00:05:06.300> just<00:05:06.419> unthread<00:05:06.780> them<00:05:07.050> if<00:05:07.650> you<00:05:07.740> have<00:05:07.860> a
