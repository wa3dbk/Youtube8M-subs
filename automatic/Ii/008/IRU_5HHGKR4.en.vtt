00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.070
 in this video 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:11.060
 I'm going to teach you how to calculate the 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.620
 barycenter of a triangle 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:17.640
 the price of a triangle 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.230
 get is the intersection of the three 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.279
 medians of a segment 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.279
 of a triangle 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.679
 of a triangle 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.730
 a median 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.239
 the the segment that joins a vertex with the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.239
 midpoint of the opposite side 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.760
 segment such that yes 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.760
 the center is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.720
 the point of the three medians of the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.720
 foundation 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.329
 to calculate the midpoint 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.329
 d 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.390
 aside, the only option we have is 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.390
 the average actress 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.620
 is popular 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.390
 we calculate to medium 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.390
 joining it with the vertex put 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.820
 we have the same for this 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.200
 for this side 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.400
 in the place I have the midpoint of 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.400
 lake 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.980
 exist 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.390
 would be continuation 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.390
 with the point of the vertex 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.740
 drawing these two I already know that the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.070
 next will happen here but other 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.070
 shapes 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.680
 I'm going to draw it like this median for 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.349
 have a cleaner drawing 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.980
 I'm going to calculate it with half shreds 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:27.390
 with angles or with a point just for you 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.390
 I know that a half trip is perpendicular 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.420
 is perpendicular in addition to going through the 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.420
 midpoint after stopping next 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.410
 is what you can see with this 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.410
 it helps 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.819
 as a shot 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.849
 they pass me 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.700
 this is this is the barycenter 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.280
 which it is also the center of gravity 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.260
 point on which we do support the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.480
 triangle would not fall would be in 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.989
 Balance 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.989
 Y
