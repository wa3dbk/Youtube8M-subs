00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 and special in Madrid at least for 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.629
 the Mexicans the Vallecano ray 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.090
 castle 'received the realsociety of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.710
 carlos candle and for us the story 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.410
 it started from before hotel of 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.150
 concentration of the real is clear to us 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.430
 that there are many differences between 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.170
 florentino pérez and carlos vela is not 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.359
 president of real madrid and one of the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.800
 most powerful men of Spain and the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.660
 another is a player of the real 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.029
 society but I think the biggest 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.949
 difference is that one smiles stops 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.080
 with people with pleasure he gives pictures to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.210
 all with an admirable humility 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.280
 while the other descends in haste from 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.129
 autographs by force and look for the way 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.860
 to get to the hotel as soon as possible 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.660
 reluctantly and without much enthusiasm we went 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.550
 witnesses of the closest you will return to 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.960
 be carlos sail a t-shirt of the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.960
 national team of mexico 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.300
 plus 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.399
 but let's go to the game because he sees the 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.289
 output to heat and searched 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.960
 immediately make eye contact with 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.629
 eric and there we had two Mexicans 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.549
 with totally different realities one 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.979
 looking to be in rhythm and form to be 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.409
 considered by your selection and another 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.110
 that those topics do not interest him though 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.210
 have level and quality everything ready and nery 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.830
 I was saying something to sail and the Mexican 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.510
 towards a gesture like not wanting to know 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.520
 More of that 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.880
 of the party we can say that in the 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.980
 runs fight fight tries and sails more 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.110
 consolidated that never of this frog 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.810
 quality by all courts Spain 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.850
 He spent nerd time and left the field 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.770
 after giving everything and criminal for the ray 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.930
 Vallecano and the fairy tale of 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.330
 carlitos and his real society began to 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.520
 finish 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.710
 at the end of the meeting and candle goes to the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.110
 dressing but moment because the boss of 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.700
 press dare to arrive with the prince of san 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.820
 sebastián to ask him to give a 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.340
 reluctantly interview candle access but 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.010
 in the end he gets his way directly to 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.690
 dressing we ask your 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.640

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.010
 star that the real society was 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.380
 hoping he would continue to despise his 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.950
 country without explanations and this we 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.950
 he answered 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.880
 that would be something 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.069
 talk about him 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.200
