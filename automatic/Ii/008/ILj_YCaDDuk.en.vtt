00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.850
 Tomorrow today, what is welcome 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.750
 next video of the camouflage today yes 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.450
 so today 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.549
 now the comic camouflage is on it this time 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.690
 team deathmatch because we are in power 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.320
 or because I do not rule anything 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.859
 have found 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.800
 The because they do not would otherwise 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.840
 which only fenced or the globes 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:32.550
 are just always the same and the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:37.530
 Lobby does not evolve under that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.309
 I do not care no matter here for example 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:46.350
 once the business card for humor as 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:53.250
 that's just what I mean 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.980
 just indiscriminately pure but it would have to 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.359
 actually went 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:06.000
 If you are not in the middle of the match now 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:09.049
 goes though, let's see if we 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.049
 with the 8th 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.280
 Oh oh oh 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.540
 12 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:38.440
 So if that was the lobby must go 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:43.500
 to say that the humor does not know 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.500
 Do not make me so ready now 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:53.020
 we let us with the power you will 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.430
 the pure I finally wanted to show you 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.390
 now the typical German weeks 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.870
 open like that on the outside where god 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:10.080
 all right 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:10.080
 running because I will not remember 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:30.780
 where there is more where by that straight 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:41.530
 a credible ultimate 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:46.170
 speak up what understand so briefly 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:50.170
 over where the kitchen is running 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.190
 but let's get you completely 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.970
 uncertain 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.970
 Yes 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.660
 crown out 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.990
 june is also the week in the 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.990
 moment solar reload pilot 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:30.210
 very nice 24.3 you can think 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.630
 for team deathmatch railway park systems 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.860
 I do not know what I mean for one 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.590
 we could have had it right 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.450
 watch as synced i have it 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.840
 I think it will be done the same 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.530
 again a lobby that was the 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:54.020
 Comments 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:57.960
 Now only one ton is missing 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:03.810
 so we have the bird with a 36 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:05.700
 35 34 33 so I thank you for that 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.640
 watching was not commenting now 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.630
 forget what you have until then 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.630
 then pure
