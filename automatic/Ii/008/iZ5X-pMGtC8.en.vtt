00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.060 
so that is it guys
and<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:09.640> here's<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.030> comparison<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:11.070> four

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
and so here's the comparison of four

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.840 
and so here's the comparison of four
armed<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.910> armed<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:18.010> it's<00:04:18.519> weird

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
armed and to armed and it's weird

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.620 
armed and to armed and it's weird
because<00:04:19.419> this<00:04:20.290> is<00:04:20.620> like<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:20.979> Sun<00:04:21.790> before

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
because this is like the Sun before

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.550 
because this is like the Sun before
armed<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:24.960> then<00:04:25.960> Lloyd<00:04:26.950> is<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.430> son<00:04:27.760> of<00:04:28.560> the

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
armed and then Lloyd is the son of the

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.030 
armed and then Lloyd is the son of the
two<00:04:29.860> arms<00:04:30.310> so<00:04:31.060> I<00:04:31.419> just<00:04:32.290> now<00:04:32.470> thought<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.830> that

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
two arms so I just now thought of that

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.320 
two arms so I just now thought of that
sunny<00:04:34.000> way<00:04:34.390> goodbye<00:04:35.050> guys
