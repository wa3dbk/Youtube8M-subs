00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.779
 In terms of interior equipment we can highlight several things well in 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.360
 this vehicle that the truth the difference that citroen makes in 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.780
 Comparison to the competition has a regulation of electric height 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.680
 of the lights depending on the load of the vehicle that can be adjusted from 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.420
 here after we have a radio that can be commanded from the steering wheel 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.710
 also with a command of three flyers where the basic functions are 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.779
 and there is also a multifunction screen that will give us a lot 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.320
 information is for example the autonomy of abuse or consumption 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.390
 average instant consumption after we have the counter 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.700
 mileage that we can not return we always do 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.610
 then you can tell us the average consumption of these effects of fire on 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.319
 steering wheel 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:50.450

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.260

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.790
 r if you want 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.390
 has a lot of space in the doors of the central zone has another like in which 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.210
 for example the gear lever is the height is because if we do it 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.480
 very nice to handling also comes with socket to the affiliate for mp3 or mp4 for 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.410
 the radio yes 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.430
 and that has paralyzed but for example is working 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.390
 I put the reverse gear 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.250
 the rear windshield high school works automatically 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.579
 the other important advantage and I'm very happy 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.579
 in what it does to its electrical conformation is that it allows us to configure 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.180
 his wife to the needs of us as for example 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.800
 me this car easily through the car computer could configure the 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.090
 foreigner they knew the lights and once they cut the light to young

 change the position 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.350
 the backup 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.550
 on both sides 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.790
