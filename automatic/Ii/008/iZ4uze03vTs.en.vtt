and everybody today I'm going to be

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:06.680 
and everybody today I'm going to be
installing<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:04.859> in<00:00:04.920> telepods<00:00:05.730> 9200<00:00:06.660> series

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
installing this in telepods 9200 series

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.400 
installing this in telepods 9200 series
it's<00:00:07.140> actually<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.560> 92<00:00:07.980> 45<00:00:09.050> 45<00:00:10.050> amp<00:00:10.440> DC<00:00:10.889> output

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
it's actually the 92 45 45 amp DC output

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.720 
it's actually the 92 45 45 amp DC output
into<00:00:13.410> my<00:00:13.530> travel<00:00:14.219> trailer<00:00:14.660> because<00:00:16.730> this

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
into my travel trailer because this

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.480 
into my travel trailer because this
device<00:00:18.180> right<00:00:18.449> down<00:00:18.690> here

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
device right down here

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.790 
device right down here
I<00:00:20.550> believe<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.210> killing<00:00:22.140> my<00:00:22.230> battery<00:00:22.680> it's

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
I believe is killing my battery it's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.429 
I believe is killing my battery it's
just<00:00:22.980> boiling<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.490> water<00:00:23.670> off<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.380> this<00:00:25.380> is

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
just boiling the water off and this is

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.509 
just boiling the water off and this is
just<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.510> converter<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.599> comes<00:00:28.519> standard

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
just the converter that comes standard

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.299 
just the converter that comes standard
in<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.779> particular<00:00:31.320> travel<00:00:31.769> trailer<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
in this particular travel trailer and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.389 
in this particular travel trailer and
they<00:00:32.640> are<00:00:32.700> notoriously<00:00:33.270> bad<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.130> what<00:00:35.280> I'm

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
they are notoriously bad so what I'm

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.020 
they are notoriously bad so what I'm
going<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.920> on<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.129> left<00:00:38.370> side<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.820> see

plug it in to the female plug that I

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.440 
plug it in to the female plug that I
wire<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> wires<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.090> are<00:01:09.150> down<00:01:09.420> there

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
wire on to the wires that are down there

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.380 
wire on to the wires that are down there
and<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.310> business<00:01:11.670> end<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.119> unit

and then the business end of this unit

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.770 
and then the business end of this unit
oops<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.350> I'll<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.860> putting<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
oops right here I'll just be putting the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.190 
oops right here I'll just be putting the
DC<00:01:18.780> wires<00:01:19.020> into<00:01:19.350> there<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.960> hopefully<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.080> be

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
DC wires into there and hopefully to be

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.410 
DC wires into there and hopefully to be
pretty<00:01:22.470> straightforward<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:24.240> too

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
pretty straightforward and not not too

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.149 
pretty straightforward and not not too
difficult<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:28.020> made<00:01:28.170> sure<00:01:28.380> my<00:01:28.530> powers<00:01:29.009> all

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
difficult it made sure my powers all

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.880 
difficult it made sure my powers all
turned<00:01:29.430> off<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.409> I'm<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.740> go

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
turned off and I'm just going to go

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.880 
turned off and I'm just going to go
ahead<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.310> disconnect<00:01:32.670> these<00:01:33.000> wires

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
ahead and disconnect these wires

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.010 
ahead and disconnect these wires
basically<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.490> got<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> I've<00:01:36.600> cut<00:01:36.840> these

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
basically I just got a I've cut these

a job for example this right here is a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.890 
a job for example this right here is a
5/32<00:02:10.170> allen<00:02:10.259> wrench<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.209> have<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.360> use<00:02:12.720> it

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
5/32 allen wrench and you have to use it

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.430 
5/32 allen wrench and you have to use it
to<00:02:12.930> tighten

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
to tighten

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.680 
to tighten
down<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.660> lugs<00:02:15.930> over<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.560> battery<00:02:17.400> wires<00:02:18.300> but

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
down the lugs over the battery wires but

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.330 
down the lugs over the battery wires but
I<00:02:18.930> mean<00:02:19.320> how<00:02:19.440> hard<00:02:19.620> would<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.890> have<00:02:20.100> either

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
I mean how hard would it have either

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.180 
I mean how hard would it have either
just<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.990> printed<00:02:21.990> something<00:02:22.380> here<00:02:22.680> or<00:02:22.710> put<00:02:23.070> it

done<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:54.900> got<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> pretty<00:02:55.850> good<00:02:56.850> suspicion<00:02:57.390> that

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
done I got a pretty good suspicion that

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.900 
done I got a pretty good suspicion that
battery<00:02:57.930> might<00:02:58.140> be<00:02:58.260> done<00:02:58.500> for<00:02:58.800> which<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.220> not

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
battery might be done for which is not

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.040 
battery might be done for which is not
the<00:03:00.090> end<00:03:00.210> of<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.360> world<00:03:00.540> because<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.780> thinking

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
the end of the world because I thinking

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.500 
the end of the world because I thinking
about<00:03:01.110> swapping<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:01.950> out<00:03:02.130> with<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.340> couple<00:03:03.330> of

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
about swapping that out with a couple of

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.290 
about swapping that out with a couple of
six<00:03:03.720> volts<00:03:04.020> anyway<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:04.790> well<00:03:05.790> since<00:03:06.090> nothing

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
six volts anyway so well since nothing

six volts anyway so well since nothing

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
an inch and this unit catches on that a

an inch and this unit catches on that a
little<00:03:21.390> bit<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.750> I'm<00:03:22.440> going<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.680> have<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:24.530> cut

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
that bottom out back far enough so I can

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.240

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.500 

apparently<00:03:35.250> such<00:03:35.520> squat<00:03:35.790> should<00:03:36.090> be<00:03:36.180> living

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
where the front cover is going to hook

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.000 
where the front cover is going to hook
into<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:57.239> then<00:03:57.390> as<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.660> can<00:03:57.810> see<00:03:58.050> there's

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
already a ventilation on each side this

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.030 
already a ventilation on each side this
one<00:04:03.690> on<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.870> right<00:04:04.050> doesn't<00:04:04.260> go<00:04:04.470> very<00:04:04.500> far<00:04:04.739> it

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
one on the right doesn't go very far it

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.100 
one on the right doesn't go very far it
just<00:04:05.070> goes<00:04:05.700> up<00:04:05.730> but<00:04:06.120> I'm<00:04:06.690> going<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.900> go<00:04:07.019> ahead

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
just goes up but I'm going to go ahead

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.690 
just goes up but I'm going to go ahead
I'm<00:04:07.410> gonna<00:04:07.470> monitor<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.190> temperature<00:04:08.610> on

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
I'm gonna monitor the temperature on

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.890 
I'm gonna monitor the temperature on
this<00:04:08.820> to<00:04:08.970> make<00:04:09.120> sure<00:04:09.150> there's<00:04:09.540> not<00:04:09.660> going<00:04:09.840> to

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
this to make sure there's not going to

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.050 
this to make sure there's not going to
be<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:10.050> problem<00:04:10.350> but<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:11.430> looks<00:04:11.640> like<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:11.910> should

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
be a problem but it looks like it should

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.430 
be a problem but it looks like it should
blow<00:04:12.180> right<00:04:12.420> into<00:04:12.660> those<00:04:12.780> holes<00:04:13.050> and<00:04:13.230> not

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
blow right into those holes and not

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.729 
blow right into those holes and not
really<00:04:13.739> be<00:04:13.890> a<00:04:13.920> big<00:04:14.130> deal

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
really be a big deal

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.710 
really be a big deal
all<00:04:16.739> right<00:04:16.890> there's<00:04:17.190> my<00:04:17.370> completed<00:04:18.239> project

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
all right there's my completed project

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.810 
all right there's my completed project
that<00:04:19.080> looks<00:04:19.830> like<00:04:20.010> right<00:04:20.310> out<00:04:20.489> of<00:04:20.519> that

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
that looks like right out of that

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.500
