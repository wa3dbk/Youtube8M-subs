yeah<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.820> these<00:00:36.000> sizes<00:00:36.270> yeah

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
yeah so you can do all these sizes yeah

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.110 
yeah so you can do all these sizes yeah
yeah<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.590> decided<00:00:37.890> when<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.399> miniseries<00:00:38.790> you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
yeah we decided when the miniseries you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.990 
yeah we decided when the miniseries you
can<00:00:39.270> mod<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.540> at<00:00:39.629> about<00:00:39.899> side<00:00:40.730> 1719<00:00:41.730> all<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
can mod you at about side 1719 all the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
can mod you at about side 1719 all the
way<00:00:42.059> up<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:43.079> head<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.250> right<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:45.020> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
way up like this head and right here the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.060 
way up like this head and right here the
size<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.289> exactly<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.340> same<00:00:48.050> six<00:00:49.050> point<00:00:49.379> four

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
size is exactly the same six point four

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.639 
size is exactly the same six point four
point<00:00:50.129> 65<00:00:50.700> inch<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.079> see<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> same

okay<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.179> is<00:01:48.299> mine<00:01:48.830> I<00:01:49.830> think<00:01:50.670> this

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
okay which one is mine I think this

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.899 
okay which one is mine I think this
certainly<00:01:51.750> no<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.679> one<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.890> mine<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.759> this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
certainly no this one is mine but this

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:03.649 
certainly no this one is mine but this
can<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.209> a<00:01:54.240> 4.0<00:01:54.959> so<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.289> CPU<00:01:56.190> a<00:02:01.190> 65<00:02:02.190> 75<00:02:02.789> so<00:02:03.479> yeah

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
can be a 4.0 so the CPU a 65 75 so yeah

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.109 
can be a 4.0 so the CPU a 65 75 so yeah
here's<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.229> dual-core<00:02:04.830> cortex<00:02:05.250> a9<00:02:05.789> in<00:02:05.940> here

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
here's a dual-core cortex a9 in here

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.359 
here's a dual-core cortex a9 in here
right<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:07.020> costs<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.409> 500<00:02:08.130> something

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
right and that costs like 500 something

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.509 
right and that costs like 500 something
at<00:02:08.729> USD<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.420> here<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.410> single<00:02:10.860> core<00:02:11.069> cortex

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
at USD and here is a single core cortex

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.360 
at USD and here is a single core cortex
a9<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.299> latest<00:02:12.480> media<00:02:13.290> tech<00:02:13.650> with<00:02:14.340> a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
a9 so it's the latest media tech with a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.740 
a9 so it's the latest media tech with a
dual<00:02:14.700> SIM<00:02:15.000> card<00:02:15.320> can<00:02:16.320> we<00:02:16.410> open<00:02:16.530> open<00:02:17.430> okay<00:02:17.750> here

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
dual SIM card can we open open okay here

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.539 
dual SIM card can we open open okay here
not<00:02:18.900> me<00:02:19.109> open<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.440> yeah<00:02:19.980> we<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.150> open<00:02:21.299> here<00:02:22.549> can

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
900 mb and I where change it into column

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.199 
900 mb and I where change it into column
let's<00:03:08.190> do<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.520> calculation<00:03:09.350> 900<00:03:10.350> /<00:03:10.950> 6.3<00:03:11.940> and

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
let's do it calculation 900 / 6.3 and

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.570 
let's do it calculation 900 / 6.3 and
you<00:03:12.300> think<00:03:12.510> faster<00:03:13.080> can<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.319> do<00:03:13.410> it

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
you think faster can you do it

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
you think faster can you do it
calculation<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.790> while<00:03:15.000> they<00:03:15.120> do<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.270> I'm

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
calculation and while they do that I'm

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.830 
calculation and while they do that I'm
going<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.780> reboot<00:03:16.610> put<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:17.760> phone<00:03:19.610> mediatek
