to try something today but I'm scared
that<00:02:31.080> my<00:02:31.590> hair<00:02:31.800> before<00:02:31.950> off<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.910> I'm<00:02:33.060> thinking

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
that my hair before off and I'm thinking

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.500 
that my hair before off and I'm thinking
like<00:02:33.450> okay<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:33.900> natural<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:35.069> mean<00:02:35.940> it

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
like okay it's natural so I mean it

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.140

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.479 
might damage my hair I'm sitting I'm

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
thinking compared to a relaxed hair it

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.870 
thinking compared to a relaxed hair it
might<00:02:42.150> not<00:02:42.360> be<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:43.010> lot<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.160> damage<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.700> I'll

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
might not be a lot of damage and I'll

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.340 
might not be a lot of damage and I'll
just<00:02:45.060> keep<00:02:45.269> putting<00:02:45.510> conditioner<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.200> my<00:02:46.230> hair
