you<00:02:16.090> go<00:02:16.239> back<00:02:16.420> upstairs<00:02:16.870> with<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.500> items<00:02:17.830> you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
you go back upstairs with the items you

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.740 
you go back upstairs with the items you
find<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.519> you<00:02:18.640> kind<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.180> like<00:02:19.330> search<00:02:19.599> around

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
find and you kind of like search around

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.740 
find and you kind of like search around
for<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.410> dig<00:02:20.799> a<00:02:20.830> hole<00:02:21.099> until<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.239> get<00:02:22.510> a

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
for it and dig a hole until you get a

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.690 
for it and dig a hole until you get a
key<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.170> that's<00:02:23.709> how<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.920> open<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.250> door<00:02:24.280> or

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
key and that's how you open the door or

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.120 
key and that's how you open the door or
the<00:02:25.180> beacons<00:02:25.720> part<00:02:26.049> it<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.410> get<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.620> little<00:02:26.860> bit

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
the beacons part it can get a little bit

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.690 
the beacons part it can get a little bit
tricky<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:27.849> it<00:02:28.750> helps<00:02:29.110> if<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.440> go<00:02:29.700> north

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
tricky so it helps if you go north

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.470 
tricky so it helps if you go north
straight<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.510> south<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.489> west<00:02:33.489> straight<00:02:34.150> east

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
straight to south and west straight east

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.920 
straight to south and west straight east
oh<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.560> forgot<00:02:35.829> watch<00:02:36.489> out<00:02:36.730> for<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.120> unset<00:02:37.540> bras

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
oh I forgot watch out for the unset bras

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.220 
oh I forgot watch out for the unset bras
because<00:02:38.590> if<00:02:39.579> they<00:02:39.819> sniff<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.390> out<00:02:40.450> they<00:02:40.840> send

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
because if they sniff you out they send

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.979 
because if they sniff you out they send
you<00:02:41.470> back<00:02:42.250> into<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.670> castle<00:02:42.849> into<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.630> little

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
you back into the castle into the little

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.589 
you back into the castle into the little
jail<00:02:44.230> area<00:02:44.709> I<00:02:44.980> mean<00:02:45.519> it's<00:02:45.760> no<00:02:45.970> problem<00:02:46.299> so<00:02:46.540> you

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
jail area I mean it's no problem so you

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.620 
jail area I mean it's no problem so you
could<00:02:46.810> just<00:02:46.930> take<00:02:47.410> your<00:02:47.530> way<00:02:47.680> back<00:02:47.920> out<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:49.390> get

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
could just take your way back out to get

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.410 
could just take your way back out to get
into<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.200> castle<00:02:50.410> seem<00:02:51.040> pretty<00:02:51.730> tricky<00:02:52.120> but

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
into the castle seem pretty tricky but

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.240 
into the castle seem pretty tricky but
it's<00:02:52.540> actually<00:02:52.720> really<00:02:53.110> easy<00:02:53.230> all<00:02:53.859> you<00:02:54.069> have

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
it's actually really easy all you have

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.940 
it's actually really easy all you have
to<00:02:54.430> do<00:02:54.609> is<00:02:54.880> kill<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.239> armored<00:02:55.630> zombie<00:02:56.019> take

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
to do is kill the armored zombie take

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.460 
to do is kill the armored zombie take
the<00:02:57.100> code<00:02:57.340> click<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.120> open<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.630> wrote<00:02:59.109> my<00:02:59.260> coat

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
the code click it open I wrote my coat

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.160 
the code click it open I wrote my coat
down<00:02:59.709> to<00:03:00.489> make<00:03:00.579> it<00:03:00.730> easier<00:03:01.060> then<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:01.959> click

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
down to make it easier then you click

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.500 
down to make it easier then you click
the<00:03:02.319> door<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.859> there's<00:03:03.489> going<00:03:03.639> to<00:03:03.700> be<00:03:03.760> run

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
the door and there's going to be run

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.890 
the door and there's going to be run
through<00:03:04.750> for<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.760> pretty<00:03:07.000> much<00:03:07.090> drag<00:03:07.720> them

through for you pretty much drag them

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.610 
through for you pretty much drag them
over<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.530> what<00:03:08.680> your<00:03:08.829> code<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:10.620> where

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
over to what your code is and where

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.789 
over to what your code is and where
there's<00:03:11.829> like<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.069> little<00:03:12.310> open<00:03:12.700> box<00:03:13.650> it's<00:03:14.650> a

there's like a little open box it's a
number<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:16.150> just<00:03:16.329> put<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.989> numbers<00:03:17.350> in

number and you just put the numbers in

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.800 
number and you just put the numbers in
for<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.250> password<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.880> then<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.120> door<00:03:19.329> opens<00:03:19.630> I

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
for a password and then the door opens I

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.479 
for a password and then the door opens I
saw<00:03:20.260> some<00:03:20.470> people<00:03:20.560> having<00:03:20.980> trouble<00:03:21.310> getting

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
saw some people having trouble getting

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.360 
saw some people having trouble getting
the<00:03:21.940> heat<00:03:22.150> gloat<00:03:22.420> all<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.260> could<00:03:23.530> do<00:03:23.680> is<00:03:23.709> run

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
the heat gloat all you could do is run

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.509 
the heat gloat all you could do is run
out<00:03:24.579> pass<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.420> iron<00:03:25.600> dragons<00:03:26.430> under<00:03:27.430> the

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
out pass the iron dragons under the

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.199 
out pass the iron dragons under the
archway<00:03:27.870> go<00:03:28.870> through<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.730> up<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.910> stairs

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
archway go through that up the stairs

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
and then down the trap door and it's I

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.330 
and then down the trap door and it's I
think<00:03:37.390> it<00:03:37.750> was<00:03:37.840> on<00:03:37.990> the<00:03:38.140> right<00:03:38.320> side<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.950> just

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
think it was on the right side you just

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.970 
think it was on the right side you just
pick<00:03:40.270> it<00:03:40.300> up<00:03:41.070> bring<00:03:42.070> it<00:03:42.160> back<00:03:42.460> to<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.730> plateau

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
pick it up bring it back to the plateau

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.080 
pick it up bring it back to the plateau
you<00:03:44.980> make<00:03:45.130> sure<00:03:45.370> you're<00:03:45.550> wearing<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.910> bring

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
you make sure you're wearing the bring

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.160 
you make sure you're wearing the bring
of<00:03:46.210> your<00:03:46.360> stability<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:48.930> shouldn't<00:03:49.930> melt

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
of your stability and it shouldn't melt

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.160 
of your stability and it shouldn't melt
open<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.710> door<00:03:51.210> also<00:03:52.210> don't<00:03:52.600> forget<00:03:52.660> to<00:03:52.900> hang

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
gives you a safe passage so you don't

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.250 
gives you a safe passage so you don't
keep<00:04:00.160> running<00:04:00.430> through<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.880> wild<00:04:01.270> it<00:04:02.020> makes

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
keep running through the wild it makes

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.230 
keep running through the wild it makes
it<00:04:02.440> really<00:04:02.710> easy<00:04:02.860> if<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.460> die<00:04:03.760> during<00:04:04.060> the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
it really easy if you die during the

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.310 
it really easy if you die during the
quest<00:04:04.510> like<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:05.080> did<00:04:05.350> um<00:04:06.750> so<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.840> can<00:04:08.020> just<00:04:08.050> get

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
quest like I did um so you can just get

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.040 
quest like I did um so you can just get
back<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.590> your<00:04:08.680> grave<00:04:08.980> really<00:04:09.430> quickly<00:04:10.060> you

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
back to your grave really quickly you

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.560 
back to your grave really quickly you
use<00:04:11.380> from<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:11.950> GE<00:04:12.190> you<00:04:12.550> go<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.760> edgeville<00:04:13.209> then

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
use from the GE you go to edgeville then

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.890 
use from the GE you go to edgeville then
you<00:04:13.690> use<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:14.140> very<00:04:14.380> code<00:04:14.910> dks<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.720> go

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
you use the very code dks you go

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.920 
you use the very code dks you go
northwest<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.370> have<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.850> book<00:04:19.030> for<00:04:19.780> the
