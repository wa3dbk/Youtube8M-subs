00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
they stretch out a lot and it's like I

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.890 
they stretch out a lot and it's like I
have<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.490> wear<00:04:33.640> like<00:04:33.790> six<00:04:34.180> pairs<00:04:34.450> of<00:04:34.600> socks

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
have to wear like six pairs of socks

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.840 
have to wear like six pairs of socks
it's<00:04:35.230> really<00:04:35.590> quite<00:04:35.800> ridiculous<00:04:36.010> so<00:04:36.730> they're

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
it's really quite ridiculous so they're

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.550 
it's really quite ridiculous so they're
not<00:04:36.940> like<00:04:37.150> wobbling<00:04:37.510> around<00:04:37.630> and<00:04:38.110> I<00:04:38.260> think

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
not like wobbling around and I think

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.140 
not like wobbling around and I think
that's<00:04:38.740> also<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.190> reason<00:04:39.220> why<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.700> backs

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
that's also the reason why the backs

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.660 
that's also the reason why the backs
ripped<00:04:40.450> off<00:04:40.570> so<00:04:40.810> easily<00:04:41.070> because<00:04:42.070> I<00:04:42.220> do<00:04:42.280> dance

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670

ripped off so easily because I do dance
so<00:04:42.970> much<00:04:43.150> when<00:04:43.390> i<00:04:43.450> get<00:04:43.600> to<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.840> club<00:04:44.050> my<00:04:44.170> go-to

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
so much when i get to the club my go-to

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.980 
so much when i get to the club my go-to
i<00:04:44.680> literally<00:04:45.250> danced<00:04:45.460> all<00:04:45.700> night<00:04:46.240> long<00:04:46.420> and<00:04:46.660> I

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990

do<00:04:47.050> that<00:04:47.350> avidly<00:04:47.740> almost<00:04:48.040> every<00:04:48.250> weekend<00:04:48.640> so

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
do that avidly almost every weekend so

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.030 
do that avidly almost every weekend so
it's<00:04:49.060> like<00:04:49.210> if<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.510> shoes<00:04:49.780> have<00:04:50.260> stretched

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
it's like if the shoes have stretched

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.130 
it's like if the shoes have stretched
out<00:04:51.310> to<00:04:51.340> where<00:04:51.670> they're<00:04:51.820> bigger<00:04:52.450> on<00:04:52.660> my<00:04:52.840> feet

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
out to where they're bigger on my feet

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.840 
out to where they're bigger on my feet
and<00:04:53.680> I'm<00:04:53.800> only<00:04:53.920> wearing<00:04:54.070> one<00:04:54.220> or<00:04:54.430> two<00:04:54.550> pairs<00:04:54.730> of

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
socks me dancing the way I do I think

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.940
