00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.400
 I hope you are great welcome 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.049
 to the new day and today I'm going to customize a 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.059
 shirt you know what to customize shirts 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.400
 is one of my diego and favorites because 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.540
 I really wear them a lot, we're going to 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.139
 start with the materials that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.139
 we need 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.519
 a shirt and a tie of color that you 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.109
 like what I 'm going to do basically is 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.300
 add a sporty touch to this 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.579
 shirt by simply adding some 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.529
 strip the classic strips like adidas that 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.419
 there are three good dashes to diaz possible 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.030
 add those adidas or adidas hairline 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.579
 on the front the idea is going to be 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.710
 create three lines with this with this loop 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.269
 a line like this another below parallel and 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.829
 another one below for the event comes first 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.170
 What I have done has been to put on my shirt 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.820
 to be sure where it was the best 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.980
 place to start placing the first 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.049
 of the strips then I marked with 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.000
 help from a chalk where would be the place 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.619
 suitable to start before starting 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.629
 to sew there is a previous step that is going to 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.920
 facilitate then very much those that do not 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.900
 have sewing machine you can also 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.720
 use tissue glue and you go 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.790
 phenomenal also the idea is that 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.189
 first put the strips right on your 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.860
 place with the help of some pins and 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.270
 you are just going to place the tape 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.670
 in the place that you want that then 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.380
 be fixed when you pass the machine 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.240
 once I have placed it with the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.040
 You have to look at how you 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.689
 You put on your shirt and you look at each other 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.570
 in front of a mirror I curiously 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.280
 when I was looking at my original idea 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.630
 stripes here and you go here but suddenly 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.730
 he tells me that there was a lot more 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.500
 original make it asymmetrical and also that 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.480
 will load a lot less tests you 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.040
 I put another loop around here in this other 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.440
 side to be too overloaded 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.150
 whereas if I leave it like this it will be 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.920
 a more subtle touch this was thinking 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.300
 I do not know what it will look like to you 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.310
 make it totally asymmetric 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.770
 example create these three details here and 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.810
 in the fist of the shirt on the other side or 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.120
 be from the opposite side truth to catch and 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.370
 place here that looks like a red strip 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.660
 as detailed here in the fist with this 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.130
 it's edges and I'm going to do it or not 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.210
 moment I'm going to start with the machine 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.460
 sew as I say you can use 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.050
 also glue for tissue and we're going to 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.550
 see how we are doing instead of with 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.930
 only by the two laterals I'm going to thing not 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.060
 for the central part because I think that 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.829
 it can stay until original 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.270
 Well, girls, I'm going to tell them the 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.209
 end of all this story that is that 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.739
 it's very good, because in the end I 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.170
 I launched to sew what was 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.569
 counting on sewing on the sleeve in what 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.970
 It is the cuff in Conserve 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.739
 the tie ideally right now that already 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.989
 had picked up the machine is said pin 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.640
 everything is more there all phenomenal me 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.739
 I will speak head and I tend account 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.090
 that he had sewn on the same side 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.880
 where the other side instead of doing it 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.380
 Asymmetric I 've done it as very 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.690
 asymmetric but super asymmetrical go 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.250
 but I know what I had to take the machine 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.630
 and changed a laziness to remove removes 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.420
 Robert to put another side is that he does 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.799
 very hot, so I'm not going to 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.330
 be at the end and I do not know how you see it 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.940
 I see very cute seems of a shirt 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.799
 original this shirt I bought it in prima 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.360
 it cost me six euros 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.269
 I have to say that it's not a shirt that 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.310
 Say the fabric have super silky fabric 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.470
 because I noticed a super silky tissue but 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.730
 Well, it gives you enough to hit and more 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.830
 when we have put this little one 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.450
 decorative detail that really remain 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.610
 Well I hope you liked the idea 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.930
 I hope that way he spies on us 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.640
 thank you very much for having me if you like 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.930
 the video fingers up and see you 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.930
