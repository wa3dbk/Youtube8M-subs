00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
the emblem on the gas tank and basically

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.040 
the emblem on the gas tank and basically
made<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.070> bigger<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.790> airbrushed<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.600> onto

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.170 
made it bigger and airbrushed it onto
the<00:00:34.170> windscreen<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.860> that's<00:00:35.700> how<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.969> turned

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the windscreen and that's how it turned

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.810 
the windscreen and that's how it turned
out<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.660> think<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.020> turned<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:37.290> pretty<00:00:37.530> good

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.319 

and<00:00:41.820> I'll<00:00:41.969> show<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.180> guys<00:00:42.270> I'm<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.320> gas<00:00:43.469> tank<00:00:43.739> so

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329

and I'll show you guys I'm a gas tank so
yeah<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> think<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:46.280> turned<00:00:47.280> out<00:00:47.399> exactly<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
yeah I think it turned out exactly the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.610 
yeah I think it turned out exactly the
same<00:00:48.030> if<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> ask<00:00:48.629> me<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.050> let<00:00:49.289> me<00:00:49.379> know<00:00:49.500> what

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
you guys think and then that is the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.990 
you guys think and then that is the
stock<00:00:52.170> windscreen<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.370> also<00:00:53.730> maybe<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.940> guys

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
stock windscreen and also maybe you guys

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.430 
stock windscreen and also maybe you guys
might<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.210> wondering<00:00:54.329> why<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.110> hot

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
might be wondering why it's not hot

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.130 
might be wondering why it's not hot
bodies<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.600> it's<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.719> because<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.020> want

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
bodies one and it's not because I want

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.170 
bodies one and it's not because I want
to<00:00:58.260> paint<00:00:58.530> over<00:00:58.710> our<00:00:58.770> hot<00:00:58.920> bodies<00:00:59.309> that's<00:01:00.030> not

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
to paint over our hot bodies that's not

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.900 
to paint over our hot bodies that's not
the<00:01:00.300> problem<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:01.109> because<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:02.010> melted<00:01:02.430> it's

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the problem it's because it melted it's

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.890 
the problem it's because it melted it's
just<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:05.030> because<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> aftermarket<00:01:06.570> wind

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
just so because the aftermarket wind

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.620 
just so because the aftermarket wind
screens<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.070> softer<00:01:08.490> material<00:01:09.030> than<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
screens are of softer material than the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.870 
screens are of softer material than the
stock<00:01:10.170> ones<00:01:10.470> they<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.220> more<00:01:11.460> sensitive<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
stock ones they are more sensitive to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.070 
stock ones they are more sensitive to
heat<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.420> when<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> got<00:01:12.780> thrown<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.260> here

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
heat so when I got thrown on the here

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.510 
heat so when I got thrown on the here
it's<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:17.210> yeah<00:01:18.240> melted<00:01:18.979> that's<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it's just yeah melted that's that and
