jacket and again this is where a bone

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.830 
jacket and again this is where a bone
folder<00:02:26.519> comes<00:02:26.879> in<00:02:27.030> really<00:02:27.180> handy<00:02:27.300> because<00:02:27.690> you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
folder comes in really handy because you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.640

want to put another sharp crease in that

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:51.679 
want to put another sharp crease in that
edge

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:03:06.890 

like<00:02:52.689> so<00:02:55.950> once<00:02:56.950> that's<00:02:57.280> done<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:04.540> put<00:03:05.079> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
like so once that's done you can put the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.000 
like so once that's done you can put the
jacket<00:03:07.900> back<00:03:08.260> on<00:03:08.469> the<00:03:08.560> book<00:03:08.799> now<00:03:09.489> in<00:03:09.639> its<00:03:09.760> cover

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
what I really like about this is how

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.149 
what I really like about this is how
little<00:03:13.239> wastage<00:03:13.629> there<00:03:13.810> is<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.829> know<00:03:14.889> this

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
little wastage there is you know this

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:21.239 
little wastage there is you know this
there's<00:03:15.430> no<00:03:16.139> off<00:03:17.139> cut<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.849> that's<00:03:19.030> it
