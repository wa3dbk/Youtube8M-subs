00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.049
 Hall people and welcome to one 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.320
 further episode of our plugin tutorial 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.960
 line 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.720
 you ask determines you why does 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.760
 now a video 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.949
 so I thought I can tell you one 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.660
 Whole week without a tutorial leave 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.279
 so we make the whole in today 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.480
 I look because it is not that way anymore 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.310
 important because I now times as much time 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.790
 have it already evening as and 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.050
 Monday evening months away and that's why 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.440
 relatively fast and maybe recognize 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.829
 beautiful 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.090
 we introduce ourselves / tel command 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.860
 Can we give a player a specific one 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.789
 Write your own message and what 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.460
 see another 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.809
 First of all, put a string on us 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.980
 string message we say is the same as 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.500
 just nothing when we go 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.559
 would write with it 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:04.040
 are therefore such gänsefüßchen 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:10.680
 just like that, and now is point long 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:13.260
 greater than greater than or equal to one 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.119
 consider 0 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.340
 we need at least one player 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.619
 after that and who the message then 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.880
 bigger maybe two and then say 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.689
 we player target is shaking point 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.689
 player 10 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.040
 So the first thing that will give it 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.820
 our player and now we look up 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.820
 target does not start at zero money 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.780
 Whether the game is online at all 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.420
 when he is not online 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:52.970
 we just send the message that 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.970
 player is not online 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.159
 but if he is on then we have to 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:10.660
 Now assemble us our message 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:15.860
 and before and is equal to 1 as long 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:21.530
 less than arx complex we say e plus 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.930
 plus that means we start with 1 different 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.440
 as the cs 0 could not with that means 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.330
 our players will not say that for a long time 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.400
 as long as many would stop 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.980
 then he should be the plus plus one then 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:41.230
 let's say message equal message 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.230
 plus a blank 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:51.830
 message equal message plus plus 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.780
 blank and that we pick ourselves 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.850
 simply our message at the moment 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.860
 the beginning has nothing then we say 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.510
 the message is equal to the message plus 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.250
 that word which always gets you out 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.690
 becomes and plus a blank and then 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.350
 very important now outside of the above 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.400
 loop 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:22.010
 let's just say psn like that 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:27.640
 message we are doing this already 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:46.030
 color codes from me to target point 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:48.100
 goes to § 8 and then zack plus message 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.380
 sign that means we just say 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.049
 because days took tomcat and then here the 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.450
 message and the target we have to 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:02.380
 Of course, also send a message and 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:11.120
 Although point game plus 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:13.040
 and he is here again this beautiful 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.780
 I have been able to show it very okay 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.549
 despite this beautiful force 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.650
 sign and then plus message again like that 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.430
 and then we'll just say message below 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.290
 we learn to say the whole thing and we 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.430
 that would be the whole already done that 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:34.220
 we do not need him here at all 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.320
 Zack Zack Zack Zack is real now 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.770
 also a really really small 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.000
 of course we need tutorial already 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.870
 what they did 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.520
 just the discount off yes, just like me 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.350
 have said because we already on Tannaitic 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.450
 and no longer considered a week 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.990
 without knowing why not like one 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.990
 come day 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:10.099
 of course I am just standing again 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:10.099
 staying in shape on the hose in the hotel 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.330
 so save 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.060
 and now the finger away the whole 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.830
 Of course everything is already registered 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.069
 and we try that out i already have 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.479
 times a minecraft account correctly 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:28.319
 opened up and I try the whole 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:30.509
 of course only for testing purposes therefore 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:35.539

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:41.460
