00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.500
 of the virtual help desk channel and this video 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.230
 Guys, I'll show you how you do it. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.820
 to find out what the installation key is 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.430
 of your windows 10 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.270
 this serves both for 12 10 and for 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.470
 windows 8 in 27 xbe also programs 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.260
 office of microsoft general office and 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.520
 visual microsoft hotel problems 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.970
 that are to be installed solutions 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.489
 computer is because I decided to do it 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.210
 of this video doorman I climbed a quagmire 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.280
 from the quays recently you have to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.570
 be wary of showing how to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.969
 manual installation of the universal and who 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.180
 booked the ad in the previous version the 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.520
 windows 7 windows 8 is you could 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.229
 update directly on the 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.390
 microsoft with the hotels 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.610
 when you upgrade the system 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.009
 install windows 10 but do not lose 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.100
 no key because it already uses the 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.440
 own key is from the previous system 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.860
 But then you have to know this key. 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.840
 why you can use it if you can 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.060
 need to install windows in the future 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 It's important to know if the key 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.990
 so I decided to make this video for 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.119
 show you how to do 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.700

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.130
 reserved for you to use in the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.430
 future we must use because it 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.000
 program I'll leave here is available 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.189

 it is to settle on nothing personal can only 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.320
 directly affect the visitation of the 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.320
 public here in this active favor 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.610
 ready and already brought here he would open 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:02.190
 My jawbone program here happens. 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.990
 he tries to talk only the training is 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.380
 finite natives own you say 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.880
 consider history is not a program 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.880
 is already installed on windows 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.650
 most important here is off you can 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.340
 store the training that will enter 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.040
 information and the product key is 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.140
 What we need is that windows 10 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.360
 own version that I have a climb 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.120
 that it brings the product identification 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.960
 and who's next, then it's that personal 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.590
 you already know the product key 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.900
 windows key you are using 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.840
 in other years microsoft is now 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.900
 as it does to store I can said 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.480
 that the option being and will be Czech there 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.750
 You'll have the option to save the 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:53.360
 text file save here in the area of 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.360
 I work late 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:03.860
 He appears here and sees there already. 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:06.439
 everything there I recommend you save 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.810
 these files in another location not even 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:12.139
 that not only machine was in a pen 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.999
 drive in the cloud the head of the kidney 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.889
 here you have the right to use 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.499
 when you need to install windows 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.779
 again okay so this is it personal this 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:22.490
 The tip I want to spend today is that I 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:25.520
 I think it is important to suppose that I 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.529
 I wanted to go up and it's not I did not find it 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.719
 easy way apart from this program that 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.330
 is very useful and very simple to be 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:35.240
 doubts about how the 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.639
 comments that I will respond to all 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.889

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:43.500
