00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.400
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.619
 I'm building my new tutorial today 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.619
 doclx the front wheel again 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.369
 The first preparation will be courts 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.529
 frames talent apart 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.980
 for this a piece of meat falls in love 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.980
 eat 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.619
 so I put the distance boxes 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.519
 the wheel hub the longer to the right the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.519
 shorter to the left 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.750
 Raise the wheel brake caliper 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.750
 thread 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.760
 The wheel hub with cable tempo ructions 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:33.459
 fists into an escape then bring the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.599
 cleaned and freshly greased axle 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.599
 by sending 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.420
 then I press the curves of the right one 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.040
 brake caliper apart and stuck 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.040
 Carefully on the brake disc 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.970
 you are screwing the caliper 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.610
 unscrew these screws 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.590
 should be renewed during their disassembly 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.970
 be screwed through there but in 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.950
 I simply use it 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.730
 look at security funds and these 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.730
 secure again 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.250
 Now you can screw the 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.250
 turn a front axle 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.390
 and tighten slightly 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.430
 before I screw the axle clamp 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.860
 I watch the motorcycle tighten 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.350
 put the motorcycle vertically and 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.729
 by the operation of the front brake 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.130
 I leave the fork a few times a 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.600
 feathers 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.880
 This puts the axle in the 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:07.160
 digging fists become tense 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.160
 balanced or avoided 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.800
 I pull the ax clamp screw 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.800
 easy on 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.830
 The screw should be 59 newton meters 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.830
 be attracted 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:01.349
 The ax when screwing should be with 220 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.349
 Newton meter dressed 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:19.919
 also the bolts of the brake caliper itself 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:19.919
 stuck with 22 newton meters 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.720
 As always important after the work is done 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:30.160
 control everything again and piece 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.160
 a trial ride nothing in the way
