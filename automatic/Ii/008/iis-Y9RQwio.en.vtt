innovation<00:00:25.060> isn't<00:00:25.210> necessarily<00:00:25.720> a<00:00:26.199> common

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
innovation isn't necessarily a common

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.320 
innovation isn't necessarily a common
word<00:00:27.070> but<00:00:27.550> that's<00:00:27.789> what<00:00:27.910> we<00:00:28.000> pride<00:00:28.210> ourselves

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
word but that's what we pride ourselves

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.540 
word but that's what we pride ourselves
on<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:28.869> so<00:00:28.960> when<00:00:29.590> we<00:00:29.619> decided<00:00:30.039> to<00:00:30.099> do<00:00:30.220> high<00:00:30.369> but

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
on and so when we decided to do high but

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.380 
on and so when we decided to do high but
we<00:00:30.640> wanted<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:30.880> do<00:00:30.970> something<00:00:31.240> that<00:00:31.300> was

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
we wanted to do something that was

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.000 
we wanted to do something that was
actually<00:00:31.510> completely<00:00:31.960> different<00:00:32.410> from<00:00:32.890> the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
actually completely different from the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.740 
actually completely different from the
norm<00:00:33.220> of<00:00:33.400> what<00:00:33.580> you're<00:00:33.699> you're<00:00:34.180> used<00:00:34.390> to<00:00:34.570> but

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
norm of what you're you're used to but

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.290 
norm of what you're you're used to but
still<00:00:34.989> kind<00:00:35.140> of<00:00:35.199> feel<00:00:35.320> similar<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:37.030> probably

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
still kind of feel similar so probably

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.329 
still kind of feel similar so probably
the<00:00:37.420> biggest<00:00:37.629> thing<00:00:37.840> that<00:00:38.080> separates<00:00:38.530> hybrid

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
the biggest thing that separates hybrid

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.189 
the biggest thing that separates hybrid
is<00:00:39.489> its<00:00:39.879> combat<00:00:40.180> focus<00:00:40.330> movement<00:00:40.900> and<00:00:40.989> so<00:00:41.080> with

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
is its combat focus movement and so with

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:42.450 
is its combat focus movement and so with
combat<00:00:41.440> focus<00:00:41.559> movement<00:00:42.100> instead<00:00:42.309> of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
combat focus movement instead of

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.639 
combat focus movement instead of
controlling<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.719> movement<00:00:43.870> specifically

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
controlling the movement specifically

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.770 
controlling the movement specifically
you<00:00:45.190> just<00:00:45.399> look<00:00:45.730> at<00:00:45.790> a<00:00:45.850> cover<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:46.360> press<00:00:46.600> a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
you just look at a cover and press a

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.209 
you just look at a cover and press a
your<00:00:47.170> character<00:00:47.440> will<00:00:47.469> automatically<00:00:48.100> go

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
your character will automatically go

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.430 
your character will automatically go
there<00:00:48.460> if<00:00:49.360> you<00:00:49.420> press<00:00:49.570> B<00:00:49.780> they'll<00:00:50.320> actually

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
there if you press B they'll actually

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.650 
there if you press B they'll actually
retreat<00:00:50.980> and<00:00:51.250> you<00:00:51.969> can<00:00:52.090> actually<00:00:52.210> with<00:00:52.539> the

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
retreat and you can actually with the

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.229 
retreat and you can actually with the
left<00:00:52.899> stick<00:00:53.079> you<00:00:53.230> can<00:00:53.289> control<00:00:53.829> on<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:55.059> path

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
left stick you can control on the path

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.850 
left stick you can control on the path
where<00:00:55.510> they're<00:00:55.629> going<00:00:56.050> so<00:00:56.289> as<00:00:56.440> they're<00:00:56.649> flying

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
where they're going so as they're flying

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.680 
where they're going so as they're flying
to<00:00:57.100> cover<00:00:57.460> they<00:00:57.699> can<00:00:57.879> move<00:00:58.030> kind<00:00:58.270> of<00:00:58.329> strafe

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
to cover they can move kind of strafe

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.729 
to cover they can move kind of strafe
and<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.110> dodge<00:01:00.480> within<00:01:01.480> their<00:01:01.660> flight<00:01:01.899> the

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
and and dodge within their flight the

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.229 
and and dodge within their flight the
game<00:01:02.890> actually<00:01:03.039> doesn't<00:01:03.430> have<00:01:03.609> any<00:01:03.940> ground

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
game actually doesn't have any ground

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.150 
game actually doesn't have any ground
movement<00:01:04.660> except<00:01:05.379> for<00:01:05.410> strafing<00:01:05.740> within

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
movement except for strafing within

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.000 
movement except for strafing within
cover

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.070 

while<00:01:12.700> you're<00:01:12.940> moving<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:13.600> can<00:01:13.750> actually

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
while you're moving you can actually

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.510 
while you're moving you can actually
change<00:01:14.290> directions<00:01:14.650> mid-flight<00:01:15.220> so<00:01:15.400> you're

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
change directions mid-flight so you're

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.520 
change directions mid-flight so you're
not<00:01:15.610> just<00:01:15.670> locked<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:16.390> one<00:01:16.570> cover<00:01:16.870> so<00:01:17.440> the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
not just locked to that one cover so the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.380 
not just locked to that one cover so the
very<00:01:17.680> very<00:01:17.740> fluid<00:01:18.100> very<00:01:18.280> very<00:01:18.460> intuitive<00:01:19.000> I'm

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
very very fluid very very intuitive I'm

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.780 
very very fluid very very intuitive I'm
very<00:01:19.600> very<00:01:19.660> simple<00:01:19.990> but<00:01:20.740> it<00:01:20.950> makes<00:01:21.160> a<00:01:21.280> strategy

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
very very simple but it makes a strategy

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.840 
very very simple but it makes a strategy
very<00:01:22.030> very<00:01:22.270> deep<00:01:22.480> because<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.920> fact<00:01:24.100> that<00:01:24.220> you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
very very deep because the fact that you

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.460 
very very deep because the fact that you
can't<00:01:25.060> just<00:01:25.360> go<00:01:25.510> anywhere<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:25.960> have<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.290> be

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
can't just go anywhere you have to be

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:36.720 
can't just go anywhere you have to be
very<00:01:26.590> purposeful<00:01:27.220> in<00:01:27.340> your<00:01:27.460> movement<00:01:35.730> what's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
very purposeful in your movement what's

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.860 
very purposeful in your movement what's
really<00:01:36.910> cool<00:01:37.090> about<00:01:37.180> this<00:01:37.420> game<00:01:37.660> is<00:01:37.690> that

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
really cool about this game is that

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.820 
really cool about this game is that
because<00:01:38.170> we<00:01:38.680> have<00:01:38.980> kind<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:39.970> a<00:01:40.650> focused<00:01:41.650> kind

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
because we have kind of a focused kind

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.969 
because we have kind of a focused kind
of<00:01:41.920> movement<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:43.150> can<00:01:43.330> allow<00:01:43.720> people<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.170> go<00:01:44.950> to

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
of movement we can allow people to go to

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.969 
of movement we can allow people to go to
upside<00:01:45.430> down<00:01:45.550> cover<00:01:45.790> or<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.180> wall<00:01:46.360> cover

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
upside down cover or to wall cover

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.870 
upside down cover or to wall cover
seamlessly<00:01:47.979> without<00:01:48.100> any<00:01:48.370> problems<00:01:48.700> so<00:01:48.790> they

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
seamlessly without any problems so they

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
seamlessly without any problems so they
just<00:01:48.910> select<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.510> they'll<00:01:49.630> go<00:01:49.660> and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
just select it and they'll go and

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.620 
just select it and they'll go and
they'll<00:01:49.990> go<00:01:50.050> upside<00:01:50.350> down<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:52.030> also<00:01:52.240> have<00:01:52.600> a

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
they'll go upside down we also have a

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.620 
they'll go upside down we also have a
killstreak<00:01:53.470> system<00:01:53.920> called<00:01:54.370> drone<00:01:54.640> and<00:01:55.540> so

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
killstreak system called drone and so

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.880 
killstreak system called drone and so
you've<00:01:55.720> seen<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:55.900> few<00:01:56.050> of<00:01:56.110> them<00:01:56.229> before<00:01:56.560> this<00:01:56.650> is

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
you've seen a few of them before this is

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.440 
you've seen a few of them before this is
kind<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.190> like<00:01:57.250> robot<00:01:57.670> looking<00:01:57.910> characters

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
kind of like robot looking characters

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
actually using the source engine so this

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.990 
actually using the source engine so this
is<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.799> this<00:04:10.919> isn't<00:04:11.099> a<00:04:11.220> homegrown<00:04:11.549> engine<00:04:11.819> but

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
is it this isn't a homegrown engine but

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.580 
is it this isn't a homegrown engine but
it's<00:04:12.120> heavily<00:04:12.299> modified<00:04:12.629> is<00:04:12.989> actually

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
it's heavily modified is actually

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.990 
it's heavily modified is actually
running<00:04:13.650> 60<00:04:14.069> frames<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.340> second<00:04:14.669> we<00:04:14.730> actually

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
running 60 frames a second we actually

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.879 
running 60 frames a second we actually
thought<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.359> with<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.019> multiplayer<00:04:16.620> shooter

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
thought that with a multiplayer shooter

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.580 
thought that with a multiplayer shooter
that's<00:04:17.190> really<00:04:17.639> important<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.900> get<00:04:19.349> the<00:04:19.470> kind

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
that's really important to get the kind

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.060 
that's really important to get the kind
of<00:04:19.739> smooth<00:04:20.099> gameplay<00:04:20.940> going<00:04:21.389> and<00:04:21.740> so<00:04:22.740> we<00:04:22.860> spend

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
of smooth gameplay going and so we spend

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.790 
of smooth gameplay going and so we spend
a<00:04:23.130> lot<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.310> time<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:24.030> know<00:04:24.380> optimizing<00:04:25.380> and

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
a lot of time you know optimizing and

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.110 
a lot of time you know optimizing and
