usually use this I'll be showing you a
small<00:00:45.170> version<00:00:45.649> small<00:00:46.190> scale<00:00:46.460> version<00:00:46.820> of

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
small version small scale version of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.200 
small version small scale version of
this<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:47.810> that<00:00:48.079> if<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:49.370> want<00:00:49.610> to<00:00:49.820> make<00:00:50.030> it

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
this so that if you want to make it

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.910 
this so that if you want to make it
bigger<00:00:50.420> just<00:00:50.780> need<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:51.050> duplicator<00:00:51.530> and

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
bigger just need to duplicator and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.330 
bigger just need to duplicator and
double<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.850> recipe<00:00:53.829> so<00:00:54.829> what<00:00:55.160> we're<00:00:55.280> gonna

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
double the recipe so what we're gonna

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.220 
double the recipe so what we're gonna
use<00:00:55.460> um<00:00:56.410> for<00:00:57.410> this<00:00:57.559> mostly<00:00:58.489> is<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:58.850> EZ<00:00:59.780> weld

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
use um for this mostly is the EZ weld

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.770 
use um for this mostly is the EZ weld

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
this as you can see it at the width and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.990 
this as you can see it at the width and
not<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:14.479> length<00:01:14.979> click<00:01:15.979> that<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.460> it<00:01:16.790> will

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
not the length click that and it will

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.539 
not the length click that and it will
get<00:01:17.180> this<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:18.530> want<00:01:18.680> to<00:01:18.740> bring<00:01:18.920> over<00:01:19.010> here<00:01:19.369> to

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
get this you want to bring over here to

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.950 
get this you want to bring over here to
your<00:01:19.670> second<00:01:20.090> one<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:20.420> bring<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:20.659> to<00:01:20.840> the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
your second one and bring it to the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.859 
your second one and bring it to the
middle<00:01:21.729> make<00:01:22.729> sure<00:01:22.940> that<00:01:23.090> it<00:01:23.210> is<00:01:23.299> aligned<00:01:23.690> by

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
middle make sure that it is aligned by

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.359 
middle make sure that it is aligned by
putting<00:01:24.200> it<00:01:24.260> on<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.500> side<00:01:24.710> checking<00:01:25.130> it<00:01:25.250> out

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
putting it on the side checking it out

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.270 
putting it on the side checking it out
then<00:01:25.909> moving<00:01:26.330> up<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.659> top<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.229> center<00:01:27.830> it

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
then moving up to the top and center it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.130 
then moving up to the top and center it
together<00:01:28.729> like<00:01:29.000> this<00:01:31.420> if<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.750> have<00:01:32.960> any

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
together like this if you have any

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.990 
together like this if you have any
problems<00:01:33.619> for<00:01:33.770> whatever<00:01:33.979> reason<00:01:34.520> go<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.729> toy

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
problems for whatever reason go to toy

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.280 
problems for whatever reason go to toy
box<00:01:35.299> and<00:01:35.619> search<00:01:37.000> on<00:01:38.000> weld<00:01:40.810> again<00:01:41.810> well<00:01:42.049> there

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
box and search on weld again well there

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.899 
box and search on weld again well there
this<00:01:43.040> is<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.430> tool<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:43.700> will<00:01:44.060> let<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:44.509> up

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
this is the tool that will let you up

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.310 
this is the tool that will let you up
will<00:01:46.909> not<00:01:47.060> use<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:47.299> move<00:01:47.720> use<00:01:47.960> that<00:01:48.140> right

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
will not use that move use that right

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.840 
will not use that move use that right
now<00:01:48.670> so<00:01:49.670> now<00:01:49.880> I'm<00:01:50.689> going<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.229> basically<00:01:52.040> make

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
now so now I'm going to basically make

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.319 
now so now I'm going to basically make
the<00:01:53.030> structure<00:01:53.479> by<00:01:53.990> doing<00:01:54.380> this<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.950> bunch<00:01:55.670> of

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
the structure by doing this a bunch of

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.600 
the structure by doing this a bunch of
times<00:01:56.630> so<00:01:56.930> basically<00:01:57.439> you<00:01:57.650> just<00:01:57.680> keep<00:01:58.100> copying

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
times so basically you just keep copying

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.060 
times so basically you just keep copying
what<00:01:59.000> you're<00:01:59.180> doing<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.750> making<00:02:00.740> these

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
what you're doing and making these

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:16.020 
what you're doing and making these
things<00:02:01.369> go<00:02:01.640> on<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.790> side<00:02:02.500> for<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.560> walls

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.460 

I'll<00:02:16.300> be<00:02:16.540> right<00:02:16.660> back<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.140> I'll<00:02:17.230> show<00:02:17.440> you

I'll be right back and I'll show you

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.130 
I'll be right back and I'll show you
what<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.800> finished<00:02:17.950> product<00:02:18.490> is<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.750> purpose

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
what the finished product is the purpose

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.290 
what the finished product is the purpose
is<00:02:20.320> let<00:02:20.500> out<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.860> roof<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.610> Front's<00:02:22.090> that

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
is let out the roof and the Front's that

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.510 
is let out the roof and the Front's that
I<00:02:22.330> could<00:02:22.570> show<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.780> what<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.110> do<00:02:23.290> next<00:02:23.520> what

sure it's nice and centered and now you

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.300 
sure it's nice and centered and now you
have<00:02:34.390> your<00:02:34.420> roof<00:02:34.810> on<00:02:35.050> top<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.680> now<00:02:36.250> the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
on it to check if it's aligned just go

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.480 
on it to check if it's aligned just go
on<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.850> side<00:02:49.120> with<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.050> do<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.740> so

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
that you can check then just take it

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.930 
that you can check then just take it
like<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:56.310> keep<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.430> like<00:02:57.550> that

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
like that keep it like that

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.630 
like that keep it like that
dianna<00:02:58.420> kind<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.780> have<00:02:58.870> an<00:02:58.990> open<00:02:59.290> space<00:02:59.640> to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640
