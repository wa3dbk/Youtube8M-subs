00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.620
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.629
 I really like to be with you today 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.630
 talk about this little stick 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.370
 namely over the bridge of ran and 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.349
 this consists of a usb-stick 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.639
 on one side and on the other 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.470
 side we have a lightning 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.600
 connection to what this product quite 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.160
 that is exactly what you can learn after the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.160
 intro I wish you much fun 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.270
 first and foremost we clarify what they are 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.610
 is because we have the once here 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.170
 usb connection and as just mentioned the 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.480
 small lightning connection we 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.850
 of course in the iphone the ipod touch 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.320
 or even the ipad can get stuck and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.300
 Accordingly, you can already 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.150
 think what the idyllic is namely a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.370
 external memory for ios you can completely 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.250
 just plug this little stick 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.230
 to your device and then transfer data 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.420
 from the iphone or ipad and ipod touch 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.580
 on the stick or vice versa if 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.230
 her on the computer data on this 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.600
 you have loaded this then you can 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.040
 again on the device load 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.449
 and that works pretty well 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.860
 I'll show you again soon 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.739
 First and foremost, a few more 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.600
 facts this stick up to once in 64 gb 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.790
 like this one in my case 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.979
 This version is also natural 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.229
 also 16 and 32 and also 128 gb so that 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.479
 Of course, one needs to be used 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.729
 app will be installed on the ios device 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 and this is also called a bridge 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.320
 Available for free and you have it 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.939
 then a kind of file manager with the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.100
 then you simply transfer data 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.930
 can look at you and so on 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.820
 So next has its own app the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.640
 that does everything for you and from that on 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.500
 moment where you stick this usb then in 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.909
 your device is plugged in then you will 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.469
 also directly asked you want this 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.000
 install app then you need 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.710
 So not only in the apps to look 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.359
 but you will be asked directly if 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.219
 then you will have them installed then 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.750
 this little usb-stick also directly 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.570
 and you can easily 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.840
 data is transferred either from stick to 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.609
 device or vice versa and for what 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.140
 The whole thing is now practically so 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.210
 in my opinion it is one of just three 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.070
 reasons for that first of all you have 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.929
 a device bought with far too little 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.770
 memory for example an iphone 5 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.210
 5s or iphone 6 with only 16gb the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.590
 Of course, extremely fast are full 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.230
 either if you play music on it 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.970
 pictures or even about apps and then 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.770
 you can easily external such a 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.840
 buy a stick and could then get the pictures 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.700
 transfer or even movies for an ipad 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.890
 that would be the second possibility you 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.480
 bicycle on vacation would like to have some 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.890
 take movies with the series and the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.290
 could easily stick to it 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.000
 load and then they are in the ipad 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.400
 stuck and on the go simply the 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.860
 watch movies without your ipad 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.300
 make memory full 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.920
 and so you can then at a 128 gb 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.150
 will be very many movies with the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.500
 you can take books we can 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.730
 take a lot of music and 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.340
 accordingly, you do not need any 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.200
 device with such a high memory and 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.180
 also have to spend less money than 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.120
 the memory at apple is pretty 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.480
 Expensive the increase from 16 to 32 or 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.790
 on 564 to 128 gb always costs 100 euros 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.250
 and you can already have 64 here 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.200
 buy gb and accordingly you can 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.060
 of course save money if you the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.920
 Marshmallow always has it or just in 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.480
 the situations where he needs them then 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.240
 easy to take with you, for example 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.620
 on holiday 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.750
 next to the marshmallow itself will be like that 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.430
 a small cap included so can 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.410
 you then simply the usb connection 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.900
 and also secure the connection for the three 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.630
 so no no dust or no 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.730
 water comes to these connections 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.489
 and so you can then the irish whole 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.630
 just protect 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.580
 Finally, we come to my 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.220
 conclusion and to my opinion regarding 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.900
 of the ipad and I have to say that that 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.870
 device really looks pretty cool 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.430
 and it is very poorly small and fits 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.110
 of course in every trouser pocket 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.299
 However, there are a few small ones 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.860
 Criticisms first and foremost becomes an app 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.810
 Needed is not bad, of course 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.549
 but should still be addressed 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.350
 of course you have to do this too 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.940
 have small stick always with you if you 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.260
 wanted to access certain data 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.850
 so if you have pictures you 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.340
 absolutely want to show and have the 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.600
 ipod stick not included then you can 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.700
 Of course, these pictures do not show 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.500
 just like with the videos you have to 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.140
 So always have this stick with you 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.040
 Besides, of course, that's not the case 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.390
 cheap so is cheaper than the apple 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.370
 memory extension but still must 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.140
 you pay some money there of course 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.669
 so you now do not get so these 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.989
 stick for 20 euro but is natural 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.609
 pay a little more 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.260
 Nevertheless, it is very convenient and 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.120
 just for the holidays or if you have one 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.490
 have device with insufficient memory bought 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.840
 Definitely worth a bitch for 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.910
 memory extension for your device that 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.200
 my video was about the delivery picture and 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.790
 Of course I hope that you have the video 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.740
 I like you guys 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.060
 opinion on this art and in the 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.130
 Write comments you can find it 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.229
 it makes sense to add such a stick or 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.690
 Would you rather directly more memory 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.889
 on your iphone or ipad to buy 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.810
 and then rather @ 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.159
 more directly at apple pay each 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.990
 you are allowed a thumb up and a 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:52.460
 Thank you for your help 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.169
 to see and would be glad if you 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.400
 be back at the next video 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.400
 until then it's good 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.020
 there
