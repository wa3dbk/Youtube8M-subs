 die in the tramps subscribers were sitting 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.690
 Nitrogen andrew channels welcome to 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.519
 regular video tutorial on downloading from 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.290
 different file sharing and today we 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.250
 consider a little money called 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.340
 letitbit 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.910
 so let's click on it 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.740
 Further went further choose means quickly 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.010
 or slowly of course slowly because 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.140
 what is free and also here again to us 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.150
 offers to wait one minute all this 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.680
 done for what principle you understand 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.990
 what is it for us to ask for 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.820
 show as much advertising as possible 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.770
 the rest is not even all the ads displayed 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.750
 because it is here even some of them 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.410
 closed until 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:43.680
 why because i have flash 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.210
 player which of our locator what or 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.440
 which are blocker some 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.870
 advertising mostly flash advertising exactly 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.480
 or maybe just flash ash 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.670
 in my opinion the second option is more suitable 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.210
 so actually this is adware where 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.489
 even more well, like he said 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.770
 earlier advertising is an integral part 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.270
 freebies here well, at least they are not everywhere 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.479
 Naturally, if you download a torrent, then 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.400
 mostly there it swings very fast and i 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.280
 all colors of course shout q torrent 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.570
 opportunity 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.930
 but do not call piracy in any way 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.640
 If there is a good game is driving 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.030
 did buy so continue push 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.570

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.650
