well<00:02:50.760> we<00:02:51.390> began<00:02:51.750> looking<00:02:52.200> for<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.709> site<00:02:53.160> where

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
well we began looking for a site where

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.780 
well we began looking for a site where
perhaps<00:02:54.900> there<00:02:55.650> was<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.830> small<00:02:56.130> chance<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.700> we

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
perhaps there was a small chance that we

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.479 
perhaps there was a small chance that we
could<00:02:57.000> realize<00:02:57.360> our<00:02:57.690> CEOs<00:02:58.350> dream<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:59.069> a

one Porsche Drive I must say we were as

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.110 
one Porsche Drive I must say we were as
surprised<00:03:08.880> as<00:03:09.180> anybody<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:09.989> we<00:03:10.380> found<00:03:10.680> that

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120

and we've been witness to that today as

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.650 
and we've been witness to that today as
we<00:04:12.209> hear<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.900> planes<00:04:13.380> going<00:04:13.709> overhead<00:04:14.220> now

that's the kind of connectivity that is

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.819 
that's the kind of connectivity that is
important<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:18.030> businesses<00:04:18.570> especially

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
important to businesses especially

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.680 
important to businesses especially
international<00:04:19.829> businesses<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:21.000> opening<00:04:21.539> of

at<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:23.970> airport<00:04:24.930> is<00:04:25.260> certainly<00:04:25.830> an<00:04:25.950> added

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
at the airport is certainly an added

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.010 
at the airport is certainly an added
ingredient<00:04:26.550> I<00:04:27.030> think<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:27.450> makes<00:04:27.660> this<00:04:27.840> an

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
ingredient I think that makes this an

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.350 
ingredient I think that makes this an
attractive<00:04:28.260> place<00:04:28.680> for<00:04:29.180> foreign<00:04:30.180> companies
