hey youtube iPhone ty here and today I'm

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.280 
hey youtube iPhone ty here and today I'm
going<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.120> be<00:00:03.210> teaching<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.629> guys<00:00:03.659> how<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:04.020> cut

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
going to be teaching you guys how to cut

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.110 
going to be teaching you guys how to cut
a<00:00:04.319> nano-sim<00:00:04.950> now<00:00:05.549> there's<00:00:05.790> three<00:00:06.029> different

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
a nano-sim now there's three different

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.179 
a nano-sim now there's three different
sizes<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.750> SIM<00:00:07.080> cards<00:00:07.410> I've<00:00:07.560> got<00:00:07.770> all<00:00:07.919> three<00:00:08.099> in

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
sizes of SIM cards I've got all three in

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.400 
sizes of SIM cards I've got all three in
front<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.490> me<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.450> your<00:00:09.809> regular<00:00:09.960> size

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
front of me this is your regular size

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.320 
front of me this is your regular size
SIM<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:12.230> what<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.349> 3G<00:00:13.710> 3GS<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.429> use<00:00:14.670> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
SIM this is what the 3G 3GS is use the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.810 
SIM this is what the 3G 3GS is use the
iPhone<00:00:15.660> 4s<00:00:15.929> use<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.379> Micro<00:00:16.800> SIM<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.279> then<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
iPhone 4s use the Micro SIM and then the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.200 
iPhone 4s use the Micro SIM and then the
new<00:00:17.940> iPhone<00:00:18.359> 5s<00:00:18.600> they<00:00:18.840> use<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.350> nano<00:00:19.710> SIM<00:00:20.210> so

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
new iPhone 5s they use this nano SIM so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.910 
new iPhone 5s they use this nano SIM so
I'm<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.020> be<00:00:22.080> showing<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.439> guys<00:00:22.590> how<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
I'm going to be showing you guys how to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.700 
I'm going to be showing you guys how to
turn<00:00:23.279> your<00:00:23.820> regular<00:00:24.300> or<00:00:24.630> Micro<00:00:25.109> SIM<00:00:25.350> cards

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
turn your regular or Micro SIM cards

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.859 
turn your regular or Micro SIM cards
into<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.070> nano<00:00:26.369> SIM<00:00:26.699> card<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.539> actually

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
into a nano SIM card and it's actually

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.419 
into a nano SIM card and it's actually
fairly<00:00:28.140> easy<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.710> what<00:00:28.830> you'll<00:00:28.980> need<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.220> do

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
fairly easy and what you'll need to do

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.680 
fairly easy and what you'll need to do
this<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.119> good<00:00:30.330> pair<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.599> scissors<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.230> or

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
this is a good pair of scissors and or

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.330 
this is a good pair of scissors and or
you<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.840> use<00:00:33.989> an<00:00:34.170> exacto<00:00:34.469> blade<00:00:34.680> or<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.190> can

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
you can use an exacto blade or you can

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.709 
you can use an exacto blade or you can
use<00:00:35.460> some<00:00:35.700> type<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> razor<00:00:36.239> blade<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.690> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
use some type of razor blade with a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.470 
use some type of razor blade with a
cutting<00:00:37.079> board<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.530> some<00:00:38.489> type<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> ruler<00:00:39.239> or

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
cutting board and some type of ruler or

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.139 
cutting board and some type of ruler or
cutting<00:00:39.809> edge<00:00:40.280> will<00:00:41.280> probably<00:00:41.760> work<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.120> I

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
cutting edge will probably work but I

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.660 
cutting edge will probably work but I
prefer<00:00:42.540> scissors<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.140> much<00:00:43.290> easier<00:00:43.770> so

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
prefer scissors it's much easier so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.979 
prefer scissors it's much easier so
let's<00:00:44.820> go<00:00:44.940> ahead<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.210> get<00:00:45.329> started<00:00:45.450> first<00:00:45.870> off

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
let's go ahead and get started first off

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.209 
let's go ahead and get started first off
we'll<00:00:46.140> go<00:00:46.289> ahead<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.590> take<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> look<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
we'll go ahead and take a look at the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.650 
we'll go ahead and take a look at the
SIM<00:00:47.430> card<00:00:47.460> now<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> will<00:00:48.000> point<00:00:48.239> out<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.480> your

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
SIM card now I will point out that your

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.389 
SIM card now I will point out that your
SIM<00:00:48.840> card<00:00:48.870> needs<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.559> smaller

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
SIM card needs to have smaller

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.520 
SIM card needs to have smaller
connections<00:00:51.149> some<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> older<00:00:52.199> ones<00:00:52.230> are

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
connections some of the older ones are

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.920 
connections some of the older ones are
larger<00:00:52.949> than<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.449> got<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
larger than this but it's got to be the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.090 
larger than this but it's got to be the
same<00:00:55.110> size<00:00:55.379> otherwise<00:00:55.559> you're<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> be

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
same size otherwise you're going to be

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.010 
same size otherwise you're going to be
cutting<00:00:56.309> off<00:00:56.489> metal<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.420> probably<00:00:57.660> won't

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
cutting off metal and it probably won't

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.990 
cutting off metal and it probably won't
work<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:59.010> long<00:00:59.129> as<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.370> SIM<00:00:59.579> card<00:00:59.609> looks

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
work so as long as your SIM card looks

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.660 
work so as long as your SIM card looks
like<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.079> looks<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:02.550> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
like this or it looks like this then it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.520 
like this or it looks like this then it
should<00:01:02.850> work<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.660> yeah<00:01:03.809> again<00:01:03.989> let's<00:01:04.409> go

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
should work but yeah again let's go

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
should work but yeah again let's go
ahead<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:04.860> started

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
ahead and get started

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.270 
ahead and get started
so<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> first<00:01:07.290> thing<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.740> need<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.040> find

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
so the first thing that we need to find

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.250 
so the first thing that we need to find
out<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.760> where<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.330> are<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> make<00:01:10.049> our

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
out is where we are going to make our

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.560 
out is where we are going to make our
angled<00:01:10.799> edge<00:01:11.040> now<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.760> angled<00:01:12.210> edge<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
angled edge now the angled edge is

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.140 
angled edge now the angled edge is
always<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> same<00:01:13.560> side<00:01:13.939> also<00:01:14.939> you'll

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
always on the same side also you'll

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.830 
always on the same side also you'll
notice<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.799> nano<00:01:17.040> SIM<00:01:17.509> most<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
notice that the nano SIM most of the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.870 
notice that the nano SIM most of the
white<00:01:19.049> plastic<00:01:19.710> around<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> edge<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.460> cut<00:01:20.549> off

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
white plastic around the edge is cut off

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
white plastic around the edge is cut off
but<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:22.560> at<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.070> at<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.240> side<00:01:24.479> there's

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
but here at the at this side there's

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.719 
but here at the at this side there's
about<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> millimeter<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.460> side<00:01:26.580> of

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
about a millimeter of it on the side of

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.819 
about a millimeter of it on the side of
the<00:01:26.820> angled<00:01:27.180> edge<00:01:27.330> now<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.110> angled<00:01:28.500> edge<00:01:28.619> is

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the angled edge now the angled edge is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.520 
the angled edge now the angled edge is
always<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.520> same<00:01:29.729> side<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.229> take

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
always on the same side so if you take

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.120 
always on the same side so if you take
the<00:01:31.740> angled<00:01:32.040> edge<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:33.439> your<00:01:34.439> SIM<00:01:35.100> card

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the angled edge that your SIM card

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.580 
the angled edge that your SIM card
already<00:01:35.610> has<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.290> you're<00:01:37.439> going

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
already has you know that you're going

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.319 
already has you know that you're going
to<00:01:37.710> make<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.950> same<00:01:38.189> angled<00:01:38.549> edge<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.119> just

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
to make that same angled edge but just

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.640 
to make that same angled edge but just
closer<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.869> we're<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.229> go<00:01:40.350> ahead<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
closer so we're going to go ahead and

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.770 
closer so we're going to go ahead and
Mark<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.130> first<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.360> we're<00:01:42.600> cutting

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
Mark that first so that as we're cutting

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.539 
Mark that first so that as we're cutting
it<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.079> don't<00:01:43.200> lose<00:01:43.409> track<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.770> which<00:01:44.130> side<00:01:44.369> is

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
it we don't lose track of which side is

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.260 
it we don't lose track of which side is
which

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.390 

okay<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:53.050> now<00:01:53.170> we've<00:01:53.350> made<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.590> mark<00:01:53.890> right<00:01:54.130> here

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
okay so now we've made a mark right here

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.770 
okay so now we've made a mark right here
so<00:01:54.610> we<00:01:54.730> know<00:01:54.910> that<00:01:54.940> this<00:01:55.240> is<00:01:55.450> where<00:01:55.600> we're

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
so we know that this is where we're

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.050 
so we know that this is where we're
going<00:01:55.930> to<00:01:56.020> do<00:01:56.170> our<00:01:56.320> angled<00:01:56.680> edge<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:57.160> let's<00:01:57.910> go

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
going to do our angled edge and let's go

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.150 
going to do our angled edge and let's go
ahead<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.390> get<00:01:58.510> started<00:01:58.660> now<00:01:59.590> when<00:01:59.980> you<00:02:00.040> make

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
ahead and get started now when you make

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.500 
ahead and get started now when you make
your<00:02:00.340> cuts<00:02:00.580> you're<00:02:00.790> going<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.090> make<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.360> cut

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
your cuts you're going to make the cut

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.270 
your cuts you're going to make the cut
almost<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.440> metal<00:02:02.710> you<00:02:02.920> don't<00:02:03.100> want<00:02:03.220> to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
almost to the metal you don't want to

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.040 
almost to the metal you don't want to
cut<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.520> metal<00:02:03.640> but<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.420> want<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.690> go<00:02:04.780> almost

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
cut the metal but you want to go almost

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.620 
cut the metal but you want to go almost
to<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.620> metal<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:06.100> we'll<00:02:06.970> go<00:02:07.060> ahead<00:02:07.120> and<00:02:07.330> start

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
to the metal so we'll go ahead and start

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.570 
to the metal so we'll go ahead and start
with<00:02:07.810> our<00:02:07.840> first<00:02:07.960> cut<00:02:08.440> here<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.890> if<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.400> got<00:02:09.520> a

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
with our first cut here and if you got a

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.340 
with our first cut here and if you got a
good<00:02:09.790> pair<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.030> scissors<00:02:10.270> it<00:02:10.690> should<00:02:10.960> just<00:02:11.080> cut

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
good pair of scissors it should just cut

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.230 
good pair of scissors it should just cut
right<00:02:11.710> through<00:02:11.740> real<00:02:12.430> easily<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.060> makes

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
right through real easily and it makes

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.630 
right through real easily and it makes
nice<00:02:13.420> straight<00:02:13.810> cuts<00:02:14.080> too<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.650> that's<00:02:15.430> why<00:02:15.610> I

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
nice straight cuts too so that's why I

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.700 
nice straight cuts too so that's why I
prefer<00:02:15.820> scissors<00:02:18.000> okay<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:20.260> there<00:02:20.410> we've<00:02:20.560> made

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
prefer scissors okay so there we've made

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:31.080 
prefer scissors okay so there we've made
our<00:02:20.830> first<00:02:21.100> cut<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:30.220> have<00:02:30.340> made<00:02:30.520> our<00:02:30.670> second

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
our first cut we have made our second

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:43.120 
our first cut we have made our second
cut

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.980 

okay<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:44.850> now<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.090> should<00:02:45.240> look<00:02:45.330> like<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:45.750> and

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
okay so now it should look like this and

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.930 
okay so now it should look like this and
you're<00:02:46.170> angled<00:02:46.500> edge<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.920> right<00:02:47.190> here<00:02:47.520> again

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
you're angled edge is right here again

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.230 
you're angled edge is right here again
you<00:02:48.060> can<00:02:48.210> still<00:02:48.450> see<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.810> marked<00:02:50.240> right

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
you can still see that marked right

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.540 
you can still see that marked right
there<00:02:51.420> at<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.600> bottom<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.080> we<00:02:53.070> are<00:02:53.100> going<00:02:53.460> to

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
there at the bottom and we are going to

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.890 
there at the bottom and we are going to
cut<00:02:53.790> about<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.600> millimeter<00:02:55.640> from<00:02:56.900> the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
cut about a millimeter from the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.710 
cut about a millimeter from the
connector<00:02:58.410> so<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:01.560> looks<00:03:01.740> like<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.450> then<00:03:03.450> we

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
connector so it looks like this then we

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.510 
connector so it looks like this then we
can<00:03:03.870> go<00:03:04.020> ahead<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.560> make<00:03:04.710> our<00:03:04.740> angled<00:03:05.280> cut

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
can go ahead and make our angled cut

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.700 
can go ahead and make our angled cut
that's<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:06.000> small<00:03:06.270> cut<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.690> goes<00:03:06.840> almost<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.500> the

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
that's a small cut it goes almost to the

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.080 
that's a small cut it goes almost to the
metal<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.820> very<00:03:09.000> edge<00:03:09.710> like<00:03:10.710> that<00:03:11.090> and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
metal on the very edge like that and

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.590 
metal on the very edge like that and
then<00:03:12.390> now<00:03:12.510> all<00:03:12.690> we<00:03:12.840> have<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.050> do<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.620> just

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
then now all we have to do is just

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.690 
then now all we have to do is just
carefully<00:03:15.600> cut<00:03:16.140> all<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.560> edges<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.400> sharp

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
carefully cut all the edges the sharp

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.810 
carefully cut all the edges the sharp
edges<00:03:17.910> off

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
edges off

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:28.310 
edges off
you<00:03:20.820> just<00:03:20.940> wanna<00:03:21.090> round<00:03:21.300> those<00:03:21.570> off<00:03:27.110> okay<00:03:28.110> and

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
you just wanna round those off okay and

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.220 
you just wanna round those off okay and
there<00:03:28.710> we<00:03:28.740> go<00:03:29.240> you<00:03:30.240> do<00:03:30.390> want<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.630> take<00:03:30.810> your<00:03:30.930> sim

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
there we go you do want to take your sim

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.620 
there we go you do want to take your sim
tray<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:31.770> make<00:03:31.950> sure<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.430> fits<00:03:32.670> so

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
tray and just make sure that it fits so

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:46.210 
tray and just make sure that it fits so
that's<00:03:33.750> what<00:03:33.960> we'll<00:03:34.080> do

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.880 

okay<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:47.180> can<00:03:47.210> see<00:03:47.570> that<00:03:47.900> doesn't<00:03:48.440> quite

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
okay and I can see that doesn't quite

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.080 
okay and I can see that doesn't quite
fit<00:03:48.950> properly<00:03:49.520> so<00:03:50.420> we're<00:03:50.570> going<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.780> make<00:03:50.990> a

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
fit properly so we're going to make a

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.220 
fit properly so we're going to make a
few<00:03:53.090> more<00:03:53.300> little<00:03:53.510> cuts

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
few more little cuts

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
few more little cuts
I<00:03:55.300> think<00:03:56.300> this<00:03:56.510> edge<00:03:56.750> up<00:03:57.380> here<00:03:57.800> needs<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.160> be

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
I think this edge up here needs to be

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.400 
I think this edge up here needs to be
cut<00:03:58.430> down<00:03:58.610> a<00:03:58.640> little<00:03:58.940> bit<00:04:01.990> and<00:04:02.990> it<00:04:03.110> may<00:04:03.230> be<00:04:03.290> a

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
cut down a little bit and it may be a

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.650 
cut down a little bit and it may be a
little<00:04:03.950> bit<00:04:04.280> too<00:04:04.460> much<00:04:04.640> plastic<00:04:04.940> on<00:04:05.240> this<00:04:05.390> side

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
little bit too much plastic on this side

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.250 
little bit too much plastic on this side
so<00:04:06.640> let's<00:04:07.640> try<00:04:07.850> this<00:04:07.910> again

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.500 

alright<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.500> there<00:04:12.980> we<00:04:13.100> go<00:04:13.280> we<00:04:14.000> have<00:04:14.030> a

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
alright and there we go we have a

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.979 
alright and there we go we have a
perfect<00:04:15.020> fitting<00:04:15.700> nano-sim<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:16.970> that<00:04:17.810> should

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
perfect fitting nano-sim and that should

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.930 
perfect fitting nano-sim and that should
work<00:04:18.110> great<00:04:18.380> in<00:04:18.500> your<00:04:18.620> iPhone<00:04:18.950> 5<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.459> believe
