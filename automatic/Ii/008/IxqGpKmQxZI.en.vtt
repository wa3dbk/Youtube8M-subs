 commission sec new kita a little 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.050
 little 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.739
 ok eva frank chef chief developer ok 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:59.670
 come and that is the boss the boss is 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.350
 the chief developer of toys for bob and 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.900
 today we have seen 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.050
 skylanders the new story namely 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.979
 trap teams calendar trap team is that 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:16.220
 calendar the fourth part of sky countries 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.220
 have a few questions like the 11 11 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.729
 So it is rather you can not 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.190
 say he is quite right 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:44.690
 sure because it's the ff too 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:44.690
 darling character okay not so question 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:02:06.119
 like the usa or uk rub the play off the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:12.060
 way to be the place to be a bad place k 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:15.630
 s ok so he can say that with you 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.510
 So you can play chaos 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.260
 to play with chaos 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.450
 Now the most important question 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.810
 actually, if you play with larsson 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.810
 can or is there then a gift 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.760
 bestowed for christoph meal wowi 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.920
 ok so there can not say much 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.920
 easy like given 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.730
 would you be mad 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.730
 like it would see to have as kuscheltier 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:26.290
 So just when the demand is right he 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.120
 that will continue to exist he is 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.879
 of course the game developer that is 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.750
 he develops these these these 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.340
 video games the computer games and then 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.129
 Of course, this is not the one who is now 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.719
 afterwards this cuddly animal says okay 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:53.980
 will there be or so more of the 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:56.200
 from the technical side so the 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.979
 work now on the calendar trap 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.030
 team and the next version there are 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.560
 not yet working on it 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.989
 To be completed is indeed 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.199
 Very early the last time you were 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.659
 at gamescom and there it was 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.430
 already finished and this game is still 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.290
 not finished the figures we 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.289
 in between then show are 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.090
 now before the release 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.090
 they can still change in parts 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.870
 So it will be certain things 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.879
 give back where you are now like sky 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.999
 the town hall where you crate these giants 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.499
 Did he have such a box skyliners 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:31.719
 Giants must use to checkout 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:34.900
 open and it will not be the rap 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:36.699
 songs give that to sap force 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.069
 is also one of the characters if you 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:43.889
 Looked closely have the new meeting 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:46.000
 Team characters have no no symbol 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.740
 that would still be possible because it yes 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.139
 no finished figures are yet 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:54.490
 right but it is expected to be so 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:56.169
 that the figures are so in 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.150
 this game will not be this zone 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.189
 but it will be other interesting 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.759
 contents admit those with these figures 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:02.759
 do have 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.759
 the elements of the portal like the ones 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:20.409
 elements of the portal recognize that we can 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:23.370
 go into the fire ok so that's it 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:25.839
 means well understood I think okay 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:30.849
 so that was really the questions 

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:32.110
 more about this we show you at the 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:48.669
 the next video was ours 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:53.639
 interview with jeff that what no one 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.639
 tips and say goodbye
