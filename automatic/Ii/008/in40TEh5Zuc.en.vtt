you pour the milk into the mark you want
to<00:00:20.220> leave<00:00:20.400> about<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.830> fourth<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.519> mug<00:00:23.730> free

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
to leave about a fourth of the mug free

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.120 
to leave about a fourth of the mug free
of<00:00:24.330> milk<00:00:24.570> one<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> about<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.529> fourth<00:00:26.010> of

of milk one of the about for fourth of
the<00:00:26.220> mug<00:00:26.369> empty<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:28.320> I'm<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.710> empty

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
the mug empty so I'm just going to empty

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.220 
the mug empty so I'm just going to empty
that<00:00:29.070> into<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.519> pan<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:31.700> turn<00:00:32.700> my<00:00:33.210> stove<00:00:33.899> onto

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that into the pan and turn my stove onto

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.940 
that into the pan and turn my stove onto
a<00:00:34.969> low-medium<00:00:35.969> heat<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:37.020> electric<00:00:37.800> which

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
a low-medium heat I have electric which

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.410 
a low-medium heat I have electric which
isn't<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.280> most<00:00:38.309> idea<00:00:38.730> if<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.059> guests

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
isn't the most idea if you have guests

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.180 
isn't the most idea if you have guests
that's<00:00:39.570> much<00:00:39.719> better<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.770> I'm<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.129> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
that's much better and that I'm going to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.930 
that's much better and that I'm going to
just<00:00:41.370> leave<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:42.180> cook<00:00:43.640> for<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> few<00:00:44.879> minutes

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
just leave to cook for a few minutes

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.029 
just leave to cook for a few minutes
just<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> heat<00:00:45.660> up<00:00:45.690> now<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.469> don't<00:00:46.770> want<00:00:46.920> this

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
just to heat up now you don't want this

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.279 
just to heat up now you don't want this
to<00:00:47.100> start<00:00:47.489> bubbling<00:00:47.730> because<00:00:48.450> once<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.110> start

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
to start bubbling because once it start

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.709 
to start bubbling because once it start
bubbling<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:50.039> boiling<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.270> killed

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
bubbling it's boiling and it's killed

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.380 
bubbling it's boiling and it's killed
everything<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.559> pasteurized<00:00:52.829> basically<00:00:53.820> so

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
everything is pasteurized basically so

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.080 
everything is pasteurized basically so
you<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> keep<00:00:54.960> dipping<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:56.579> knuckle<00:00:56.969> of

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you want to keep dipping the knuckle of

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.430 
you want to keep dipping the knuckle of
your<00:00:57.239> little<00:00:57.480> finger<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
your little finger in there just to

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.069 
your little finger in there just to
check<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> temperature<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.079> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
check what the temperature is and the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.810 
check what the temperature is and the
ideal<00:01:01.410> temperature<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:02.550> just

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
ideal temperature is going to be just

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.119 
ideal temperature is going to be just
slightly<00:01:03.270> warmer<00:01:04.080> than<00:01:04.199> skin<00:01:04.619> temperature

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
slightly warmer than skin temperature

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.450 
slightly warmer than skin temperature
just<00:01:05.670> perfect<00:01:06.299> dream<00:01:06.600> drinking<00:01:07.170> temperature

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
just perfect dream drinking temperature

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.370 
just perfect dream drinking temperature
so<00:01:08.460> while<00:01:08.640> that's<00:01:08.820> doing<00:01:09.299> let's<00:01:09.930> start<00:01:10.049> mixing

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
so while that's doing let's start mixing

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.399 
so while that's doing let's start mixing
up<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.770> hot<00:01:11.340> chocolate<00:01:11.549> base<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
up the hot chocolate base for it and I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.280 
up the hot chocolate base for it and I
have<00:01:13.650> my<00:01:14.130> organic<00:01:14.520> cocoa<00:01:15.150> powder<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:16.080> could

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
have my organic cocoa powder you could

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.249 
have my organic cocoa powder you could
use<00:01:16.530> raw<00:01:16.740> cocoa<00:01:17.220> powder<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.270> it's

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
use raw cocoa powder for this but it's

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.870 
use raw cocoa powder for this but it's
very<00:01:19.530> expensive<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.250> quite<00:01:20.460> difficult<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
very expensive and quite difficult to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.730 
very expensive and quite difficult to
get<00:01:21.030> hold<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.659> use<00:01:21.869> organic<00:01:22.140> cocoa

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
get hold up so I just use organic cocoa

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.490 
get hold up so I just use organic cocoa
powder<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:24.390> want<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.630> nice<00:01:24.840> heaped

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
powder and you want a nice heaped

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.330 
powder and you want a nice heaped
teaspoon<00:01:26.340> full<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.750> cocoa<00:01:28.250> dump<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
teaspoon full of the cocoa dump that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.249 
teaspoon full of the cocoa dump that
into<00:01:29.670> your<00:01:29.820> mug<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:32.810> then<00:01:33.810> we're<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.170> be

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
into your mug and then we're going to be

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.660 
into your mug and then we're going to be
using<00:01:34.290> some<00:01:35.009> stevia<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:37.650> little<00:01:38.070> sachets<00:01:38.490> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
using some stevia the little sachets of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.730 
using some stevia the little sachets of
stevia<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.210> perfect<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.560> one

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
stevia are perfect for this so just one

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.300 
stevia are perfect for this so just one
packet<00:01:41.930> you<00:01:42.930> could<00:01:43.110> use<00:01:43.350> two<00:01:43.649> or<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.070> could

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
packet you could use two or you could

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.690 
packet you could use two or you could
use<00:01:44.520> less<00:01:44.759> according<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:46.259> taste<00:01:46.700> just

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
dump that in as well so I said it's very

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.100 
dump that in as well so I said it's very
scientific<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:53.360> we'll<00:01:54.360> add<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> little<00:01:54.840> bit<00:01:55.049> of

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
scientific and we'll add a little bit of

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.859 
scientific and we'll add a little bit of
water<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.430> mix<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.630> tiny

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
water just so we can mix it just a tiny

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.770 
water just so we can mix it just a tiny
amount<00:01:58.790> just<00:01:59.790> we<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.090> make<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> into<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.570> paste

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
amount just we can make it into a paste

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.840 
amount just we can make it into a paste

and I've got my nice little Whizzer here
very<00:02:03.780> dangerous<00:02:04.140> tool<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:05.340> I'm<00:02:05.369> going<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
very dangerous tool and I'm going to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.510 
very dangerous tool and I'm going to
whizz<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.090> up<00:02:06.799> it's<00:02:07.799> great<00:02:08.009> fun<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.399> you

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
whizz that up it's great fun this you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.080 
whizz that up it's great fun this you
have<00:02:08.640> clouds<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.270> smoke<00:02:09.420> emanating<00:02:09.810> from<00:02:10.349> it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.390 

make<00:02:14.090> yourself<00:02:14.390> choke<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.860> that's<00:02:16.040> all<00:02:16.220> ready

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
make yourself choke and that's all ready

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.150 
make yourself choke and that's all ready
to<00:02:16.489> add<00:02:16.730> our<00:02:17.000> warmed<00:02:17.510> milk<00:02:17.780> too<00:02:18.080> so<00:02:18.770> as<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.099> said

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
to add our warmed milk too so as I said

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.440 
to add our warmed milk too so as I said
just<00:02:19.520> keep<00:02:19.640> checking<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.300> should

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
just keep checking that it should

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.449 
just keep checking that it should
probably<00:02:20.870> only<00:02:21.020> take<00:02:21.260> if<00:02:21.620> you're<00:02:21.800> doing<00:02:22.099> just

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
probably only take if you're doing just

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.710 
probably only take if you're doing just
one<00:02:22.640> mug<00:02:22.849> it<00:02:23.000> should<00:02:23.150> probably<00:02:23.390> only<00:02:23.510> take

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
one mug it should probably only take

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.660 
one mug it should probably only take
three<00:02:24.050> or<00:02:24.170> four<00:02:24.349> minutes<00:02:24.620> at<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.830> most<00:02:24.860> if

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
three or four minutes at the most if

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.250 
three or four minutes at the most if
you're<00:02:25.760> doing<00:02:26.000> more<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.390> will<00:02:26.510> take<00:02:26.720> obviously

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
you're doing more it will take obviously

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.540 
you're doing more it will take obviously
a<00:02:27.290> little<00:02:27.440> bit<00:02:27.680> longer<00:02:27.860> you've<00:02:28.069> got<00:02:28.190> more<00:02:28.310> milk

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
a little bit longer you've got more milk

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.520 
a little bit longer you've got more milk
to<00:02:28.730> heat<00:02:28.910> but<00:02:29.420> just<00:02:29.600> keep<00:02:29.750> coming<00:02:30.050> back<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.230> it

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
to heat but just keep coming back to it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.470 
to heat but just keep coming back to it
every<00:02:30.739> minute<00:02:30.890> or<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.340> just<00:02:31.550> stick<00:02:31.790> the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
every minute or so just stick the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.820 
every minute or so just stick the
knuckle<00:02:32.780> of<00:02:32.840> your<00:02:32.989> little<00:02:33.110> finger<00:02:33.530> in<00:02:33.650> there

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
knuckle of your little finger in there

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.010 
knuckle of your little finger in there
just<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.130> check<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.730> temperature<00:02:35.270> so<00:02:35.750> our

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
just to check the temperature so our

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.420 
just to check the temperature so our
milk<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.410> at<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.620> right<00:02:36.739> temperature<00:02:36.800> now

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
milk is at the right temperature now

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.780 
milk is at the right temperature now
just<00:02:38.360> check<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.260> finally<00:02:40.190> with<00:02:40.340> your<00:02:40.459> knuckle

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
just check it finally with your knuckle

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.420 
just check it finally with your knuckle
make<00:02:40.970> sure<00:02:41.150> it's<00:02:41.330> safe<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:42.650> then<00:02:43.280> we've<00:02:43.400> got

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
make sure it's safe and then we've got

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.290 
make sure it's safe and then we've got
our<00:02:43.959> cocoa<00:02:44.959> mixture<00:02:45.470> here<00:02:45.769> now<00:02:46.580> you<00:02:46.880> can<00:02:47.090> just

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
our cocoa mixture here now you can just

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.729 
our cocoa mixture here now you can just
leave<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.660> like<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.140> can<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.500> add<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
leave it like that you can just add the

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.920 
leave it like that you can just add the
milk<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.130> drink<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.519> just<00:02:50.450> straight<00:02:50.690> like

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
milk and drink it just straight like

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.380 
milk and drink it just straight like
that<00:02:51.040> but<00:02:52.040> sometimes<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.850> like<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.090> add<00:02:53.360> a

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
that but sometimes I like to add a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.539 
that but sometimes I like to add a
little<00:02:53.600> bit<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.840> flavoring<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.890> of

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
little bit of flavoring to it and of

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.309 
little bit of flavoring to it and of
course<00:02:55.790> our<00:02:56.030> flavorings<00:02:56.750> are<00:02:56.900> not<00:02:57.019> full<00:02:57.200> of

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
course our flavorings are not full of

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.490 
course our flavorings are not full of
sugar<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.860> syrup<00:02:58.069> like<00:02:58.630> coffee<00:02:59.630> shop<00:02:59.959> syrups

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
up with the milk there's two ways of

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.500 
up with the milk there's two ways of
pouring<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.680> milk<00:03:39.829> into<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.220> mac<00:03:40.400> i<00:03:40.670> prefer

pouring the milk into the mac i prefer
the<00:03:41.540> less<00:03:41.810> tidy<00:03:42.230> method<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:42.829> could<00:03:43.040> use<00:03:43.220> a

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
the less tidy method you could use a

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.250 
the less tidy method you could use a
ladle<00:03:43.549> it's<00:03:44.150> very<00:03:44.269> tidy<00:03:44.540> but<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:44.840> takes<00:03:44.989> longer

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
ladle it's very tidy but it takes longer

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.710 
ladle it's very tidy but it takes longer
and<00:03:45.410> I'm<00:03:45.590> just<00:03:45.920> far<00:03:46.280> too<00:03:46.310> lazy<00:03:46.579> for<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:46.850> so

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
and I'm just far too lazy for that so

excuse the dumping method we're just
going<00:03:51.109> to<00:03:51.140> pour<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.530> milk<00:03:51.709> in<00:03:51.920> it<00:03:54.910> fits
