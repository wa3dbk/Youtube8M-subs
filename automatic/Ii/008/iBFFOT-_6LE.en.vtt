that<00:01:31.950> i<00:01:32.040> never<00:01:32.250> ever<00:01:32.549> thought<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.090> would<00:01:33.119> see

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
that i never ever thought I would see

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.270 
that i never ever thought I would see
but<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:33.900> far<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.409> quality<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> match

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
but as far as the quality of the match

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.069 
but as far as the quality of the match
we<00:01:35.490> were<00:01:35.610> gonna<00:01:35.729> get<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> ring<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.750> was<00:01:36.900> not

you<00:01:54.960> can't<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.590> I'm<00:01:55.920> surprised<00:01:56.430> how<00:01:56.790> many

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
you can't do that I'm surprised how many

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.060 
you can't do that I'm surprised how many
wrestlers<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.719> day<00:01:57.990> still<00:01:58.350> say<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
wrestlers to this day still say that

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.380 
wrestlers to this day still say that
rock<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.520> Hogan<00:01:59.700> should<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.090> been<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.240> main

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
rock and Hogan should have been the main

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.330 
rock and Hogan should have been the main
event<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.780> WrestleMania<00:02:01.320> 18<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> think<00:02:02.189> that

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
event of WrestleMania 18 I think that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.889 
event of WrestleMania 18 I think that
would<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.579> been<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.790> slap<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.420> face<00:02:03.479> to

would have been a slap in the face to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.469 
would have been a slap in the face to
Jericho<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.040> Triple<00:02:05.340> H<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.939> their<00:02:06.090> title

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
Jericho and Triple H and to their title

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.150 
Jericho and Triple H and to their title
and<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> whole<00:02:07.259> company<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.069> the

whole roster of guys that we've been
working<00:02:09.989> there<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.500> hard<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:11.400> know<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.610> put

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
working there so hard you know to put

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.380

WCW out of business

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.000 
WCW out of business
which<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.630> what<00:02:13.840> made<00:02:14.110> Hogan<00:02:14.500> come<00:02:14.710> back<00:02:14.860> to

which is what made Hogan come back to
the<00:02:15.100> WWE<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.910> first<00:02:16.120> place<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.540> think<00:02:16.600> it

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
the WWE in the first place I think it

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.880 
the WWE in the first place I think it
would<00:02:16.960> have<00:02:17.020> been<00:02:17.080> wrong<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:17.620> would<00:02:17.709> have<00:02:17.770> been

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
would have been wrong it would have been

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.500 
would have been wrong it would have been
morally<00:02:18.370> wrong<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.580> do<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.240> I'm<00:02:19.330> glad

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
morally wrong to do that and I'm glad

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.970 
morally wrong to do that and I'm glad
that<00:02:19.630> they<00:02:19.750> didn't<00:02:20.020> do<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.170> yes<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.800> title

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
that they didn't do it yes the title
