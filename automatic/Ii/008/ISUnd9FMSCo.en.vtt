so overall hardware design you can see

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.629 
so overall hardware design you can see
that<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.700> signal<00:00:09.090> said<00:00:09.330> only<00:00:10.099> 20<00:00:11.099> millimeters

in<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> movie<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> wrongful<00:00:42.440> way

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
in the movie the wrongful way

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.310 
in the movie the wrongful way
it's<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.489> seven<00:00:45.000> children<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.329> although<00:00:49.079> we

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
it's about seven children so although we

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.729 
it's about seven children so although we
use<00:00:49.469> plastic<00:00:50.219> parts<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.960> also<00:00:52.170> carry<00:00:52.620> off

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
use plastic parts and we also carry off

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.290 
use plastic parts and we also carry off
some<00:00:52.980> weight<00:00:53.219> from<00:00:53.940> last<00:00:54.539> generation<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:56.300> so

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
some weight from last generation and so

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.170 
some weight from last generation and so
you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.660> try<00:00:57.809> out<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.079> series<00:00:58.469> hexley<00:00:59.180> so

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
you can try out the series hexley so

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.330 
you can try out the series hexley so
basically<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:01.020> are<00:01:01.050> not<00:01:01.680> compromising<00:01:01.949> on

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
basically we are not compromising on

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.549 
basically we are not compromising on
photonics<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.420> machine<00:01:03.989> itself

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
photonics on the machine itself

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.039 
photonics on the machine itself
we're<00:01:05.189> behind<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.570> three<00:01:06.720> guys

then<00:01:09.450> we<00:01:09.630> got<00:01:10.100> where<00:01:11.100> disconnection<00:01:11.729> so

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
then we got where disconnection so

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.210 
then we got where disconnection so

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
video the local content sharing and it's

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.780 
video the local content sharing and it's
broken<00:02:15.450> when<00:02:16.050> everything<00:02:16.560> yeah<00:02:16.740> yeah<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.550> the
