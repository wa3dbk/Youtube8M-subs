00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.710 
five points and five straight two of
those<00:01:39.770> are<00:01:40.040> wins<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.610> three<00:01:41.030> shootout<00:01:41.420> losses

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
those are wins and three shootout losses

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.020 
those are wins and three shootout losses
so<00:01:42.200> I've<00:01:42.860> got<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.039> find<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.369> way<00:01:43.399> to<00:01:43.520> avoid<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
so I've got to find a way to avoid the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.279 
so I've got to find a way to avoid the
shootout<00:01:44.060> I<00:01:44.450> think<00:01:44.780> might<00:01:44.960> be<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.170> biggest

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
shootout I think might be the biggest

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.469 
shootout I think might be the biggest
key<00:01:45.619> coming<00:01:46.009> up<00:01:46.100> 4-2<00:01:46.399> lead<00:01:46.520> well<00:01:47.000> i<00:01:47.090> think<00:01:47.149> in

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
key coming up 4-2 lead well i think in

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.480 
key coming up 4-2 lead well i think in
ultimately<00:01:47.899> that<00:01:48.200> that's<00:01:48.440> going<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:48.619> the

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
ultimately that that's going to the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.529 
ultimately that that's going to the
shootouts<00:01:49.789> are<00:01:49.850> going<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.060> counters<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.450> me

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
shootouts are going to counters to me

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:51.940 
shootouts are going to counters to me
skill<00:01:50.780> players<00:01:51.080> those<00:01:51.320> goals<00:01:51.560> going<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.799> come

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
skill players those goals going to come

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.770 
skill players those goals going to come
in<00:01:52.039> a<00:01:52.100> shootout<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:53.119> maybe<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.600> biggest

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
in a shootout and maybe the biggest

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.200 
in a shootout and maybe the biggest
number<00:01:54.380> out<00:01:54.619> of<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:54.860> mix<00:01:55.159> there<00:01:55.460> today<00:01:55.700> Scott
