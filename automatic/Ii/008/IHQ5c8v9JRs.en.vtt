00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.920
 well it her whole world seneca 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.500
 kayes we meet today for 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.570
 a new adventure map so this 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.820
 adventure map has no name any 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.750
 simply salma been sent by i 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.039
 37 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.189
 good I think we present like this or 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.949
 die 37 to the American a little bit and 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.390
 so bah he did not name it tells me that 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.320
 I could name it as I 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.500
 wish but I confess that I have 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.399
 not too much name in any case I 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.510
 will you introduce it anyway because 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.540
 that she's pretty good at the full of 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.610
 nice little challenges to achieve so this is 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.530
 a course tablecloth actually you go 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.719
 you are going to have several common 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.800
 like many with different 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.570
 others but as many we have 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.120
 rooms to cross and then to pass 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.120
 from room to room with different 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.120
 different 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.430
 different challenges to achieve everything 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.320
 simply and so here it is a little bit 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.149
 match style except that there you go the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.160
 see right after we go we'll do it already 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.489
 some of these challenges in the desert 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.860
 so here is the spawn point already 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.990
 you will start started here so 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.100
 to get into the bap we can already 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.920
 take what is a little slow at that 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.290
 will still be able to serve but I take 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.610
 even if it will not serve the masses and 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.500
 you can go back here you have to break the 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.570
 glass and then to just drop it 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.920
 and there you have the joke of everything in 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.600
 the chests of which I do not know exactly what 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.119
 it serves all that he explained to me I am 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.970
 not sure we can actually take them 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.990
 and then even if we can take them 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.929
 what interest of kayes to all I want no 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.429
 that was not it his room where he 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.920
 put all these cov for precisely 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.330
 can build this map that 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.470
 serve chests only in the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.640
 emergency case be there like that too 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.259
 we can not use in 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.970
 chests that would be way too simple 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.030
 for for this map 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.679
 in any case we appear above so 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.780
 therefore must break the green 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.159
 to get in and you continue here 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.450
 so there is no real rule 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.130
 it's going to be really 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.050
 follow the path that is proposed to us 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.060
 and so as I wanted to say we 're going 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.160
 go back into the orders and forget 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.539
 by the way gaulle maggots so m listening 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.509
 we go right away what is left 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.890
 go back to the desert and we'll see 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.030
 will see the rest of the note so you 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.270
 go see it's full of little challenges to 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.890
 do you realize all of this side there 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.590
 this is me again I am 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.989
 in mode 2 in creative mode so I can 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.349
 fly and I will try not 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.060
 use it one finds the output so 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.349
 the first goal is to find the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.810
 exit so you get here in this 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.860
 piece for the first challenge and you go 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.950
 see we'll see the small indications 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.420
 who are going from if you can 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.790
 episodes indications that will us 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.709
 say what to do one of the by 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.810
 example 3 does not hesitate to darken but 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.950
 damn we'll go for it 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.330
 that's it and you see we can move on to 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.700
 through the bank should not stay too 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.200
 a long time otherwise you simply die 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.520
 may 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.530
 but this is the first 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.640
 little challenge that's pretty simple but 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.800
 phone you have to know it anyway 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.319
 to see him 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.580
 sorry and so that's okay it's going 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.840
 unfold like that in fact you're going 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.970
 have small challenges everyone is 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.250
 little lever activated as here you see 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.540
 here too so here and I'm going to you 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.440
 show how that's going on what I've 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.800
 searched for a little bit of talent hour 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.670
 just gathered together we're going to recover 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.380
 the little pot au noir here and precisely 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.430
 it was written so seeks justin but 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.810
 what do I know what I need 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.980
 actually look like I'm like that 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.849
 normally if I'm not mistaken is a 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.709
 lever over here then although the ecti 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.299
 here we go we have a little lever and so 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.510
 which is well hidden elsewhere and who 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.970
 activate the gsm system to be able to 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.500
 to pass over just to pass 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.610
 face but there that you can see 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.950
 these farms and so there is a second 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.280
 lever activated then there i'm trying 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.790
 from cramer 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:48.540
 I do not know where he thinks he's on 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.540
 the right there I can leave here 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.360
 but without falling I think I'm going 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.620
 fall like that you activate though 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.700
 I show you how you have a 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.320
 little lever here that will activate the door 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.230
 I do not deceive trigger all 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.640
 levers finally and when I'm 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.410
 otherwise I still have not trigger we're going 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.710
 get there and who was not we go there 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.030
 arrive 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.070
 is that there are levers everywhere 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.350
 does thaler I support a little bit especially and 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.769
 suddenly I remember where it is that 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.600
 he must at then six months takes it's good 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.720
 this one that I had in search of 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.720
 memory 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.130
 here 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.360
 the save the door so there is 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.740
 several levers engaged so 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.539
 this one is not engaged apparently 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.490
 I'm a bit too much how I did 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.289
 finally you will of course 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.729
 without cheating me it's really for 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.050
 present the map and to advance a 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.310
 little bit in the tablecloth because if I 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.669
 spend a little too much time on a single 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.130
 room 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.500
 oh that's not very interesting it's this 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.970
 which is interesting is to see a little 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.500
 a little bit give you a little overview 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.770
 from the beginning of the adventures to give you 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.000
 want to do it and so that's it 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.949
 could also have some chests with a 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.720
 small amount of food distributed 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.660
 toulon to allow you to regenerate 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.630
 because otherwise you will have taken 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.490
 to get there so we can see property 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.050
 in the desert there is a trick was created 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.160
 it's a place that was created in the 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:13.660
 desert alas here so you can mine two 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:16.389
 blocks maxime bono you do not con 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.650
 gaston chose the good otherwise if there I 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.449
 will show you if you do not want to 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.729
 see which lever once it's not 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.050
 what you see in l2 thil city ​​which 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.159
 did not want to see which fault 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.800
 pencil stop the video now 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.630
 otherwise well listen I tell her all 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.780
 immediately the lever actuated is the one 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.780
 this 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.470
 to the passage just below and we 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.190
 can take two so you can mine 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.050
 and the two there are here to be able to pass 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.130
 here is the device we will go here 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.240
 then resume will not stop what I 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.700
 am showing you a bit of a 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.500
 little any time how to pass the matte 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.560
 so that 's fine with a little bit 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.660
 the adventure run here in fact enormously 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.050
 there is a little a little black of 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.480
 pressure there that snaps and you have to 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.650
 skip game simply for not for 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.040
 not activate it because it's triggered 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.870
 the milk that will snap a door that 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.170
 will close if you enable it from 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.340
 jump on arriving here you are there 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.660
 will have to run bah listen we are going 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.280
 stop here then you go back into the 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.720
 in clashes directly so do 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.640
 watch out because the singing bomb 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.600
 creative and there I feel like they 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.040
 do not ruin any case whatsoever 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.300
 monsters have it is rather 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.250
 quiet maybe you're in 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.060
 have and pay attention to everything 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.680
 what is around because there are some 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.170
 things we do not see and things 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.780
 we forget and you will be blue 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.740
 trample have subsequently 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.090
 so here with tea I will stay here 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.500
 because otherwise I have too much of you 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.300
 unveil it will not be interesting for 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.320
 you in any case I hope that the map 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.760
 please me, I find it rather nice 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.730
 then we are in the desert it changes a 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.700
 little bit and in the meantime I tell you to 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.820
 very soon for our video hi all 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.820
 the world
