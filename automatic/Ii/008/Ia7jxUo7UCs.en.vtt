00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
fantastical this game is sounding too

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.410

looking and so on and it is looking
fantastic<00:00:37.690> now<00:00:38.320> my<00:00:38.500> only<00:00:38.680> complaint<00:00:39.370> with<00:00:39.519> the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
fantastic now my only complaint with the

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.910 
fantastic now my only complaint with the
visuals<00:00:40.089> would<00:00:40.269> be<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.510> anti-aliasing<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:41.800> I

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
visuals would be the anti-aliasing and I

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.979 
visuals would be the anti-aliasing and I
believe<00:00:42.519> they've<00:00:42.730> added<00:00:43.059> a<00:00:43.150> new<00:00:43.330> model<00:00:43.690> since

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
believe they've added a new model since

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.660 
believe they've added a new model since
this<00:00:44.199> because<00:00:44.500> I<00:00:44.589> believe<00:00:45.040> this<00:00:45.460> is<00:00:45.519> the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
this because I believe this is the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.850 
this because I believe this is the
gamescom<00:00:46.210> build<00:00:46.629> if<00:00:46.780> it's<00:00:46.900> not<00:00:47.110> as<00:00:47.229> the<00:00:47.320> e3

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
gamescom build if it's not as the e3

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.560 
gamescom build if it's not as the e3
build<00:00:48.129> which<00:00:48.309> are<00:00:48.460> quite<00:00:48.670> early<00:00:48.850> builds<00:00:49.390> and

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
build which are quite early builds and

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.680 
build which are quite early builds and
they<00:00:49.960> added<00:00:50.290> an<00:00:50.379> anti-aliasing<00:00:51.100> build<00:00:52.030> but

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
they added an anti-aliasing build but

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.270 
they added an anti-aliasing build but
they<00:00:52.809> added<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.080> anti-aliasing<00:00:53.650> onto<00:00:54.129> it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
they added the anti-aliasing onto it

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.039 
they added the anti-aliasing onto it
just<00:00:54.850> after<00:00:55.059> games<00:00:55.420> come<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:55.720> believe

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
just after games come I believe

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.109 
just after games come I believe
especially<00:00:56.260> they<00:00:56.890> they<00:00:57.400> demonstrated<00:00:57.940> it

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:58.119 
especially they they demonstrated it

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:59.880 
especially they they demonstrated it
with<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.420> night<00:00:58.690> video<00:00:59.409> that<00:00:59.680> they<00:00:59.830> were

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
with the night video that they were

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.509 
with the night video that they were
showing<00:01:00.280> so<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.510> game<00:01:01.690> is<00:01:01.720> looking<00:01:02.140> fantastic

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
showing so the game is looking fantastic

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.520 
showing so the game is looking fantastic

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
the first time i played is because they

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.230 
the first time i played is because they
don't<00:01:56.229> expect<00:01:56.619> respect<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.429> handling<00:01:57.969> model

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
don't expect respect the handling model

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.050 
don't expect respect the handling model
that<00:01:58.659> we<00:01:58.840> got<00:01:59.109> with<00:01:59.740> driveclub<00:02:00.310> it's

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
that we got with driveclub it's

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.209 
that we got with driveclub it's
something<00:02:01.450> new<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.810> different<00:02:01.869> but<00:02:02.710> it<00:02:02.799> feels

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
something new and different but it feels

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.419 
something new and different but it feels
more<00:02:03.749> simulation<00:02:04.749> than<00:02:05.289> it<00:02:05.619> does<00:02:05.889> arcade

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
more simulation than it does arcade

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.999 
more simulation than it does arcade
which<00:02:06.789> is<00:02:06.999> good<00:02:07.270> in<00:02:07.389> my<00:02:07.509> opinion<00:02:07.560> because<00:02:08.560> in

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
which is good in my opinion because in

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.490 
which is good in my opinion because in
the<00:02:09.160> way<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.640> cars<00:02:09.910> handle<00:02:10.539> wants<00:02:11.319> the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
the way that the cars handle wants the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.550 
the way that the cars handle wants the
ass<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.010> car<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.580> out<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.540> out<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.080> you

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
ass of the car is out it is out and you

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.460 
ass of the car is out it is out and you
need<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.980> learn<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.280> control<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:16.000> car

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
need to learn to control that car

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.630 
need to learn to control that car
specifically<00:02:17.470> because<00:02:17.740> I<00:02:17.890> believe<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.520> all

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
specifically because I believe that all

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.630 
specifically because I believe that all
cars<00:02:18.910> will<00:02:19.120> feel<00:02:19.780> different<00:02:20.380> as<00:02:20.560> such<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.400> so

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
cars will feel different as such and so

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
cars will feel different as such and so
on<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.920> sense<00:02:24.280> of<00:02:24.460> speed<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.940> definitely

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
on so this sense of speed is definitely

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.780 
on so this sense of speed is definitely
there<00:02:25.900> I've<00:02:26.620> noticed<00:02:27.010> some<00:02:27.190> games<00:02:27.430> reach

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
there I've noticed some games reach

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.830 
there I've noticed some games reach
they<00:02:27.879> don't<00:02:28.060> really<00:02:28.209> have<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.390> sense<00:02:28.689> of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
they don't really have the sense of

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.080 
they don't really have the sense of
speed<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.349> you're<00:02:29.530> going<00:02:29.680> but<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.159> speed<00:02:30.489> is

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
speed that you're going but the speed is

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.479 
speed that you're going but the speed is
definitely<00:02:31.900> noticeable<00:02:32.469> in<00:02:32.709> driveclub<00:02:33.010> and

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
definitely noticeable in driveclub and

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.729 
definitely noticeable in driveclub and
especially<00:02:34.180> when<00:02:34.629> you<00:02:34.780> go<00:02:34.900> up<00:02:35.049> to<00:02:35.079> a<00:02:35.260> corner

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
especially when you go up to a corner

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.800 
especially when you go up to a corner
and<00:02:35.859> you<00:02:36.370> don't<00:02:36.609> realize<00:02:36.819> how<00:02:37.060> fast<00:02:37.540> you're

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
and you don't realize how fast you're

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.990 
and you don't realize how fast you're
actually<00:02:37.959> going<00:02:38.469> and<00:02:38.859> then<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.790> up<00:02:39.969> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
actually going and then you up the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.520 
actually going and then you up the
corner<00:02:40.450> quite<00:02:40.629> a<00:02:40.659> bit<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.969> so<00:02:42.969> out<00:02:43.959> of<00:02:44.019> all<00:02:44.319> the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
corner quite a bit and so out of all the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.750 
corner quite a bit and so out of all the
racing<00:02:44.859> games<00:02:45.040> on<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.310> show<00:02:45.459> this<00:02:45.609> is

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
racing games on the show this is

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.819 
racing games on the show this is
probably<00:02:45.939> one<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.209> my<00:02:46.329> favorite<00:02:46.900> overall<00:02:47.590> it

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
probably one of my favorite overall it

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.880 
probably one of my favorite overall it
is<00:02:47.859> just<00:02:48.189> the<00:02:48.400> well-built<00:02:49.049> one<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:50.500> demo

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
is just the well-built one and the demo

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.729 
is just the well-built one and the demo
actually<00:02:51.549> well<00:02:52.150> put<00:02:52.480> together<00:02:52.659> that<00:02:53.590> was

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
actually well put together that was

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.140 
actually well put together that was
probably<00:02:53.889> one<00:02:54.159> of<00:02:54.189> my<00:02:54.310> biggest<00:02:54.549> complaints

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
probably one of my biggest complaints

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.670 
probably one of my biggest complaints
about<00:02:55.239> you're<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.480> gamer<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.870> demos<00:02:56.200> did<00:02:56.409> feel

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
about you're a gamer the demos did feel

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.890 
about you're a gamer the demos did feel
a<00:02:56.709> bit<00:02:56.980> throwing<00:02:57.609> together<00:02:57.849> at<00:02:58.150> last<00:02:58.329> minute

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
a bit throwing together at last minute

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.539 
a bit throwing together at last minute
they<00:02:59.139> didn't<00:02:59.379> really<00:02:59.680> seem<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:01.090> be<00:03:02.189> well<00:03:03.189> done

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
they didn't really seem to be well done

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.399 
they didn't really seem to be well done
they<00:03:03.819> seemed<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.239> be<00:03:04.329> no<00:03:04.629> are<00:03:04.900> we<00:03:04.930> need<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.290> make

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
they seemed to be no are we need to make

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.259 
they seemed to be no are we need to make
a<00:03:05.439> demo<00:03:05.680> for<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.069> games<00:03:06.310> conference<00:03:06.760> let's<00:03:07.000> just

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
a demo for a games conference let's just

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.319 
a demo for a games conference let's just
throw<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.659> together<00:03:07.750> which<00:03:08.169> rivals<00:03:09.329> rivals

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
throw it together which rivals rivals

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.740 
throw it together which rivals rivals
did<00:03:10.599> feel<00:03:10.900> thrown<00:03:11.169> together<00:03:11.409> as<00:03:11.829> well<00:03:12.340> as

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
did feel thrown together as well as

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.059 
did feel thrown together as well as
mainly<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.840> third<00:03:14.019> party<00:03:14.439> ones<00:03:14.590> exclusive

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
mainly the third party ones exclusive

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.800 
mainly the third party ones exclusive
ones<00:03:15.250> did<00:03:15.459> seem<00:03:15.700> put<00:03:16.030> together<00:03:16.180> well<00:03:16.510> for

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
ones did seem put together well for

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.080 
ones did seem put together well for
demonstration<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.650> typically<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.700> ones<00:03:18.879> I

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
demonstration and typically the ones I

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.149 
demonstration and typically the ones I
enjoyed<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.810> lot<00:03:20.019> more<00:03:20.319> because<00:03:20.590> they<00:03:20.739> were<00:03:20.889> put

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
enjoyed a lot more because they were put

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.589 
enjoyed a lot more because they were put
together<00:03:21.310> well<00:03:21.639> which<00:03:21.819> I'll<00:03:21.939> get<00:03:22.030> into<00:03:22.090> detail

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
together well which I'll get into detail

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.360 
together well which I'll get into detail
with<00:03:22.629> the<00:03:22.870> others<00:03:23.079> when<00:03:23.109> I<00:03:23.290> get<00:03:23.470> into<00:03:23.620> so

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
obviously I did try the DualShock with

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.509 
obviously I did try the DualShock with
this<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.439> trying<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.769> new<00:03:26.889> console<00:03:27.370> all

together doing races together on the
same<00:05:53.200> track<00:05:53.940> obviously<00:05:54.940> 4v4<00:05:55.480> not<00:05:55.720> literally

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
same track obviously 4v4 not literally

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.900 
same track obviously 4v4 not literally
working<00:05:56.290> yellow<00:05:56.740> but<00:05:56.920> you<00:05:57.340> know<00:05:57.430> two<00:05:57.640> teams

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
working yellow but you know two teams

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.750 
working yellow but you know two teams
against<00:05:58.360> each<00:05:58.450> other<00:05:58.710> going<00:05:59.710> you<00:06:00.220> know<00:06:00.340> at<00:06:00.520> it

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
against each other going you know at it

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.400 
against each other going you know at it
but<00:06:01.210> anyway<00:06:01.480> this<00:06:01.690> was<00:06:01.870> probably<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.230> most

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
but anyway this was probably the most

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.150 
but anyway this was probably the most
solid<00:06:02.800> build<00:06:03.330> the<00:06:04.330> demo<00:06:04.690> actually<00:06:05.350> whole<00:06:05.950> out
