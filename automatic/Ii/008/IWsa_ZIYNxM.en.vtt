00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.550
 if you see it's a new video with us 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.750
 in this video I will show you two new ones 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.090
 tutorial and I decided to register 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.160
 the whole video for a matter of time 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.900
 then to show how to create a 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.920
 blind curve to your head if you are nothing 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.289
 more 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.840
 moretti is a new art like 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.360
 color red and combed de corones cido 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.490
 I decided to record this video 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.030
 because thanks to the universe horn of 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.160
 months a girl was very kind and 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.530
 just advised me how to do 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.460
 there is a good curve even if not if not 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.079
 I have a clamp before I start 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.649
 some telelibera and just us however 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.800
 I would like to thank acute betti 78 who 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.219
 the girl he wanted to share 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.420
 like this, I thank you for the 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.489
 irons for helping me in a coma 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.510
 now let's start with creating the 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.850
 our structure 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.269
 I have already put my map here 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.220
 then performing a reconstruction with 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.290
 extension precisely with the bad mi 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.390
 I recommend making all the various 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.250
 engineering preparation phases 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.530
 here now you are seeing that I am 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.750
 putting the product and man is just a 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.409
 coarse they are not totally 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.079
 growth because as I'm sorry I'm 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:26.359
 all creating me an abbot to do then 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:28.939
 a curved area then asked face 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.950
 gone just that is when mine 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.670
 connection and length 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.670
 desired 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.110
 once the length is reached 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.350
 that I have in mind before putting them 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.920
 lamp I try to outline better i 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.940
 edges with flat brush after which one 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:07.750
 once finished in bed in lamp for 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:09.580
 about 40 seconds from over 40 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.880
 second what we do take one 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.080
 simple burns hanger with le 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.569
 pegs the advice to resume 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.970
 pegs that are fitted ie that are 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.640
 the quilts also you see that they have 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.980
 these children so that not once 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.550
 the legendary on your olga not 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.760
 They make aesthetic anti pledges saying 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.819
 every time, take this 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.650
 burn the break from at this point here 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.200
 about 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.850
 I have drawn this ep the studies mentioned 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.209
 to break because if you are limited to 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.100
 simply pulling them lose theirs 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.239
 pension and therefore do not push you well 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.100
 Long told him when you remove the 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.970
 your a grade on 40 for con of 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.310
 lamp 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.180
 let's take our wife 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.850
 roughly and we insert it so after 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.540
 that we put it in a lamp and finish it 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:11.049
 precisely the pleasant altitude time for 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.850
 catalyze a builder gel 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.709
 finished the Icelandic catalization from 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.540
 I remove my maps and created my baby 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.640
 the faster I make the pony friend 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.150
 gently placed at the center 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.120
 cuticles and toes trying not to 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.070
 touch them otherwise this will make me gods 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.109
 uprisings so girls like of 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.880
 these also that had to drool before 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.100
 to put in the lamp clean on the throne 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.019
 with orange sticks once 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.480
 Once I have done my camber , I put it in 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.440
 the padalino for 40 seconds after a 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.450
 moment and I put my little pizza back 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.620
 in this way I put it back in the lamp is 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.120
 as with 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.090
 previously as we did 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.150
 previously we finish the minutes 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.209
 the catalyst once completed 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.790
 we renew our sect again 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.190
 and let's start coaching to create for 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.739
 give the most correct shape possible 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.569
 our idea four years the buffer is 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.400
 this is the result of the q basin e 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.920
 see that I did some complexity 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.970
 cicciotta but you try to 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:16.000
 also thin as possible if you notice 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.430
 for example that below that I am 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.440
 doing with the brush is too narrow 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.080
 you see too closed you take 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.949
 waiting with the compactness and the past 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.720
 under 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.970
 in this way you will widen slightly 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.560
 the thin syrup curve also meshes the 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.270
 your tip then the first part of the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.100
 video finished now I'll show you 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.100
 precisely the decoration 

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:45.459
 now i take my 08 starts await 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:47.649
 a first coat of color in this way 

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:49.239
 once covered all the nails it 

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:51.729
 catalyzes in the lamp for itself soldiers 

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:55.659
 finished catalyst to outside 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.879
 without dealing precisely with one 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:00.459
 second color coat I recommend 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.169
 try to cover the sides well and 

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:03.610
 especially the fontaine when in 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.799
 how much color you must see from 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.479
 an angle once what the 

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:09.339
 catalyzed second coat of color 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.049
 lamp for another three minutes 

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:14.469
 pull out happy turn directly 

00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:16.479
 without handling sealed note 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:19.599
 catalyzed lamp for coconut limits 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:23.559
 take out defatted it started to 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:26.409
 beat the beat to dull or make us 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:27.729
 after the sealant that this way 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.479
 we're going to make the surface 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:35.679
 completely opaque without spoiling 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:37.539
 the color below so do this 

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:38.889
 procedure in an accurate manner as 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.899
 there must be absolutely no 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.589
 need and color lights must be 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:48.300
 uniformly but precisely once 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:51.069
 satisfied with the result thanks to you 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.319
 with clean air or if you want also with 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:54.729
 of ethyl alcohol that will favor precisely 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.309
 the mat effect 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.029
 once you have dealt with this it will be 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:02.289
 just 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:05.459
 the final effect of a nail with 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.459
 matte effect 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:13.010
 now it is a vigilance without dispersion 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.470
 what should not be treated signed up 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.690
 a few drops in this way 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.590
 now being white not so much yes 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.990
 they saw that if the amount I got 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.340
 will serve and go to create the apple precisely 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.470
 with brush and started teaching 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.720
 a little rose as if we were 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.030
 using simple acrylic colors 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.470
 to see the video on the little rose 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.270
 go to my channel that there are i 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.720
 ten thousand micro that closed where I do 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:44.090
 see how to create creole rue roses 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.420
 Cleo is at the center two leaves from a 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.100
 side and the other side of the rose after that 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.990
 take it smarino with champagne i 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.140
 raw dash the two stars all in e 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:57.530
 that on one side than on the other hand we take 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.780
 the spot or an orange stick e 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.760
 I believe points of local line start that 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.320
 the grown- ups and then consider smaller 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:08.120
 always understand it by the thin tip 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.790
 local for 5 minutes 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.910
 and this is the result of the auction 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.040
 over then I will post the photos of the 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.400
 result on how they came with the 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.230
 long 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.860
 I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.240
 thank you again betti 78 both for the 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.080
 warp c 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.490
 I dedicate this video to too much star 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.350
 that since he had it in art 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.540
 much struck he had much appreciated 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.880
 asked me to make a video for her 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.830
 show her how she idealized her 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.860
 then 0 which builds both 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.660
 quite clear and understandable 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.120
 before serving you could recommend them 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:47.750
 subscribe to the forum because they know each other 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:50.300
 so many fantastic girls you can 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:54.350
 learn so many things as per 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:08:00.890
 example that of the dl clamp for the 

00:07:54.350 --> 00:08:03.140
 curve what else to tell you I send you a 

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.600
 true kiss that you challenge so many 

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.310
 because completely free greeting 

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.470
 all the girls in the forum send a 

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:11.150
 kiss muldoon kiss you too and you 

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:13.310
 thank you so much for your attention 

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.820
 let's see to the next tutor bye to all 

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.820
 girls
