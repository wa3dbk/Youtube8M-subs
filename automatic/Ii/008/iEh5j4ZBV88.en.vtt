00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.700
 very good guys we are we have 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.189
 minecraft and look what I have in the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.449
 inventory agree this well apart 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.669
 of being a star that surpasses 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.550
 even the hub of the objects that 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.200
 we can have in minecraft as that is 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.970
 another edition of the surf 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.730
 so I've been bringing you for 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 a few days ago not so good well you 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.669
 I'm going to teach three things that are very 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.670
 bestial are three things that are 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.320
 amazing and I think that they are going to 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.780
 love guys I think with this 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.760
 make adventure maps with it turns out that 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.699
 edited I think it will turn out to be 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.710
 a wonder and well let's go to 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.999
 show him first what this rail would be 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.699
 according to this rail that would be 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:53.460
 really a cactus is a cactus 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.140
 become a train rail and here 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.269
 we have our example I'm going to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.399
 remove and I'll show you that 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.999
 example if I gave efe 3 see that I have 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.850
 17 fps very low fps even 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:09.120
 being in a flat world with nothing 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.920
 absolutely but good is something that 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.630
 still being studied is possible 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.969
 that they still improve it a little more 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.159
 this issue of the fps downloads is but 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.020
 is that it is amazing 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.509
 what coolest things even taking 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.909
 even texture errors like you can 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.880
 see what we have right now has some 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.649
 error but it is something that is 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.450
 pretty cool and you'll ask me 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.520
 how put the minecraft surely 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.770
 some will know and as I have done is 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.890
 thus putting a real life justly 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.020
 here below and the cactus well here in 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.599
 this block of sand that we have here in 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.179
 this part does not so simply because 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.700
 we put the sand block we put the 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.879
 cactus and as you can see the way of 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.700
 train right next to the thing is that 

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:55.799
 Well, that, as I say, is still 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.619
 studying is a way to get off 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.569
 less fps is every time this turns out that 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.640
 thank you less in this case of 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.890
 moment has not created me any time 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.110
 all those that I have tried and as I already 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.209
 I say this is the least beast so 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.679
 now let's move on to something that is 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.379
 really amazing 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.989
 good guys we have returned and where before 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:19.290
 there was a train track now we have the 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.790
 model of an archer look what else 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.040
 cool this 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.659
 it was unthinkable to do it before 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.730
 minecraft to show that what 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.980
 I'm doing is real 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.069
 I'm here right next to the model 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.629
 and because nothing I love is that I can not 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.599
 To say otherwise is that it is something 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.700
 amazing what a most vast thing is that 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.489
 I could never have thought about this 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.340
 It seems expensive df is very cool is 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.480
 something that is great but even so 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.810
 I'm going to put time set to see 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.260
 but perfect, even so, this is not true either 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.330
 is the most vast of this it turns out that no 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.340
 there are three different results each 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.530
 with a model and each one so what 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.900
 does it modify the cactus not so 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.819
 then on the other hand we have this 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.370
 archer who is also pretty cool 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.720
 I invite you to try it makes it 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.440
 see that there is a lot less as you see 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.690
 I'm at 60 fps it 's so good the rail 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.690
 Well, yes, it is pretty, but this 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.099
 model practically nothing not not the one 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.709
 called minecraft and the truth that is 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:25.430
 pretty cool is very very very accomplished 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.220
 now yes let's go to the last one turns out and 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.700
 you are going to see what amazing is all good 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.849
 Well here we are looking what else 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.379
 cool what wonder are scarce are 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:41.750
 houses are houses between modeled in 3d 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.430
 and that we can even enter to see it 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.700
 not here where the cactus is here 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.730
 we have the my car 'that I do not even see 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.090
 even and then look what else 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.870
 cool look what things prettier uncle 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.810
 is what 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.640
 my god I can not imagine with the 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.769
 things that can be created from 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.840
 now in main craft thanks to all this 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.500
 I do not say that you can use that 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.870
 as you can see, I go through everything but 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.069
 as a decoration you can do wonders 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.220
 it's amazing what is going to happen 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:19.519
 in the future in minecraft thanks to everything 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.290
 this I do not know is that the one that hallucinates me 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.180
 I have brought you several days in a row 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.500
 of surf pack with different things with 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.690
 the lego blocks with the blocks 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.750
 spherical with blocks good with 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.400
 hexagons but it is already this is raw 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.860
 the drop that fills the glass I think that 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.610
 after this I do not know anymore I do not know what it is 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.070
 what they are going to be able to take out I keep creating 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.949
 my own results but this is going 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.289
 open great ideas to do 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.850
 different things so good I'm going to 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.410
 keep working I'll try 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.710
 finish it as soon as possible before 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.680
 I copied the idea and then nothing if it has 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.800
 liked this good this pack of results 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.539

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.830
 Well, I suppose I can bring some way 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.450
 of time to record it and liked it
