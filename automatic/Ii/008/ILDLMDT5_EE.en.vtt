00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.620
 the selection 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.830
 somehow contaminated by the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.530
 Borda distrust for all the bad 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.139
 results that have occurred in this 2003 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.630
 and that the critical situation is so abrupt 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.300
 the trial would be more viable it will go up 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.580
 is going through that group that is the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.130
 group that has the debt of which both 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.970
 we talk about moving forward when 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.740
 better if the team 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.050
 good when one's decision 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.490
 decision now not to compromise or 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.130
 those who are going to integrate this new 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.550
 selection 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:48.160
 what we depend on is simply to put 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.080
 to work in his club every one and 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.070
 try to be in the best of the 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.560
 clear levels that we were losing the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.680
 trust and when confidence will be lost 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.980
 Without any success 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.350
 I think that while but the moment 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.880
 that those who go or go to the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.729
 selection 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.630
 they close fixed they work with a 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.060
 same idea and we are convinced that 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.080
 has been the best decision and that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.080
 only then can we move forward 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.080
 d 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.380
 convinced that the best action is 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.440
 just as it is to take the determination 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:34.090
 because the former body as temuco 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.660
 his family life is clear 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.550
 he kept the note lying for not 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.530
 have good results because he took that 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.040
 determination 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.720
 now this decision is made and vÃ­ctor 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.750
 manuel vucetich and we have to be 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.369
 convinced that it is the best decision 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.320
 of not paying it now we're just going to 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.600
 Commit to your idea 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.350
 all the people who go to the selection and 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.350
 only so 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.250
 7 upi missed American luxury flats 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.770
 after the justice that remains 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.210
 World champion is won by creating 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.500
 this error measure 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.500
 finished the line 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.790
 that we are all clear that if they were 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.000
 important achievements but that remained in the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.550
 past and all of us who do the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.560
 selection was not anxious about 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.560
 get the positive results 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.730
 a critical moment but we should be 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:49.790
 convinced that we are going to be for 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:51.530
 100 2014 and only working us what 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.889
 we are going to achieve are the matches that 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:59.689
 we have to play and win them that we 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:02.389
 it is clear and only thus still by 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:05.230
 question of models up directly 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.230
 we can enter 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.750
 and encouragement we will fight until the last 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.670
 of course you have to do the job first 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.040
 inside the court 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.310
 and now the words that their 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.310
 faults 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.380
 when trust is lost it is difficult 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.080
 and to reach success is then more 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.330
 complicated to regain the mental level and 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.000
 emotionally touristy from the countryside 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.910
 good football now it's important the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.120
 clear mental aspect but I think that 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.730
 as professionals that we are we have to 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.620
 hold the page to know that the only thing 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.670
 that will take us forward is the 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.130
 daily work yes clear as all 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.680
 we know we have to analyze what has been 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.770
 We stopped doing what we have 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.780
 wrong and try to improve it and give 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.500
 turn the page and keep going I 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.700
 I think that's going to be very important 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.260
 now those in the analysis that they do 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.970
 personally in the self-criticism what 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.020
 conclusions come from why it came 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.310
 to this situation 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.130
 verified 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.800
 and what 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.980
 as the colleagues who have said 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.430
 ceased to be things inside the cane 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.919
 without making bad decisions 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.580
 each one I think we are responsible for 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.070
 that new thing equally I know it was 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.590
 wrong also in certain 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.990
 moment and that bothers me a lot and I 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.810
 it hurts but we have to continue 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.820
 go ahead just work on what 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.270
 we have stopped doing good that we 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.750
 We have also wrong and pure not knowing 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.630
 what can we get out of this by working 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.760
 of the community 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.950
 there is a union of all the fronts that 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.170
 all be united it 's time maybe 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.570
 also that players stop 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.100
 visit put your personal interests and 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.610
 join this selection to go on 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.810
 look for that ticket to the world 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.180
 well we are convinced that we are going to 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.340
 behave badly good we're going to 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:11.350
 contribute for the partner for because 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:16.840
 he was representing all corn and 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:19.150
 no personal self-interest always 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.040
 we are thinking about helping the partner in 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.800
 always move situations forward 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:28.210
 complicated and trying to succeed 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:30.220
 but we know that here they do not win united or 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.170
 neither loses friends we do not 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.380
 everyone in a group and that's how we work 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.380
 and that's how we're going to play 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.400
 good is an issue that was talked about in that 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.460
 they respect the decisions that also 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.830
 at this time they took so much of the 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.350
 column that is respected will also have 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.540
 his reasons clear that now is time 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.110
 that we all add that we all 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.310
 let's join as Mexicans who are equal 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.620
 only in that way can we get out 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.380
 ahead 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.990
 me how important is animals 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:12.530
 virtual for you unknown 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:15.740
 equally and beginning to change the 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:19.070
 mentality and take something positive if it's 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.130
 important print what leaves you 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.200
 select now you focus on the team 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.990
 Of course they do not forget but you know that 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.220
 you have to work day to day always 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.590
 trying to improve your level 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.290
 football and now we have a 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.840
 opportunity not always to help and to 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:39.470
 add now with blue cross and we're going to 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.820
 do as always trying to follow 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.470
 improving day by day 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.430
 thank you very much 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.430
 life
