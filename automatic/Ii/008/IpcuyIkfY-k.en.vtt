replaceable hard plastic screen

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.410 
replaceable hard plastic screen
protector<00:00:18.650> so<00:00:19.650> we'll<00:00:20.609> just<00:00:20.789> take<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.119> screen

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420

silicone<00:00:27.720> has<00:00:28.349> reinforced<00:00:29.010> corners<00:00:29.960> because

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
silicone has reinforced corners because

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.209 
silicone has reinforced corners because
we<00:00:31.140> all<00:00:31.260> know<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.160> drop<00:00:32.579> your<00:00:32.759> phone

we all know that if you drop your phone
chances<00:00:35.219> are<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> fall<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.120> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
chances are it's going to fall on one of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.850 
chances are it's going to fall on one of
the<00:00:36.270> corners<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.780> they<00:00:36.899> decide<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.260> reinforce

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the corners so they decide to reinforce

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.990 
the corners so they decide to reinforce
it<00:00:39.410> next<00:00:40.410> layer<00:00:40.649> would<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> polycarbonate

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
it next layer would be the polycarbonate

it next layer would be the polycarbonate
hard<00:00:42.239> shell<00:00:42.950> display<00:00:43.950> right<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.780> and

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
hard shell display right here and

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.369 
hard shell display right here and
directly<00:00:47.820> molded<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.510> top<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.350> have

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
directly molded on top of that we have

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.189 
directly molded on top of that we have
our<00:00:49.739> impact<00:00:50.280> resistant<00:00:50.850> polymer<00:00:51.559> right<00:00:52.559> here

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
our impact resistant polymer right here

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.200 
our impact resistant polymer right here
in<00:00:55.199> other<00:00:55.410> words<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.940> hard

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
in other words it's just a really hard

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.119 
in other words it's just a really hard
rubber<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.090> case<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.270> very<00:01:00.600> easy<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.020> use

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
rubber so this case is very easy to use

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.709 
rubber so this case is very easy to use
first<00:01:02.129> things<00:01:02.309> first<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.210> place<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
first things first you just place the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
first things first you just place the
screen<00:01:04.049> protector<00:01:04.439> darkly<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.040> top<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.549> your

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
screen protector darkly on top of your

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
screen protector darkly on top of your
device<00:01:06.619> take<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.799> silicone<00:01:08.310> skin<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.909> we'll

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
device take the silicone skin and we'll

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.530 
device take the silicone skin and we'll
just<00:01:10.049> wrap<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.260> around<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:11.610> skin<00:01:12.030> actually

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
just wrap that around the skin actually

just wrap that around the skin actually
holds<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> screen<00:01:13.409> protector<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.830> place<00:01:18.500> so

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
holds the screen protector in place so

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.530 
holds the screen protector in place so
it<00:01:19.590> should<00:01:19.740> look<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.420> after<00:01:21.420> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
it should look like this after that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.070 
it should look like this after that
you'll<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.530> reattach<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.310> outer<00:01:24.080> hard
