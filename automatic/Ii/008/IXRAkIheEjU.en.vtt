Kubla it could be implemented into
downloadable<00:03:49.169> content<00:03:49.349> and<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:50.370> one<00:03:50.549> that

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
downloadable content and the one that

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.289 
downloadable content and the one that
strikes<00:03:51.120> me<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.389> most<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:52.229> the<00:03:52.879> aa-12<00:03:53.879> which

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
strikes me the most is the aa-12 which

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.409 
strikes me the most is the aa-12 which
