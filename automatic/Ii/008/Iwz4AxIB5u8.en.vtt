you're one of the leaders or yep I'm a
sector<00:01:18.100> commander<00:01:18.520> yeah<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:18.970> basically<00:01:19.420> what

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
sector commander yeah so basically what

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.450 
sector commander yeah so basically what
it<00:01:19.869> is<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.470> whole<00:01:20.650> two<00:01:20.950> days<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.430> a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
it is is the whole two days is a

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.670 
it is is the whole two days is a
campaign<00:01:22.060> right<00:01:22.510> so<00:01:22.810> what<00:01:22.960> we're<00:01:23.140> doing<00:01:23.170> is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
campaign right so what we're doing is

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.070 
campaign right so what we're doing is
that<00:01:23.979> each<00:01:24.550> sector<00:01:25.240> is<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.420> different<00:01:25.810> planet

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
that each sector is a different planet

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.280 
that each sector is a different planet
that<00:01:26.830> is<00:01:27.009> being<00:01:27.280> affected<00:01:27.550> by<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.000> hiding<00:01:28.630> so

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
that is being affected by the hiding so

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.990 
that is being affected by the hiding so
I<00:01:29.470> believe<00:01:29.740> Leviathan<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.369> coming<00:01:30.790> out<00:01:30.880> on

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
I believe Leviathan is coming out on

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.210 
I believe Leviathan is coming out on
attacking<00:01:31.300> all<00:01:31.570> different<00:01:32.110> planets<00:01:32.619> and<00:01:32.800> the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
attacking all different planets and the

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.219 
attacking all different planets and the
Imperial<00:01:33.729> side<00:01:33.940> is<00:01:34.149> basically<00:01:34.690> trying<00:01:34.990> to

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
Imperial side is basically trying to

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.139 
Imperial side is basically trying to
force<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.830> tyranids<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.430> go<00:01:36.550> and<00:01:36.729> attack<00:01:36.940> an

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
force the tyranids to go and attack an

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.780 
force the tyranids to go and attack an
orc<00:01:37.420> planet<00:01:37.899> instead<00:01:38.560> of<00:01:38.710> attacking<00:01:39.130> Imperial

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
orc planet instead of attacking Imperial

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.460 
orc planet instead of attacking Imperial
and<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.630> what's<00:01:40.810> happening<00:01:41.170> in<00:01:41.259> all<00:01:41.350> these

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
and so what's happening in all these

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.980 
and so what's happening in all these
games<00:01:41.740> is<00:01:42.040> each<00:01:42.490> sector<00:01:43.090> what<00:01:43.390> happens<00:01:43.810> in<00:01:43.960> the

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
games is each sector what happens in the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.380 
games is each sector what happens in the
game<00:01:44.259> will<00:01:44.619> then<00:01:44.770> affect<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.399> story<00:01:45.759> as<00:01:46.119> the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
game will then affect the story as the

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.930 
game will then affect the story as the

assuming<00:02:17.850> we<00:02:17.880> have<00:02:18.000> stratagem<00:02:18.780> points<00:02:19.200> like

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
assuming we have stratagem points like

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.870 
assuming we have stratagem points like
we<00:02:19.470> thought<00:02:19.770> we<00:02:19.920> would<00:02:19.950> they're<00:02:20.610> going<00:02:20.820> to

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
we thought we would they're going to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.880 
we thought we would they're going to
have<00:02:20.970> everything<00:02:21.240> up<00:02:21.540> here<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.050> drop<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.680> and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
have everything up here and drop so and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.660 
have everything up here and drop so and
i'll<00:02:23.070> decide<00:02:23.370> launch<00:02:24.380> those<00:02:25.380> guys<00:02:25.590> but<00:02:25.950> that

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
i'll decide launch those guys but that

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.620 
i'll decide launch those guys but that
kind<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.910> backfired<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:28.880> costing<00:02:29.880> more<00:02:30.570> to

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
kind of backfired it is costing more to

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.250 
kind of backfired it is costing more to
shreds<00:02:31.050> my<00:02:31.260> bunch<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.620> bugs<00:02:33.050> got<00:02:34.050> off<00:02:34.140> his

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
shreds my bunch of bugs got off his

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.199 
shreds my bunch of bugs got off his
first<00:02:34.530> round<00:02:34.800> but<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.220> predict<00:02:35.670> overall<00:02:41.209> okay

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
first round but I predict overall okay

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.850 
first round but I predict overall okay
that<00:02:42.480> makes<00:02:42.600> sense<00:02:42.660> she's<00:02:43.440> appeared<00:02:43.770> in

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
that makes sense she's appeared in

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.320 
that makes sense she's appeared in
