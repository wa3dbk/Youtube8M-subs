time<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.670> was<00:01:02.789> making<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.359> think<00:01:03.870> about<00:01:03.960> two

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
time we was making I think about two

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.850 
time we was making I think about two
thousand<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.250> about<00:01:05.600> 2,800<00:01:06.600> coins<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.990> 3200

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.460 
thousand to about 2,800 coins to 3200
Cline's<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.220> every<00:01:09.000> single<00:01:09.210> aboa<00:01:09.810> bonus<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.350> we

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
Cline's on every single aboa bonus so we

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.740 
Cline's on every single aboa bonus so we
made<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> lot<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.070> coins<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.729> player<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.180> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
made a lot of coins on that player and I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.910 
made a lot of coins on that player and I
think<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> last<00:01:13.770> one

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
think this is going to be the last one

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.609 
think this is going to be the last one
here<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.310> pick<00:01:14.490> them<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.930> 3500<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.049> bid<00:01:16.409> and

where<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.159> can't<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.640> list<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.060> play<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
where you can't just list you play a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.490 
where you can't just list you play a
straight<00:01:30.540> away<00:01:30.720> you've<00:01:30.869> got<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.110> see<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> you

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
straight away you've got to see a you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.679 
straight away you've got to see a you
know<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> few<00:01:32.180> malfunction<00:01:33.180> errors<00:01:33.540> or

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
know a few malfunction errors or

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.850 
know a few malfunction errors or
something<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.140> know<00:01:34.170> saying<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.740> your

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
something you know saying that your

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.710 
something you know saying that your
player<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:35.310> ready<00:01:35.640> yet<00:01:35.790> etc<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
player is not ready yet etc and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.020 
player is not ready yet etc and
hopefully<00:01:37.710> they<00:01:37.829> fix<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.610> soon<00:01:38.759> because

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
hopefully they fix that soon because

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.700 
hopefully they fix that soon because
that<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.360> was<00:01:39.509> incredibly<00:01:40.140> annoying<00:01:40.409> last

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that it was incredibly annoying last

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.380 
that it was incredibly annoying last
year<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.130> hopefully<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.850> doesn't<00:01:42.030> become<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
year and hopefully that doesn't become a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.420 
year and hopefully that doesn't become a
theme<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:42.990> trading<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.740> year<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:44.130> that

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
theme for trading this year because that

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.179 
theme for trading this year because that
was<00:01:44.939> an<00:01:45.060> absolute<00:01:45.420> ball<00:01:45.600> buster<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.409> logged

at all time when you're trading it's

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.900 
at all time when you're trading it's
very<00:03:22.410> very<00:03:22.590> easy<00:03:22.620> just<00:03:22.920> ten<00:03:23.280> percent<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.760> it

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
very very easy just ten percent of it

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.910 
very very easy just ten percent of it
and<00:03:24.060> then<00:03:24.150> half<00:03:24.360> again<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.530> see<00:03:25.709> like<00:03:25.890> if

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
and then half again so you see like if

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.340 
and then half again so you see like if
something's<00:03:26.519> at<00:03:26.700> 20<00:03:27.000> k<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.690> know<00:03:27.989> that<00:03:28.170> goes

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
something's at 20 k you know that goes

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.740 
something's at 20 k you know that goes
to<00:03:28.560> 10k<00:03:29.010> for<00:03:29.310> ten<00:03:29.489> percent<00:03:29.850> no<00:03:29.940> Twitter<00:03:30.239> 20k

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
for ten percent and then obviously half

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.580 
for ten percent and then obviously half
again<00:03:32.610> for<00:03:32.820> five<00:03:32.940> percent<00:03:33.269> 10k<00:03:33.959> incredibly

again for five percent 10k incredibly
easy<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.860> do<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.390> you<00:03:36.390> know<00:03:36.420> it's<00:03:36.630> just<00:03:36.750> a

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
easy to do and you know it's just a

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.319 
easy to do and you know it's just a
trick<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.680> use<00:03:37.980> for<00:03:38.010> five<00:03:38.610> percent<00:03:38.940> on<00:03:39.090> my

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
trick that I use for five percent on my

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.420 
trick that I use for five percent on my
ear<00:03:39.510> tax<00:03:39.810> every<00:03:39.989> single<00:03:40.320> time<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.769> because

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
ear tax every single time and because

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.310 
ear tax every single time and because
five<00:03:41.670> percent<00:03:41.940> tax<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.390> going<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.810> be<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.200> know

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
five percent tax is going to be you know

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.479 
five percent tax is going to be you know
the<00:03:43.350> main<00:03:43.620> reason<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:43.980> have<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.190> calculate

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
the main reason you have to calculate

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.490 
the main reason you have to calculate
because<00:03:44.940> you<00:03:45.540> will<00:03:45.660> lose<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.840> lot<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.079> coins<00:03:46.320> if

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
because you will lose a lot of coins if

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.680 
because you will lose a lot of coins if
you<00:03:46.590> do<00:03:46.739> not<00:03:46.890> calculate<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:48.570> know

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
you do not calculate that and you know

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.330 
you do not calculate that and you know
who<00:03:49.140> nobody<00:03:49.440> wants<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.739> lose<00:03:49.859> clients<00:03:50.040> now<00:03:50.280> do

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
who nobody wants to lose clients now do

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.099 
who nobody wants to lose clients now do
they<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.730> but<00:03:51.239> we<00:03:51.299> picked<00:03:51.420> up<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.660> BRI<00:03:51.840> on<00:03:51.959> that

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
they and but we picked up a BRI on that

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.690 
they and but we picked up a BRI on that
that's<00:03:52.260> going<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.739> going<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.010> profit

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
that's going to this going to profit

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.180 
that's going to this going to profit
probably<00:03:54.150> profit<00:03:54.780> about<00:03:55.019> 1100<00:03:55.799> clines<00:03:56.010> and

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
probably profit about 1100 clines and
