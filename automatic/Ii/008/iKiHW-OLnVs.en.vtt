00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.289
Welcome, my name is Sascha Limberger

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.130
and today I will

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.140
show you inventory

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.630
with ACMP 4. In this example,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.820
you will see how you can quickly

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.279
and easily inventory your computers.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:37.300
First of all please

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:39.640
log in to your ACMP console

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.489
when the individual menu points have been loaded

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.890
thereafter, you can first

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.370
configure the default installations account

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.699
You will find these under the point system

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.300
settings, agent settings. Here

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.829
for example, you will just use your

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.530
administrator to be able to

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.710
gain access to the $ admin release

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.600
of your clients.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.050
After you have saved

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.790
these configurations,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.479
please switch to the point

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.270
agent installation. Under the point

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.250
agent installation, the

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.640
clients that have been indetifed on

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.560
your Windows network will appear.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.500
The next step is the selection of

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.200
individual clients or the enter structure.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.909
in order to start the installation

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.530
please use the ACMP agent

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.570
install on slected computers.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.799
Now use the option apply

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.880
standard installation account

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.979
and affirm this dialogue by clicking ok.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.289
Thereafter the installation

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.729
will be started on the individual computers

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.579
and via installation result chain

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:56.560
you can follow how far

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:58.600
the installation has acutally gone.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.740
The first point is that the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.990
installation will always be requested.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.219
If you update you

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.929
will probably notice that

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.939
the installation is running

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.320
you can also check this

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.660
in the legend on the right side

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.030
and when the agent

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.060
has been run, the client will be

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.280
on waiting for data.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.440
This waiting for data status only means

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.980
that the server is waiting untill the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.569
client has been fully inventoried.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.000
I have just updated and

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.340
we can see here immediately

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.290
the client have all switched

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.510
to waiting for data this means that

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.700
the agent has been proparely deployed

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.190
and the server will wait untill

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.489
the respective computer

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.110
has sent it's enter set of data to the ACMP server

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.930
shortly this will also be the case

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.910
so that we can also take a look

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.420
at this client in the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.540
inventory.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:58.120
You will find the inventory

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.040
in the query administration.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.840
When the agent has been deployed

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.180
on the individual computers and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.319
the inventory has been completed,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.980
the clients will disappear from the

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.359
installation wating list

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.760
and in the main window the agent

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:16.629
installation and even the computer will

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.519
already be marked as administered.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.769
If I now switch under the point query administration

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.959
I can immediately look at

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.060
the inventory of this client.

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.109
Herefor for example, I will open the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.480
already pre finished client query,

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.669
inventory queries can be completely customized

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.220
this means that

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.579
the inventory queries that we

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.760
already provided can also be

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.410
deleted, customized or even changed.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.440
After starting the inventory queries

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.040
I can immediately see that

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.709
the computer TRAIN 1 - 6

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.840
also appear in the invetory and here

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.349
their respective inventory data has been

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.419
appropriately entered.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.440
In every inventory query

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.810
I have the opportunity

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.109
to be able to sort according to different

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.459
values or simply per drag and

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:14.319
for example, to carry out a grouping of

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.090
the respective computer. If I wish to save

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.799
configuration or a sorting,

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.660
I can just use the small

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.539
disc symbol at the top

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.210
and the ACMP console will register

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:28.240
where and in which sorting

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.770
or grouping

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.870
this query was saved.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.770
This means that even when

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.390
I place this window on my second monitor

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.090
open the ACMP console when I next

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:44.690
start the invetory the administartion

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:46.880
query will be opened on my second window.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.340
If I wish to create my own query in the query administration

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.020
to generate ones own query I need to select

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.510
just select favoured folders

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.820
and click the add button

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.070
here at the top nextly,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.590
I need to decide what my query is

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.600
ment to reveal.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.180
In my demonstration it will be a model query

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.060
where the manufacturer of the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.760
respective device will be displayed

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.500
and which model is concerned

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.440
For this I will used the

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.120
field computer name

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.190
in order to identify the computer

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.430
In addtion,

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:26.120
under the point hardware, machine

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.760
I will add the two points

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.890
system model and system manufacturer

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.380
I will also use these two fields for a sorting.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.880
In the next step I could also

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.890
define other filters

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.080
I will just leave it point empty

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.030
as well as the point security where I can set

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.890
who is allowed to

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.520
process this query or

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.940
more specifically, open

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:54.380
or even see it. The query

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:56.900
icon is completely favoured

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.990
After running this query, we will

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.330
be shown the respective information

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.790
I can release this window from the main window

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.510
in order to receive

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.960
the second window.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.090
here I also have the opportunity

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.200
to group and

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.690
maybe a nested grouping

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.510
so that I can see

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.550
for example whether the six

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.370
TRAIN computers that I just inventoried

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:27.140
are all from Fujitsu Siemens

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.460
and are from the Esprimo edition P2530.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.250
Now I can also save this query

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.720
and ACMP will also recognize that these

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.090
query was opened in a second window

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.029
and was opened on the

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:42.580
was currently opened on monitor one.

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:44.560
so with this, this information

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.069
is always available to me with

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.069
just a doubleclick.

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:52.120
Should you have any questions

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.469
about inventory with ACMP 4,

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.210
my collegues and I are

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:57.370
gladly available to you

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.039
I'd like to thank you for paying attention

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.599
and hope to be welcome you soon to another new ACMP video.
