00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.280 

little<00:00:38.460> bit<00:00:38.550> more<00:00:38.699> in<00:00:38.850> fact<00:00:41.840> at<00:00:42.840> some<00:00:43.050> point

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
little bit more in fact at some point

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:54.200

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.189 
she's healing the damage I just did to
her<00:00:58.940> but<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.059> gives<00:01:00.239> me<00:01:00.390> time<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.629> run<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
her but that gives me time to run in and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.660 
her but that gives me time to run in and
lay<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.409> satchels<00:01:04.729> feet

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
lay some satchels feet

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.880 
lay some satchels feet
case<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:08.420> did<00:01:08.540> philhealth<00:01:08.869> again<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.320> it's

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
case you did philhealth again and it's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.460 
case you did philhealth again and it's
starting<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.280> throw<00:01:10.790> things<00:01:11.030> at<00:01:11.150> me<00:01:11.180> watching

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.560 

now<00:01:18.470> this<00:01:18.680> is<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.920> much<00:01:19.100> much<00:01:19.490> better<00:01:20.030> strategy

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
now this is a much much better strategy

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.710 
now this is a much much better strategy
a<00:01:20.780> little<00:01:21.320> bit<00:01:21.409> easier<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:22.210> these<00:01:23.210> bubbles<00:01:23.600> are

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
a little bit easier to these bubbles are

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.840 
a little bit easier to these bubbles are
kind<00:01:24.680> of<00:01:24.830> terrible<00:01:27.399> very<00:01:28.399> hard<00:01:28.580> for<00:01:28.700> her<00:01:28.759> to

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
kind of terrible very hard for her to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.490 
kind of terrible very hard for her to
hit<00:01:28.970> something<00:01:29.180> with<00:01:29.299> it<00:01:29.450> how<00:01:30.409> do<00:01:30.470> i<00:01:30.590> click<00:01:31.250> on

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.130 

that<00:01:36.500> didn't<00:01:36.830> work<00:01:38.140> okay<00:01:40.690> I'd<00:01:41.690> say<00:01:41.840> all<00:01:41.990> that

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
that didn't work okay I'd say all that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.309 
that didn't work okay I'd say all that
fails<00:01:42.500> what<00:01:42.920> then<00:01:43.130> what<00:01:43.340> can<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.610> do<00:01:44.530> yeah

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:59.370 
fails what then what can you do yeah
casual<00:01:48.319> dis<00:01:48.590> die

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.880 

great

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.219 

start<00:02:03.760> shooting<00:02:04.000> at<00:02:04.060> these<00:02:04.210> peasant

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.270 

now<00:02:09.229> since<00:02:09.440> she's<00:02:09.560> firing<00:02:09.770> into<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.040> giant

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
now since she's firing into a giant

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.800 
now since she's firing into a giant
groups<00:02:10.610> getting<00:02:10.940> at<00:02:11.030> some<00:02:11.270> of<00:02:11.360> these<00:02:11.450> people

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
but hopefully well typically happens if

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.760 
but hopefully well typically happens if
I<00:02:17.360> start<00:02:17.600> charging<00:02:18.050> her<00:02:18.170> like<00:02:18.350> this<00:02:18.530> she's

could just kill much my own guys Oh see
how<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:32.270> would<00:02:32.390> get<00:02:32.540> annoying<00:02:32.780> because<00:02:32.960> now

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
how this would get annoying because now

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.710

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.820 

since<00:02:51.060> she<00:02:51.180> can<00:02:51.330> fire<00:02:51.660> her<00:02:52.110> bubbles<00:02:52.500> from<00:02:52.650> up

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830

in<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.040> platform<00:02:53.340> caption<00:02:53.970> go<00:02:54.330> far<00:02:54.570> i<00:02:54.600> have<00:02:54.750> a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
in that platform caption go far i have a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.560 
in that platform caption go far i have a
way<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.960> lure<00:02:55.320> her<00:02:55.500> down<00:02:59.060> no<00:03:00.060> see<00:03:00.240> what<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.450> to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570

said

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.560 

so<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:09.170> think<00:03:09.290> it's<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:10.010> can<00:03:10.190> see<00:03:10.400> it's<00:03:11.180> safe<00:03:11.420> to

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
so I think it's you can see it's safe to

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.030 
so I think it's you can see it's safe to
say<00:03:11.600> that<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:12.050> can<00:03:12.200> imagine<00:03:12.380> that<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.740> was

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
say that you can imagine that I was

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.770 
say that you can imagine that I was
really<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.580> terrified<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.450> was<00:03:14.600> going<00:03:14.720> to
