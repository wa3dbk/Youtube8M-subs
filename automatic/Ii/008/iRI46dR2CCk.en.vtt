00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.939 
liked a lot in the shoe and that was
just<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.449> flexibility<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
just this flexibility and the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.770

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
performance feel of it which is not

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.539 
performance feel of it which is not
something<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.320> remember<00:01:04.739> from<00:01:04.979> those<00:01:05.309> versions

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
something I remember from those versions

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.700 
something I remember from those versions
several<00:01:06.270> years<00:01:06.450> back<00:01:06.659> certainly<00:01:07.470> you've<00:01:07.680> got

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
several years back certainly you've got

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
and that remains true but what I really

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780 
and that remains true but what I really
thought<00:01:13.260> was<00:01:13.409> was<00:01:13.890> special<00:01:14.280> about<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.580> shoe

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
thought was was special about this shoe

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.630 
thought was was special about this shoe
was<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.330> how<00:01:15.659> fast<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.259> felt<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:17.070> yet<00:01:17.490> how

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
was just how fast it felt but yet how

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.190 
was just how fast it felt but yet how
comfortable<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.210> was<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.900> an<00:01:19.020> 8<00:01:19.170> or

comfortable it was and I can do an 8 or

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.060 
comfortable it was and I can do an 8 or
10<00:01:19.590> miler

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070
