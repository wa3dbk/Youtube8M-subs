took<00:00:48.530> some<00:00:48.769> time<00:00:48.949> to<00:00:48.980> build<00:00:49.989> you<00:00:50.989> know<00:00:51.019> it

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
took some time to build you know it

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.869 
took some time to build you know it
doesn't<00:00:51.350> necessarily<00:00:51.980> have<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.160> be<00:00:52.250> all<00:00:52.489> legit

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879
