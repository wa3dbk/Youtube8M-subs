 video taken a bit later yes 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.530
 He has some skills for the tanks 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.480
 is important to the sheep 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.780
 beak because with every sharp one 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.780
 beak he acts he causes 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.970
 rather of pierced armor and these 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.020
 pierced armor in turn ensures that 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.270
 that her per piece of the jaw 50 more 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.280

 Make a simple tank change 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.770
 otherwise we will see here just the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.130
 solar wind that is a cone-shaped 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.570
 Brief the boss regularly forward 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.060
 Yes, that works for you, of course 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.469
 just do not stand in front of the bus 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.680
 best you position yourself like that 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:13.119
 bit behind the boss and or 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.979
 side of the boss is also still 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.469
 otherwise you are watching here right now 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.569
 me in the target exhausted phoenix and 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.639
 on the left of me okay that a dead down 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.109
 Sportplatz say that we still have one 

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:25.209
 starched phoenix because there is here 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:28.209
 two species of phoenix on the one hand 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:30.130
 exhausted and then the phoenix hers 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:31.029
 see it in the picture on the right side and ashes 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.149
 leave 

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:36.789
 sitting heaps are for the next 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.009
 phase of interest because raises the same 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.429
 the boss looks up in the air 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.740
 the ability bloodfeeding and yes thereby 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.630
 he releases more or less blood feathers 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.990
 the players on the bottom of the floor 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.229
 fall season so far and yes as soon as 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.209
 a blood feud just touches the ground 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.560
 thus arises the ability fiery fire 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:01.359
 and we ignite or we kindle the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.009
 ash heap again and out of it 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.039
 emerging net and we want that 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.719
 of course, avoid it 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.610
 you just go a little bit from the 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.530
 ash heap away you see this here now 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.890
 he goes up there the acts 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.380
 ability blood feather 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.720
 you can see yes I do not know if you see 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.870
 In any case, you should just 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.230
 Keep away from it and not like us 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.610
 Now here's a bunch of the net because 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.230
 You can really do that 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.340
 You can avoid that one has with us 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.430
 it did not work that way now but me 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.010
 It's a world bus, actually 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.390
 I think I have agro right now 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.130
 from an exhausted phoenix and the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.970
 skin really well so I run 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.410
 always through the tank through yes the tank 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.810
 All of them are good at it too 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.400
 bound and yes this blood-feud 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.739
 phase does not last long so you see the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.360
 as a raid, of course, should try 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.980
 kill the phoenix now 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.630
 the other one actually thinks that 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.080
 task from the boss a bit out to 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.260
 turn but hey ya with 40 countries that 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.910
 that's just a thing 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.930
 otherwise yes the boss has 25 now 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.010
 percent 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.780
 airdrop 665 item level rewards the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.830
 you will also find in the video again 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.690
 description below or yes 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.980
 but below under the video quite clearly there 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.320
 you will find a written part 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.590
 how many millions of points of the hat 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.269
 where the boss is exactly and and 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:31.500
 and of course then also this 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:33.450
 video guide to umag or stuttering and yes 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.390
 All in all, it was like that 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.489
 said keep it from the ashes 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.190
 heap of fern as tank pay attention please 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:45.570
 necessarily on the sharp beak or 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.130
 on the verve and perhaps 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.650
 worth mentioning the boss has one 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.880
 aura the so-called solar radiation 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.130
 He causes it every 15 seconds 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.540
 85,000 damage regularly means that 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.910
 you just have to heal a bit 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.650
 I do not want to say on the fly but 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.360
 you should just do it a bit 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.299
