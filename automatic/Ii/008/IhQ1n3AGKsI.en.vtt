00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.490 
do so because when you're grilling
something<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:38.159> any<00:01:39.060> type<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.390> meat<00:01:39.750> it's

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.960 
something it's any type of meat it's
great<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.189> up<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.400> room<00:01:41.549> temperature

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
great to have it up to room temperature

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.539 
great to have it up to room temperature
before<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:43.380> grill<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.189> too<00:01:44.310> cold

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
before you grill it if it's too cold

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.510 
before you grill it if it's too cold
then<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.149> outside<00:01:45.710> could<00:01:46.710> possibly<00:01:47.100> over

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
then the outside could possibly over

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.550 
then the outside could possibly over
cook<00:01:47.700> quickly<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.780> inside<00:01:49.079> will<00:01:49.290> remain

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
cook quickly and the inside will remain

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.649 
cook quickly and the inside will remain
undercooked<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:50.790> good<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:50.970> keep<00:01:51.270> take

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
undercooked so it's good to keep take

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.810 
undercooked so it's good to keep take
the<00:01:51.780> meat<00:01:51.960> out<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.350> let<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.799> come<00:01:53.579> up<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.790> room
