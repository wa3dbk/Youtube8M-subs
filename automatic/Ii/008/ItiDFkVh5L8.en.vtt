00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.050
 hello with you leader on these forces and 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.990
 today is not an ordinary guest of ours 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.789
 studios 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:10.889
 television 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.879
 it would seem that might be interesting in 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.109
 TV even let it be historical 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.789
 only new samsung technology 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.989
 claims that in her new china india 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.220
 We note not fought days namely Elton 9 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.109
 there are plenty of them on TV 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.990
 in the summer let's try 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.699
 sort out 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.699
 in it 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.170
 what is union 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.730
 trial of us is a new way of forming 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.210
 images like yo or amulet screens 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.450
 mobile devices 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.090
 this does not mean LED 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.520
 image highlighting 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.020
 This means that instead of the backlight 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.880
 matrix using LEDs 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.670
 much more compact 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.200
 consuming less energy and giving 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.410
 smoother LED light stock 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.790
 backlight they started so long ago 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.790
 be applied to the city overshot beeches 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.130
 that it will fit besides everything 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.329
 of the above 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.800
 first significant 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.829
 screen year thickness reduction 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.890
 look at the thin cover from this 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.179
 laptop and now imagine that 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.530
 this one is a huge TV 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.470
 in the thick of the MGU 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.470
 exactly the same as this one laptop 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.950
 branded crystal design with translucent 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.160
 The elements make this TV even more 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.230
 lightweight picture 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.340
 hangs in the air 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.260
 looks 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.450
 very beautiful 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.490
 such a thin TV is much 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.230
 easier to carry 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.280
 I am not god is easier to find a place in the interior 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.570
 not even a very large room 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.750
 even classic wall hang and 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.500
 it will look like a tom 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.870
 exact picture they like 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.320
 TV supports trucks 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.890
 security officers 1080p resolution mode 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.170
 the screen gives a cool juicy image with 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.600
 me peaceful backlit and very 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.740
 large almost one hundred and eighty 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.780
 degree viewing angles 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.750
 high resolution matrix provides 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.369
 very good picture detail 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.740
 and here it is very important that 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.159
 video footage is still appropriate 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.760
 you can not look at this tone zarinsk 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.660
 seen as experienced 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.670
 in the form of TV is not only beautiful but also 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.210
 smart 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.150
 first turn it around and see something 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.419
 it can connect 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.249
 Of course it is easier but the courts are digital codes 4 e 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.729
 May and 2 beaten 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:17.839
 there is an optical sp div for 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.579
 connect home theater 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.400
 Napoleon illegally changed 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.409
 Bodnarenko focus on leaving the gang 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.009
 mention tv 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.439
 all new video computer troopers 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.299
 and connector for 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.179
 local computer network 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:31.729
 the hardest thing is the owner of such 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:33.959
 TV find and wait for contracts so 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.399
 opportunity however 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:37.159
 primarily for head use 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.919
 says mary drives instead of the player you can 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.019
 use prefix sony playstation 3 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.899
 she too can produce a fool and 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:44.819
 although not everyone knows about it 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.849
 besides she can play pestel 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.639
 this amount to a new level of chances 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.809
 realism, etc. 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.379
 you can write yourself and reading 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.439
 affairs with the help of such a camcorder 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.959
 then the video from your release will be 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.279
 unusually bright details remain 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:59.549
 only master the art of the operator 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.419
 most likely you will have it 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.539
 on the computer 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:05.690
 remember how 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.249
 it was convenient to connect 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.460
 computer TV analogs filed 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.609
 now everything is much easier to watch 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.419
 cube one cable 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.929
 one connector 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:17.729
 we connect 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:19.819
 we get the picture on the TV and 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.030
 mini video output 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.670
 sound and you're on a suburban cable 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.839
 A film for children 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:26.659
 and we can watch them 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.969
 it's not all tv streets 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:30.389
 play media congresses 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.349
 drives it can be like flash 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.869
 the cataclysm went hard drive 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.239
 insert select on the remote media player 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.259
 choose the contacts which these inserts 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.119
 play and go ahead 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.179
 there you can connect all day storages and 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:44.839
 forget about the risks at all 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:46.579
 TV letters in a village company 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:47.959
 formats playing dv video 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.749
 x and xvid anything including file 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:51.439
 on simply or matryoshka which as 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.860
 time 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.670
 most convenient to encode in the video 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.610
 high resolution performance 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.290
 video processor is very high if 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.960
 normal computer when decoding steps 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.780
 video and transfer it through network dima 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.090
 stumble who hears about the movie goes 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.289
 absolutely smooth 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:06.129
 the only thing you should not forget is 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.619
 data volumes of the background wait they are very great 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:10.359
 and for a couple of threes films for sure 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.919
 will need it was 64 gigabyte monster 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.719
 TVs and both 190 know 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.549
 the biggest problem is tagilstroy 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.099
 the rush is that they can't 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.489
 resist can come out some kind of a moody 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.659
 the format of which the TV is not 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.199
 it is provided that in that case remains 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.090
 hope for flashing feature 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.660
 you can upgrade your TV 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.850
 some new fleet 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.850
 functionality 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.180
 modern in Sydney sorry l and day 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.000
 TV as we see it is much more 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.309
 than just tv 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:44.039
 already worth taking for granted and 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.400
 small thickness 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.270
 such a gorgeous picture 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.129
 It is worth staying on the fact that there is this 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:52.620
 TV does not need 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.310
 external player he himself is a player for 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.620
 all that fails he is very 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.350
 familiar with computers if 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.010
 speak the same language with them 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.010
 he himself is to some extent a computer 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.400
 I personally caught fire 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.800
 Act
