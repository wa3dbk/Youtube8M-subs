00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and I've been really happy with it I

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.949 
and I've been really happy with it I
think<00:02:10.259> up<00:02:10.470> until<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.979> point<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.569> hadn't<00:02:12.569> even

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
think up until this point I hadn't even

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.199 
think up until this point I hadn't even
heard<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.250> I'd<00:02:14.519> been<00:02:14.730> using<00:02:14.970> other

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
heard of this and I'd been using other

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.110 
heard of this and I'd been using other
powders<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.810> I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
powders that I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.300 
powders that I
well<00:02:16.239> weren't<00:02:16.780> really<00:02:17.170> doing<00:02:17.620> what<00:02:17.799> I<00:02:17.830> wanted

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
well weren't really doing what I wanted

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.270 
well weren't really doing what I wanted
and<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:19.690> guess<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.349> just<00:02:20.379> took<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.890> MacPro

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
and I guess it just took a MacPro

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.940 
and I guess it just took a MacPro
product<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.330> finally<00:02:23.080> get<00:02:23.349> me<00:02:23.500> what<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.680> needed
