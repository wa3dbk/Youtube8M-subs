00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
I'm on track I want that open so I

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.230 
I'm on track I want that open so I
pulled<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.400> out<00:02:46.460> so<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.820> could<00:02:46.940> be<00:02:46.970> even<00:02:47.120> a

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
pulled that out so it could be even a

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.780 
pulled that out so it could be even a
little<00:02:47.510> bit<00:02:47.630> quieter<00:02:48.050> than<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.710> was<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.640> way

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
little bit quieter than it was the way

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.550 
little bit quieter than it was the way
that<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.150> chose<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:51.410> use<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:52.100> helmet<00:02:53.260> is<00:02:54.260> it

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
that I chose to use the helmet is it

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.060 
that I chose to use the helmet is it
worth<00:02:54.800> three<00:02:55.790> hundred<00:02:55.820> eighty<00:02:56.210> nine<00:02:56.300> dollars

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
worth three hundred eighty nine dollars

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.430 
worth three hundred eighty nine dollars
honestly<00:02:58.540> it's<00:02:59.540> probably<00:02:59.720> worth<00:03:00.020> more<00:03:00.260> than

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
honestly it's probably worth more than

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.170 
honestly it's probably worth more than
that<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:00.860> mean<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:01.100> really<00:03:01.640> felt<00:03:01.850> that<00:03:02.000> this

that's really impressive

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.830 
that's really impressive

performing high quality helmets that are

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.130 
performing high quality helmets that are
at<00:03:30.140> price<00:03:30.440> point<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:31.370> competition<00:03:32.140> aren't

at price point the competition aren't

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.290 
at price point the competition aren't
able<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.380> do<00:03:33.590> they<00:03:34.340> operate<00:03:34.610> here<00:03:35.120> in<00:03:35.150> the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
able to do they operate here in the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.320 
able to do they operate here in the
States<00:03:35.570> now<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:36.080> it<00:03:36.590> goes<00:03:36.830> basically

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
States now it's it goes basically

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.660 
States now it's it goes basically
essentially<00:03:38.330> it's<00:03:38.510> manufacturer<00:03:39.670> to

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
essentially it's manufacturer to

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.670 
essentially it's manufacturer to
retailer<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:41.990> you're<00:03:42.110> kind<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.290> cutting<00:03:42.590> out

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
retailer so you're kind of cutting out

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.520 
retailer so you're kind of cutting out
the<00:03:42.830> middle<00:03:43.070> there<00:03:43.250> that<00:03:43.910> allows<00:03:44.209> for<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.990> less

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
the middle there that allows for a less

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.430 
the middle there that allows for a less
expensive<00:03:45.890> product<00:03:46.459> to<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.640> consumer<00:03:46.730> so

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
expensive product to the consumer so

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.870 
expensive product to the consumer so
you're<00:03:48.440> gonna<00:03:48.530> get<00:03:48.680> less<00:03:50.110> price<00:03:51.400> more<00:03:52.400> value

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
you're gonna get less price more value

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.790 
you're gonna get less price more value
and<00:03:53.060> that<00:03:53.420> I<00:03:53.660> think<00:03:53.930> it's<00:03:54.170> really<00:03:54.440> important

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
and that I think it's really important

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.080 
and that I think it's really important
we<00:03:54.890> work<00:03:54.980> harder<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:55.550> make<00:03:55.700> sure<00:03:55.820> that<00:03:55.940> we're

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
we work harder to make sure that we're

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.270 
we work harder to make sure that we're
bringing<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:56.390> all<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:57.260> best<00:03:57.530> values<00:03:57.980> that<00:03:58.160> we

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
bringing you all the best values that we
