all<00:00:06.620> right<00:00:06.740> this<00:00:06.890> is<00:00:07.040> the<00:00:07.069> CID<00:00:07.430> one<00:00:07.760> display

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
all right this is the CID one display

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.669 
all right this is the CID one display
that's<00:00:08.420> been<00:00:08.540> taken<00:00:08.870> apart<00:00:08.960> and<00:00:10.150> this<00:00:11.150> is<00:00:11.679> the

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
that's been taken apart and this is the

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.570 
that's been taken apart and this is the
ribbon<00:00:13.990> that<00:00:14.990> was<00:00:15.139> taken<00:00:15.499> off<00:00:15.620> of<00:00:15.650> it<00:00:15.889> the

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
ribbon that was taken off of it the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.910 
ribbon that was taken off of it the
shorter<00:00:17.000> side<00:00:17.210> attaches<00:00:17.840> to<00:00:18.470> this<00:00:18.590> printed

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920

shorter side attaches to this printed
circuit<00:00:19.220> board<00:00:19.430> here<00:00:19.789> and<00:00:20.480> if<00:00:20.689> you<00:00:20.810> can<00:00:20.930> see<00:00:21.170> it

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
circuit board here and if you can see it

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.300 
circuit board here and if you can see it
cleaned<00:00:21.769> the<00:00:21.949> contacts<00:00:22.609> I<00:00:24.189> don't<00:00:25.189> know<00:00:25.250> if

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
cleaned the contacts I don't know if

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.349 
cleaned the contacts I don't know if
it's<00:00:25.400> gonna<00:00:25.519> focus<00:00:25.759> on<00:00:26.029> there<00:00:26.150> but<00:00:26.269> I've

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
it's gonna focus on there but I've

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.640 
it's gonna focus on there but I've
cleaned<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:26.630> context<00:00:27.140> as<00:00:27.230> well<00:00:27.439> as<00:00:27.590> I

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
cleaned the context as well as I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.450 
cleaned the context as well as I
possibly<00:00:28.039> can<00:00:29.289> but<00:00:30.289> I<00:00:30.320> gotta<00:00:30.589> focus<00:00:30.800> on<00:00:31.160> this

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.970 

I've<00:00:34.460> got<00:00:34.670> I've<00:00:35.420> got<00:00:35.600> another<00:00:35.810> friend<00:00:36.140> circuit

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
I've got I've got another friend circuit

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.160 
I've got I've got another friend circuit
board<00:00:37.220> that<00:00:37.280> I<00:00:37.430> haven't<00:00:37.820> cleaned<00:00:38.360> I<00:00:41.170> don't

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
board that I haven't cleaned I don't

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.820 
board that I haven't cleaned I don't
know<00:00:42.230> if<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:42.410> could<00:00:42.530> tell<00:00:42.650> the<00:00:42.710> difference

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
know if you could tell the difference

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.910 
know if you could tell the difference
this<00:00:43.400> still<00:00:43.970> has<00:00:44.150> some<00:00:44.330> of<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.680> that<00:00:45.680> ribbon

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
this still has some of the that ribbon

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.450 
this still has some of the that ribbon
cable<00:00:46.040> attached<00:00:46.700> and<00:00:47.390> so<00:00:48.320> this<00:00:48.830> one<00:00:49.010> has<00:00:49.250> been

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
cable attached and so this one has been

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.820 
cable attached and so this one has been
cleaned<00:00:49.790> and<00:00:50.060> so<00:00:50.240> I've<00:00:50.780> taken<00:00:51.020> off<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:51.410> old

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
cleaned and so I've taken off the old

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.670 
cleaned and so I've taken off the old
one<00:00:52.220> and<00:00:52.430> then<00:00:53.060> the<00:00:53.210> new<00:00:53.450> one<00:00:53.480> from<00:00:54.110> pixel<00:00:54.440> fix

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
one and then the new one from pixel fix

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.030 
one and then the new one from pixel fix
comm<00:00:55.150> looks<00:00:56.150> something<00:00:56.360> like<00:00:56.480> this<00:00:56.990> and<00:00:57.230> it

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
comm looks something like this and it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.230 
comm looks something like this and it
comes<00:00:58.280> with<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.880> new<00:01:00.430> ribbon<00:01:01.430> cable<00:01:02.030> and

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
comes with the new ribbon cable and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.770 
comes with the new ribbon cable and
these<00:01:02.780> two<00:01:03.050> pieces<00:01:03.290> are<00:01:03.740> are<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.430> foam<00:01:04.939> that

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
these two pieces are are a foam that

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.719 
these two pieces are are a foam that
that's<00:01:06.080> just<00:01:06.259> a<00:01:06.380> sticky<00:01:06.740> back<00:01:06.920> foam<00:01:07.340> piece

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
that's just a sticky back foam piece

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.020 
that's just a sticky back foam piece
that<00:01:07.939> you<00:01:08.030> place<00:01:08.240> on<00:01:08.420> top<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:09.350> that<00:01:09.789> the<00:01:10.789> rubber

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
that you place on top so that the rubber

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.740 
that you place on top so that the rubber
bands<00:01:11.570> in<00:01:11.869> here<00:01:12.409> this<00:01:12.590> black<00:01:12.859> one<00:01:13.070> here<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.750> it

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
bands in here this black one here and it

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.109 
bands in here this black one here and it
wraps<00:01:14.929> around<00:01:15.049> on<00:01:15.259> the<00:01:15.350> front<00:01:15.640> will<00:01:16.640> will

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
wraps around on the front will will

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.319 
wraps around on the front will will
apply<00:01:17.390> more<00:01:17.630> pressure<00:01:17.899> on<00:01:18.259> those<00:01:18.740> contacts

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
apply more pressure on those contacts

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.730 
apply more pressure on those contacts
okay<00:01:20.329> and<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.079> basically<00:01:21.439> what<00:01:21.649> you

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
okay and so this is basically what you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.840 
okay and so this is basically what you
have<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:22.009> have<00:01:22.130> these<00:01:22.219> different<00:01:22.429> three

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
have you have these different three

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.919 
have you have these different three
different<00:01:23.090> pieces<00:01:23.240> once<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.749> take

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
different pieces once you take

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:24.760 
different pieces once you take
everything<00:01:24.229> apart

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
everything apart

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.469 
everything apart
you<00:01:25.189> have<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.460> printed<00:01:25.820> circuit<00:01:25.969> board<00:01:26.149> the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
you have the printed circuit board the

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.529 
you have the printed circuit board the
LCD<00:01:26.869> screen<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.789> piece<00:01:28.999> that<00:01:29.240> the

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
LCD screen and the the piece that the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.480 
LCD screen and the the piece that the
bit<00:01:29.689> that<00:01:29.810> holds<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.229> LCD<00:01:30.590> screen<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.460> has

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
bit that holds the LCD screen and it has

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.239 
bit that holds the LCD screen and it has
the<00:01:31.819> lights<00:01:32.090> that<00:01:32.719> would<00:01:32.840> backlight<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.530> for

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.249 
the lights that would backlight it for

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:37.149 
the lights that would backlight it for
the<00:01:34.340> display<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:36.200> now<00:01:36.380> what<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.710> trick<00:01:36.950> is

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
the display and so now what the trick is

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.830 
the display and so now what the trick is
to<00:01:37.520> do<00:01:38.240> is<00:01:38.719> to<00:01:39.549> take<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:40.759> ribbon<00:01:40.909> cable<00:01:41.420> here

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
to do is to take the ribbon cable here

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.319 
to do is to take the ribbon cable here
remove<00:01:42.259> it<00:01:42.350> from<00:01:42.409> its<00:01:42.530> package<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.219> fix<00:01:43.789> it<00:01:44.030> just

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
remove it from its package a fix it just

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.190 
remove it from its package a fix it just
with<00:01:44.539> tape<00:01:44.810> actually<00:01:45.289> first<00:01:45.679> to<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:47.200> LCD

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
with tape actually first to the LCD

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.450 
with tape actually first to the LCD
screens<00:01:48.619> back<00:01:49.549> here<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.210> then<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.799> the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
screens back here and then to the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.950 
screens back here and then to the
printed<00:01:52.759> circuit<00:01:52.909> board<00:01:53.090> well<00:01:53.539> then<00:01:53.810> you

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
printed circuit board well then you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.279 
printed circuit board well then you
install<00:01:54.679> it<00:01:54.859> into<00:01:55.009> this<00:01:55.219> piece<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:55.759> then<00:01:56.299> fix

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
install it into this piece and then fix

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.709 
install it into this piece and then fix
that<00:01:57.499> the<00:01:57.710> tricky<00:01:58.009> strings<00:01:58.219> to<00:01:58.340> see<00:01:58.670> in<00:01:59.030> the

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
that the tricky strings to see in the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.679 
that the tricky strings to see in the
light<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.170> might<00:02:00.350> be<00:02:00.530> able<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.709> see<00:02:00.950> them<00:02:01.249> but

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
light you might be able to see them but

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.949 
light you might be able to see them but
is<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.840> contacts<00:02:03.499> on<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.009> LCD<00:02:04.310> itself<00:02:05.149> here

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
is the contacts on the LCD itself here

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.800 
is the contacts on the LCD itself here
they're<00:02:06.170> very<00:02:06.469> visible<00:02:06.649> in<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.369> gold<00:02:07.810> and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
they're very visible in the gold and

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.920 
they're very visible in the gold and
it's<00:02:09.229> pretty<00:02:09.440> simple<00:02:09.770> line<00:02:10.100> up<00:02:10.280> but<00:02:10.760> here<00:02:11.330> you

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
it's pretty simple line up but here you

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.890 
it's pretty simple line up but here you
have<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.260> really<00:02:12.620> search<00:02:13.130> for<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.490> contacts

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
have to really search for the contacts

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.330 
have to really search for the contacts
just<00:02:15.900> with<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.170> right<00:02:16.380> lighting<00:02:16.740> but<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.190> can

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
just with the right lighting but you can

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.190 
just with the right lighting but you can
see<00:02:17.520> them<00:02:17.700> as<00:02:17.850> we<00:02:18.390> want<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.660> line<00:02:18.780> I've<00:02:18.960> got<00:02:19.110> to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
see them as we want to line I've got to

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.350 
see them as we want to line I've got to
make<00:02:19.320> sure<00:02:19.620> one<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.160> weird<00:02:20.460> things<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:21.000> I'm

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
make sure one of the weird things is I'm

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.080 
make sure one of the weird things is I'm
having<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.200> little<00:02:22.380> issue<00:02:23.040> with<00:02:23.280> just

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
having this little issue with just

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.160 
having this little issue with just
determining<00:02:24.840> which<00:02:24.960> one's<00:02:26.420> Sid<00:02:27.420> one<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.960> Sid

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
this is the Sid two ribbon cable that

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.980 
this is the Sid two ribbon cable that
was<00:02:37.650> sent<00:02:37.920> as<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> replacement<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.690> you

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
was sent as a replacement and and you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.750 
was sent as a replacement and and you
know<00:02:40.080> when<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.320> compare<00:02:40.710> them<00:02:40.950> they're

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
know when you compare them they're

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.200 
know when you compare them they're
identical<00:02:42.330> with<00:02:42.990> with<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.500> little<00:02:44.210> lines

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
identical with with the little lines

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.990 
identical with with the little lines
okay<00:02:46.080> on<00:02:46.320> this<00:02:46.740> side<00:02:47.130> however<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.640> have<00:02:47.790> some

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
okay on this side however I have some

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.360 
okay on this side however I have some
SID<00:02:48.210> one<00:02:48.450> pieces<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.040> little<00:02:50.250> bit

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
SID one pieces and it's a little bit

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.730 
SID one pieces and it's a little bit
different<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:50.910> that's<00:02:51.450> identical<00:02:52.320> with<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
different and that's identical with the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.070 
different and that's identical with the
SID<00:02:53.070> one<00:02:53.760> cable<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.540> originally

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
SID one cable that I originally

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.070 
SID one cable that I originally
purchased<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:55.830> if<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.700> look<00:02:56.850> at<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.030> case<00:02:57.270> it

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
purchased but if I look at the case it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.920 
purchased but if I look at the case it
says<00:02:58.290> Sid<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.620> again<00:02:59.300> so<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:01.110> don't<00:03:01.950> know<00:03:02.100> but

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
says Sid to again so I don't know but

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.420 
says Sid to again so I don't know but
I'll<00:03:03.930> only<00:03:04.080> I'll<00:03:04.410> put<00:03:04.590> some<00:03:04.740> pictures<00:03:04.890> up<00:03:05.070> of

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
I'll only I'll put some pictures up of

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.000 
I'll only I'll put some pictures up of
the<00:03:05.580> different<00:03:06.060> Sid<00:03:06.450> Sid<00:03:07.260> -<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.940> Sid<00:03:08.940> one<00:03:09.300> and

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
the different Sid Sid - and Sid one and

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.740 
the different Sid Sid - and Sid one and
and<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.190> can<00:03:11.340> open<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.700> up<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.000> make<00:03:12.390> sure<00:03:12.420> to

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
and you can open it up and make sure to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.980 
and you can open it up and make sure to
compare<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.470> I'm<00:03:13.530> gonna<00:03:13.620> go<00:03:13.740> ahead<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:13.920> fix

compare so I'm gonna go ahead and fix

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.490 
compare so I'm gonna go ahead and fix
this<00:03:15.990> which<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.100> Sid<00:03:17.850> two<00:03:18.060> cable<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.260> SID

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
this which is a Sid two cable to the SID

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.780 
this which is a Sid two cable to the SID
-<00:03:19.710> LCD<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.850> put<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.090> all<00:03:21.270> together<00:03:22.700> all<00:03:23.700> right

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
- LCD and put it all together all right

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.950 
- LCD and put it all together all right
the<00:03:23.940> next<00:03:24.120> thing<00:03:24.300> that<00:03:24.540> I've<00:03:24.630> done<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.930> just

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
the next thing that I've done is just

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.150 
the next thing that I've done is just
taken<00:03:25.200> out<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.880> LCD<00:03:26.880> ribbon<00:03:27.030> cable<00:03:27.510> and

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
taken out the LCD ribbon cable and

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.880 
taken out the LCD ribbon cable and
you'll<00:03:29.160> notice<00:03:29.460> right<00:03:29.550> away<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.150> has<00:03:30.330> a

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
you'll notice right away that it has a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.320 
you'll notice right away that it has a
has<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.920> hard<00:03:32.840> backing<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.020> it<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:35.520> so<00:03:36.150> what<00:03:36.300> I

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
has a hard backing to it and so what I

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.240 
has a hard backing to it and so what I
did<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.750> got<00:03:37.020> some<00:03:37.230> pieces<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.620> tape<00:03:37.800> they

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
did is I got some pieces of tape they

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.730 
did is I got some pieces of tape they
were<00:03:38.310> just<00:03:38.520> on<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:40.080> hard<00:03:40.320> backing

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
were just on that and that hard backing

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.110 
were just on that and that hard backing
just<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.070> get<00:03:41.190> some<00:03:41.310> size<00:03:43.220> some<00:03:44.220> stick<00:03:44.460> all<00:03:44.970> it

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
just to get some size some stick all it

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.180 
just to get some size some stick all it
really<00:03:45.240> holds<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.020> sticky<00:03:46.320> tape<00:03:46.500> and

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
really holds in is the sticky tape and

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.920 
really holds in is the sticky tape and
that<00:03:47.310> holds<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:47.640> together<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:49.050> I<00:03:49.350> remove

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
that holds it together and so I remove

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.410 
that holds it together and so I remove
the<00:03:51.930> ribbon<00:03:52.140> cable<00:03:54.560> from<00:03:55.560> this<00:03:56.300> hard<00:03:57.300> plastic

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
the ribbon cable from this hard plastic

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.640 
the ribbon cable from this hard plastic
backing<00:03:59.270> and<00:04:00.270> there's<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:01.260> piece<00:04:01.470> that

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
backing and there's the the piece that

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.500 
backing and there's the the piece that
just<00:04:01.710> keeps<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.700> together<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.210> that<00:04:03.360> can<00:04:03.480> be

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
just keeps it together so that can be

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.270 
just keeps it together so that can be
discarded<00:04:03.870> but<00:04:04.560> now<00:04:04.680> here's<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.040> ribbon

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
discarded but now here's the ribbon

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.240 
discarded but now here's the ribbon
cable<00:04:05.580> this<00:04:05.640> is<00:04:05.700> actually<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.150> back<00:04:06.270> side<00:04:06.600> the

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
cable this is actually the back side the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.000 
cable this is actually the back side the
side<00:04:08.250> with<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.790> little<00:04:08.940> black<00:04:10.010> contact

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
side with the little black contact

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.680 
side with the little black contact
points<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.490> this<00:04:11.880> is<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.270> side<00:04:12.480> that's

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
points that this is the side that's

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.400 
points that this is the side that's
meant<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.290> make<00:04:13.530> contact<00:04:14.040> with<00:04:14.550> both<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:15.410> LCD

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
meant to make contact with both the LCD

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.039 
meant to make contact with both the LCD
screen<00:04:16.530> itself<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:18.239> printed<00:04:18.900> circuit

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
screen itself and the printed circuit

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.229 
screen itself and the printed circuit
board<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:20.070> this<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.549> how<00:04:20.700> this<00:04:20.910> is<00:04:20.970> going

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
board and so this is how this is going

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.730 
board and so this is how this is going
to<00:04:21.390> adhere<00:04:21.510> on<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.140> what<00:04:22.230> I'll<00:04:22.320> do<00:04:22.470> is<00:04:22.500> I'll

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
to adhere on and what I'll do is I'll

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.390 
to adhere on and what I'll do is I'll
take<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.700> tape<00:04:24.000> that<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.270> have<00:04:24.630> cut<00:04:25.400> I'll

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
take that that tape that I have cut I'll

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:36.820 
take that that tape that I have cut I'll
put<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.790> on<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.270> back

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.189 

and<00:04:37.639> basically<00:04:37.849> you'd<00:04:38.360> think<00:04:38.599> you<00:04:38.840> know<00:04:38.960> glue

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
and basically you'd think you know glue

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.379 
and basically you'd think you know glue
would<00:04:39.319> be<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.530> best<00:04:39.710> thing<00:04:39.949> but<00:04:39.979> I<00:04:40.460> think<00:04:41.210> what

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
would be the best thing but I think what

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.700 
would be the best thing but I think what
this<00:04:41.569> is<00:04:41.629> what<00:04:41.870> they've<00:04:42.020> told<00:04:42.229> you<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:42.590> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
this is what they've told you in the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.550 
this is what they've told you in the
book<00:04:42.949> and<00:04:43.430> they're<00:04:43.639> in<00:04:43.759> their<00:04:43.879> little

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
book and they're in their little

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.659 
book and they're in their little
instructions<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:46.039> I<00:04:46.099> think<00:04:46.310> this<00:04:46.430> is<00:04:46.550> going

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
instructions and I think this is going

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.700 
instructions and I think this is going
to<00:04:46.759> be<00:04:46.849> best<00:04:47.120> with<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.389> tape<00:04:47.599> because<00:04:47.990> it's

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
to be best with the tape because it's

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.200 
to be best with the tape because it's
not<00:04:48.979> going<00:04:49.159> you<00:04:49.340> know<00:04:49.460> if<00:04:49.759> you<00:04:49.940> need<00:04:50.090> to

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
not going you know if you need to

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.510 
not going you know if you need to
reposition<00:04:50.449> it<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:51.169> won't<00:04:51.349> be<00:04:51.470> impossible<00:04:51.560> and

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
reposition it it won't be impossible and

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.809 
reposition it it won't be impossible and
so<00:04:52.580> then<00:04:52.879> just<00:04:53.659> look<00:04:54.020> just<00:04:54.050> eyeballing<00:04:54.889> I<00:04:55.310> have

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
so then just look just eyeballing I have

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.580 
so then just look just eyeballing I have
a<00:04:55.849> good<00:04:56.180> visual<00:04:56.690> with<00:04:56.870> it<00:04:57.020> with<00:04:57.169> it<00:04:57.199> with<00:04:57.319> this

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
a good visual with it with it with this

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.260 
a good visual with it with it with this
white<00:04:57.740> background<00:04:58.539> of<00:04:59.539> the<00:05:00.940> contacts<00:05:01.940> here

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
white background of the contacts here

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:12.399 
white background of the contacts here
and<00:05:02.479> so<00:05:02.930> I'm<00:05:03.199> going<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:06.190> line<00:05:07.190> them<00:05:07.430> up<00:05:11.409> make

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
and so I'm going to line them up make

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:18.129 
and so I'm going to line them up make
sure<00:05:12.440> it's<00:05:13.870> straight<00:05:16.780> I'm<00:05:17.780> gonna<00:05:17.930> take<00:05:18.110> a

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
sure it's straight I'm gonna take a

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:27.090 
sure it's straight I'm gonna take a
couple<00:05:18.440> goes<00:05:18.740> at<00:05:19.009> it

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.530 

and<00:05:28.100> I'm<00:05:28.190> allowing<00:05:28.460> it<00:05:28.670> to<00:05:28.730> overlap<00:05:29.180> on<00:05:29.330> here

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
and I'm allowing it to overlap on here

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.120 
and I'm allowing it to overlap on here
because<00:05:29.690> it's<00:05:29.840> clear<00:05:30.080> tape<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:30.530> all<00:05:30.620> the<00:05:30.890> only

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
because it's clear tape and all the only

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.350 
because it's clear tape and all the only
thing<00:05:31.280> that's<00:05:31.460> back<00:05:31.640> here<00:05:31.880> is<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.120> lights

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
thing that's back here is the lights

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.700 
thing that's back here is the lights
that<00:05:32.960> shine<00:05:33.230> through<00:05:33.820> so<00:05:35.320> if<00:05:36.320> you<00:05:36.410> peel<00:05:36.680> back

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
that shine through so if you peel back

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.900 
that shine through so if you peel back
here<00:05:37.690> you'll<00:05:38.690> be<00:05:38.810> able<00:05:38.900> to<00:05:39.080> see<00:05:39.640> if<00:05:40.640> you've

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
here you'll be able to see if you've

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.610 
here you'll be able to see if you've
lined<00:05:41.210> it<00:05:41.390> up<00:05:41.480> correctly<00:05:42.020> and<00:05:42.110> it<00:05:42.290> looks<00:05:42.470> as

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
lined it up correctly and it looks as

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.260 
lined it up correctly and it looks as
though<00:05:42.650> I<00:05:42.800> got<00:05:43.100> it<00:05:44.410> right<00:05:45.410> on<00:05:45.520> right<00:05:46.520> perfectly

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
though I got it right on right perfectly

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.060 
though I got it right on right perfectly
maybe<00:05:47.810> if<00:05:47.930> I've<00:05:48.050> started<00:05:48.410> over<00:05:48.710> here<00:05:48.740> and<00:05:49.040> I

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
maybe if I've started over here and I

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.680 
maybe if I've started over here and I
can<00:05:49.100> check<00:05:49.430> this<00:05:49.610> that<00:05:49.790> as<00:05:49.940> well<00:05:50.120> yeah<00:05:50.540> it

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
can check this that as well yeah it

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.360 
can check this that as well yeah it
looks<00:05:50.930> perfect<00:05:51.290> looks<00:05:51.500> like<00:05:51.650> boom<00:05:51.800> those

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
looks perfect looks like boom those

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.210 
looks perfect looks like boom those
points<00:05:52.850> when<00:05:53.330> contact<00:05:53.930> is<00:05:54.050> made<00:05:54.320> across<00:05:54.800> this

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
points when contact is made across this

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.180 
points when contact is made across this
this<00:05:55.790> line<00:05:56.090> right<00:05:56.300> here

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
this line right here

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.670 
this line right here
those<00:05:58.190> those<00:05:58.940> points<00:05:59.330> are<00:05:59.450> going<00:05:59.570> to<00:05:59.840> to<00:06:00.440> apply

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
those those points are going to to apply

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.230 
those those points are going to to apply
pressure<00:06:00.890> and<00:06:01.220> give<00:06:01.610> you<00:06:01.700> a<00:06:01.760> good<00:06:01.910> signal

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
pressure and give you a good signal

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.130 
pressure and give you a good signal
there<00:06:02.390> okay<00:06:03.110> so<00:06:03.650> now<00:06:03.890> that<00:06:03.920> I<00:06:04.190> have<00:06:04.430> that<00:06:04.730> done

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
there okay so now that I have that done

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
there okay so now that I have that done
they<00:06:06.140> do<00:06:06.200> have<00:06:06.620> these<00:06:07.520> pieces<00:06:08.150> of<00:06:08.800> foam<00:06:09.800> and

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
they do have these pieces of foam and

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.140 
they do have these pieces of foam and
these<00:06:10.850> are<00:06:11.060> applied<00:06:11.510> over<00:06:12.050> the<00:06:12.080> top<00:06:12.470> of<00:06:12.860> that

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
these are applied over the top of that

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.760 
these are applied over the top of that
contact<00:06:14.150> point<00:06:14.360> so<00:06:14.660> that<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:15.050> the<00:06:15.500> rubber

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
contact point so that the the rubber

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.370 
contact point so that the the rubber
Cable<00:06:16.580> will<00:06:16.610> apply<00:06:16.970> more<00:06:17.300> pressure<00:06:17.570> right

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
Cable will apply more pressure right

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.170 
Cable will apply more pressure right
there<00:06:18.410> and<00:06:18.770> so<00:06:18.890> I'll<00:06:18.980> go<00:06:19.070> ahead<00:06:19.100> and<00:06:19.370> apply

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
there and so I'll go ahead and apply

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.780 
there and so I'll go ahead and apply
that<00:06:20.300> now<00:06:21.400> and<00:06:22.400> say<00:06:22.580> just<00:06:22.820> simply<00:06:23.270> remove<00:06:23.870> the

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
that now and say just simply remove the

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:35.480 
that now and say just simply remove the
backing<00:06:25.790> and<00:06:27.790> then<00:06:30.400> seek<00:06:31.400> to<00:06:31.430> line<00:06:31.790> it<00:06:31.820> up

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.500 

right<00:06:36.490> over<00:06:36.640> the<00:06:36.850> point<00:06:37.120> where<00:06:37.330> it<00:06:37.420> would

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
right over the point where it would

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:47.830 
right over the point where it would
contact<00:06:39.630> yes

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:07:55.580
