00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 thirteen fights two stories to but 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.500
 they did not save 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.240
 it's bad 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.649
 young champion of the union 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.840
 European at 24 years old ahmed el moussaoui 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.920
 embodies the success of boxing 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.290
 French professional 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.329
 after a brilliant amateur career 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.620
 the boxer of levallois did not delay to 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.159
 to stand out among the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.159
 professional 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:15.270
 I get my now 23 fights do not 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:17.190
 are in France 2013 but if the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.750
 ring results are there the cameras 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.490
 they are much less 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.020
 Boxing is a sport today 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.789
 mediated in which the sponsors 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.160
 and televisions invest it 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.869
 almost more modeling contract 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.550
 advertising boxers today 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.780
 do as they can to do the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.420
 promoting their sport 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.470
 everyone tries to get re- mediatised as 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.760
 of the little 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.790
 they have that each its benefits too 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.640
 well then and then genetically that 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.170
 physically just that 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.760
 does he miss this sport to attract the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.620
 looks foul of champions 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.240
 charismatic and beautiful posters 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.280
 channel + left the ring to my channel 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.750
 sport that tries to revive the 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.820
 flame despite small means 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.380
 faced with internal problems of 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.420
 boxing structure and rivalries 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.400
 professional French tramples 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.320
 yet the number of licensees increases 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.540
 every year twenty-four thousand eight 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.660
 cents in 1997 for 37 thousand 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.660
 today 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.300
 but everyone is interested in boxing 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.460
 it's a sport that has always been 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.820
 fashion it's a noble sport and now 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.460
 I do not know of the only one who knows how things are 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.320
 to happen but I trust me I 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.580
 think it'll come back someday a day 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.070
 or the other I think it takes a head 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.690
 of poster simply that he will us 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.790
 what will make the difference 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.500
 to the question of whether ahmed el 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.180
 moussaoui maybe this head of posted 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.130
 the young boxer does not hide his 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.660
 ambitions 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:49.240
 we manage for it hurts 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.460
 some reports its featuring that makes 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.850
 badly it hurts go there given the cases where 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.430
 it hurts in worse scenery the jo it's done 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.530
 no call ahmed el moussaoui swing that 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.290
 hurts it hurts fast boxing 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.050
 featuring it hurts ap vadim to help 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.460
 social where it hurts it does it there is 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.560
 not enough competition in France at 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.660
 level of sports TV channel 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.500
 so when we go up plateaus 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.690
 boxing level galas 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.940
 of one it does not interest any chain there in 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.620
 has very few wines so there is no 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.550
 competition 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.130
 the trays will be lowered 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.710
 since to make profitable a plateau the 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.920
 the ticketing is not enough it is necessary that 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.620
 this is mediatized is good 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.840
 so we live on grants from 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.060
 local authorities 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.640
 such sponsorship small sponsorship so 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.459
 it's too weak we're going to organize two 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.510
 big fight in France what is missing 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.080
 it's visibility 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.370
 it's visibility and yaya 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.849
 potentiality in France but there is no 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.150
 visibility 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.830
 so if we are champion but that 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.590
 nobody sees you do not attract the eye 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:01.120
 it does not attract sponsors is not live 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.310
 of his passion and we vegetate while waiting 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.049
 the cameras back on the ring ahmed 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.340
 el moussaoui will put him at stake 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.680
 champion of the european union 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.750
 next September for 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:20.709
 why not after galy a big 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:22.840
 european price championship ording 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.790
 it hurts it hurts to remember that 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.250
 his audience it hurts it redone my 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.070
 neighbor and the cases where it hurts 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.250
 jo amputated when it hurts 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.250
 made
