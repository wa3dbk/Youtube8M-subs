know<00:05:28.180> what<00:05:28.330> Morales<00:05:28.719> is<00:05:29.069> defensive<00:05:30.069> workrate

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
know what Morales is defensive workrate

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.329 
know what Morales is defensive workrate
is<00:05:30.759> as<00:05:31.029> you<00:05:31.689> can<00:05:31.719> see<00:05:31.839> exactly<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.860> same<00:05:33.039> again

00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:33.339 
is as you can see exactly the same again

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:35.550 
is as you can see exactly the same again
Hernandez<00:05:34.180> does<00:05:34.419> the<00:05:34.539> work<00:05:34.750> gets<00:05:35.020> a<00:05:35.169> beautiful

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
Hernandez does the work gets a beautiful

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.950 
Hernandez does the work gets a beautiful
shot<00:05:35.800> away<00:05:35.949> and<00:05:36.310> it<00:05:36.430> is<00:05:36.550> picked<00:05:36.819> up<00:05:37.000> by<00:05:37.210> Morales

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
shot away and it is picked up by Morales

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.040 
shot away and it is picked up by Morales
so<00:05:38.650> he<00:05:39.189> might<00:05:39.550> not<00:05:39.789> always<00:05:40.060> be<00:05:40.389> the<00:05:40.750> goal

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
so he might not always be the goal

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.529 
so he might not always be the goal
scorer<00:05:41.469> but<00:05:41.620> he<00:05:41.800> is<00:05:41.919> definitely<00:05:42.189> a<00:05:42.539> beautiful
