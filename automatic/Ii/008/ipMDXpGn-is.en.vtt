hi everyone this is a video about how to
fit<00:00:08.630> yourself<00:00:08.780> getting<00:00:09.320> tap<00:00:09.770> on<00:00:10.250> a<00:00:10.310> 15

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
fit yourself getting tap on a 15

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.690 
fit yourself getting tap on a 15
millimeter<00:00:11.180> copper<00:00:11.840> pipe<00:00:12.110> this<00:00:13.040> is<00:00:13.250> basically

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
millimeter copper pipe this is basically

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.259 
millimeter copper pipe this is basically
a<00:00:13.880> tap<00:00:15.010> what<00:00:16.010> we<00:00:16.189> need<00:00:16.340> to<00:00:16.520> do<00:00:16.670> is<00:00:16.939> first<00:00:17.779> fit<00:00:18.320> D

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:19.269 
a tap what we need to do is first fit D

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.060 
a tap what we need to do is first fit D
this<00:00:20.269> hole<00:00:20.660> of<00:00:20.869> its<00:00:21.019> holder<00:00:21.650> which<00:00:21.800> is<00:00:21.890> going

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
this hole of its holder which is going

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.370 
this hole of its holder which is going
to<00:00:22.130> hold<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:22.400> tap<00:00:22.669> to<00:00:22.910> the<00:00:22.939> pipe<00:00:23.359> on<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:24.109> pipe

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
to hold the tap to the pipe on the pipe

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.259 
to hold the tap to the pipe on the pipe
and<00:00:24.679> then<00:00:25.960> then<00:00:26.960> just<00:00:26.990> go<00:00:27.470> in<00:00:27.769> the<00:00:27.949> tap<00:00:28.269> which

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
and then then just go in the tap which

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.440 
and then then just go in the tap which
which<00:00:29.630> is<00:00:29.749> going<00:00:29.960> to<00:00:30.019> cut<00:00:30.289> holding<00:00:31.039> the<00:00:31.130> type

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
which is going to cut holding the type

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.369 
which is going to cut holding the type
pipe<00:00:32.450> and<00:00:33.280> that's<00:00:34.280> it<00:00:34.430> basically<00:00:35.020> okay<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:36.079> as

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
pipe and that's it basically okay so as

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.939 
pipe and that's it basically okay so as
you<00:00:36.469> can<00:00:36.680> see<00:00:36.980> I<00:00:37.329> have<00:00:38.329> tightened<00:00:39.199> the<00:00:39.649> screw

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
you can see I have tightened the screw

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.740 
you can see I have tightened the screw
in<00:00:40.190> here<00:00:40.570> which<00:00:41.570> holds<00:00:42.079> the<00:00:42.230> tap<00:00:43.010> holder<00:00:43.750> to

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
in here which holds the tap holder to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.549 
in here which holds the tap holder to
the<00:00:44.870> pipe<00:00:45.340> the<00:00:46.340> reason<00:00:46.640> I'm<00:00:46.760> using<00:00:47.719> this<00:00:48.019> self

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
the pipe the reason I'm using this self

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.150 
the pipe the reason I'm using this self
cutting<00:00:49.629> tap<00:00:50.629> is<00:00:50.899> because<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:51.379> was<00:00:51.590> using<00:00:51.800> this

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
cutting tap is because I was using this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.400 
cutting tap is because I was using this
a<00:00:52.449> plastic<00:00:53.449> epsilon<00:00:53.929> piece<00:00:54.429> to<00:00:55.429> connect<00:00:55.910> my

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
a plastic epsilon piece to connect my

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.250 
a plastic epsilon piece to connect my
dishwasher<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:57.679> washing<00:00:57.920> machine<00:00:58.399> but

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
dishwasher and washing machine but

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.959 
dishwasher and washing machine but
unfortunately<00:01:00.260> I<00:01:00.440> had<00:01:00.649> to<00:01:00.679> I<00:01:01.039> both<00:01:01.550> two<00:01:01.820> of

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
unfortunately I had to I both two of

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.360 
unfortunately I had to I both two of
these<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.359> both<00:01:02.600> failed<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:03.920> I<00:01:03.949> thought<00:01:04.339> I

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
these and both failed so I thought I

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.270 
these and both failed so I thought I
just<00:01:04.580> going<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.000> install<00:01:05.269> a<00:01:05.860> separate<00:01:06.860> tab<00:01:07.250> for

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
just going to install a separate tab for

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.569 
just going to install a separate tab for
the<00:01:07.790> dishwasher<00:01:07.970> in<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.570> washing<00:01:08.900> machine<00:01:08.930> so

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
the dishwasher in the washing machine so

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.460 
the dishwasher in the washing machine so
what<00:01:10.579> you<00:01:10.700> need<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:11.000> do<00:01:11.180> is<00:01:11.360> what<00:01:11.930> I've<00:01:12.079> done<00:01:12.290> is

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
what you need to do is what I've done is

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.760 
what you need to do is what I've done is
I've<00:01:12.890> just<00:01:13.000> tighten<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.119> screw<00:01:14.360> in<00:01:14.509> here<00:01:14.770> so

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
I've just tighten the screw in here so

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.289 
I've just tighten the screw in here so
you<00:01:15.829> need<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.220> make<00:01:16.340> sure<00:01:16.400> you<00:01:16.790> don't<00:01:17.030> tighten

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
you need to make sure you don't tighten

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.080 
you need to make sure you don't tighten
too<00:01:17.810> much<00:01:17.920> otherwise<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:19.250> can<00:01:19.549> crush<00:01:19.909> the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
too much otherwise you can crush the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.780 
too much otherwise you can crush the
pipe<00:01:20.320> so<00:01:21.320> basically<00:01:21.799> just<00:01:21.979> start<00:01:22.250> on<00:01:22.399> it

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
pipe so basically just start on it

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.490 
pipe so basically just start on it
lessen<00:01:23.240> as<00:01:23.390> soon<00:01:23.540> as<00:01:23.659> you<00:01:23.780> feel<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:24.170> start

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
lessen as soon as you feel it start

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.690 
lessen as soon as you feel it start
enough<00:01:24.860> just<00:01:25.689> stop<00:01:26.689> at<00:01:26.899> that<00:01:27.049> stage<00:01:27.700> what

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
enough just stop at that stage what

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.539 
enough just stop at that stage what

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
this you know as you tighten it it feels

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.149 
this you know as you tighten it it feels
harder<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:44.930> harder<00:01:45.320> as<00:01:45.469> you<00:01:45.500> screw<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:46.039> in

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
harder and harder as you screw it in

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.340 
harder and harder as you screw it in
until<00:01:47.740> it<00:01:48.740> actually<00:01:49.090> cuts<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.750> wall<00:01:51.320> of

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
until it actually cuts to the wall of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.700 
until it actually cuts to the wall of
the<00:01:51.530> pipe<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.570> if<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:53.869> haven't<00:01:54.110> turned<00:01:54.439> the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
the pipe so if you haven't turned the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.420 
the pipe so if you haven't turned the
main<00:01:54.890> water<00:01:55.460> supply<00:01:55.789> off<00:01:56.680> you<00:01:57.680> know<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:58.159> might
