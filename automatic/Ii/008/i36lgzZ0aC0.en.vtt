00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 First wide player 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.640
 The thing that felt when you fought 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.880
 Think Well one shot one shot 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:18.630
 Kedomo This Well is as you can see also a look at the video 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:22.420
 Surprised chan is unexpectedly several people in the person who is the most kindly 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.930
 It is fast at the early Uchiai 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:30.510
 Towards the earliest rather than the one-shot one shot I got to this hard I think 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.020
 I have an image and I am shy 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.860
 I felt that it was dangerous if I continued to get here 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.730
 Hmm 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.730
 It was fast 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:50.050
 nalu 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:51.860
 As for Kimura Atsushi, I think that one by one will make me remember the memory 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.079
 One shot one shot 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.200
 of 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.680
 Surely 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:03.150
 Then by all means service period or 3 edition period blue 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.150
 It is a punch with love power 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.920
 As an out of anti 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:22.930
 I hear I'm certain many Toka strong towards heavier born Nde punch of pastor 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.230
 Among them, in the case of players 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.740
 It's raining as I said 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.110
 Dealing with such Lasser period 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.550
 hiroya A player is quick, oh 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.550
 The hard punch is 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:42.500
 I get close when I keep receiving 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.500
 Minoru will have 3 agencies in one shot and one shot 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.350
 I think it's five and a half minutes 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.800
 Together with 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:09.130
 I have a strategy and a strategy, but 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:12.819
 If a player who is well-in-hand fights with the player with the same motivation as fighting a player 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.330
 There is also a possibility of overwhelming 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.210
 Speaking in harsh words, Iwai player 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:24.840
 It says so? Is not it has continued all through to there is no post 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:28.739
 Rings headed with a spirit of spirit always make a good match 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.160
 Specification is by Melo players happy customer is the audience Oko 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.650
 Let's go together 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.829
 Because we have the ability to lift 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.319
 And the me off guard and unless the Do Tank 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:42.819
 If Hiraya has that feeling 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.819
 Can't you get excited ? 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.099
 Not so yes 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.770
 Well after the wide teacher trainers 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.579
 After all I do not think that measures against punchers are perfect 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.110
 strategy 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.510
 As i am 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.909
 I'm looking forward 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.150
 It says the audience also Well flashy Uchiai a was or Toka ko down 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.310
 Is the first 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.700
 Hey 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:31.170
 I like it and I call it, but after all the model 1 fans also call this strategy in the backbone 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.680
 There is a thing 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:39.850
 Trainer land that earns its strategy 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.660
 More interesting fun bar when you try to 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.660
 I wonder if can come of 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.390
 Even a company 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.490
 It became such a server 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.490
 I got an early start 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.080
 Hey That's right 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.860
 Kimura 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.860
 Hirase because it is a different type of storytelling from players 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.680
 I'm fun 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.650
 When 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.449
 Defensive players each other 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.710
 The world top level when it says in defense technique 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:39.960
 Both in the in what my opinion of 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:43.780
 For example, these two people either painted aggressively 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.310
 If there is a chance for players to play in the future 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.310
 I wonder if it will spread 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.390
 Well, you still have to bear the risk of gaining popularity and sensitivity to some extent 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.849
 you know 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.280
 How much risk do you bear 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.850
 Can it be causal 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.850
 Life battle name 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.290
 People are cars 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.500
 After all that 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.950
 Because water is on the ring 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:33.380
 The feelings of the players at that time 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:34.600
 The sentiments of the Seconds are also sometimes highly unbalanced, though 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.289
 because k 1 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:43.659
 Impress customers as phone entertainment 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:46.229
 The player who thought about the customer who thinks about the customer after all comes out after all popularly 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.229
 I think so 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.000
 That's why a double strike 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.760
 Well you can expect it as an Edge Coin
