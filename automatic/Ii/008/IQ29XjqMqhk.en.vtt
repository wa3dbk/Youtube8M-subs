and you know play your arms behind your

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.850 
and you know play your arms behind your
butt<00:01:32.729> or<00:01:32.939> whatever<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:34.259> put<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> hold<00:01:34.740> them

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
butt or whatever I just put I hold them

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.730 
butt or whatever I just put I hold them
together<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.290> it's<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> way<00:01:37.530> works

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
together like this it's the way works

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.940 
together like this it's the way works
for<00:01:37.860> me<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:39.299> then<00:01:39.540> that's<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:40.729> yeah<00:01:41.759> nice<00:01:42.000> tech

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
for me and then that's it yeah nice tech

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.719 
for me and then that's it yeah nice tech
so<00:01:44.180> it<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.360> get<00:01:45.479> pretty<00:01:45.689> tiring<00:01:46.340> if<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.490> hold

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
so it can get pretty tiring if you hold

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.990 
so it can get pretty tiring if you hold
it<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.119> while<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:49.520> before<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.610> take<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
it for a while so before you take it to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.910 
it for a while so before you take it to
them<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.450> hill<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.079> really<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.560> could<00:01:52.680> take<00:01:52.799> up

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
them a hill I really you could take up

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.889 
them a hill I really you could take up
to<00:01:52.950> little<00:01:53.189> hills<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:53.670> before<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.570> do<00:01:54.720> like<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
to little hills but before you do like a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.219 
to little hills but before you do like a
long<00:01:55.200> run<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:56.130> might<00:01:56.340> take<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.790> know<00:01:56.869> 3<00:01:57.869> or<00:01:57.990> 4

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
long run that might take you know 3 or 4

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.800 
long run that might take you know 3 or 4
minutes<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.710> get<00:01:58.920> down<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.340> hill<00:01:59.630> you<00:02:00.630> want

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
minutes to get down to the hill you want

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.510 
minutes to get down to the hill you want
to<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.649> practice<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:04.100> just<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:05.250> how<00:02:05.310> long

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
to just practice that just see how long

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.700 
to just practice that just see how long
you<00:02:05.670> can<00:02:05.820> hold<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.240> cause<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> little

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
you can hold it cause it is a little

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.260 
you can hold it cause it is a little
more<00:02:07.979> difficult<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.550> hold<00:02:08.700> than<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.090> might

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
more difficult to hold than you might

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.170 
more difficult to hold than you might
think<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:10.459> eventually<00:02:11.459> your<00:02:11.640> legs<00:02:11.849> will<00:02:12.060> get

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
think and eventually your legs will get

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.930 
think and eventually your legs will get
really<00:02:12.420> strong<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.170> know

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
really strong you know

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.309 
really strong you know
muscle-memory<00:02:14.940> all<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.629> good<00:02:15.780> stuff<00:02:15.810> it

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
muscle-memory all that good stuff it

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.920 
muscle-memory all that good stuff it
