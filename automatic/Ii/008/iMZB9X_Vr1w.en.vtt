having a real feedback mechanism
automatically<00:00:47.370> built<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.750> understand

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
automatically built in is to understand

education to kind of get a real-time

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.179 
education to kind of get a real-time
feedback<00:01:05.540> from<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> real<00:01:07.560> world<00:01:07.770> all

the<00:01:08.520> time<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.060> having<00:01:09.869> real<00:01:10.140> projects<00:01:10.830> real

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
the time and having real projects real

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.270 
the time and having real projects real
investigations<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.710> think<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> fact

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
investigations because I think the fact

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.230 
investigations because I think the fact
that<00:01:14.340> academics<00:01:14.909> sometimes<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.540> cut<00:01:15.810> off<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
that academics sometimes is so cut off I

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.890 
that academics sometimes is so cut off I
think<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.930> me<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.380> also<00:01:19.560> more<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.880> believe<00:01:21.689> in

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
think to me it's also more I believe in

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.899 
think to me it's also more I believe in
into<00:01:22.200> grow<00:01:22.470> rather<00:01:23.040> than<00:01:23.280> integrate<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:25.909> mean

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
into grow rather than integrate I mean

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.399 
into grow rather than integrate I mean
we<00:01:27.030> also<00:01:27.299> had<00:01:27.509> these<00:01:27.630> conversations<00:01:27.900> about

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
we also had these conversations about

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.520 
we also had these conversations about
that<00:01:29.280> design<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:30.030> only<00:01:30.259> starts<00:01:31.259> when<00:01:31.290> you're

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
that design not only starts when you're

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
that design not only starts when you're
designing<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.040> building<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.520> design<00:01:32.880> starts

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
designing a building but design starts

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.060 
designing a building but design starts
with<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> negotiations<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> politics

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
with the negotiations with the politics

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.170 
with the negotiations with the politics
with<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> lot<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.549> different<00:01:35.880> things<00:01:36.030> that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
with a lot of different things that

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.600 
with a lot of different things that
maybe<00:01:36.840> they<00:01:37.049> were<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.409> taught<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.770> school<00:01:37.890> at

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
maybe they were not taught in school at

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.060 
maybe they were not taught in school at
first<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.270> could<00:01:40.229> not<00:01:40.380> imagine<00:01:40.590> having<00:01:40.920> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
first I could not imagine having that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.679 
first I could not imagine having that
practice<00:01:41.400> without<00:01:41.670> teaching<00:01:41.909> I've<00:01:42.240> always

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
practice without teaching I've always

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.749 
practice without teaching I've always
been<00:01:42.899> teaching<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.530> said<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.399> force

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
been teaching as you said and to force

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.490 
been teaching as you said and to force
myself<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.299> constantly<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> long<00:01:46.259> term

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
myself to constantly have a long term

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.580 
myself to constantly have a long term
view<00:01:46.909> instead<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.970> like<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.930> zooming<00:01:49.470> in

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
view instead of like you know zooming in

view instead of like you know zooming in
on<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.860> problem<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.820> solve<00:01:50.970> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
on this problem we have to solve and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.460 
on this problem we have to solve and
it's<00:01:51.360> obviously<00:01:51.750> always<00:01:52.020> an<00:01:52.229> interesting

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
it's obviously always an interesting

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.380 
it's obviously always an interesting
problem<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.220> think<00:01:53.430> should<00:01:53.579> be<00:01:53.640> solved<00:01:54.119> I

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
problem and I think should be solved I

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.469 
problem and I think should be solved I
I<00:01:55.420> think<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:56.020> kind<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.650> my<00:01:56.710> motto<00:01:57.700> sort<00:01:58.360> of

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
I think that is kind of my motto sort of

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.270 
I think that is kind of my motto sort of
like<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:59.080> know<00:01:59.200> rather<00:01:59.440> than<00:01:59.620> thinking<00:02:00.220> that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
like you know rather than thinking that

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.830 
like you know rather than thinking that
you<00:02:00.640> have<00:02:00.760> to<00:02:00.880> solve<00:02:01.060> all<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.390> little<00:02:01.659> stuff

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
you have to solve all the little stuff

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.780

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
William gets master plans I'd be even

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.750 
William gets master plans I'd be even
organic<00:02:09.750> really<00:02:10.750> fast<00:02:11.140> impulses<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.400> letting

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
organic really fast impulses and letting

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.090 
organic really fast impulses and letting
them<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.270> then<00:02:13.420> seeing<00:02:13.750> how<00:02:13.959> that<00:02:14.020> reacts<00:02:14.860> and

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
before crowdsourcing and all these

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.880 
before crowdsourcing and all these
things<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.050> were<00:02:23.200> now<00:02:23.410> because<00:02:23.709> of<00:02:23.830> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
things that were now because of the

things that were now because of the
social<00:02:24.070> media<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.730> remember<00:02:25.239> yeah<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:25.630> forgot

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
social media I remember yeah I forgot

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.390 
social media I remember yeah I forgot
the<00:02:26.230> name<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.590> guys<00:02:26.770> doing<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.190> but<00:02:27.310> they

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
the name of the guys doing it but they

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.190 
the name of the guys doing it but they
were<00:02:27.459> trying<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.180> store<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:28.720> some<00:02:28.959> part

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
were trying to do a store in some part

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.080 
were trying to do a store in some part
of<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.290> city<00:02:29.560> where<00:02:29.860> they<00:02:30.010> put<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.370> sign<00:02:30.880> in<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
of the city where they put a sign in the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.640 
of the city where they put a sign in the
window<00:02:31.120> saying<00:02:31.600> what<00:02:31.959> do<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.140> want<00:02:32.350> this<00:02:32.470> to

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
window saying what do you want this to

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.740 
window saying what do you want this to
be<00:02:32.800> but<00:02:33.430> as<00:02:33.519> you<00:02:33.640> said<00:02:33.790> who<00:02:34.150> brings<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.600> down

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
be but as you said who brings it down

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.710 
be but as you said who brings it down
and<00:02:34.989> does<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.350> if<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.950> test<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.370> no<00:02:36.550> yeah<00:02:36.910> yeah

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
and does it if you test it no yeah yeah

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.449 
and does it if you test it no yeah yeah
that's<00:02:37.989> also<00:02:38.170> when<00:02:38.440> your<00:02:38.560> experience<00:02:39.220> comes

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
that's also when your experience comes

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.670 
that's also when your experience comes
in<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.910> know<00:02:40.060> people<00:02:40.840> want<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.140> lot<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.320> things

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
in you know people want a lot of things

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.640 
in you know people want a lot of things
but<00:02:41.920> they<00:02:42.310> they<00:02:43.300> can<00:02:43.510> only<00:02:43.930> tell<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.290> what<00:02:44.440> the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
but they they can only tell you what the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.470 
but they they can only tell you what the
one<00:02:44.769> that<00:02:44.890> needs<00:02:45.070> translation<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.239> needs

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
one that needs translation and it needs

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.040 
one that needs translation and it needs
kind<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:47.610> maybe<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.730> bigger<00:02:49.060> sweep<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.930> know

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
kind of maybe a bigger sweep you know

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.229 
kind of maybe a bigger sweep you know
like<00:02:50.320> some<00:02:51.100> things<00:02:51.370> were<00:02:51.550> like<00:02:51.700> really<00:02:51.970> tiny

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
like some things were like really tiny

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.090 
like some things were like really tiny
but<00:02:52.840> they<00:02:52.930> could<00:02:53.110> be<00:02:53.200> really<00:02:53.380> important<00:02:53.950> for

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
but they could be really important for

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:03.360 
but they could be really important for
an<00:02:54.370> area<00:03:00.239> again<00:03:01.239> about<00:03:01.620> education<00:03:02.620> when

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
an area again about education when

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.949 
an area again about education when
you're<00:03:03.940> doing<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.299> with<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:04.540> with<00:03:04.840> your

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
you're doing that with this with your

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.930 
you're doing that with this with your
students<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.560> they're<00:03:05.650> seeing<00:03:05.920> this<00:03:06.519> also<00:03:06.730> is

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
students and they're seeing this also is

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.449 
students and they're seeing this also is
designing<00:03:07.209> you're<00:03:07.959> designing<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:09.010> dialogues

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
designing you're designing the dialogues

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.979 
designing you're designing the dialogues
you're<00:03:09.640> designing<00:03:10.000> possibilities<00:03:10.810> for

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
you're designing possibilities for

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.130 
you're designing possibilities for
dialogue<00:03:11.350> you're<00:03:12.220> designing<00:03:13.140> synthesizing

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
dialogue you're designing synthesizing

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.910 
dialogue you're designing synthesizing
all<00:03:14.320> that<00:03:14.590> information<00:03:15.220> into<00:03:15.670> something

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
all that information into something

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.080 
all that information into something
something<00:03:17.920> generates<00:03:18.340> something<00:03:18.549> else<00:03:18.910> you

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
something generates something else you

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.060 
something generates something else you
know<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.420> there<00:03:19.570> is<00:03:19.690> some<00:03:20.350> sort<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.560> dynamics

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
know that there is some sort of dynamics

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.930 
know that there is some sort of dynamics
created<00:03:21.640> by<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:22.200> but<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.920> like<00:03:24.519> what<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.790> said

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
created by it but I like what you said

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.600 
created by it but I like what you said
about<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.420> change<00:03:25.989> of<00:03:26.230> design<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.430> it's

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
about the change of design and that it's

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.910 
about the change of design and that it's
not<00:03:27.850> like<00:03:28.090> oh<00:03:28.269> we<00:03:28.450> do<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:29.079> is<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.650> know<00:03:29.739> it's

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
not like oh we do it it is you know it's

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.740 
not like oh we do it it is you know it's
a<00:03:30.070> search<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.790> then<00:03:30.940> we<00:03:31.060> stop<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.540> then<00:03:31.660> we

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
a search and then we stop and then we

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.530 
a search and then we stop and then we
design<00:03:31.900> no<00:03:32.320> we<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.579> research<00:03:33.970> part<00:03:34.329> is

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
design no we the research part is

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.720 
design no we the research part is
already<00:03:34.959> designed<00:03:35.320> part<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:36.310> when<00:03:36.489> we're

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
already designed part and when we're

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.819 
already designed part and when we're
designing<00:03:37.299> were<00:03:37.720> still<00:03:38.049> bringing<00:03:38.410> in<00:03:38.620> more

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
designing were still bringing in more

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.220 
designing were still bringing in more
research<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:40.090> idea<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.630> really<00:03:40.750> that

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
research so the idea is really that

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.020 
research so the idea is really that
you're<00:03:41.410> constantly<00:03:41.709> like<00:03:42.310> oh<00:03:42.489> my<00:03:42.610> students<00:03:42.910> I

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
you're constantly like oh my students I

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.710 
you're constantly like oh my students I
say<00:03:43.180> it's<00:03:43.360> like<00:03:43.390> imagine<00:03:44.049> your<00:03:44.170> pride

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
say it's like imagine your pride

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.330 
say it's like imagine your pride
private<00:03:45.170> detective<00:03:45.620> when<00:03:45.770> you're<00:03:45.920> solving<00:03:46.100> a

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
private detective when you're solving a

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.310 
private detective when you're solving a
case<00:03:46.550> mm-hmm<00:03:47.300> you're<00:03:47.570> not<00:03:47.720> gonna<00:03:47.870> stop

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
case mm-hmm you're not gonna stop

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.530 
case mm-hmm you're not gonna stop
looking<00:03:48.740> at<00:03:48.890> evidence<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:50.150> need<00:03:50.510> to

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
looking at evidence you need to

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.020 
looking at evidence you need to
constantly<00:03:51.200> like<00:03:51.680> bring<00:03:51.950> in<00:03:52.070> more<00:03:52.460> evidence

constantly like bring in more evidence

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.770 
constantly like bring in more evidence
and<00:03:53.270> mores

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
and mores

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.110

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
you know smart arguments of why this

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.000 
you know smart arguments of why this
solution<00:03:56.510> is<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.050> best<00:03:57.200> one

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.140 

it<00:04:01.010> doesn't<00:04:01.250> finish<00:04:01.370> when<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.640> building<00:04:02.030> is

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
it doesn't finish when the building is

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.700 
it doesn't finish when the building is
built<00:04:02.390> what<00:04:02.780> happens<00:04:03.230> because<00:04:03.410> the

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
built what happens because the

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.310 
built what happens because the
architecture<00:04:04.310> exists<00:04:05.030> Herbert<00:04:05.600> Alicia<00:04:05.990> was

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
architecture exists Herbert Alicia was

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.050 
architecture exists Herbert Alicia was
the<00:04:06.530> critic<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.220> New<00:04:07.310> York<00:04:07.550> Times<00:04:07.760> at<00:04:07.940> that

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
the critic of the New York Times at that

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.150 
the critic of the New York Times at that
point<00:04:08.270> he<00:04:08.900> looked<00:04:08.930> at<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:09.380> project<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:10.070> he

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
point he looked at the project and he

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.880 
point he looked at the project and he
said<00:04:10.370> ah<00:04:10.690> so<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:11.750> think<00:04:12.080> that<00:04:12.140> extension<00:04:12.590> is<00:04:12.830> a

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
said ah so you think that extension is a

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.090 
said ah so you think that extension is a
parasite<00:04:13.340> is<00:04:13.550> it<00:04:13.700> not<00:04:13.880> absolutely<00:04:14.180> yeah<00:04:15.100> it's

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
parasite is it not absolutely yeah it's

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.400 
parasite is it not absolutely yeah it's
just<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.430> extension<00:04:16.730> and<00:04:17.120> our<00:04:17.600> extension<00:04:18.170> was

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
just the extension and our extension was

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.710 
just the extension and our extension was
twice<00:04:18.980> the<00:04:19.010> size<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.640> the<00:04:19.820> original<00:04:20.000> building

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
twice the size of the original building

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.150 
twice the size of the original building
we've<00:04:21.140> still<00:04:21.470> filed<00:04:21.769> it<00:04:21.950> as<00:04:22.070> an<00:04:22.190> extension<00:04:24.160> but

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
we've still filed it as an extension but

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.240 
we've still filed it as an extension but
what<00:04:25.580> he<00:04:25.850> said<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.480> he<00:04:26.690> said<00:04:26.900> up<00:04:27.110> so<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.740> have

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
what he said so he said up so you have

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.700 
what he said so he said up so you have
essentially<00:04:28.970> started<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:29.990> new<00:04:30.170> type<00:04:30.410> called

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
essentially started a new type called

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.890 
essentially started a new type called
apply<00:04:31.070> rebuilding<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:31.880> so<00:04:32.300> he<00:04:32.360> wrote<00:04:32.630> like<00:04:32.870> a

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
apply rebuilding and so he wrote like a

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.690 
apply rebuilding and so he wrote like a
huge<00:04:33.200> article<00:04:33.470> New<00:04:33.770> Times<00:04:34.010> final<00:04:34.430> building

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
huge article New Times final building

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.910 
huge article New Times final building
government<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.600> then<00:04:35.900> funny<00:04:36.350> enough<00:04:36.680> we<00:04:36.890> just

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
government and then funny enough we just

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.770 
government and then funny enough we just
started<00:04:37.340> seeing<00:04:37.520> in<00:04:37.730> New<00:04:37.850> York<00:04:38.120> was<00:04:38.300> all<00:04:38.570> these

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
started seeing in New York was all these

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.690 
started seeing in New York was all these
buildings<00:04:39.380> with<00:04:39.620> extensions<00:04:40.250> bigger<00:04:40.490> than

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
buildings with extensions bigger than

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.070 
buildings with extensions bigger than
the<00:04:40.820> original<00:04:41.210> building<00:04:41.570> popping<00:04:41.960> up

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
the original building popping up

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.970 
the original building popping up
everywhere<00:04:42.440> what<00:04:43.250> is<00:04:43.370> really<00:04:43.670> interesting<00:04:43.820> of

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
everywhere what is really interesting of

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.200 
everywhere what is really interesting of
architecture<00:04:45.980> and<00:04:46.130> cultural<00:04:46.580> critics<00:04:46.970> is

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
architecture and cultural critics is

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.659 
architecture and cultural critics is
that<00:04:47.900> they<00:04:48.200> can<00:04:48.470> really<00:04:48.680> push<00:04:48.980> things<00:04:49.250> in<00:04:49.490> ways

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
that they can really push things in ways

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.190 
that they can really push things in ways
we<00:04:49.880> would<00:04:50.060> never<00:04:50.270> do<00:04:50.480> because<00:04:50.810> you<00:04:50.900> can<00:04:51.080> never

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
we would never do because you can never

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.230 
we would never do because you can never
read<00:04:51.560> your<00:04:51.590> own<00:04:51.890> building<00:04:52.250> like<00:04:52.400> that<00:04:52.430> we<00:04:53.060> have

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
read your own building like that we have

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.080 
read your own building like that we have
this<00:04:53.390> conversation<00:04:53.740> that<00:04:54.740> he<00:04:55.370> suddenly<00:04:55.700> he's

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
this conversation that he suddenly he's

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.120 
this conversation that he suddenly he's
thought<00:04:56.450> ah<00:04:56.690> so<00:04:57.110> there<00:04:57.290> is<00:04:57.350> a<00:04:57.380> para<00:04:57.680> building

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
thought ah so there is a para building

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.159 
thought ah so there is a para building
which<00:04:58.400> means<00:04:58.610> this<00:04:58.700> new<00:04:58.970> type<00:04:59.270> and<00:04:59.570> was<00:04:59.780> a<00:04:59.810> mean

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
which means this new type and was a mean

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.900 
which means this new type and was a mean
and<00:05:00.440> so<00:05:00.530> we<00:05:00.620> started<00:05:00.890> writing<00:05:01.070> about<00:05:01.250> the

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
and so we started writing about the

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.670 
and so we started writing about the
urban<00:05:02.240> effects<00:05:02.690> and<00:05:02.840> the<00:05:02.960> architectural

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
urban effects and the architectural

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.060 
urban effects and the architectural
effects<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.580> potential<00:05:05.120> of<00:05:06.070> continuity

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
effects and the potential of continuity

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.880 
effects and the potential of continuity
the<00:05:07.370> urban<00:05:08.000> language<00:05:08.840> while<00:05:09.260> still<00:05:09.680> bringing

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
the urban language while still bringing

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.470 
the urban language while still bringing
in<00:05:10.190> new<00:05:10.400> architectural<00:05:12.580> forms<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:14.270> how<00:05:14.419> does

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
in new architectural forms and how does

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.620 
in new architectural forms and how does
it<00:05:14.690> really<00:05:14.810> change<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.410> way<00:05:15.560> a<00:05:16.630> conventional

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
it really change the way a conventional

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.960 
it really change the way a conventional
or<00:05:17.690> common<00:05:18.110> things<00:05:18.350> were<00:05:18.500> seeing<00:05:18.800> no<00:05:18.980> can

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
or common things were seeing no can

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.570 
or common things were seeing no can
advance<00:05:20.300> them<00:05:20.540> a<00:05:20.630> little<00:05:20.870> bit<00:05:21.020> no<00:05:21.830> exactly<00:05:22.400> and

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
advance them a little bit no exactly and

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.129 
advance them a little bit no exactly and
these<00:05:22.730> are

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
these are

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:24.869 
these are
testing<00:05:23.409> things<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:23.800> think<00:05:23.860> we<00:05:24.310> need<00:05:24.340> to<00:05:24.729> do

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
testing things I think we need to do

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.610 
testing things I think we need to do
because<00:05:25.090> I<00:05:25.300> think<00:05:25.449> the<00:05:25.780> shift<00:05:26.020> between<00:05:26.199> urban

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
because I think the shift between urban

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.619 
because I think the shift between urban
and<00:05:26.770> privacy<00:05:27.280> this<00:05:27.520> is<00:05:27.849> exactly<00:05:28.270> where<00:05:28.509> I've

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:28.629 
and privacy this is exactly where I've

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.779 
and privacy this is exactly where I've
happens<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.139> it's<00:05:29.349> our<00:05:30.039> cities<00:05:30.460> we<00:05:30.610> can

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
happens and it's our cities we can

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.879 
happens and it's our cities we can
really<00:05:31.030> change<00:05:31.300> by<00:05:31.629> like<00:05:32.349> taking<00:05:32.740> the

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
really change by like taking the

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.589 
really change by like taking the
conventional<00:05:33.610> and<00:05:34.060> making<00:05:34.509> it

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
conventional and making it

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.320 
conventional and making it
unconventional<00:05:35.529> rather<00:05:36.219> than<00:05:36.490> thinking<00:05:36.969> that

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
unconventional rather than thinking that

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.929 
unconventional rather than thinking that
everything<00:05:37.840> has<00:05:38.020> to<00:05:38.169> be<00:05:38.289> special<00:05:38.979> I<00:05:39.249> think<00:05:39.849> it

00:05:39.929 --> 00:05:39.939 
everything has to be special I think it

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.339 
everything has to be special I think it
is<00:05:40.060> the<00:05:40.210> most<00:05:40.330> interesting<00:05:40.900> tool<00:05:41.080> ooh<00:05:41.139> the

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
is the most interesting tool ooh the

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.230 
is the most interesting tool ooh the
most<00:05:41.560> conventional<00:05:41.949> do<00:05:42.759> you<00:05:42.879> really

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
most conventional do you really

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.929 
most conventional do you really
understand<00:05:43.749> and<00:05:44.229> criticize<00:05:44.740> and<00:05:44.770> rethink<00:05:45.550> and

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:45.939 
understand and criticize and rethink and

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.360 
understand and criticize and rethink and
and<00:05:46.120> figure<00:05:46.960> out<00:05:46.990> like<00:05:47.139> what<00:05:47.620> can<00:05:47.800> we<00:05:47.949> do<00:05:48.099> here

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
and figure out like what can we do here

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.209 
and figure out like what can we do here
so<00:05:48.669> that<00:05:48.879> we<00:05:49.060> shift<00:05:49.360> around<00:05:49.779> race<00:05:50.050> yeah<00:05:50.469> the

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:51.219 
so that we shift around race yeah the

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:53.129 
so that we shift around race yeah the
small<00:05:51.610> shifts<00:05:52.210> are<00:05:52.330> the<00:05:52.449> most<00:05:52.599> interesting

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
small shifts are the most interesting

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.050 
small shifts are the most interesting
ones<00:05:53.349> it<00:05:53.710> just<00:05:54.159> maybe<00:05:54.279> it's<00:05:54.430> around<00:05:54.639> up<00:05:54.879> it's

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
ones it just maybe it's around up it's

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.869 
ones it just maybe it's around up it's
that<00:05:55.599> if<00:05:56.259> somebody<00:05:56.710> has<00:05:56.919> something<00:05:57.189> important

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:57.879 
that if somebody has something important

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:59.790 
that if somebody has something important
to<00:05:57.939> say<00:05:58.029> if<00:05:58.300> somebody<00:05:58.599> has<00:05:58.779> an<00:05:58.900> opinion<00:05:59.199> design

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
to say if somebody has an opinion design

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.980 
to say if somebody has an opinion design
starts<00:06:00.370> even<00:06:00.580> from<00:06:00.759> the<00:06:00.879> sidewalk<00:06:01.300> the

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
starts even from the sidewalk the

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.529 
starts even from the sidewalk the
biggest<00:06:02.319> thing<00:06:02.469> I<00:06:02.650> learned<00:06:02.979> from<00:06:03.389> looking<00:06:04.389> at

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
biggest thing I learned from looking at

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.050 
biggest thing I learned from looking at
Colombia<00:06:05.050> was<00:06:05.319> that<00:06:06.129> they<00:06:06.370> changed<00:06:06.849> whole

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
Colombia was that they changed whole

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.610 
Colombia was that they changed whole
neighborhoods<00:06:07.539> by<00:06:07.810> either<00:06:08.139> putting<00:06:08.439> a

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
neighborhoods by either putting a

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.409 
neighborhoods by either putting a
library<00:06:09.009> of<00:06:09.069> a<00:06:09.159> school<00:06:09.430> in<00:06:09.580> middle<00:06:09.939> and<00:06:10.150> that

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
library of a school in middle and that

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.950 
library of a school in middle and that
became<00:06:11.020> their<00:06:11.319> public<00:06:12.090> event<00:06:13.090> space<00:06:13.449> that

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
became their public event space that

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.439 
became their public event space that
public<00:06:14.289> plaza<00:06:14.560> the<00:06:15.339> place<00:06:15.669> people<00:06:15.969> started

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
public plaza the place people started

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.689 
public plaza the place people started
together<00:06:16.539> every<00:06:17.199> year<00:06:17.229> but<00:06:18.099> what<00:06:18.310> was<00:06:18.460> even

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
together every year but what was even

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.010 
together every year but what was even
more<00:06:18.729> interesting<00:06:18.909> is<00:06:19.389> that<00:06:19.419> this<00:06:19.750> city

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
more interesting is that this city

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.170 
more interesting is that this city
didn't<00:06:20.650> just<00:06:20.830> do<00:06:20.979> that<00:06:21.009> but<00:06:21.460> then<00:06:21.580> from<00:06:21.849> their

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
didn't just do that but then from their

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.730 
didn't just do that but then from their
own<00:06:22.389> they<00:06:22.569> started<00:06:22.930> putting<00:06:23.439> the<00:06:23.589> most

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
own they started putting the most

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.119 
own they started putting the most
beautiful<00:06:24.430> pavement<00:06:24.999> in<00:06:25.599> patterns<00:06:26.259> all

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:27.129 
beautiful pavement in patterns all

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:28.860 
beautiful pavement in patterns all
throughout<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.669> neighborhood<00:06:27.819> so<00:06:28.240> where

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
throughout the neighborhood so where

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.769 
throughout the neighborhood so where
these<00:06:29.110> slums<00:06:30.039> essentially<00:06:30.729> first<00:06:31.479> were<00:06:31.659> on

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:31.779 
these slums essentially first were on

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:33.929 
these slums essentially first were on
mud<00:06:32.050> roads<00:06:32.349> and<00:06:32.889> this<00:06:33.069> switch<00:06:33.310> was<00:06:33.490> blocked<00:06:33.729> up

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:33.939 
mud roads and this switch was blocked up

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:34.679 
mud roads and this switch was blocked up
and<00:06:34.089> all<00:06:34.150> that<00:06:34.180> stuff

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:34.689 
and all that stuff

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:36.899 
and all that stuff
now<00:06:35.020> suddenly<00:06:35.589> what<00:06:36.250> was<00:06:36.279> already<00:06:36.639> there

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
now suddenly what was already there

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:38.670 
now suddenly what was already there
public<00:06:37.449> living<00:06:37.750> room<00:06:37.960> because<00:06:38.110> it's<00:06:38.469> fought

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
public living room because it's fought

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.889 
public living room because it's fought
and<00:06:39.009> they're<00:06:39.099> living<00:06:39.339> outside<00:06:39.490> a<00:06:39.699> lot<00:06:39.899> became

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:40.899 
and they're living outside a lot became

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:43.529 
and they're living outside a lot became
the<00:06:41.199> most<00:06:41.379> beautiful<00:06:41.979> and<00:06:42.250> what<00:06:43.000> was<00:06:43.180> people's

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
the most beautiful and what was people's

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:45.300 
the most beautiful and what was people's
reaction<00:06:44.020> they<00:06:44.469> were<00:06:44.529> starting<00:06:44.860> to<00:06:44.889> fix<00:06:45.159> that

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
reaction they were starting to fix that

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.450 
reaction they were starting to fix that
and<00:06:45.930> I<00:06:46.930> thought<00:06:47.229> that<00:06:47.289> was<00:06:47.740> just<00:06:48.069> the<00:06:48.279> most

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
and I thought that was just the most

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.969 
and I thought that was just the most
poetic<00:06:49.240> and<00:06:49.719> beautiful<00:06:49.779> thing<00:06:50.379> I've<00:06:50.589> seen<00:06:50.800> in

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:50.979 
poetic and beautiful thing I've seen in

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.909 
poetic and beautiful thing I've seen in
a<00:06:51.009> long<00:06:51.159> time<00:06:51.430> that<00:06:52.180> again<00:06:52.689> is<00:06:52.930> what<00:06:53.409> happened

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
a long time that again is what happened

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.089 
a long time that again is what happened
because<00:06:54.069> the<00:06:54.399> architecture<00:06:55.349> because<00:06:56.349> what

00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:57.099 
because the architecture because what

00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:58.920 
because the architecture because what
was<00:06:57.189> after<00:06:57.430> the<00:06:57.699> architecture<00:06:58.210> to<00:06:58.719> me<00:06:58.839> the

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
was after the architecture to me the

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.119 
was after the architecture to me the
most<00:06:59.080> important<00:06:59.469> thing<00:06:59.500> is<00:06:59.680> the<00:06:59.770> sense<00:07:00.009> of

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:00.129 
most important thing is the sense of

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:03.059 
most important thing is the sense of
pride<00:07:00.399> yeah<00:07:00.879> the<00:07:01.149> you<00:07:01.719> started<00:07:02.500> seeing<00:07:02.740> in<00:07:02.949> all
