00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.259
 a version strawberry parts a caramel 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.740
 red wine you will see it 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.750
 surprising 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.280
 so we start with creams 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.710
 mom that you can it is to garnish the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.150
 bottom yes we're going to allow in fact of 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.320
 cook the dough with the cream 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.390
 of almond that will hold a little bit a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.619
 little bit mellow and you will not have 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.039
 need shots to make two people 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.330
 different 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.470
 so let's go for that baumann 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.340
 if it's a little cold we go to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.700
 a little bit in the microwave 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.649
 for now we are moving forward so we see 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.180
 that he is very much worse forms he 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.780
 really very low almost not to 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.440
 to work is perfect da then there 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.440
 like I sugar you 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.190
 so he almond cream actually it takes 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.020
 the mulsanne and to give volume to 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.560
 little one here we have to work a little 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.470
 little is the little sport session 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.580
 on a slaughterer rights of the user 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.559
 with a leaf is not bad but 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.270
 when we look at I have a pod of 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.350
 vanilla me I spoil game grata pod of 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:09.670
 vanilla and I get my arms together 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.890
 give here to take adds the powder 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.000
 almonds 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.550
 obviously we can put something else 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.030
 that just nuts after years 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:23.770
 screening because retraces case there for 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.259
 dried fruits that you like we are going 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.340
 add the devices in baton well 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.540
 between each time it's gone and you 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.420
 go see that offered a cream that had 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.350
 very very smooth that will be pretty and that 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.800
 you can put it in full of tone 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.540
 left 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.830
 it is very greedy not to the cream 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.869
 almond and ready now we're going 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.100
 care for rape in dieffenthal 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.560
 the bottom of everywhere we can buy it 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.700
 all fresh or so we can do it yourself 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.710
 even it's even better to deal with 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.030
 depend on time for nathan tonight then 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.530
 which is very important already when 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.470
 you have your child do not forget 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:59.380
 of course cooking after we split the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.840
 almond cream comes to the center and after 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.789
 there would be there realized for very leather 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.140
 smooth or not ben it's important just 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.490
 be it distributed after she goes 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.690
 to pack with them to cook them 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.819
 the one- eyed oven will make its effect 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.870
 okay it just needs to spread 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.890
 in the corners after what you can 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:22.780
 to do is to type it a little soon to the 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.010
 marine cooking then we will bake it 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.690
 as is in a preheated oven at 170 Â° 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.670
 30 35 minutes until it is 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.040
 well gilded be downright thigh 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.060
 here we go 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.340
 the pie in cooking now we're going 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.050
 to make a syrup of branches very very 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.940
 simple we will put sugar in a 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.599
 pan 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:47.020
 here is syrup syrup liquor 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:53.560
 strawberry but it's the oath of the lakers 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:55.269
 and choirs of France you go 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.099
 quiet the toque then invoked 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.989
 start again 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:03.280
 you return here the tauf part 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.379
 now offered sleeping syrup 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.400
 to make more or less of the 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.590
 can amended 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.250
 this is a very very simple for that we are going 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.650
 put sugar in a crazy we go 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.689
 put strawberry liquor syrup 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.620
 possibly strawberry hockey put 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.680
 a shaved head shot is the red wine will 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.560
 bring that tone a little bit 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.599
 greedy to the color recipe 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.640
 also very simple we just want the future 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.409
 munitions as soon as these evolutions 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.719
 we remove it from the fire and leave it well 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:36.750
 cool it goes very fast so that the ace 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:39.129
 bari were the ammo we stopped 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.450
 there is a mixture of fresh smells and a 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:45.310
 saba contract agreement and therefore there is 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.159
 is going to make a red wine caramel then 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.950
 go ahead my account so very simple we're going 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.930
 put the sugar the sugar in a 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.519
 pan and will do so a caramel 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.750
 which is more simplified yet a little 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.300
 little water when you put about a 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.670
 third of weight in water agreement 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.040
 and there we stir it just me well 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.750
 average low and judge boyer for the 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.040
 wet which helped her to dissolve the 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.540
 sugar and convent with caramel 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.890
 much easier and there we wear 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.330
 to boiling and there we are happy either 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.350
 huh that's it we do not touch anymore 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.760
 do not put two spoons born from this 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.710
 patch in it is very important because 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.290
 that it is likely to massage the sugar to 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.340
 the ego here are our stages of caramel and there 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.470
 you go ice cream and to make a 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.820
 liquid caramel there we do very 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.170
 be careful as I was liquid 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.880
 fat in the caramel that 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:35.200
 it does not jump on it will get ready 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:36.990
 always weighing a little bit 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.470
 impressive 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.790
 it's the reaction of water or wine 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.610
 with caramel 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.360
 but look at the right color we're going 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.780
 add a little bit here is it 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.610
 he will reduce this caramel wine 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.620
 red to a consistency in the tablecloth 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.210
 to be able after 91 of them pie 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.250
 of strawberries 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:05.980
 red wine has reduced well and you see my 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:07.090
 a consistency was going well the slope that 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.500
 is going to be very pretty on the 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.060
 strawberries and who added value a people 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.030
 there is no small caramel vegetables 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.640
 it's going to cool meaning it's going to thicken a 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.100
 little bit that there needs to be 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.490
 was not voting me it's 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.419
 important 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.490
 in the meantime then we went out 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.680
 the background of farbus must we just go punch 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.210
 is actually the almond cream with the 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.160
 syrup 13 red wine 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.280
 here we prepared earlier and there 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.450
 you have to let a little see that 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.129
 will allow only branch agreements 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.709
 and like that it will bring already 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:39.939
 with the cream before and it will bring in 

00:05:38.709 --> 00:05:41.979
 really does it'll give a second 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:43.509
 taste and texture really 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.899
 particular much softer little 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.469
 most mellow word then there we see 

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:49.209
 although it is 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.739
 it's very very beautiful lots the end is 

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:54.539
 really very greedy to tidy up 

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:56.619
 strawberries on then calibrated strawberries 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.999
 if you have a 13.1 can calibrate 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:00.779
 it's always better when you like it 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:04.689
 like that lambert tac tac tac 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:07.689
 here and that ends with a small 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:13.330
 whole sentence caramel table of strawberries 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:15.159
 rd a nice texture and the end of january 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.009
 a little bit of strawberries 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.819
 some small chips of pistachios 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.979
 won a little color 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.169
 here is our caramel strawberry pie 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.550
 red sea is over with a pretty 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.490
 caramel red wine a big 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.929
 originality very pretty very good ball 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.929
 aspects as we like it's up to you
