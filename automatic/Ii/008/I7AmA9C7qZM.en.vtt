you do have some good defense um you do

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.060 
you do have some good defense um you do

monitor that I felt like giving you guys
but<00:02:17.790> with<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.120> let's<00:02:18.420> take<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.630> look<00:02:18.870> at<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> set

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
but with that let's take a look at a set

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.110 
but with that let's take a look at a set
that<00:02:19.830> closer<00:02:20.099> can<00:02:20.459> make<00:02:20.610> use<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.819> this

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that closer can make use of this

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.750 
that closer can make use of this
generation<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:22.140> uses<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.770> bunch<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.489> moves

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
generation that uses a bunch of moves

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.270 
generation that uses a bunch of moves
that<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.630> now<00:02:24.810> get<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.349> also<00:02:25.680> some<00:02:26.069> old

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
that it can now get and also some old

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.800 
that it can now get and also some old
ones<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.819> are<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> lot<00:02:27.360> better<00:02:27.540> this

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
ones that are a lot better this

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.020 
ones that are a lot better this
generation<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:29.040> let's<00:02:29.400> take<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.819> look<00:02:29.940> at<00:02:29.970> that

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
generation so let's take a look at that

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.870 
generation so let's take a look at that
right<00:02:30.300> now<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.830> first<00:02:32.069> off<00:02:32.280> with<00:02:32.489> this<00:02:32.670> set

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
right now so first off with this set

right now so first off with this set
we're<00:02:33.360> going<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.660> closed<00:02:33.930> their<00:02:34.110> an

to increase your speed but lower your

to increase your speed but lower your
special<00:02:43.920> attack<00:02:44.239> personally<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.269> would<00:02:45.569> go

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
special attack personally I would go

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.210 
special attack personally I would go
with<00:02:45.720> jolly<00:02:46.080> because<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.620> generally<00:02:47.010> always

take speed over power as for the ability
we're<00:02:50.610> going<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.790> be<00:02:50.910> using<00:02:50.940> skill<00:02:51.540> link<00:02:51.720> even

we're going to be using skill link even

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.449 
we're going to be using skill link even
though<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.319> isn't<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.680> new<00:02:52.799> ability<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.340> it

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
though it isn't a new ability that it

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.340 
though it isn't a new ability that it
gets<00:02:53.640> but<00:02:53.970> because<00:02:54.330> it's<00:02:54.540> an<00:02:54.690> old<00:02:54.870> ability

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
gets but because it's an old ability

that<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.830> said<00:02:56.370> before<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:57.030> very<00:02:57.450> exploitable

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
that I said before is very exploitable

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
give you one more point into that 252

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.000 
give you one more point into that 252
into<00:03:05.730> physical<00:03:06.120> attack<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.019> 252<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.920> de

into physical attack and 252 and de
speed<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.970> give<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.269> either<00:03:09.390> your<00:03:09.720> max<00:03:09.989> or

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
speed to give you either your max or

speed to give you either your max or
your<00:03:10.590> highest<00:03:11.010> possible<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.880> stat<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.810> those

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
your highest possible a stat of those

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.870 
your highest possible a stat of those
two<00:03:13.440> stats<00:03:13.709> depending<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.400> nature<00:03:14.549> that

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
two stats depending on the nature that

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.240 
two stats depending on the nature that
you<00:03:15.000> use<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:16.230> as<00:03:16.319> for<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.590> item<00:03:16.890> we're<00:03:17.130> going

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
you use and as for the item we're going

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.759 
you use and as for the item we're going
to<00:03:17.310> be<00:03:17.430> making<00:03:17.610> use<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.239> white<00:03:18.480> herb<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.049> the

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
to be making use of a white herb and the

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.890 
to be making use of a white herb and the
reasoning<00:03:20.160> for<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.730> because<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:21.690> is

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
reasoning for this is because it is

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.650 
reasoning for this is because it is
going<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.440> be<00:03:22.470> removing<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.579> defense<00:03:24.329> and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
going to be removing the defense and

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.140 
going to be removing the defense and
special<00:03:25.230> defense<00:03:25.680> drop<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.640> get<00:03:26.880> the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
special defense drop that you get the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.270 
special defense drop that you get the
first<00:03:27.329> time<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.900> use<00:03:27.959> shell<00:03:28.590> break<00:03:28.829> which<00:03:29.100> is

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
first time you use shell break which is

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.370 
first time you use shell break which is
the<00:03:29.489> first<00:03:29.700> move<00:03:29.940> in<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.209> set<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.720> if<00:03:31.290> you

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
the first move in the set and if you

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.440 
the first move in the set and if you
don't<00:03:31.650> know<00:03:31.829> she'll<00:03:32.519> break<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:33.090> move<00:03:33.269> that

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
don't know she'll break is a move that

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.390

any defense drops that you could get
with<00:03:50.400> cloister<00:03:50.880> are<00:03:51.120> really<00:03:51.690> bad<00:03:51.900> for<00:03:51.959> it

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
with cloister are really bad for it

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.099 
with cloister are really bad for it
because<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.889> the<00:03:53.040> fact<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.609> you<00:03:54.120> won't<00:03:54.810> last

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
because of the fact that you won't last

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.289 
because of the fact that you won't last
that<00:03:55.440> long<00:03:55.500> in<00:03:55.859> battle<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.400> because<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.239> the

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
that long in battle and because of the

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.360 
that long in battle and because of the
fact<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.810> already<00:03:58.440> take<00:03:58.920> increased

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
fact that you already take increased

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
in if they're on the field so having a

in if they're on the field so having a
white<00:04:03.930> herb<00:04:04.139> is<00:04:04.410> kind<00:04:04.739> of<00:04:04.859> essential<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.579> the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
white herb is kind of essential in the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.940 
white herb is kind of essential in the
set<00:04:06.000> because<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.930> allows<00:04:07.200> cloister<00:04:07.739> to

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
set because it allows cloister to

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.610 
set because it allows cloister to
maintain<00:04:08.519> its<00:04:08.790> defenses<00:04:09.450> even<00:04:10.440> though<00:04:10.560> you

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
maintain its defenses even though you

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.069 
maintain its defenses even though you
know<00:04:10.859> aside<00:04:11.609> from<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:12.090> massive<00:04:12.450> physical

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
know aside from the massive physical

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.890 
know aside from the massive physical
defense<00:04:13.380> aren't<00:04:13.889> that<00:04:14.010> great<00:04:14.299> so<00:04:15.299> it's<00:04:15.630> kind

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
defense aren't that great so it's kind

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.960 
defense aren't that great so it's kind
of<00:04:16.019> really<00:04:16.410> useful<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:17.160> have<00:04:17.250> as<00:04:17.519> your<00:04:17.669> item

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
of really useful to have as your item

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.969 
of really useful to have as your item
even<00:04:18.359> though<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.780> might<00:04:19.019> be<00:04:19.260> tempted<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.680> go

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
even though you might be tempted to go

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.590 
even though you might be tempted to go
for<00:04:20.250> something<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:20.820> gives<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.150> more<00:04:21.359> power

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
for something that gives you more power

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.529 
for something that gives you more power
like<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.019> life<00:04:22.289> orb<00:04:22.530> but<00:04:23.430> since<00:04:23.880> again<00:04:24.210> you<00:04:24.419> are

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
like a life orb but since again you are

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.170 
like a life orb but since again you are

spheres based power was only ten but in

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.830 
spheres based power was only ten but in
this<00:04:53.470> generation<00:04:53.890> it<00:04:54.250> was<00:04:54.460> boosted<00:04:54.940> to<00:04:55.210> 25

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
this generation it was boosted to 25

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.040 
this generation it was boosted to 25
meaning<00:04:56.770> that<00:04:56.920> this<00:04:57.100> move<00:04:57.340> has<00:04:57.610> got<00:04:57.940> in<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.810> lot

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.320 
meaning that this move has got in a lot
power<00:04:59.350> or<00:04:59.620> a<00:04:59.680> lot<00:04:59.860> more<00:04:59.980> powerful<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.670> can<00:05:01.120> get

power or a lot more powerful and can get
a<00:05:01.360> lot<00:05:01.660> more<00:05:01.720> use<00:05:02.200> on<00:05:02.440> cloister<00:05:03.220> because<00:05:03.610> of

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
a lot more use on cloister because of

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.480 
a lot more use on cloister because of
skill<00:05:04.000> link<00:05:04.210> and<00:05:04.420> stab<00:05:04.990> and<00:05:05.350> increased<00:05:06.250> power

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
skill link and stab and increased power

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.520 
skill link and stab and increased power
so<00:05:07.210> that<00:05:07.360> is<00:05:07.510> one<00:05:07.690> amazing<00:05:07.960> thing<00:05:08.230> about

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
so that is one amazing thing about

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.920 
so that is one amazing thing about
icicle<00:05:09.040> spirit<00:05:09.370> this<00:05:09.490> generation<00:05:10.030> along<00:05:10.870> with

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
icicle spirit this generation along with

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.480 
icicle spirit this generation along with
that<00:05:11.080> though<00:05:11.440> we're<00:05:11.710> going<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:11.920> be<00:05:12.010> using<00:05:12.040> rock

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
that though we're going to be using rock

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.980 
that though we're going to be using rock
blast<00:05:12.790> which<00:05:13.120> was<00:05:13.300> pretty<00:05:13.450> common<00:05:13.930> on

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
blast which was pretty common on

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.350 
blast which was pretty common on
cloister<00:05:14.500> previously<00:05:15.160> but<00:05:15.640> it's<00:05:16.090> still<00:05:16.300> very

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
cloister previously but it's still very

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.960 
cloister previously but it's still very
useful<00:05:17.140> because<00:05:17.320> it's<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.860> rock<00:05:18.070> move<00:05:18.340> of<00:05:18.550> 25

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
useful because it's a rock move of 25

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.510 
useful because it's a rock move of 25
based<00:05:19.270> power<00:05:19.450> that<00:05:20.140> hits<00:05:20.710> five<00:05:20.920> times<00:05:21.250> with

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
based power that hits five times with

based power that hits five times with
skill<00:05:21.790> link<00:05:22.000> and<00:05:22.210> gives<00:05:22.930> you<00:05:23.080> some<00:05:23.350> more<00:05:23.500> type

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
skill link and gives you some more type

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.010 
skill link and gives you some more type
coverage<00:05:24.130> and<00:05:24.700> lastly<00:05:25.360> we're<00:05:25.720> going<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:25.930> be

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
coverage and lastly we're going to be

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.960 
coverage and lastly we're going to be
using<00:05:26.050> shell<00:05:26.590> blade<00:05:26.890> which<00:05:27.160> is<00:05:27.340> another<00:05:27.640> new

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
using shell blade which is another new

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.850 
using shell blade which is another new
move<00:05:28.210> that<00:05:28.450> cloister<00:05:28.870> gets<00:05:29.080> this<00:05:29.260> generation

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
move that cloister gets this generation

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.950 
move that cloister gets this generation
and<00:05:29.980> something<00:05:30.580> that<00:05:30.730> it<00:05:30.880> has<00:05:31.030> always<00:05:31.270> really

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
and something that it has always really

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.710 
and something that it has always really
needed<00:05:32.320> because<00:05:32.890> cloister<00:05:33.520> did<00:05:33.820> not<00:05:34.000> have<00:05:34.360> any

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
needed because cloister did not have any

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.800 
needed because cloister did not have any
powerful<00:05:35.610> physical<00:05:36.610> water<00:05:36.880> type<00:05:37.180> stab<00:05:37.480> moves

to<00:05:37.990> use<00:05:38.230> until<00:05:39.070> shell<00:05:39.340> blade<00:05:39.610> came<00:05:40.090> out<00:05:40.330> this

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
to use until shell blade came out this

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.660 
to use until shell blade came out this
generation<00:05:41.110> so<00:05:41.770> that<00:05:41.800> is<00:05:42.100> something<00:05:42.250> that<00:05:42.460> is

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
generation so that is something that is

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.210 
generation so that is something that is
really<00:05:43.030> great<00:05:43.480> uncoy<00:05:44.020> stir<00:05:44.260> and<00:05:44.500> can<00:05:44.680> give<00:05:45.070> it

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
really great uncoy stir and can give it

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.860 
really great uncoy stir and can give it
some<00:05:45.490> better<00:05:45.700> type<00:05:45.940> coverage<00:05:46.390> and<00:05:46.630> allow<00:05:46.840> it

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
some better type coverage and allow it

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.870 
some better type coverage and allow it
to<00:05:47.050> hit<00:05:47.260> steel<00:05:47.590> types<00:05:47.890> which<00:05:48.190> it<00:05:48.370> can't<00:05:48.640> with

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
and if it resists it obviously you can

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
go with rock blast but in the case of

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.050 
go with rock blast but in the case of
something<00:06:20.950> else<00:06:21.100> that<00:06:21.310> resists<00:06:21.670> both<00:06:21.850> of

something else that resists both of

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
those shell blade is another option but

those shell blade is another option but
anything<00:06:24.940> that<00:06:24.970> doesn't<00:06:25.330> resist<00:06:25.690> icicle

spirit<00:06:26.590> will<00:06:26.740> pretty<00:06:27.070> much<00:06:27.160> be<00:06:28.080> ko'd<00:06:29.340> after

spirit will pretty much be ko'd after

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.390 
spirit will pretty much be ko'd after
you<00:06:30.520> shell<00:06:30.760> break<00:06:31.000> and<00:06:31.330> that<00:06:31.930> goes<00:06:32.590> for<00:06:32.980> the

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
you shell break and that goes for the

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.980 
you shell break and that goes for the
majority<00:06:33.730> of<00:06:33.970> the<00:06:34.210> Pokemon<00:06:34.660> that<00:06:34.840> you're

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
majority of the Pokemon that you're

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.690 
majority of the Pokemon that you're
going<00:06:35.080> to<00:06:35.140> be<00:06:35.230> encountering<00:06:35.860> this<00:06:36.070> generation

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
going to be encountering this generation

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.100 
going to be encountering this generation
and<00:06:36.910> I'm<00:06:37.030> not<00:06:37.180> even<00:06:37.210> kidding<00:06:37.570> about<00:06:37.810> that<00:06:37.980> so

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
and I'm not even kidding about that so

and I'm not even kidding about that so
this<00:06:39.350> is<00:06:39.530> probably<00:06:39.770> something<00:06:40.160> that<00:06:40.490> makes

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
this is probably something that makes

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.210 
this is probably something that makes
