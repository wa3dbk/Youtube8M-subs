we sampled the body of the hose is made

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.410 
we sampled the body of the hose is made
from<00:01:29.380> vinyl<00:01:30.009> material<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.999> contains

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
hose that I'd point out is there's also

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.690 
hose that I'd point out is there's also
brass<00:01:36.700> fittings<00:01:37.329> and<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:38.439> high<00:01:38.979> percentage<00:01:39.249> of

brass fittings and a high percentage of

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.879 
brass fittings and a high percentage of
the<00:01:39.789> hoses<00:01:40.119> we<00:01:40.270> tested<00:01:40.749> actually<00:01:41.200> contained<00:01:41.649> a

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:41.889 
the hoses we tested actually contained a

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:45.480 
the hoses we tested actually contained a
lot<00:01:42.729> of<00:01:42.880> lead<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.710> we<00:01:44.829> know<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:44.979> phthalate

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
lot of lead so we know that phthalate

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.330 
lot of lead so we know that phthalate
plasticizers<00:01:45.520> are<00:01:46.420> used<00:01:46.749> in<00:01:47.020> hose<00:01:47.439> material

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
plasticizers are used in hose material

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.999 
plasticizers are used in hose material
our<00:01:48.789> question<00:01:49.090> was<00:01:49.509> do<00:01:49.899> these<00:01:50.079> plasticizers

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
our question was do these plasticizers

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.249 
our question was do these plasticizers
actually<00:01:51.369> migrate<00:01:51.789> into<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.090> water<00:01:52.420> we<00:01:53.079> did

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
actually migrate into the water we did

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.620 
actually migrate into the water we did
an<00:01:53.350> experiment<00:01:53.770> where<00:01:54.100> we<00:01:54.219> actually<00:01:54.819> put

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
an experiment where we actually put

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.359 
an experiment where we actually put

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
part of that is creating a really

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.960 
part of that is creating a really
healthy<00:02:39.440> soil<00:02:39.800> ecosystem<00:02:40.400> which<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.850> the
