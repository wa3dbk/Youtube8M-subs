because I'm homeschooling my daughter

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
because I'm homeschooling my daughter
and<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.350> son<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:16.979> two<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.220> them<00:01:17.400> so

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and my son it's just two of them so

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.039 
and my son it's just two of them so

still think that it's really good for
homeschooling<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.380> again<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.430> printable

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
my last video

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.490 
my last video
the<00:01:38.880> other<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.900> didn't<00:01:40.080> feel<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.320> doing

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
the other I just didn't feel like doing

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.929 
the other I just didn't feel like doing
it<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.189> always<00:01:41.430> make<00:01:41.670> your<00:01:41.729> own

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it but you can always make your own

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.480 
it but you can always make your own
cover<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.420> want<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.080> but<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.070> chose<00:01:44.430> to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
cover if you want to but I just chose to

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.580 
cover if you want to but I just chose to
stick<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:44.970> hers<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.450> super<00:01:46.020> cute<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
stick with hers because super cute and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.770 
stick with hers because super cute and
it<00:01:47.220> follows<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> theme<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.210> all<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> dividers

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it follows the theme of all the dividers

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.679 
it follows the theme of all the dividers
so<00:01:49.350> anyway<00:01:50.280> again<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.970> got<00:01:51.119> these<00:01:51.299> dividers

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
so anyway again I got these dividers

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
that in but that's what the majority of

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.210 
that in but that's what the majority of
my<00:03:44.430> planner<00:03:44.700> is

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
my planner is

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.400

this so they'll just be full weeks
filled<00:03:47.920> out<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.370> again<00:03:48.820> like<00:03:49.240> I<00:03:49.450> had<00:03:49.690> showed

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
filled out and again like I had showed

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.140 
filled out and again like I had showed
in<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.770> previous<00:03:51.160> video<00:03:51.430> I'm<00:03:51.670> using<00:03:51.700> a

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
in the previous video I'm using a

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.050 
in the previous video I'm using a
thicker<00:03:52.570> type<00:03:53.110> of<00:03:53.350> paper<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:54.070> I<00:03:54.460> will<00:03:54.670> link<00:03:54.880> to

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
thicker type of paper and I will link to

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.270 
thicker type of paper and I will link to
it<00:03:55.240> but<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.750> allows<00:03:55.960> me<00:03:55.990> to<00:03:56.290> print<00:03:57.070> on<00:03:57.250> both

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
it but it allows me to print on both

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.360 
it but it allows me to print on both
sides<00:03:57.490> and<00:03:58.240> it<00:03:58.480> doesn't<00:03:58.840> bleed<00:03:59.140> through<00:03:59.620> so

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
sides and it doesn't bleed through so

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.530 
sides and it doesn't bleed through so
that<00:04:00.700> way<00:04:01.420> I<00:04:01.450> can<00:04:01.600> save<00:04:01.960> some<00:04:02.200> trees<00:04:02.760> anyway<00:04:03.760> so

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
that way I can save some trees anyway so

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.900 
that way I can save some trees anyway so
I<00:04:04.900> have<00:04:05.200> these<00:04:05.350> tabs<00:04:05.680> just<00:04:05.830> breaking<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.550> up<00:04:06.640> by

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
is that two there maybe one more and I

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.590 
is that two there maybe one more and I
think<00:05:12.190> here<00:05:12.340> is<00:05:12.490> I<00:05:12.669> think<00:05:12.880> it's<00:05:13.000> full<00:05:13.300> of

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600

think here is I think it's full of
apples<00:05:14.200> but<00:05:14.919> I<00:05:15.669> think<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:16.690> might<00:05:16.810> have<00:05:16.960> used<00:05:17.140> up

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
apples but I think I might have used up

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.960 
apples but I think I might have used up
too<00:05:17.440> much<00:05:17.470> ink<00:05:17.890> I<00:05:18.040> could<00:05:18.250> be<00:05:18.370> wrong<00:05:18.550> so<00:05:18.940> don't

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
too much ink I could be wrong so don't

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.300 
too much ink I could be wrong so don't
take<00:05:19.210> it<00:05:19.270> take<00:05:20.020> my<00:05:20.200> word<00:05:20.380> for<00:05:20.410> that<00:05:20.710> but<00:05:20.950> at

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
take it take my word for that but at

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.469 
take it take my word for that but at
least<00:05:21.490> these<00:05:21.790> two<00:05:22.030> I<00:05:22.090> thought<00:05:22.300> were<00:05:22.450> really

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
least these two I thought were really

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.350
