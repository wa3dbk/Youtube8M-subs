this<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.980> I'm<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:20.880> kind<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.210> confusing

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
this to I'm just it's kind of confusing

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.359 
this to I'm just it's kind of confusing
because<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.990> first<00:00:22.199> two<00:00:22.380> galaxies<00:00:22.920> have

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
because the first two galaxies have

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.490 
because the first two galaxies have
secret<00:00:23.789> stars<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.240> cannot<00:00:24.539> get<00:00:24.779> until<00:00:25.109> much

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
secret stars you cannot get until much

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.460 
secret stars you cannot get until much
later<00:00:25.789> or<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:26.939> least<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.480> little<00:00:28.230> bit<00:00:28.439> later<00:00:30.470> doo

doo doo doo doo and actually I forgot to
mention<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.290> has<00:00:37.559> some<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.980> my

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
mention it but this it has some of my

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.410 
mention it but this it has some of my
favorite<00:00:38.579> music<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.120> any<00:00:39.300> galaxy<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:41.420> think

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
favorite music in any galaxy I think

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.180 
favorite music in any galaxy I think
it's<00:00:42.570> only<00:00:42.750> galaxy<00:00:43.320> music<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:43.800> still<00:00:44.010> my

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
it's only galaxy music that's still my

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.990 
it's only galaxy music that's still my
favorites<00:00:44.640> list<00:00:44.730> after<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:46.340> proved<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.550> but

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
favorites list after I proved it but

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.760 
favorites list after I proved it but
when<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.210> soundtrack<00:00:49.110> first<00:00:49.410> came<00:00:49.590> out<00:00:49.710> I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
when the soundtrack first came out I

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.630 
when the soundtrack first came out I
just<00:00:49.829> favorited<00:00:50.250> everything<00:00:52.219> and<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.399> time

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
just favorited everything and this time

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.889 
just favorited everything and this time
the<00:00:53.789> pool<00:00:53.969> stars<00:00:54.300> take<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> an

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the pool stars take you to an

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.389 
the pool stars take you to an
interesting<00:00:55.350> plan<00:00:55.530> instead<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.070> land<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
interesting plan instead of the land of

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.240 
interesting plan instead of the land of
dumb<00:00:56.640> globes<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.360> apparently<00:00:58.350> somehow

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
dumb globes and apparently somehow

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.420 
dumb globes and apparently somehow
gravity<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.910> still<00:01:00.059> stronger<00:01:00.570> away<00:01:00.870> from<00:01:01.079> this

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
gravity is still stronger away from this

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.740 
gravity is still stronger away from this
yet<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.550> has<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> same<00:01:03.030> gravity<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:03.539> some<00:01:03.660> on

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
yet it has the same gravity with some on

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.320 
yet it has the same gravity with some on
it<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.140> anyway<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.920> farm<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> bunch<00:01:06.119> of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
it so anyway you can farm for a bunch of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.039 
it so anyway you can farm for a bunch of
tasty<00:01:06.930> star<00:01:07.229> bits<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> depressing

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
tasty star bits to get a depressing

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.880 
tasty star bits to get a depressing

which<00:01:14.760> i<00:01:14.939> think<00:01:15.000> i<00:01:15.210> will<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.720> get<00:01:15.869> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
which i think i will do just get that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
which i think i will do just get that
out<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> way<00:01:16.320> i<00:01:18.619> might<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.740> needed<00:01:19.890> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
out of the way i might have needed to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.950 
out of the way i might have needed to
collect<00:01:20.250> some<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.729> away<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.450> i<00:01:21.659> don't

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
collect some one away here but i don't

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.810 
collect some one away here but i don't
really<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:23.130> there<00:01:23.460> are<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> lot

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
really think so because there are a lot

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.820 
really think so because there are a lot
down<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.170> even<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.380> kind<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.650> confusing

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
down here even if it's kind of confusing

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.149 
down here even if it's kind of confusing
to<00:01:26.430> look<00:01:27.030> at<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.930> down

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
to look at and down

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.140 
to look at and down
to<00:01:30.159> say<00:01:30.369> they<00:01:30.520> did<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.670> really<00:01:30.729> good<00:01:31.090> job

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
to say they did a really good job

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.469 
to say they did a really good job
keeping<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.290> movement<00:01:33.130> feeling<00:01:33.850> natural

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
keeping the movement feeling natural

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.100 
keeping the movement feeling natural
even<00:01:35.110> though<00:01:35.259> you're<00:01:35.470> on<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.799> sphere<00:01:36.040> I<00:01:36.400> mean

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
even though you're on a sphere I mean

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.719 
even though you're on a sphere I mean
non<00:01:38.110> spheres<00:01:38.590> don't<00:01:38.920> work<00:01:39.100> so<00:01:39.310> well<00:01:39.340> but<00:01:39.610> this

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
non spheres don't work so well but this

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.840 
non spheres don't work so well but this
is<00:01:39.940> actually<00:01:40.270> really<00:01:40.299> nice<00:01:41.850> actually

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
is actually really nice actually

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.149 
is actually really nice actually
surprising<00:01:43.689> because<00:01:43.840> most<00:01:44.740> other<00:01:45.040> times

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
surprising because most other times

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.609 
surprising because most other times
games<00:01:45.850> have<00:01:46.060> attempted<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.630> wonky<00:01:46.930> gravity

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
games have attempted that wonky gravity

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.550 
games have attempted that wonky gravity
cough<00:01:47.860> sonic<00:01:48.340> cough<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:49.090> whoops<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.140> forgot<00:01:50.170> to

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
cough sonic cough and whoops I forgot to

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.130 
cough sonic cough and whoops I forgot to
get<00:01:50.680> starving<00:01:51.100> trim<00:01:51.280> it<00:01:51.399> because<00:01:51.909> I<00:01:52.270> forgot

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
get starving trim it because I forgot

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.950 
get starving trim it because I forgot
your<00:01:53.380> star<00:01:53.649> bitch<00:01:53.860> from<00:01:54.009> it<00:01:54.190> but<00:01:54.460> um<00:01:54.840> once<00:01:55.840> the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
your star bitch from it but um once the

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.600 
your star bitch from it but um once the
time<00:01:56.170> when<00:01:56.289> games<00:01:56.500> try<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:56.890> do<00:01:57.310> weird<00:01:57.549> stuff

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
time when games try to do weird stuff

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.950 
time when games try to do weird stuff
with<00:01:57.909> gravity<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.420> acts<00:01:58.770> really<00:01:59.770> weird<00:02:00.130> but

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
with gravity it acts really weird but

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.389 
with gravity it acts really weird but
this<00:02:01.960> is<00:02:02.259> definitely<00:02:02.500> polished<00:02:03.100> with<00:02:03.250> what

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
this is definitely polished with what

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.999 
this is definitely polished with what
they<00:02:03.520> did<00:02:03.670> do<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:03.970> it<00:02:04.119> so<00:02:04.509> i<00:02:04.960> guess<00:02:05.619> i<00:02:05.770> can

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
they did do to it so i guess i can

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.940 
they did do to it so i guess i can

only occurs here but you can get one ups

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.640 
only occurs here but you can get one ups

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.320 
like in classic Mario for doing for
jumping<00:04:30.220> on<00:04:30.310> a<00:04:30.340> bunch<00:04:30.520> of<00:04:30.639> goombahs<00:04:30.850> it<00:04:31.090> once

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
jumping on a bunch of goombahs it once

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.110 
jumping on a bunch of goombahs it once
and<00:04:31.510> it's<00:04:32.040> easier<00:04:33.040> is<00:04:33.160> Luigi<00:04:33.610> but<00:04:33.790> it's<00:04:33.940> still

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
and it's easier is Luigi but it's still

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.760 
and it's easier is Luigi but it's still
too<00:04:34.450> hard<00:04:34.690> for<00:04:34.750> me<00:04:36.930> mostly<00:04:37.930> because<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.590> don't

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
too hard for me mostly because I don't

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.620 
too hard for me mostly because I don't
care<00:04:38.979> about<00:04:39.100> one<00:04:39.400> ups<00:04:39.580> or<00:04:39.790> whatever<00:04:40.210> potential

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
care about one ups or whatever potential

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.909 
care about one ups or whatever potential
reward<00:04:41.139> you<00:04:41.260> get<00:04:41.410> for<00:04:41.680> this<00:04:43.139> what<00:04:44.139> I<00:04:44.380> was<00:04:44.710> the

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
reward you get for this what I was the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
mightiest been I don't you don't want me

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.719 
mightiest been I don't you don't want me
to<00:04:47.080> spin<00:04:47.320> don't<00:04:47.800> spin<00:04:48.070> when<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.340> want<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.610> to

to spin don't spin when I want you to
spend<00:04:48.970> game<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:50.500> is<00:04:50.620> rather<00:04:50.889> vexing<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:55.270> also

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
spend game it is rather vexing and also

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.090 
spend game it is rather vexing and also
why<00:04:55.690> do<00:04:55.750> you<00:04:55.870> collide<00:04:56.139> with<00:04:56.320> walls<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.889> stuff

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
why do you collide with walls and stuff

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.469 
why do you collide with walls and stuff
when<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.340> don't<00:04:57.580> want<00:04:57.729> you<00:04:57.850> to<00:04:58.000> but<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:58.210> can't

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
when I don't want you to but you can't

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.730 
when I don't want you to but you can't
collide<00:04:58.750> with<00:04:58.900> a<00:04:58.960> deal<00:04:59.139> but<00:04:59.320> when<00:04:59.440> I<00:04:59.500> want<00:04:59.650> you

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
collide with a deal but when I want you

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.010 

right<00:05:06.539> and<00:05:07.539> now<00:05:07.810> this<00:05:08.800> weird<00:05:09.220> I<00:05:09.910> think<00:05:10.720> it's<00:05:10.870> a

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
right and now this weird I think it's a

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.020 
right and now this weird I think it's a

to say despite the package of me like 10

that galaxy for now but we will be done
for<00:05:38.139> it<00:05:38.229> for<00:05:38.410> quite<00:05:38.740> a<00:05:38.800> while<00:05:39.040> after<00:05:39.729> this<00:05:40.830> all

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
for it for quite a while after this all

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.560 
for it for quite a while after this all
right<00:05:43.260> I'll<00:05:44.260> save<00:05:44.770> just<00:05:45.250> in<00:05:45.400> case<00:05:45.669> power

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
right I'll save just in case power

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.510 
right I'll save just in case power
outage<00:05:47.020> returns<00:05:47.380> and<00:05:47.650> it<00:05:47.710> doesn't<00:05:48.040> feel<00:05:48.250> quite

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
outage returns and it doesn't feel quite

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.270 
outage returns and it doesn't feel quite
as<00:05:48.639> generous<00:05:49.510> to<00:05:49.750> my<00:05:49.900> we<00:05:50.139> which<00:05:51.010> somehow

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
as generous to my we which somehow

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.110 
as generous to my we which somehow
survived<00:05:52.240> it<00:05:52.570> when<00:05:52.810> my<00:05:52.960> computer<00:05:53.139> didn't

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
survived it when my computer didn't

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.640 
survived it when my computer didn't
because<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.270> computer<00:05:55.720> was<00:05:55.930> thinking<00:05:56.440> about

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
because the computer was thinking about

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.350 
because the computer was thinking about
for<00:05:56.950> stuff<00:05:57.250> below<00:05:57.520> he<00:05:57.669> was<00:05:57.970> the<00:05:58.150> way<00:05:58.240> it<00:05:58.330> was

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
for stuff below he was the way it was

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.480 
for stuff below he was the way it was
just<00:05:58.570> basically<00:05:58.720> like<00:06:01.889> I'm<00:06:02.889> pretty<00:06:03.130> sure<00:06:03.370> it

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
just basically like I'm pretty sure it

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.219 
just basically like I'm pretty sure it
doesn't<00:06:03.760> actually<00:06:03.880> require<00:06:04.150> any<00:06:04.630> power<00:06:04.870> and

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
doesn't actually require any power and

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.520 
doesn't actually require any power and
that's<00:06:05.350> just<00:06:05.560> like<00:06:05.860> a<00:06:06.930> scheme<00:06:07.930> to<00:06:08.110> give<00:06:08.320> you<00:06:08.410> to

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
that's just like a scheme to give you to

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.409 
that's just like a scheme to give you to
waste<00:06:08.710> electricity<00:06:09.250> by<00:06:09.700> feeding<00:06:10.000> it<00:06:10.150> into<00:06:10.210> the

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
waste electricity by feeding it into the

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.450 
waste electricity by feeding it into the
Wii<00:06:10.570> or<00:06:10.600> maybe<00:06:11.169> i<00:06:11.260> just<00:06:11.290> i<00:06:11.620> think<00:06:12.010> the<00:06:12.100> sensor

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
Wii or maybe i just i think the sensor

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.770 
Wii or maybe i just i think the sensor
bar<00:06:12.639> needs<00:06:12.820> the<00:06:13.000> power<00:06:13.150> but<00:06:13.389> not<00:06:13.510> that<00:06:13.660> we

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
bar needs the power but not that we

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.530 
bar needs the power but not that we
