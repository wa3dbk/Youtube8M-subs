most
no<00:00:31.380> x-men<00:00:31.949> isn't<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.460> blow<00:00:32.520> people<00:00:32.850> away

no x-men isn't going to blow people away
for<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.329> oddness<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> mean<00:00:34.230> but

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
for this oddness you know I mean but

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.500 
for this oddness you know I mean but
it's<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.340> does<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.149> think<00:00:36.390> it's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it's but it does have I think it's

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.650 
it's but it does have I think it's
riskier<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.190> catching<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.239> then

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
riskier and it's catching it and then

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.400 
riskier and it's catching it and then
it's<00:00:40.280> humor<00:00:41.280> then<00:00:41.879> other<00:00:42.510> x-men<00:00:42.840> movies<00:00:43.260> have

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
it's humor then other x-men movies have

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.590 
it's humor then other x-men movies have
been<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:43.680> till<00:00:43.829> now<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.000> think<00:00:45.239> that's

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
been up till now and I think that's

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
been up till now and I think that's
that's<00:00:45.960> really<00:00:46.079> don't<00:00:46.410> leave<00:00:46.530> em<00:00:46.680> letting

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
that's really don't leave em letting

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.479 
that's really don't leave em letting
that<00:00:47.700> happen<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:49.219> sometimes<00:00:50.219> stuff

all these wonderful films before but

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.520 
all these wonderful films before but

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
and that's a really strange talent

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.330 
and that's a really strange talent
because<00:02:26.819> I<00:02:26.940> didn't<00:02:27.209> sort<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.110> didn't<00:02:28.410> pin<00:02:29.220> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
because I didn't sort of I didn't pin it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.530 
because I didn't sort of I didn't pin it
down<00:02:29.370> when<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:29.880> first<00:02:30.150> started<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:30.480> the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
down when I first started in the

down when I first started in the
business<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.840> took<00:02:30.959> me<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.080> good<00:02:31.380> few<00:02:31.530> years<00:02:31.620> to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
business it took me a good few years to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.650 
business it took me a good few years to
realize<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.430> or<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.180> see<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.510> and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660
