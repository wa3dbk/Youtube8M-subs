00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
all the reason I really did this is

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.270 
all the reason I really did this is
because<00:03:43.420> I<00:03:43.870> always<00:03:44.109> tweak<00:03:44.349> out<00:03:44.499> and<00:03:44.799> diet<00:03:44.920> dad

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
because I always tweak out and diet dad

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.390 
because I always tweak out and diet dad
because<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:46.060> get<00:03:46.480> nervous<00:03:46.629> like<00:03:47.499> okay<00:03:48.189> I<00:03:48.219> take

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
because I get nervous like okay I take

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.640 
because I get nervous like okay I take
an<00:03:48.549> hour<00:03:48.730> getting<00:03:48.999> here<00:03:49.359> can<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.049> do<00:03:50.109> it<00:03:50.200> and

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
an hour getting here can I do it and

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.709 
an hour getting here can I do it and
then<00:03:50.799> healers<00:03:51.760> come<00:03:51.969> i<00:03:51.999> miss<00:03:52.239> a<00:03:52.269> price<00:03:52.540> which

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:52.719 
then healers come i miss a price which

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.929 
then healers come i miss a price which
if<00:03:52.870> they<00:03:52.989> die<00:03:53.139> so<00:03:54.040> figured<00:03:54.310> why<00:03:54.430> not<00:03:54.459> him<00:03:54.760> do<00:03:54.909> it

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
if they die so figured why not him do it
