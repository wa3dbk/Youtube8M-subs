00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 all dear friends with you and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.910
 maracasi and you watch the show chic 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.040
 position issue 63 and first 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.980
 location is on map 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.880
 sandy river in head-on mode 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.520
 square c7 and here it is worth going on the tank 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.570
 with a strong tower and good angles 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:29.010
 vertical guidance for example t29 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.289
 t32 and so on thanks to the fact that you 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.440
 you are a bit higher 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.360
 a little better from here you can shoot 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.120
 nearby opponents 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.390
 Well, and besides, you will break through extremely 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.430
 difficult and you can quite a long time here 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.110
 be 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.410
 the only thing that can shoot through 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.410
 orton is if you move after 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.260
 each shot then maybe not even 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.980
 can you get on the whole not 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.620
 static and for american tank 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.880
 quite fit and personally I would have experienced 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.010
 this position may not be the tpm 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:12.479
 heaped but rather effective 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.240
 and if you want an unusual position then 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.820
 I have this for you it's true 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.950
 a bit risky and but basically in 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.530
 some situations and its quite possible 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.560
 apply effectively and so you 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.900
 need light on medium tank and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.049
 if there is nobody in the courtyard then 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.829
 climb up this ruined 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.320
 home and from here you already stick out and 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.689
 shoot enemies that are 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.880
 near, in principle, I think you can even 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.280
 tower and trump it but mostly 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.460
 This place is suitable but when 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.829
 opponents are distracted for example there your 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.920
 allies attack and you are there on the easy 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.530
 the tank begins to fire their side and in 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.509
 forage thereby Prague simply can not 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.670
 react and if they still 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.140
 keep warm on you to you can very 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.899
 quickly hide here 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.960
 the whole place is original in my very 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.849
 even quite good 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.310
 love to play aggressive on average 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.470
 tanker prefer themselves to go and 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.930
 highlight yourself deal damage 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.739
 own light then it's a tactic 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.640
 for you 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.400
 drive to e8 square on erlenberg map and 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.680
 here you can highlight opponents and 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.989
 shoot them besides here 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.090
 rather hilly terrain and therefore 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.220
 you can tank the tower 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.160
 no doubt this tactic is very 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.220
 risky but it only allows you 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.430
 actively influence the course of the battle since you are here 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.920
 highlight opponents damage them 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.129
 most season agrit and unpleasant and on 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.430
 yourself and not particularly experienced opponents go 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.190
 right on you want to destroy you and in 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.170
 end up being substituted and dying under 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.099
 shots of your allies 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.610
 Well, of course, be them, too, and in 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:05.300
 general tactics are quite interesting 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.030
 which are pretty dangerous further we go 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.840
 position for sniper lovers on 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.030
 Ny map in square d 4 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.210
 climb on this pile of debris and here 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.940
 you can shoot like a sniper through here 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.520
 these are the windows passing by in the center 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.730
 tanks are pretty simple 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:28.640
 after the light you can move down 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.820
 if opponents shoot at you also 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.220
 if you have a strong tower if you are on 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.370
 heavy tank of course you can 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.520
 ok see botan down in general then 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.980
 the place is great allows you to well damage 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.950
 in some cases, even opponents 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.140
 to aggro on you and trying to somehow you 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.930
 punch but this is just for you and 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.830
 allows even more damage in general 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.070
 just super then we have interesting 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.040
 the place on the map of El Halluf squared a3 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.489
 and it is great for not very 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.370
 tall tanks with a solid tower for example 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.450
 yes yes there are 3 pin is even better for three 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.060
 fours or 30 brisk you can here 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.150
 so that way roll out fast 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.820
 follow the opponent on shoot and then 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.910
 hiding while enemies see only 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.979
 one tower and it will be extremely difficult for you 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.300
 punch so you can here quite 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:31.400
 stay long and that way 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.669
 damage and damage the enemy 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.910
 tower but naturally your fun can 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:41.180
 interrupt art she calmly pulls out 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.400
 can't throw you right in the stern it 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.740
 it will be naturally very unpleasant 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.310
 so you should always go if the arts 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.320
 no, and so we continue 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.960
 dizzying position further with us 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.919
 goes hard to reach position on 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.480
 bullfighting map in g8 square where it stands 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.960
 go fast cars 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.630
 and also help allies yes 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.570
 I agree that it is very difficult here 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.420
 climb and few will help in 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.170
 most cases but if you can 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.400
 come here then this is the perfect place for 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.320
 small tanks with good angles 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.240
 vertical guidance 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.490
 because you can like this 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.070
 lean out shoot some 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.160
 opponents when he's on you keep warm you 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.730
 here it is easy to hide and do not get damage 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.520
 in reply 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.480
 you can also drive a little further 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.700
 above and from there you can even shoot through 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.470
 enemy base as well as opponents 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.840
 which 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.210
 zanykali here beside in general interesting 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.340
 location position is really possible 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.220
 do a lot of things useful for 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:54.330
 teams he but call here of course 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:59.100
 extremely difficult but I think who wants that 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:01.710
 it will make the course and lastly at 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.810
 I have a very cool position for you 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.930
 on the map the robin in the square 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.960
 HR-1 you need fast lungs 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.760
 medium tanks to cheerfully 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.160
 shine here 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.950
 You break the boat that you were lucky and well 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.310
 then everything just pokes out the spa candles 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:23.100
 get out foes and hide and your 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.710
 allies do the rest of the work then 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.520
 there is damage by the enemy and they give you 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.350
 for this honestly earned experience 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.690
 surely the most arrogant opponent will go 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.440
 right here to punish you 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:40.080
 but it will let him down your allies 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.000
 disassemble it already on the way that there is such 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.060
 wonderful stone for which you 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.640
 be able to hide from also uneven 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.370
 terrain and in general 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.860
 opponent fable get you 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.980
 shine until there is anyone here 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:59.700
 will not stay and you calmly you play 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:02.730
 fight and get a lot of experience and all the woman 

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:05.130
 will be worn in yours but at the end for sure 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.890
 will come the most evil boss who 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.180
 wants to drown you but you give him 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.090
 nose and 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:15.000
