a<00:03:18.370> bad<00:03:18.430> choice<00:03:18.690> some<00:03:19.690> people<00:03:19.960> I<00:03:20.020> could<00:03:20.080> see

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
a bad choice some people I could see

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.020 
a bad choice some people I could see
maybe<00:03:20.530> not<00:03:21.040> going<00:03:21.370> all<00:03:21.490> the<00:03:21.520> way<00:03:21.610> through<00:03:21.910> this

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
maybe not going all the way through this

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.380 
maybe not going all the way through this
movie<00:03:22.390> but<00:03:23.050> I<00:03:23.350> think<00:03:23.740> it<00:03:23.830> would<00:03:23.920> be<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.040> mistake

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
movie but I think it would be a mistake

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.150 
movie but I think it would be a mistake
I<00:03:25.390> really<00:03:26.080> like<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.470> focus<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:27.040> know<00:03:27.130> I

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
I really like the focus you know I

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.370 
I really like the focus you know I
talked<00:03:27.460> about<00:03:27.550> in<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.940> open<00:03:28.240> on<00:03:28.450> father's<00:03:29.020> and

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
talked about in the open on father's and

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.250 
talked about in the open on father's and
not<00:03:29.740> only<00:03:29.980> just<00:03:30.190> father's<00:03:30.910> but<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.780> emotional

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
not only just father's but the emotional

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.650 
not only just father's but the emotional
toll<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.680> being<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.040> like<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.580> real<00:03:33.880> guy<00:03:34.120> guy<00:03:34.510> in

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
toll of being a like a real guy guy in

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.360 
toll of being a like a real guy guy in
real<00:03:34.840> life<00:03:35.020> I<00:03:35.230> think<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.620> know<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.250> that's

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
real life I think you know and that's

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.530 
real life I think you know and that's
something<00:03:36.790> obviously<00:03:36.910> I<00:03:37.210> don't<00:03:37.480> know

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
something obviously I don't know

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.440 
something obviously I don't know
anything<00:03:37.870> about<00:03:37.990> but<00:03:38.830> you<00:03:39.400> know<00:03:39.490> I'm<00:03:39.640> not<00:03:40.180> even

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
anything about but you know I'm not even

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.000 
anything about but you know I'm not even
from<00:03:40.600> popular<00:03:40.990> culture<00:03:41.020> I<00:03:41.380> think<00:03:41.590> it's<00:03:41.710> rarely

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
from popular culture I think it's rarely

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.790 
from popular culture I think it's rarely
explored<00:03:42.550> I<00:03:42.970> think<00:03:43.450> when<00:03:44.380> men<00:03:44.500> are<00:03:44.650> portrayed

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
explored I think when men are portrayed

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.280 
explored I think when men are portrayed
in<00:03:45.430> pop<00:03:45.760> culture<00:03:45.790> it's<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.810> know<00:03:46.930> these

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
in pop culture it's you know these

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.780 
in pop culture it's you know these
bigger<00:03:47.530> than<00:03:47.740> life<00:03:47.860> characters<00:03:48.430> or<00:03:48.670> they're

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
bigger than life characters or they're

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.860 
bigger than life characters or they're
going<00:03:48.970> something<00:03:49.360> through<00:03:49.510> something<00:03:49.840> like

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
going something through something like

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.320 
going something through something like
really<00:03:50.350> extraordinary<00:03:51.160> or<00:03:51.580> they're

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
really extraordinary or they're

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.180 
really extraordinary or they're
superheroes<00:03:52.780> but<00:03:53.560> they<00:03:53.680> don't<00:03:53.830> get<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:53.950> kind

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
superheroes but they don't get the kind

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.640 
superheroes but they don't get the kind
of<00:03:54.250> attention<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.880> think<00:03:55.150> women<00:03:55.810> do<00:03:56.080> that

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
of attention that I think women do that

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.070 
of attention that I think women do that
we<00:03:56.800> get<00:03:56.980> like<00:03:57.790> in<00:03:57.910> rom-coms<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.750> know<00:03:58.870> like

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
we get like in rom-coms you know like

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.630 
we get like in rom-coms you know like
exploring<00:03:59.620> how<00:03:59.770> do<00:03:59.830> women<00:04:00.100> feel<00:04:00.280> about<00:04:00.460> like

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
exploring how do women feel about like

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.850 
exploring how do women feel about like
what<00:04:00.820> are<00:04:00.910> their<00:04:01.000> goals<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.690> think<00:04:02.230> that<00:04:02.410> you

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
what are their goals I think that you

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.990 
what are their goals I think that you
know<00:04:02.950> something<00:04:03.220> some<00:04:03.580> people<00:04:03.610> might<00:04:03.970> even

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
know something some people might even

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.390 
know something some people might even
say<00:04:04.240> it's<00:04:04.390> been<00:04:04.510> explored<00:04:04.870> like<00:04:05.710> an<00:04:05.920> ad

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
know if it rings true so if you've seen

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.650 
know if it rings true so if you've seen
the<00:04:33.250> movie<00:04:33.280> right<00:04:33.760> down<00:04:33.940> below<00:04:34.150> if<00:04:34.480> you're<00:04:34.630> a

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
the movie right down below if you're a

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.230 
the movie right down below if you're a
guy<00:04:34.840> if<00:04:35.740> you<00:04:35.950> think<00:04:36.160> Jesse<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.670> France<00:04:36.910> really

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
guy if you think Jesse and France really

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.880 
guy if you think Jesse and France really
hits<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.810> right<00:04:37.930> notes<00:04:38.230> and<00:04:38.470> depicts<00:04:38.740> it

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
hits the right notes and depicts it

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.400 
hits the right notes and depicts it
correctly<00:04:39.250> so<00:04:40.210> obviously<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.080> movie<00:04:41.290> like

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
correctly so obviously the movie like

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.900 
correctly so obviously the movie like
this<00:04:41.590> you're<00:04:41.770> gonna<00:04:41.860> have<00:04:42.070> some<00:04:42.220> really<00:04:42.370> great

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
this you're gonna have some really great

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.760 
this you're gonna have some really great
acting<00:04:43.450> and<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.750> think<00:04:43.990> that<00:04:44.140> for<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.710> most

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
acting and I think that for the most

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.460 
acting and I think that for the most
part<00:04:44.980> you<00:04:45.220> do<00:04:45.370> obviously<00:04:45.690> Ryan<00:04:46.690> Gosling<00:04:46.930> is

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
part you do obviously Ryan Gosling is

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.680 
part you do obviously Ryan Gosling is
the<00:04:47.770> best<00:04:47.980> in<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.280> film<00:04:48.490> he's<00:04:48.880> fantastic<00:04:49.120> when

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
the best in the film he's fantastic when

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.050 
the best in the film he's fantastic when
he's<00:04:49.840> not<00:04:49.990> on<00:04:50.050> screen<00:04:50.530> he<00:04:50.800> really<00:04:51.100> haunts<00:04:51.910> the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
he's not on screen he really haunts the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.510 
he's not on screen he really haunts the
film<00:04:52.300> his<00:04:52.810> character<00:04:53.290> is<00:04:53.410> so<00:04:53.560> great<00:04:53.830> on<00:04:54.100> the

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
film his character is so great on the

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.159 
film his character is so great on the
other<00:04:54.669> characters<00:04:55.210> don't<00:04:55.479> really<00:04:55.660> have<00:04:55.810> a

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
other characters don't really have a

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.800 
other characters don't really have a
a lot<00:04:56.409> of<00:04:56.529> emotional<00:04:57.240> layering<00:04:58.240> as<00:04:58.419> much<00:04:58.629> as

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
a lot of emotional layering as much as

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.600 
a lot of emotional layering as much as
his<00:04:58.960> character<00:04:59.229> and<00:04:59.680> I<00:04:59.949> couldn't<00:05:00.430> quite

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
his character and I couldn't quite

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.459 
his character and I couldn't quite
figure<00:05:00.729> out<00:05:01.240> if<00:05:01.360> that<00:05:01.389> was<00:05:01.539> the<00:05:01.810> actors<00:05:02.199> fault

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
figure out if that was the actors fault

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.050 
figure out if that was the actors fault
or<00:05:02.770> if<00:05:02.860> it's<00:05:03.009> the<00:05:03.129> writing<00:05:03.490> just<00:05:03.520> didn't<00:05:03.939> care

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
or if it's the writing just didn't care

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.360 
or if it's the writing just didn't care
to<00:05:04.210> develop<00:05:04.629> them<00:05:04.779> as<00:05:04.900> much<00:05:05.129> but<00:05:06.129> then<00:05:06.249> when<00:05:06.340> I

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
to develop them as much but then when I

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.249 
to develop them as much but then when I
see<00:05:06.639> ben<00:05:06.819> mendelsohn<00:05:07.029> here<00:05:07.539> in<00:05:07.629> the<00:05:07.749> movie<00:05:08.050> I

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
see ben mendelsohn here in the movie I

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:09.779 
see ben mendelsohn here in the movie I
think<00:05:08.800> maybe<00:05:08.919> it's<00:05:09.129> the<00:05:09.249> actors<00:05:09.550> fault

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
think maybe it's the actors fault

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.459 
think maybe it's the actors fault
because<00:05:09.939> Ben<00:05:10.180> Mendelsohn<00:05:10.659> does<00:05:10.810> very<00:05:11.169> much

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469 
because Ben Mendelsohn does very much

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.950 
because Ben Mendelsohn does very much
with<00:05:11.650> very<00:05:11.860> little<00:05:12.069> here<00:05:12.599> he's<00:05:13.599> very

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
with very little here he's very

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.899 
with very little here he's very
charismatic<00:05:14.529> it's<00:05:15.009> you<00:05:15.279> know<00:05:15.400> he's<00:05:15.639> on<00:05:15.759> the

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
charismatic it's you know he's on the

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.550 
charismatic it's you know he's on the
same<00:05:16.060> I'd<00:05:16.509> say<00:05:16.659> he's<00:05:16.810> on<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:16.990> same<00:05:17.169> level<00:05:17.349> as

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
same I'd say he's on the same level as

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.260 
same I'd say he's on the same level as
Ryan<00:05:17.770> Gosling<00:05:17.979> as<00:05:18.430> an<00:05:18.520> actor<00:05:18.789> which<00:05:18.939> is<00:05:19.090> maybe

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
Ryan Gosling as an actor which is maybe

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.969 
Ryan Gosling as an actor which is maybe
why<00:05:19.479> their<00:05:19.629> scenes<00:05:19.900> are<00:05:20.080> so<00:05:20.229> compelling<00:05:20.590> and

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
why their scenes are so compelling and

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.339 
why their scenes are so compelling and
you<00:05:21.939> know<00:05:22.060> Ben<00:05:22.479> Mendelsohn<00:05:22.870> really<00:05:23.080> if<00:05:23.259> you

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
you know Ben Mendelsohn really if you

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:24.809 
you know Ben Mendelsohn really if you
watch<00:05:23.590> my<00:05:23.800> review<00:05:24.159> for<00:05:24.189> killing<00:05:24.580> them<00:05:24.669> softly

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
watch my review for killing them softly

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.209 
watch my review for killing them softly
really<00:05:25.180> stood<00:05:25.449> out<00:05:25.509> there<00:05:25.900> I'm<00:05:26.529> excited<00:05:27.189> for

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
really stood out there I'm excited for

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.010 
really stood out there I'm excited for
him<00:05:27.460> as<00:05:27.580> an<00:05:27.699> actor<00:05:27.849> and<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.599> hope<00:05:28.839> that

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
him as an actor and I hope that

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.200 
him as an actor and I hope that
Hollywood<00:05:29.469> gives<00:05:29.770> him<00:05:30.039> you<00:05:30.699> know<00:05:30.789> a<00:05:30.819> leading

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
Hollywood gives him you know a leading

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.820 
Hollywood gives him you know a leading
role<00:05:31.389> soon<00:05:31.749> instead<00:05:31.930> of<00:05:32.139> just<00:05:32.319> these<00:05:32.409> small

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
role soon instead of just these small

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.709 
role soon instead of just these small
supporting<00:05:33.460> roles<00:05:33.639> I<00:05:33.789> think<00:05:33.999> I<00:05:34.210> think<00:05:34.629> he

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
supporting roles I think I think he

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.659 
supporting roles I think I think he
could<00:05:34.870> pull<00:05:35.050> it<00:05:35.169> off<00:05:35.319> and<00:05:36.159> speaking<00:05:36.610> of

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
could pull it off and speaking of

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.909 
could pull it off and speaking of
careers<00:05:37.120> I<00:05:37.509> think<00:05:38.020> Derek<00:05:38.229> C<00:05:38.409> and<00:05:38.529> France<00:05:38.740> is

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
careers I think Derek C and France is

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.100 
careers I think Derek C and France is
ready<00:05:39.129> to<00:05:39.310> move<00:05:39.460> up<00:05:39.699> at<00:05:39.969> this<00:05:40.150> point<00:05:40.479> he<00:05:40.960> did<00:05:41.080> a

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
ready to move up at this point he did a

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.869 
ready to move up at this point he did a
great<00:05:41.319> job<00:05:41.349> here<00:05:41.889> I<00:05:42.069> love<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.699> action

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:42.879 
great job here I love the action

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.149 
great job here I love the action
sequences<00:05:43.539> I<00:05:43.599> think<00:05:44.199> his<00:05:44.319> brand<00:05:44.620> of<00:05:44.740> realism

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
sequences I think his brand of realism

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:46.439 
sequences I think his brand of realism
really<00:05:45.430> works<00:05:45.639> for<00:05:45.879> him<00:05:46.029> I<00:05:46.089> think<00:05:46.270> he<00:05:46.330> has<00:05:46.419> a

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:46.449 
really works for him I think he has a

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.689 
really works for him I think he has a
voice<00:05:46.689> as<00:05:46.960> a<00:05:46.990> director<00:05:47.469> and<00:05:47.710> so<00:05:48.310> he's<00:05:48.460> ready<00:05:48.639> to

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
voice as a director and so he's ready to

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.670 
voice as a director and so he's ready to
take<00:05:49.089> it<00:05:49.180> to<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.330> next<00:05:49.479> level<00:05:49.569> if<00:05:50.020> not<00:05:50.080> you

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
take it to the next level if not you

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.640 
take it to the next level if not you
know<00:05:50.770> by<00:05:50.919> going<00:05:51.069> into<00:05:51.310> mainstream<00:05:51.879> films<00:05:52.650> I'm

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
know by going into mainstream films I'm

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.920 
know by going into mainstream films I'm
sorry<00:05:54.069> I'm<00:05:54.189> a<00:05:54.249> little<00:05:54.460> sick<00:05:54.610> so<00:05:54.669> I<00:05:55.389> think<00:05:55.659> that

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
sorry I'm a little sick so I think that

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.510 
sorry I'm a little sick so I think that
I'm<00:05:56.020> not<00:05:56.139> going<00:05:56.349> into<00:05:56.469> mainstream<00:05:56.979> films<00:05:57.339> I

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
I'm not going into mainstream films I

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.279 
I'm not going into mainstream films I
think<00:05:58.120> that<00:05:58.270> he<00:05:58.419> at<00:05:58.509> least<00:05:58.569> is<00:05:58.930> ready<00:05:59.110> to

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
think that he at least is ready to

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.839 
think that he at least is ready to
upgrade<00:05:59.589> to<00:05:59.710> a<00:05:59.740> bigger<00:05:59.800> budget<00:06:00.219> I'd<00:06:00.580> like<00:06:00.729> to

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
upgrade to a bigger budget I'd like to

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:02.249 
upgrade to a bigger budget I'd like to
see<00:06:01.000> him<00:06:01.120> do<00:06:01.300> more<00:06:01.539> I<00:06:01.569> don't<00:06:01.839> wanted<00:06:02.050> to<00:06:02.110> see

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
see him do more I don't wanted to see

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.050 
see him do more I don't wanted to see
him<00:06:02.349> get<00:06:02.469> too<00:06:02.620> comfortable<00:06:02.979> in<00:06:03.279> this<00:06:03.399> zone<00:06:03.639> and

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
him get too comfortable in this zone and

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.610 
him get too comfortable in this zone and
kind<00:06:04.360> of<00:06:04.419> rest<00:06:04.659> on<00:06:04.810> his<00:06:04.960> laurels<00:06:04.990> I<00:06:05.409> think<00:06:05.560> he

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
kind of rest on his laurels I think he

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.079 
kind of rest on his laurels I think he
needs<00:06:05.770> to<00:06:05.830> push<00:06:06.069> himself<00:06:06.279> I'd<00:06:06.639> actually<00:06:06.969> say

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089 
needs to push himself I'd actually say

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:08.939 
needs to push himself I'd actually say
the<00:06:07.149> same<00:06:07.330> thing<00:06:07.509> about<00:06:07.599> Ryan<00:06:07.870> Gosling<00:06:07.949> Ryan

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
the same thing about Ryan Gosling Ryan

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.070 
the same thing about Ryan Gosling Ryan
Gosling<00:06:09.099> is<00:06:09.430> a<00:06:09.460> fantastic<00:06:10.120> actor<00:06:10.479> this<00:06:10.899> is

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
Gosling is a fantastic actor this is

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.869 
Gosling is a fantastic actor this is
another<00:06:11.289> great<00:06:11.620> ride<00:06:11.889> Gosling<00:06:12.339> performance

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:12.879 
another great ride Gosling performance

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:15.209 
another great ride Gosling performance
but<00:06:13.479> I<00:06:13.509> feel<00:06:13.870> that<00:06:14.110> he<00:06:14.199> needs<00:06:14.229> to<00:06:14.529> also<00:06:15.009> push

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:15.219 
but I feel that he needs to also push

my<00:06:37.360> only<00:06:37.539> problem<00:06:37.930> with<00:06:38.020> the<00:06:38.110> movie<00:06:38.349> is<00:06:38.409> the

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
my only problem with the movie is the

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.529 
my only problem with the movie is the
title<00:06:39.039> I<00:06:39.219> think<00:06:39.699> it<00:06:39.759> doesn't<00:06:39.939> reflect<00:06:40.240> it<00:06:40.449> all

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
title I think it doesn't reflect it all

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:41.879 
title I think it doesn't reflect it all
in<00:06:40.659> the<00:06:40.719> movie<00:06:40.839> it's<00:06:41.050> actually<00:06:41.469> what

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
in the movie it's actually what

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.399 
in the movie it's actually what
Schenectady<00:06:42.520> New<00:06:42.550> York

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:43.409 
Schenectady New York

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:45.869 
Schenectady New York
what<00:06:44.409> Schenectady<00:06:44.860> stands<00:06:45.189> for<00:06:45.550> that's<00:06:45.819> the

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:45.879 
what Schenectady stands for that's the

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:48.119 
what Schenectady stands for that's the
movie<00:06:46.120> takes<00:06:46.300> place<00:06:46.360> the<00:06:47.259> place<00:06:47.740> isn't<00:06:47.979> really

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:48.129 
movie takes place the place isn't really

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.969 
movie takes place the place isn't really
a<00:06:48.310> character<00:06:49.270> in<00:06:49.389> the<00:06:49.479> movie<00:06:49.779> so<00:06:50.050> I<00:06:50.349> think<00:06:50.740> they

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:50.979 
a character in the movie so I think they

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:52.559 
a character in the movie so I think they
just<00:06:51.009> didn't<00:06:51.550> know<00:06:51.580> what<00:06:51.759> to<00:06:51.819> name<00:06:52.089> it<00:06:52.240> but<00:06:52.389> so

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:52.569 
just didn't know what to name it but so

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.209 
just didn't know what to name it but so
anyway<00:06:52.659> if<00:06:52.899> you've<00:06:53.020> seen<00:06:53.229> the<00:06:53.349> movie<00:06:53.379> I'll
