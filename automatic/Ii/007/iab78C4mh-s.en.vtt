00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
and the way that one moved I knew that I

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.220 
and the way that one moved I knew that I
could<00:02:19.670> find<00:02:20.480> out<00:02:20.690> more

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230

could find out more
I<00:02:21.260> know<00:02:21.830> basically<00:02:22.400> my<00:02:22.610> capabilities<00:02:23.360> and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660

stuff<00:02:24.290> when<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.620> comes<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:25.130> how<00:02:25.670> how<00:02:26.090> hard<00:02:26.360> I

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
stuff when it comes to how how hard I

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.130 
stuff when it comes to how how hard I
can<00:02:26.540> actually<00:02:26.810> grind<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.580> made<00:02:29.240> a<00:02:29.270> good<00:02:29.480> pick

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140

at<00:02:30.880> 575<00:02:31.880> pounds<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.420> really<00:02:32.750> believed<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.200> could

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
at 575 pounds I really believed I could

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.240 
at 575 pounds I really believed I could
stand<00:02:33.620> up<00:02:33.770> with<00:02:33.950> it

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
stand up with it

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.640 
stand up with it
and<00:02:34.570> it's<00:02:35.570> something<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.020> wanted<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.440> do

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
for a long time so I put it on the bar

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.730 
for a long time so I put it on the bar
and<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.300> just<00:02:41.630> went<00:02:41.870> for<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:43.210> I<00:02:44.740> didn't

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.170 
see but I just found her locked so then
I<00:05:52.789> decided<00:05:53.789> to<00:05:54.000> do<00:05:54.180> these<00:05:54.419> long<00:05:55.050> pauses<00:05:55.500> on<00:05:56.180> 315

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
I decided to do these long pauses on 315

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.779 
I decided to do these long pauses on 315
and<00:05:57.389> what<00:05:58.260> these<00:05:58.470> do<00:05:58.710> is<00:05:58.740> it<00:05:59.130> actually<00:05:59.460> teaches

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
and what these do is it actually teaches

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.850

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
position and it's something that I find

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.020 
position and it's something that I find
really<00:06:04.500> works<00:06:04.800> well<00:06:05.039> if<00:06:05.310> you're<00:06:05.520> in<00:06:05.820> an

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
not have a bounce around and stuff those

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.230 
not have a bounce around and stuff those
longer<00:06:13.199> pauses<00:06:13.440> are
