00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.100
 t 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.240
 hello that such friends inform you that 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.700
 I will be doing a series of tutorials 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.279
 so that they learn to edit a 3d model 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.109
 in this first tutorial of share a 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.250
 introduction so that they understand the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.610
 basic concepts 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.879
 that said let's start by opening the bz 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.470
 t3 model winter nick where it says file 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.840
 we'll see an option that says open model 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.480
 with this we can find the file of the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.430
 character that we are going to avoid saving 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.020
 model this serves to save the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.660
 file of the character and when 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.550
 we finished editing it when opening a 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.260
 file of a character in the section 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.050
 model we can see the following 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.050
 options model blocks here are 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.910
 The main parts of the model parts 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.700
 individual here are the parts 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.430
 individual of said model and des here 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.470
 there are two and one and two and three I 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.450
 you follow 1 and 2 they make the part be 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.180
 well located and does not produce errors and the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.370
 ide 3 defines the colors of the parts 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.580
 replace part this serves to 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.410
 replace the parts extract part 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.560
 it serves to extract a part in 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.710
 specific delete part serves to 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.570
 remove parts delete group serves 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.660
 to eliminate a whole group of 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.820
 parts in the section names we will see or 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.770
 following save model names 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.619
 This opens a notebook where they are 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.420
 the codes of each of the parties and 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.340
 finally load model names 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.310
 open a notebook of the names of 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.320
 models maybe you will find this as 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.330
 something obvious and tired but believe me is 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.540
 It is essential to understand it so that 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.860
 make it easier to avoid models 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.660
 soon I will upload the next part 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.490
 of this video where we will enter 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.460
 good stuff until here we are 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.320
 wait for my next tutorial that's all 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.930
 I hope you have understood until the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.680
 next I will leave you in the description the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.680
 tools needed
