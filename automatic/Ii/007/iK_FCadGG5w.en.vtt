00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 all send my name is my name 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.750
 I'm an industrialist from Bonn and in 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.240
 this video is about impacting 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:15.480
 training with beginners table tennis 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.100
 Krankl live very interesting topic 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.340
 I have the last one myself a hall 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.210
 It has been going on for two weeks now 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.490
 on 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.500
 son co-trainer of me 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.689
 Youth training supports in the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.490
 Verein where I do that because we are so much 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.210
 many children in the meantime too 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.610
 got and he has just before eight 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.020
 or nine years, first one or his c 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.120
 royalty made then not really 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.649
 Training more passed and I have 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.350
 in the last few units times the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.110
 give in and then start with 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.250
 just give them a try and me 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.480
 just wanted to do the training 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.690
 be guided freely 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.539
 with his beginner group then he has 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.100
 The stop shown with the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.780
 out of the backhand similar to the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.039
 professionals and their which also took up 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.049
 So shown are special to me 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.970
 synonymous ever mentioned in the video and 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.590
 You have to say that clearly for beginners 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.600
 There are very special rules 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.860
 serve training 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.710
 they do not need special ones 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.630
 grip when the serve need 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.450
 also not the cool serve with the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.280
 out of the backhand side because they 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.290
 must first learn the basics so 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.570
 before changing the serve attitude 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.490
 you should grab a serve first 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.729
 the right grip in the table tennis 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.930
 learning that is very important and direct 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.299
 installment 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.310
 where to ask for the service because of the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.710
 It also has to be first 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.409
 difficulty making simple forehand premiums 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.130
 or back serves so I have 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.810
 you have written 4 or 5 points on it 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.689
 which I think is very important 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.970
 Supplement training with beginner rule 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:02:09.720
 Number one or number one is one 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:11.310
 simple real serve me 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.280
 Hope this is just a little read 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.530
 wet the board very clearly and simply 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.420
 I mean either a markup on 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.640
 the existing or back on the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.430
 backhand side that you 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.410
 to learn to throw the farm that they 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.960
 Do not live on the plate and 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.910
 behind the white line 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:35.300
 that's already going to be a lot 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.300
 help second second goal 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:52.800
 also places an important one for exercises 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.290
 point of course we want to have children 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.410
 even simple exercises do somehow 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.080
 a ball relay or a sequence 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.209
 it is always backhand once before 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.980
 in which one can let up and can 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.420
 somehow on the table then we can 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.550
 Of course, with such exercises hardly 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.360
 that's why it would have been 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.620
 important that you have a proper 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.930
 but it's easy 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.510
 the at least one certain relationship 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.340
 be it for example only the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.650
 backhand only in the middle or now me 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.030
 earlier the impact or if you already 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.519
 a bit advanced then 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.380
 also a short edition but also that 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:33.590
 here only from easy to difficult 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.590
 third point 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.190
 flat with flat I mean that of course 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.840
 do not they just paint the plate 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.060
 should the then ten meters high is synonymous 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.530
 then you can not play any exercise or 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.910
 is also available for when out my 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.870
 circle ranking or tournament play because 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.580
 he in the season 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:17.880
 then you have to learn how to do it 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:19.979
 A flat serve can be a surcharge 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.049
 training is then on point number 4 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.030
 or as target number four first 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.160
 tactical cognition together that 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:36.620
 means that they understand when I do that 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:39.479
 maybe that happens to five 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.000
 means to me sure I know 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.620
 unfortunately many beginners are even 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.240
 do not dare to serve because 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.169
 they always have to be afraid of it somehow 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.150
 to make a mistake 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.560
 I can always watch that very well 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.940
 if we play practice then we let 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.830
 always open the other 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.630
 if you ask her why she does that 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.550
 different he has yes I can the impact 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.740
 not that's why it is here too 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.229
 It's important for you to have a safe one 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.669
 Order can be where you are now 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.220
 not always sure but over 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.690
 Also for you in the head is sure where 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.430
 you go confidently to the plate 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:15.680
 can say I can open now 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.680
 it's very important to me from 66 goal 

00:05:24.269 --> 00:05:29.199
 she can teach fun with variations 

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:31.209
 I hear these points 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.189
 then you should have completed the 

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:35.379
 Children also tried the fun too 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.239
 convey that she was in my house 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.999
 also be able to vary it is in the 

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:42.699
 Placement be it cut or be it 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.050
 in position because many children are 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.729
 of course, very peculiar in the 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.449
 Order just when you first 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.789
 learn 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.619
 Then you have a standard surcharge 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.719
 and just see competition 

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:54.789
 then again as you have the hat 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:56.619
 also try to teach them 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.439
 stop from the same position too 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:01.569
 different placement games can 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:03.779
 those are the first or the first for me 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:06.099
 you six main goals or 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.019
 learning goals for the impact training with 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.399
 absolute beginners so children or 

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:12.629
 adult guessing table tennis 

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:15.489
 start and the first so enough yes 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:18.069
 handle this or hit cool 

00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:19.569
 Strikes that are so covered and 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:21.550
 the look great 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:22.149
 maybe they like that on youtube 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.919
 if they see the 

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:27.099
 see game summaries of the professionals 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.189
 but the world is and for now just easy 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:32.319
 and usually it will be ours 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:34.119
 he should be placed one 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.800
 can swing for the first exercises 

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:38.740
 he should be flat 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.469
 you have to tactical a tactical 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.909
 Understand it should be safe 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:45.069
 should be comfortable with the 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:47.099
 turn up and eventually they should 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:49.360
 then get to know the variations 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:50.979
 I hope you liked the video
