lines on my forehead I have like a few

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.650 
lines on my forehead I have like a few
right<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:26.340> they're<00:00:26.550> really<00:00:26.789> small<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:27.390> I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
right here they're really small but I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.080 
right here they're really small but I
can<00:00:27.960> still<00:00:28.170> see<00:00:28.320> them<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:29.460> know<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
can still see them and you know like the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.600 
can still see them and you know like the
typical<00:00:30.570> expression<00:00:31.080> lines<00:00:31.260> are<00:00:31.439> here<00:00:31.650> anyway

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
typical expression lines are here anyway

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.610 
typical expression lines are here anyway
so<00:00:34.550> I<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:36.180> decided<00:00:36.840> give<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.140> try<00:00:37.320> I've
