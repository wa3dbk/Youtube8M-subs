00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.500

 at 2 o'clock 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.500
 two o'clock then when you 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.930
 they see that it did not leave at 10 o'clock in the morning 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.150
 in the bag the girl tram 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.150
 You can expect the rain there in the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.670
 spe is the time the grade was grouped 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.660
 with this I indicate eight holy districts 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.720
 weapon 3 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.360
 I do not know if it's probably if you 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.460
 watched a very crazy video 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.590
 after I posted it is maybe be 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.570
 other games in which we are 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.350
 bringing you but you do not know that I 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:42.220
 I record with them at 5 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.890
 the river tietê to 1 soon the jeton laine and a7 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.730
 would also allow our series 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.980
 from gt the mother also has the 8 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.530
 book is not always composite video 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.860
 I only whip myself because I alone can 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.010
 when it gets more quiet but the nights 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.990
 is usually loose varied videos of 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.910
 skate 3 times 22 is big tourism 6 of 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.770
 May 2014 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.260
 these are the games I have on 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.840
 now it is logical that soon give 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.090
 accelerated and also pressing here in 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.250
 Soon, new games will come out. 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.530
 change but it's interesting that we go 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.990
 maintaining this dialogue to maintain the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.450
 things sort of organized in the carnival 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.900
 here then at first people on the channel 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.420
 It's basically this guys that if you guys 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.890
 they see something different someday than 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.680
 example 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.630
 I did not leave out any online race is 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.450
 Part unfortunately could not record 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.069
 with the galley some unforeseen occur 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.500
 but do not worry that the next day 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.340
 the turn around 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.340
 it's not a video 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.980
 to go out and meet a 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.920
 little of the time that the soil mine 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.580
 series 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.470
 or another radar here 80 per hour let's go 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.380
 to see 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.740
 16 laps is good for you, I hope 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.030
 yes but soon we will improve 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.040

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.780
 It's already 6:30 in the afternoon too. 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.859
 dark 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.859
 This video will probably go out there by 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.000
 states too 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.340
 the free time I have there there ' 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.620
 also the times that I record it highlights 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.319
 mailbox or even some blog 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.050
 showing something these videos and 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.939
 they leave random times of the galley 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.050
 do not have a fixed schedule because they are not 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:42.009
 headquarters that I bring every day 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.990
 They are 10 times more than it takes me more 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.259
 Bring it on, then it's going to loose. 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:51.300
 sometimes even go out in the morning to late 16 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:53.819
 Sometimes night but that's it. 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.860
 but I wanted to ask you guys 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.610
 Are you finding this channel format? 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.830
 interesting 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:04.680
 is to know your opinion what we people 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:07.270
 could improve what is at last 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.370

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.930

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.879
 cool content and everything 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.979
 you might also suggest in some 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:34.060
 games to profile the playing 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.930
