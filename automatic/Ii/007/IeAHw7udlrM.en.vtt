00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.569 
zero side effects and how long did they
have<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.110> take<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.320> pills<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.770> they<00:02:02.219> did<00:02:02.460> it

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
have to take the pills for they did it

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.719 
have to take the pills for they did it
for<00:02:02.610> 12<00:02:03.030> weeks<00:02:03.329> only<00:02:04.100> that's<00:02:05.100> reworked<00:02:05.460> yeah

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
for 12 weeks only that's reworked yeah

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.030 
for 12 weeks only that's reworked yeah
you<00:02:05.909> guys<00:02:06.060> interested<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.479> this

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.730 

this<00:02:11.040> is<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> raw<00:02:11.520> material<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.150> coffee<00:02:13.140> that

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
this is the raw material for coffee that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.200 
this is the raw material for coffee that
we<00:02:13.830> drink<00:02:14.070> why<00:02:14.250> would<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.670> drinking<00:02:15.000> coffee

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
we drink why would just drinking coffee

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.420 
we drink why would just drinking coffee
do<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.660> yeah<00:02:16.050> because<00:02:16.500> when<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.190> coffee

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
do this yeah because when the coffee

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.430 
do this yeah because when the coffee
that<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:17.910> drank<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.540> roasted<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.230> when<00:02:19.320> they

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
that we drank is roasted and when they

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.810 
that we drank is roasted and when they
roast<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.920> they<00:02:20.070> roasted<00:02:20.490> at<00:02:20.660> 475<00:02:21.660> degrees

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
roast it they roasted at 475 degrees

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.850 
roast it they roasted at 475 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.660> changes<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.200> color<00:02:25.440> turns

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
Fahrenheit so it changes the color turns

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.980 
Fahrenheit so it changes the color turns
brown<00:02:26.190> changes<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.850> aroma<00:02:27.180> changes<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
brown changes the aroma changes the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.050 
brown changes the aroma changes the
taste<00:02:28.230> changes<00:02:28.740> everything<00:02:29.010> but<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.880> most

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
taste changes everything but the most

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.940 
taste changes everything but the most
important<00:02:30.570> thing<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.810> does<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.320> removes

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
important thing it does is it removes

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.120 
important thing it does is it removes
the<00:02:32.280> chlorogenic<00:02:32.760> acid<00:02:33.630> that's<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.650> key<00:02:34.890> to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the chlorogenic acid that's the key to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.130 
the chlorogenic acid that's the key to
what<00:02:35.310> we're<00:02:35.490> talking<00:02:35.520> about<00:02:36.030> today<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:37.050> how

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
what we're talking about today so how

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.800 
what we're talking about today so how
does<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.350> work<00:02:37.410> well<00:02:38.400> it's<00:02:38.700> amazing<00:02:39.210> it's<00:02:39.600> what

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
does it work well it's amazing it's what

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.930 
does it work well it's amazing it's what
we<00:02:39.900> call<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> triple<00:02:40.500> threat<00:02:40.530> okay<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.730> it's

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
we call a triple threat okay and it's

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.700 
we call a triple threat okay and it's
the<00:02:42.090> chlorogenic<00:02:42.450> acid<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.290> causes<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
the chlorogenic acid that causes the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.530 
the chlorogenic acid that causes the
effect<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.370> works<00:02:44.580> three<00:02:44.910> ways<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.360> first

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
effect and it works three ways the first

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.530 
effect and it works three ways the first
way<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.860> goes<00:02:47.070> in<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.670> causes<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.390> body

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
way is it goes in and it causes the body

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.710 
way is it goes in and it causes the body
to<00:02:48.720> burn<00:02:49.110> glucose<00:02:49.800> or<00:02:50.010> sugar<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.700> burn<00:02:51.330> fat

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
to burn glucose or sugar and burn fat

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.080 
to burn glucose or sugar and burn fat
mainly<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.350> liver<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.280> second<00:02:53.700> way<00:02:53.820> and

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
mainly in the liver the second way and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.120 
mainly in the liver the second way and
the<00:02:54.150> most<00:02:54.330> important<00:02:54.780> way<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.560> slows<00:02:56.100> the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
the most important way is it slows the

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.900 
the most important way is it slows the
release<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:57.060> sugar<00:02:57.630> into<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.530> bloodstream<00:02:58.910> so

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
release of sugar into the bloodstream so

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.520 
release of sugar into the bloodstream so
when<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.210> don't<00:03:00.450> have<00:03:00.600> sugar<00:03:00.870> building<00:03:01.320> up<00:03:01.410> in

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
when you don't have sugar building up in

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.350 
when you don't have sugar building up in
the<00:03:01.560> bloodstream<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:02.520> don't<00:03:02.790> have<00:03:03.030> fat

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the bloodstream you don't have fat

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.990 
the bloodstream you don't have fat
building<00:03:03.810> up<00:03:03.960> because<00:03:04.290> sugar<00:03:04.650> turns<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.760> fat

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
building up because sugar turns to fat

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.020 
building up because sugar turns to fat
and<00:03:06.300> everybody<00:03:06.900> must<00:03:07.260> remember<00:03:07.710> that<00:03:08.160> when

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
and everybody must remember that when

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.360 
and everybody must remember that when
the<00:03:09.150> two<00:03:09.360> are<00:03:09.510> combined<00:03:10.020> together<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:11.190> get

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
the two are combined together you get

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.000 
the two are combined together you get
this<00:03:11.580> synergistic<00:03:12.270> effect<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.530> basically

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
this synergistic effect that basically

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.300 
this synergistic effect that basically
burns<00:03:14.430> in<00:03:14.730> blocks<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.420> stops<00:03:15.810> fat<00:03:16.320> but<00:03:17.190> it

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
burns in blocks and stops fat but it

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:27.620 
burns in blocks and stops fat but it
also<00:03:17.490> is<00:03:18.350> natural<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.560> safe

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.690 

you
