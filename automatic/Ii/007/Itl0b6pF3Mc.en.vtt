00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
just felt funny when you turned it like

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.220 
just felt funny when you turned it like
kind<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.029> feels<00:00:27.210> weird<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.660> your<00:00:27.810> hands<00:00:27.990> when

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
kind of feels weird in your hands when

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.189 
kind of feels weird in your hands when
you<00:00:28.320> first<00:00:28.529> get<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.510> don't<00:00:30.510> know<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
feeling is just it's hard to explain but

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.620 
feeling is just it's hard to explain but
yeah<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.200> feels<00:00:34.620> kind<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.829> weird<00:00:35.630> one

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
yeah it just feels kind of weird one

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.600 
yeah it just feels kind of weird one
size<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:37.350> attention<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.890> little<00:00:38.010> bit<00:00:38.250> pudgy

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
size at attention a little bit pudgy

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.180 
size at attention a little bit pudgy
glue<00:00:39.140> as<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.320> see<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:40.620> usually<00:00:40.890> sitting

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
glue as you can see it's usually sitting

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.630 
glue as you can see it's usually sitting
there<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.719> moved<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.550> yeah<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.629> um

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
there but I moved it so yeah but um

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.069 
there but I moved it so yeah but um
after<00:00:47.640> i<00:00:47.700> put<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> gigolo<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.780> worked

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
after i put the gigolo in it worked

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.700 
after i put the gigolo in it worked
perfectly<00:00:49.760> spotting<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.210> smooth<00:00:51.750> it's

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
perfectly spotting really smooth it's

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.290 
perfectly spotting really smooth it's
not<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.190> fastest<00:00:53.910> cube<00:00:55.190> what<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:59.300> yeah

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
not the fastest cube what it is yeah

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.630 
not the fastest cube what it is yeah
it's<00:01:00.870> really<00:01:01.079> smooth<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.309> can<00:01:02.460> see<00:01:02.489> i

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
it's really smooth and as you can see i

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.969 
it's really smooth and as you can see i
put<00:01:02.910> cubes<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.570> texture<00:01:04.080> tiles<00:01:04.350> i'll<00:01:04.799> be

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
put cubes with texture tiles i'll be

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.469 
put cubes with texture tiles i'll be
making<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.339> review<00:01:05.700> about<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.939> probably

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
making a review about that probably

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.910 
making a review about that probably
today<00:01:06.630> um<00:01:07.520> they<00:01:08.520> really<00:01:08.729> um<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:10.710> look

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
good with the blue background I'm not

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.039 
good with the blue background I'm not
gonna<00:01:12.960> lie<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.439> look<00:01:13.590> really<00:01:13.740> nice<00:01:14.869> this<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
but anyway back to the review about this

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.240 
but anyway back to the review about this
on<00:01:24.299> cutting<00:01:25.140> corners<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.799> actually<00:01:26.130> pretty

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
on cutting corners it's actually pretty

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.450 
on cutting corners it's actually pretty
good<00:01:26.490> um<00:01:27.590> not<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> greatest<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:30.020> pretty<00:01:31.020> good

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
good um not the greatest but pretty good

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.670 
good um not the greatest but pretty good
it<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.909> far<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.329> has<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.540> pop<00:01:34.079> gummy<00:01:34.350> ones

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
it so far it has not pop gummy ones

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.440 
it so far it has not pop gummy ones
which<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.790> good<00:01:36.000> i<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.380> course<00:01:37.590> and

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
which is good i like that of course and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.300 
which is good i like that of course and
overall<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:39.659> good<00:01:40.020> q<00:01:40.290> doesn't<00:01:41.040> pop

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
overall it's a really good q doesn't pop

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.090 
overall it's a really good q doesn't pop
that<00:01:41.549> much<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:42.180> smooth<00:01:42.540> not<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.619> fastest

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
that much really smooth not the fastest

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.289 
that much really smooth not the fastest
cube<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:45.119> i<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:48.140> my<00:01:49.140> first<00:01:49.380> blue

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
cube but i really like it my first blue

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.429 
cube but i really like it my first blue
blue<00:01:51.299> base<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:51.930> i<00:01:52.549> have<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> bunch<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.939> whites

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
blue base one i have a bunch of whites

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.280 
blue base one i have a bunch of whites
but<00:01:55.439> yeah<00:01:55.770> i'm<00:01:55.920> very<00:01:56.399> happy<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.290> this

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
but yeah i'm very happy with it this

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.260 
but yeah i'm very happy with it this
probably<00:01:58.799> will<00:01:58.920> not<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.250> my<00:01:59.399> speed<00:01:59.700> cube<00:02:00.000> since

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
probably will not be my speed cube since

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.190 
probably will not be my speed cube since
it's<00:02:00.630> not<00:02:00.810> extremely<00:02:01.649> fast<00:02:03.049> probably<00:02:04.049> just

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
it's not extremely fast probably just

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.679 
it's not extremely fast probably just
there<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.619> solve<00:02:05.460> use<00:02:05.880> algorithms<00:02:06.149> on

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
there to solve use algorithms on

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.529 
there to solve use algorithms on
practice<00:02:07.200> them<00:02:07.940> just<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.030> have<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.420> know

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
practice them just to have you know

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.219 
practice them just to have you know
really

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
really

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.570 
really
I<00:02:11.300> really<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.569> claim<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.349> know

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
I really like to claim with it you know

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.390 
I really like to claim with it you know
it's<00:02:14.580> really<00:02:14.909> smooth<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:19.500> yeah<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.980> got<00:02:20.220> this

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
it's really smooth so yeah I got this

speed stability and stickers which i

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.789

i think since you can change the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.659 
i think since you can change the
stickers<00:03:40.620> on<00:03:40.799> them<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.220> don't<00:03:41.430> think<00:03:41.609> you

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
stickers on them I don't think you

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:47.180 
stickers on them I don't think you
really<00:03:41.819> need<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:43.190> one<00:03:44.190> but<00:03:44.940> yeah<00:03:45.919> so<00:03:46.919> yeah

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.559 
really need that one but yeah so yeah
that<00:03:47.609> should<00:03:47.819> be<00:03:47.849> about<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.239> there's<00:03:48.480> nothing

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
really else to say just overall smooth

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.369 
really else to say just overall smooth
not<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.859> fastest<00:03:53.400> doesn't<00:03:54.239> pop<00:03:54.450> cuts<00:03:55.109> corners

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
not the fastest doesn't pop cuts corners
