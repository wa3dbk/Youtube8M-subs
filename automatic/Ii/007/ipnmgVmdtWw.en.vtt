bit about the nomenclature this would be

the packaging plastic packaging that it
comes<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:40.940> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.149> see<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:43.290> housing

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
comes in and you can see the housing

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.930 
comes in and you can see the housing
you've<00:00:46.320> got<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> mounting<00:00:46.980> hardware<00:00:47.129> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you've got the mounting hardware and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.670 
you've got the mounting hardware and
this<00:00:48.210> mounting<00:00:48.809> hardware<00:00:48.960> we've<00:00:49.289> gone<00:00:49.559> ahead

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
this mounting hardware we've gone ahead

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.750 
this mounting hardware we've gone ahead
and<00:00:49.829> put<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.100> together<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.640> this

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
and put it together for this

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.250 
and put it together for this
demonstration<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.840> mounting<00:00:52.140> hardware

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
in the spot light beam pattern and we're

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.219 
in the spot light beam pattern and we're
gonna<00:01:03.120> talk<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> little<00:01:03.570> bit<00:01:03.719> about<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
gonna talk a little bit about that the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.050 
gonna talk a little bit about that the
flood<00:01:04.439> beam<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.460> your<00:01:05.580> shorter

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
flood beam is going to be your shorter

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.530 
flood beam is going to be your shorter
and<00:01:06.710> your<00:01:07.710> wider<00:01:08.010> beam<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.640> then<00:01:09.390> your

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
and your wider beam and then your

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.730 
and your wider beam and then your
trapezoid<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> little<00:01:10.619> bit

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
trapezoid is going to be a little bit

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.950 
trapezoid is going to be a little bit
longer<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.340> obviously<00:01:12.090> narrower<00:01:12.479> than<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
longer and obviously narrower than the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.450 
longer and obviously narrower than the
flat<00:01:13.140> beam<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> spot<00:01:13.890> light<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
flat beam and the spot light is going to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.630 
flat beam and the spot light is going to
be<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> longest<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.509> also<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> skinniest<00:01:16.640> so

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
be the longest and also the skinniest so

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.390 
be the longest and also the skinniest so
these<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.509> nomenclature<00:01:19.080> says<00:01:19.290> HT<00:01:19.950> which

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
these the nomenclature says HT which

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.149 
these the nomenclature says HT which
just<00:01:20.610> stands<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.060> halogen<00:01:21.450> trapezoid<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.890> you

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
just stands for halogen trapezoid if you

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.690 
just stands for halogen trapezoid if you
were<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.759> V<00:01:23.880> 504<00:01:24.420> HF<00:01:24.689> or<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.619> V<00:01:25.770> 502<00:01:26.310> HF

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
were to get the V 504 HF or the V 502 HF

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.170 
were to get the V 504 HF or the V 502 HF
or<00:01:26.970> even<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> B<00:01:27.750> 503<00:01:28.530> HF<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.520> are<00:01:29.729> three<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
or even the B 503 HF which are three of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.539 
or even the B 503 HF which are three of
Petersons<00:01:30.930> different<00:01:31.290> types<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.740> character

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
Petersons different types of character

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.429 
Petersons different types of character
and<00:01:32.640> work<00:01:32.820> lights<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.780> that's<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.350> be

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and work lights then that's going to be

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.550 
and work lights then that's going to be
your<00:01:34.920> flood<00:01:35.189> beam<00:01:35.400> pattern<00:01:35.869> which<00:01:36.869> will<00:01:37.140> give

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
your flood beam pattern which will give

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.950 
your flood beam pattern which will give
you<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.460> said<00:01:38.670> before<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.060> widest<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:39.750> also

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
you as I said before the widest but also

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.859 
you as I said before the widest but also
the<00:01:40.829> shortest<00:01:41.460> amount<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.150> light<00:01:42.360> this

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the shortest amount of light this

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.109 
the shortest amount of light this
trapezoid<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.560> right<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.860> between<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.850> flood

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
trapezoid is right in between the flood

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
trapezoid is right in between the flood
and<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.560> spot<00:01:46.560> light<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.040> gives<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
and the spot light it really gives you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.420 
and the spot light it really gives you
kind<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.520> an<00:01:47.640> all-around<00:01:48.149> light<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.860> we'll<00:01:50.310> go

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
kind of an all-around light and we'll go

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.039 
kind of an all-around light and we'll go
ahead<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.759> put<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.270> some<00:01:51.479> power<00:01:51.720> let's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
ahead and put this to some power let's

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.480 
ahead and put this to some power let's
