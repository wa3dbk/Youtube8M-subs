00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
that the problem does exist

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.030 
that the problem does exist
okay<00:00:23.630> obviously<00:00:24.020> I'm<00:00:24.590> driving<00:00:25.010> down<00:00:25.160> the<00:00:25.250> road

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.310 

I'll<00:00:28.220> just<00:00:28.370> take<00:00:28.610> a<00:00:28.670> look<00:00:28.940> at<00:00:29.330> my<00:00:29.720> handsome<00:00:29.960> and

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.410 

I'm<00:00:39.499> probably<00:00:39.649> good<00:00:40.100> 16<00:00:40.670> miles<00:00:40.879> an<00:00:41.059> hour<00:00:41.179> now

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
I'm probably good 16 miles an hour now

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.110 
I'm probably good 16 miles an hour now

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
55

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.710 
55
and<00:00:44.210> it's<00:00:44.360> not<00:00:44.539> registered<00:00:45.020> at<00:00:45.199> all

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.170 

the<00:00:49.140> tank<00:00:49.410> armor

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.029 

the<00:00:53.480> temperature<00:00:53.899> gauge<00:00:54.020> is<00:00:54.079> not<00:00:54.289> registering

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
the temperature gauge is not registering

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.750 
the temperature gauge is not registering
and<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:55.340> fuel<00:00:55.579> gauges<00:00:56.710> well<00:00:57.710> let's<00:00:58.430> just<00:00:58.610> say

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
and the fuel gauges well let's just say

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.780 
and the fuel gauges well let's just say
mister

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.370 

I<00:01:06.880> think<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.450> champagne<00:01:07.630> should<00:01:08.050> definitely

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
I think the champagne should definitely

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.999 
I think the champagne should definitely
have<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:08.530> recall<00:01:08.980> on<00:01:09.280> their<00:01:09.490> camp

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
have a recall on their camp

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.370 
have a recall on their camp
cows<00:01:11.399> for<00:01:11.670> one<00:01:11.789> outbred<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> Internet

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
cows for one outbred on the Internet

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.640 
cows for one outbred on the Internet
very<00:01:14.829> why

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.410 

and<00:01:18.770> I'll<00:01:19.130> show<00:01:19.400> you<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.700> mileage<00:01:20.150> that<00:01:20.180> I

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
and I'll show you the mileage that I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:28.590 
and I'll show you the mileage that I
have

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.630 

almost<00:01:29.490> 80,000

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
almost 80,000

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.000 
almost 80,000
but<00:01:31.940> this<00:01:32.120> is<00:01:32.270> with<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.630> second<00:01:33.080> engine

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
but this is with the second engine

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.530 
but this is with the second engine
this<00:01:36.010> actual<00:01:36.550> engine<00:01:36.910> that's<00:01:37.030> in<00:01:37.210> here<00:01:37.390> now

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
this actual engine that's in here now

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.240 
this actual engine that's in here now
only<00:01:37.930> has<00:01:38.260> about<00:01:39.030> $60,000

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.730 

and<00:01:43.730> I<00:01:44.390> don't<00:01:45.140> know<00:01:45.410> I<00:01:45.710> wish<00:01:46.400> Chevy<00:01:47.030> would<00:01:47.740> do

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
and I don't know I wish Chevy would do

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.430 
and I don't know I wish Chevy would do
recall<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:49.940> I<00:01:49.970> could<00:01:50.150> get<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.390> fixed<00:01:50.690> because<00:01:51.080> I

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
recall so I could get it fixed because I

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.170 
recall so I could get it fixed because I
don't<00:01:51.650> have<00:01:53.020> $200<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.230> put<00:01:54.380> down<00:01:54.910> toward<00:01:55.910> a<00:01:56.000> new

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
don't have $200 to put down toward a new

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.010 
don't have $200 to put down toward a new
innocent<00:01:56.660> person

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
innocent person

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.039 
innocent person
I'm<00:01:58.469> taking<00:01:59.039> the<00:01:59.100> fuse<00:01:59.369> out<00:01:59.579> that<00:02:00.000> don't<00:02:00.210> work

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.780 

it<00:02:05.290> just<00:02:05.470> says<00:02:05.650> that<00:02:05.680> I'm<00:02:05.890> really<00:02:06.130> hot<00:02:06.520> days

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
it just says that I'm really hot days

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.820 
it just says that I'm really hot days
it's<00:02:07.149> a<00:02:07.270> lot<00:02:07.570> worse

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
it's a lot worse

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.220 
it's a lot worse
I'd<00:02:10.340> say<00:02:10.580> it's<00:02:10.729> probably<00:02:10.850> about<00:02:11.150> 90<00:02:11.720> 92

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
I'd say it's probably about 90 92

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.330 
I'd say it's probably about 90 92
degrees<00:02:12.440> out<00:02:12.890> here

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
degrees out here

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.730 
degrees out here
you're<00:02:14.270> outside

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.540 

Adamo<00:02:20.990> maybe<00:02:21.990> eventually<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.680> Luciano<00:02:23.190> Rico

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
Adamo maybe eventually that Luciano Rico

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.300 
Adamo maybe eventually that Luciano Rico
I<00:02:23.960> just<00:02:24.960> have<00:02:25.080> nobody<00:02:25.320> has<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.770> crash<00:02:26.040> or

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310
