make a tutorial on how to create
residence<00:00:08.469> protection<00:00:09.100> here<00:00:10.030> in<00:00:10.180> Minecraft

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:11.049 
residence protection here in Minecraft

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.560 
residence protection here in Minecraft
so<00:00:11.500> I<00:00:11.740> get<00:00:12.070> started<00:00:12.369> here<00:00:12.879> first<00:00:13.330> thing<00:00:13.420> you

so I get started here first thing you
want<00:00:13.719> to<00:00:13.779> do<00:00:13.959> is<00:00:14.230> figure<00:00:14.830> out<00:00:14.980> exactly<00:00:15.730> the

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
want to do is figure out exactly the

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.910 
want to do is figure out exactly the
dimensions<00:00:16.359> that<00:00:16.570> you<00:00:16.720> want<00:00:16.960> to<00:00:16.990> protect<00:00:17.050> in

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
dimensions that you want to protect in

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.340 
dimensions that you want to protect in
this<00:00:18.100> case<00:00:18.400> I've<00:00:18.700> made<00:00:19.090> a<00:00:19.120> little<00:00:19.390> frame<00:00:19.750> here

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
this case I've made a little frame here

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.470 
this case I've made a little frame here
for<00:00:20.890> what<00:00:21.010> I<00:00:21.040> want<00:00:21.310> my<00:00:21.430> little<00:00:21.640> noob<00:00:21.910> Shack<00:00:22.270> to

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
for what I want my little noob Shack to

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.880 
for what I want my little noob Shack to
be<00:00:22.660> and<00:00:22.900> it's<00:00:23.140> six<00:00:23.470> by<00:00:23.830> six<00:00:23.890> by<00:00:24.760> six<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:26.260> what

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
be and it's six by six by six so what

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.359 
be and it's six by six by six so what
we're<00:00:27.039> going<00:00:27.130> to<00:00:27.250> do<00:00:27.369> first<00:00:27.400> is<00:00:29.130> select<00:00:30.130> this

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
we're going to do first is select this

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.450 
we're going to do first is select this
area<00:00:30.699> which<00:00:30.850> is<00:00:31.000> six<00:00:31.270> long<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.980> I<00:00:33.040> just<00:00:33.220> mark

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
area which is six long and I just mark

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.860 
area which is six long and I just mark
that<00:00:33.489> off<00:00:33.670> here<00:00:34.030> with<00:00:34.150> Coble<00:00:34.510> I<00:00:34.570> think<00:00:34.750> that's

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
that off here with Coble I think that's

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.170 
that off here with Coble I think that's
a<00:00:34.930> good<00:00:35.050> idea<00:00:35.170> just<00:00:35.440> gives<00:00:35.770> you<00:00:35.890> a<00:00:35.920> visual<00:00:36.180> so

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
a good idea just gives you a visual so

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.970 
a good idea just gives you a visual so
you<00:00:37.270> take<00:00:37.600> your<00:00:37.750> axe<00:00:37.960> this<00:00:38.530> is<00:00:38.710> step<00:00:38.950> number

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
you take your axe this is step number

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.760 
you take your axe this is step number
one<00:00:39.489> and<00:00:39.760> you<00:00:40.450> left<00:00:40.720> click<00:00:41.050> on<00:00:41.200> your<00:00:41.440> first

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
one and you left click on your first

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.400 
one and you left click on your first
point<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:43.510> is<00:00:43.570> going<00:00:43.840> to<00:00:43.899> place<00:00:44.200> your

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
point which is going to place your

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.590 
point which is going to place your
primary<00:00:44.950> selection<00:00:45.430> point<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:45.910> then<00:00:46.480> you

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
primary selection point and then you

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.430 
primary selection point and then you
right<00:00:46.840> click<00:00:46.870> on<00:00:47.410> your<00:00:47.850> second<00:00:48.850> point<00:00:49.440> that's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
right click on your second point that's

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.440 
right click on your second point that's
going<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.739> make<00:00:50.890> your<00:00:51.160> secondary<00:00:51.880> selection

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
going to make your secondary selection

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.600 
going to make your secondary selection
point<00:00:52.690> this<00:00:53.260> is<00:00:53.620> going<00:00:53.770> to<00:00:53.829> be<00:00:53.980> your<00:00:54.280> first

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
point this is going to be your first

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.479 
point this is going to be your first
dimensional<00:00:55.180> line<00:00:55.390> here<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:57.280> you've

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
dimensional line here that you've

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.639 
dimensional line here that you've
created<00:00:57.790> so<00:00:58.300> now<00:00:58.600> we<00:00:58.660> want<00:00:58.780> to<00:00:59.020> expand<00:00:59.440> that

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
created so now we want to expand that

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.360 
created so now we want to expand that
out<00:00:59.890> this<00:01:00.700> way<00:01:00.879> so<00:01:01.090> you<00:01:02.079> want<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.559> face<00:01:03.070> the

out this way so you want to face the

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.889 
out this way so you want to face the
direction<00:01:03.670> you<00:01:03.940> want<00:01:03.969> to<00:01:04.149> expand<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.749> that's

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
direction you want to expand and that's

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.169 
direction you want to expand and that's
very<00:01:05.049> important<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:06.850> type<00:01:07.149> r<00:01:07.450> as

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
very important and then you type r as

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:12.929 
very important and then you type r as
select<00:01:10.740> expand<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:12.310> I<00:01:12.369> want<00:01:12.549> to<00:01:12.609> make<00:01:12.729> buying

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
select expand and I want to make buying

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.599 
select expand and I want to make buying
a<00:01:13.119> total<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.539> six<00:01:13.869> so<00:01:14.859> since<00:01:15.280> we've<00:01:15.429> already

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
a total of six so since we've already

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.840 
a total of six so since we've already
selected<00:01:15.999> the<00:01:16.450> one<00:01:16.810> block<00:01:17.649> line<00:01:17.979> we<00:01:18.609> want<00:01:18.789> to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
selected the one block line we want to

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.199 
selected the one block line we want to
make<00:01:18.969> it<00:01:18.999> five<00:01:19.329> more<00:01:19.659> so<00:01:20.789> there<00:01:21.789> you<00:01:21.850> go<00:01:21.909> it

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:22.209 
make it five more so there you go it

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:24.629 
make it five more so there you go it
says<00:01:22.389> expanding<00:01:22.929> negative<00:01:23.380> exits<00:01:23.770> whatever

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:24.639 
says expanding negative exits whatever

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.879 
says expanding negative exits whatever
direction<00:01:24.819> you're<00:01:25.149> facing<00:01:25.289> so<00:01:26.289> now<00:01:26.560> we've

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:26.889 
direction you're facing so now we've

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:29.779 
direction you're facing so now we've
created<00:01:27.189> the<00:01:27.490> protection<00:01:27.999> for<00:01:28.479> this

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
created the protection for this

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.769 
created the protection for this
two-dimensional<00:01:30.789> area<00:01:31.090> but<00:01:31.299> we<00:01:31.389> want<00:01:31.569> to<00:01:31.630> make

00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:31.779 
two-dimensional area but we want to make

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:33.149 
two-dimensional area but we want to make
it<00:01:31.810> three<00:01:32.079> dimensions<00:01:32.469> we<00:01:32.590> want<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.859> have<00:01:33.009> it

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
it three dimensions we want to have it

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.330 
it three dimensions we want to have it
both<00:01:33.700> up<00:01:33.999> and<00:01:34.179> down<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:34.959> this<00:01:35.170> is<00:01:35.229> my<00:01:35.560> roof

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
both up and down so this is my roof

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.690 
both up and down so this is my roof
level<00:01:36.689> which<00:01:37.689> is<00:01:37.719> four<00:01:38.259> blocks<00:01:38.469> up<00:01:38.889> so<00:01:39.399> what

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
level which is four blocks up so what

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.649 
level which is four blocks up so what
you<00:01:39.819> want<00:01:39.969> to<00:01:40.029> do<00:01:40.149> is<00:01:40.450> look<00:01:41.229> upwards<00:01:41.799> and<00:01:42.659> type

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
you want to do is look upwards and type

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:50.810 
you want to do is look upwards and type
res<00:01:44.109> select<00:01:45.959> expand<00:01:46.959> sorry<00:01:48.450> for

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
res select expand sorry for

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
res select expand sorry for
and<00:01:51.090> there<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.690> you<00:01:51.930> just<00:01:52.020> expanded

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and there you go you just expanded

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.610 
and there you go you just expanded
upwards<00:01:53.479> so

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
upwards so

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.800 
upwards so
we<00:01:56.160> want<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.400> expand<00:01:56.760> downwards<00:01:57.330> it's<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.630> good

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
we want to expand downwards it's a good

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050 
we want to expand downwards it's a good
idea<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.230> do<00:01:58.410> that<00:01:58.440> you<00:01:58.680> don't<00:01:58.800> have<00:01:59.010> to<00:01:59.250> but<00:01:59.910> it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
idea to do that you don't have to but it

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.670 
idea to do that you don't have to but it
just<00:02:00.240> keeps<00:02:00.510> people<00:02:00.750> from<00:02:01.110> tunneling

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
just keeps people from tunneling

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.710 
just keeps people from tunneling
directly<00:02:02.310> under<00:02:02.550> your<00:02:02.640> residence<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.240> I'm

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
directly under your residence so I'm
