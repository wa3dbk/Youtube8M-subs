 of some of the videos from our 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.660
 channel and let's think a little bit of 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.050
 gameplay wearing line 94 with loaded 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.070
 fast and butt if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.660
 high school 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:06.030
 I think he was carrying the knife and 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.410
 advantages the hard line vest hardness 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.970
 scavenger is 4 is a nuclear or double 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.830
 nuclear file as you want to call it 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.620
 because the previous round stays with 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.720
 run of 23 and the nu that is a little bit 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.780
 adjusted time as you can see it 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.550
 it takes two seconds less to take it out and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.770
 well he has nothing more to say if 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.300
