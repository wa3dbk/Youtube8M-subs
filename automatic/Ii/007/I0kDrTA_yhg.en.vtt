00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.390
 14th edition of auto stories, I will continue 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.970
 to acquaint you with interesting tuning you 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.739
 options 124 mercedes 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.989
 So in 1986, specialists went 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.090
 brabus could pump your dohlenky 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.930
 carburetor 105 and a strong wagon 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.750
 200 tons 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.850
 102 motor of the car received 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.449
 new double weber carburetor 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.040
 as well as equal exhaust manifold 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:55.670
 resulting in recoil rising to 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.440
 136 forces besides this brabus 200-m 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.500
 got a brand kit 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 other wheels shorter 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.479
 shock absorbers and sports steering wheel acceleration with 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.200
 zero to one hundred kilometers per hour reduced 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.880
 from 14 to 12 seconds and the maximum speed increased 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.850
 from one hundred seventy three to one hundred 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.740
 eighty eight kilometers per hour 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.090
 improvements cost the customer in one thousand 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.970
 seven hundred and thirty pounds 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.700
 masters I for mg about the same year 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.150
 could give your 230 significantly 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.150
 more agility for this 136 strong 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.610
 motor 2 and 3 m102 equaled equal to long 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.270
 exhaust manifold a different exhaust 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.460
 system 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.030
 as well as more evil distributive 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.190
 shaft motor power rose to 160 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.350
 this was enough horsepower 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.300
 to accelerate the car from zero to one hundred 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.400
 kilometers per hour for eight point nine 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.060
 tenths of a second and develop on the highway 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.130
 speed of 220 kilometers per hour 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.260
 standard 230 and swap first 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.290
 a hundred in 10 point four seconds 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.020
 and accelerated to 200 three kilometers in 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.360
 hour in addition to finalizing the motor car 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.620
 I got a fault kit wider 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.709
 wheels and modified suspension in 1988 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.810
 year brabus released a modification and b4 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.780
 which was built on the basis of the model 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.340
 300 e by increasing the compression ratio 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.790
 managed to turn 180 strong 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.200
 205 sirin entire operation also allowed 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.780
 increase moment 255 newton meters to 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.940
 284 newton meters at 4000 them 800 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.160
 rpm minutes maximum speed 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.230
 this modification has grown from two hundred 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.269
 twenty five kilometers per hour to 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.040
 two hundred and forty three kilometers per hour 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.530
 acceleration from zero to one hundred kilometers per hour 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.810
 decreased to 7.4 seconds vs. 8.1 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.769
 A second earlier, again got a car 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.099
 corporate kit 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.829
 new 16-inch wheels with wider 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:57.480
 gum and sports shock absorber 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:59.819
 the price tag on b4 was 77,000 148 marks 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.010
 in addition to firms specializing in 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.650
 fine-tuning the motor exterior salons and 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.200
 pendants existed offices that are not 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.030
 touched the motor at all for example the company 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.340
 lorinser was turning you practically 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.860
 any sedan 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.540
 124 bodywork in a handsome handsome car 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.790
 got the original kit 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.519
 rich wood trim in the cabin 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.620
 new role rims original 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.549
 design and sports springs and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.329
 shock absorbers 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.549
 motor people from lorinser and not touched 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.410
 the carat company also offered 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.310
 good body kit for sedans and 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.060
 generalists 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.450
 and also began salons 124 even more 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.880
 tommy kaira's luxury Japanese company 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.560
 their time showed their point of view on 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.590
 tuning 124 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.669
 M300 model I got modified 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.000
 three-liter engine 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:52.950
 m103 for brochures is hard to say for sure 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.989
 most likely the Japanese have equipped the motor not 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.150
 only equal to the long collector but also 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.049
 applied a new camshaft and raised 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.510
 compression ratio 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.560
 recoil rose to two hundred twenty five 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.319
 horsepower 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.780
 m 30s got an elegant body kit and 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.030
 original rims in addition 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.000
 the trunk lid was decorated with not much 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.260
 rear wing 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.720
 in 1988 the German company about tenge 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.120
 for someone better known for tuning 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.690
 audi and volkswagen showed her eyes 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.450
 for revision 124 to cherish not particularly 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.480
 steel took a great motor m103 and 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.150
 increased its volume to 3.6 liters 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.630
 plus increased the compression ratio to 10 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.870
 whole 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.350
 units in the end the power rose to 240 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.050
 horsepower and the moment of decent 355 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.150
 newton meters already at three thousand 900 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.460
 rpm interior got 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.340
 speedometer marked up to 300 kilometers in 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.040
 hour and exterior only new wheels ronal 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.990
 and some attributes of the company such 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.870
 slipper in those early years could develop on 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.000
 highway speed is 250 kilometers per hour and 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.610
 get rid of the first hundred for seven whole 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.850
 one tenth of a second for those times it 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.780
 top s-class level 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.500
 124 we move the gear was estimated at 83 1558 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.540
 mac 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.880
 now let's get down to heavy 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.450
 reckless American artillery 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.180
 company ren those in 1992 brought about 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.729
 monster light called wounds those 600s 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.890
 not particularly difficult to guess what 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.770
 the hood of this devil settled 6 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.229
 liter engine but not m120 as they thought 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.919
 many a modified m119 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:35.440
 from the model 500sl 129 body its volume 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.780
 nurtured up to 6 liters a chip system 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:41.680
 control bosch injection replaced by 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.620
 m &amp; g tires recoil has risen 322 forces to 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.860
 an impressive 381 horsepower 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.590
 and the moment rose to 545 newton meters at 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.930
 three thousand 900 rpm and all 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.750
 this powerful force was shoved under the hood 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.240
 Modifications 300 e 4-speed automatic 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.160
 also had to take the 500sl model 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.690
 In this regard, I had a little 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.750
 remake the bottom of the car 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.430
 but all these improvements were worth that overclocking 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.500
 from zero to ninety seven kilometers in 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.960
 an hour occupied only four point nine 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.230
 tenths of a second a quarter mile from the field 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:18.040
 Sedan passed in 13.5 seconds 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:21.100
 and this is 0.4 seconds faster than 850 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.890
 sysoy and at the level of the newest top 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.790
 treshki 340 oh brabus also released 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.370
 similar model 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.330
 true its 6 liter engine built 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.020
 according to the same recipe 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.270
 gave out as much as 408 horsepower and moment in 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.640
 the monstrous 604 newton meters was 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.980
 already available at 3000 of 800 revolutions per 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.900
 minute even a giant rear tire 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.820
 two hundred and eighty five wide 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.740
 millimeters did not allow the machine 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.410
 start without smoke due to excess 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.720
 moment but still acceleration from zero to one hundred 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.270
 kilometers per hour impressed and occupied 5 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.190
 a full three tenths of a second a quarter 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.160
 miles from the place the car went faster 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:00.400
 than the 600th from the wounds of those finally the most evil 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.450
 tuning version 124 besides brabus and from 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.040
 last issue 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:08.350
 is the modification to hell at 12:07 barely 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:11.470
 built on the base of 500 e gorgeous 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:14.230
 326 strong motor m119 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.860
 excuse me for blasphemy was thrown out and 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:20.260
 replaced by monstrous 12-cylinder 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:24.280
 m120 working volume of which increased to 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:28.000
 7.2 liters capacity of this nuclear power plant 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.550
 reached 510 horsepower and moment 700 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.260
 newton meters this was enough to 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.570
 disperse heavy on board 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.730
 sedan up to a hundred kilometers per hour approximately 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:42.190
 in 4.5 seconds and accelerate on the chassis hd 

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:45.160
 330 kilometers per hour like this 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.200
 124 turned out to be a giant in terms of 

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.460
 tuning 

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.460
 Subscribe will be even more interesting
