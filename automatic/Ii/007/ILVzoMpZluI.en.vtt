but<00:04:27.310> you're<00:04:28.310> going<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.490> want<00:04:28.670> to<00:04:28.760> turn<00:04:28.910> that

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
but you're going to want to turn that

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.510 
but you're going to want to turn that
clockwise<00:04:30.110> or<00:04:32.140> now<00:04:33.140> just<00:04:33.530> Pok<00:04:33.800> wise<00:04:34.040> increase

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
clockwise or now just Pok wise increase

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.850 
clockwise or now just Pok wise increase
field<00:04:34.880> delivery<00:04:35.360> in<00:04:35.420> counter<00:04:36.380> clockwise<00:04:36.650> to

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
field delivery in counter clockwise to

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.310 
field delivery in counter clockwise to
decrease<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:38.570> field<00:04:38.780> delivery<00:04:39.320> so<00:04:39.710> uh<00:04:40.090> yeah

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
decrease the field delivery so uh yeah

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.670 
decrease the field delivery so uh yeah
it's<00:04:42.320> definitely<00:04:42.830> it<00:04:43.280> was<00:04:43.930> it's<00:04:44.930> a<00:04:45.080> lot<00:04:45.260> easier

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
it's definitely it was it's a lot easier

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.060 
it's definitely it was it's a lot easier
than<00:04:45.860> it<00:04:45.980> sounds<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:47.000> do<00:04:47.530> it<00:04:48.530> probably<00:04:48.919> took<00:04:49.010> me

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
than it sounds to do it probably took me

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.400 
than it sounds to do it probably took me
maybe<00:04:49.430> you<00:04:49.669> half<00:04:49.850> hour<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.270> do<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:50.450> but<00:04:50.780> most<00:04:51.230> of

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
maybe you half hour to do it but most of

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.710 
maybe you half hour to do it but most of
that<00:04:51.470> time<00:04:51.710> was<00:04:52.090> cranking<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.240> engine<00:04:53.270> over

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
that time was cranking the engine over

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.090 
that time was cranking the engine over
and<00:04:53.840> then<00:04:53.930> getting<00:04:54.140> back<00:04:54.320> up<00:04:54.350> on<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.860> agenda

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
and then getting back up on the agenda

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.030 
and then getting back up on the agenda
trying<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:56.240> find<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:58.460> set<00:04:59.210> screw<00:04:59.480> so<00:05:00.040> if

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
trying to find the the set screw so if

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.120 
trying to find the the set screw so if
you<00:05:01.250> have<00:05:01.400> a<00:05:01.430> friend<00:05:01.970> that<00:05:02.090> will<00:05:02.270> help<00:05:02.570> you

you have a friend that will help you

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.190 
you have a friend that will help you
turn<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.280> engine<00:05:04.580> over<00:05:04.720> look<00:05:05.720> for<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:05.990> set

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
turn the engine over look for the set

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.010 
turn the engine over look for the set
screw<00:05:06.470> one<00:05:06.650> of<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.800> two<00:05:06.950> and<00:05:07.669> elite<00:05:08.300> extremely

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
screw one of the two and elite extremely

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.170 
screw one of the two and elite extremely
easy<00:05:09.520> but<00:05:10.520> uh<00:05:10.550> I<00:05:11.650> recommend<00:05:12.650> doing<00:05:12.770> this<00:05:13.180> when

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
easy but uh I recommend doing this when

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
easy but uh I recommend doing this when
the<00:05:14.270> engine<00:05:14.570> is<00:05:14.690> cool

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
the engine is cool

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.190 
the engine is cool
because<00:05:15.979> I<00:05:16.190> wasn't<00:05:16.400> smart<00:05:16.729> enough<00:05:16.910> to<00:05:17.200> figure

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
because I wasn't smart enough to figure

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.219 
because I wasn't smart enough to figure
that<00:05:18.410> or<00:05:18.680> I<00:05:18.979> did<00:05:19.430> it<00:05:19.580> probably<00:05:20.270> 20<00:05:20.960> minutes

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
that or I did it probably 20 minutes

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.000 
that or I did it probably 20 minutes
after<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:21.620> drove<00:05:22.370> it<00:05:22.580> ten<00:05:22.850> miles<00:05:23.120> or<00:05:23.540> more<00:05:24.110> and

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
after I drove it ten miles or more and

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.360 
after I drove it ten miles or more and
the<00:05:25.970> engine<00:05:26.240> is<00:05:26.360> still<00:05:26.570> hot<00:05:26.780> and<00:05:27.020> I<00:05:27.200> I<00:05:27.500> burned

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
the engine is still hot and I I burned

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.219 
the engine is still hot and I I burned
my<00:05:28.550> hand<00:05:28.580> a<00:05:28.910> little<00:05:29.120> bit<00:05:29.270> but<00:05:29.570> it<00:05:30.610> yeah<00:05:32.200> what<00:05:33.200> I
