like GM their their job isn't just to

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.050 
like GM their their job isn't just to

figure out a way to get them to sell
them<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.750> idea<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.290> car<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.650> general<00:02:35.040> and

them in the idea of a car in general and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.060 
them in the idea of a car in general and
that's<00:02:36.300> that's<00:02:36.900> difficult<00:02:37.170> that's<00:02:37.680> saying

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
that's that's difficult that's saying

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.110 
that's that's difficult that's saying
you<00:02:38.160> know<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.700> have<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.880> change<00:02:39.060> your

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
you know you have to change your

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.000 
you know you have to change your
priorities<00:02:39.440> but<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.620> mean<00:02:40.800> let's<00:02:40.950> talk

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
priorities but so I mean let's talk

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.610 
priorities but so I mean let's talk
about<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.430> right<00:02:41.490> because<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.350> there<00:02:43.350> is<00:02:43.410> also

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
about that right because I there is also

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.490 
about that right because I there is also
this<00:02:44.130> notion<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.910> these<00:02:45.630> days<00:02:45.870> young<00:02:46.140> people

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
this notion that these days young people

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.990 
this notion that these days young people
would<00:02:46.620> rather<00:02:46.770> sit<00:02:47.370> around<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:47.730> facebook

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
would rather sit around on facebook

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.460 
would rather sit around on facebook
there<00:02:48.570> was<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> whole<00:02:48.900> piece<00:02:49.080> about<00:02:49.230> they<00:02:49.350> go

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
there was a whole piece about they go

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.170 
there was a whole piece about they go
nowhere<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> generation<00:02:50.460> and<00:02:50.610> how<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:50.970> only

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
nowhere a generation and how not only

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.310 
nowhere a generation and how not only
are<00:02:51.270> they<00:02:51.360> not<00:02:51.510> moving<00:02:51.810> out<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.960> their<00:02:52.020> parents

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
are they not moving out of their parents

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.240 
are they not moving out of their parents
house<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:52.590> they'd<00:02:52.740> rather<00:02:52.860> just<00:02:53.070> sit<00:02:53.190> around

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
house but they'd rather just sit around

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.160 
house but they'd rather just sit around
on<00:02:53.460> social<00:02:53.820> media<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.600> at<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.720> same<00:02:54.870> time<00:02:55.020> we

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
on social media but at the same time we

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.930 
on social media but at the same time we
like<00:02:55.350> our<00:02:55.440> gadgets<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.550> start<00:02:56.820> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
like our gadgets and so we start to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.760 
like our gadgets and so we start to
prioritize<00:02:57.480> things<00:02:57.720> like<00:02:57.960> having<00:02:58.560> an<00:02:58.650> iphone

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
prioritize things like having an iphone

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.610 
prioritize things like having an iphone
having<00:02:59.460> a<00:02:59.520> certain<00:02:59.850> game<00:03:00.480> console<00:03:01.200> but<00:03:01.470> those

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
having a certain game console but those

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.590 
having a certain game console but those
things<00:03:01.830> are<00:03:01.980> also<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.310> lot<00:03:02.460> cheaper<00:03:02.820> than<00:03:03.330> cars

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
things are also a lot cheaper than cars

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.020 
things are also a lot cheaper than cars
but<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.560> this<00:03:04.650> just<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.130> new<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.580> new

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
but is this just a new the new

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.340 
but is this just a new the new
counterculture<00:03:06.690> like<00:03:06.840> if<00:03:06.960> you<00:03:07.050> want<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.260> be

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
counterculture like if you want to be

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.660 
counterculture like if you want to be
the<00:03:07.440> cool<00:03:07.620> kid<00:03:07.800> in<00:03:07.920> high<00:03:08.010> school<00:03:08.310> you're<00:03:08.550> not

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
the cool kid in high school you're not

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.220 
the cool kid in high school you're not
so<00:03:08.910> worried<00:03:09.210> about<00:03:09.270> what<00:03:09.870> car<00:03:10.050> you're<00:03:10.140> gonna

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.930 
so worried about what car you're gonna
get<00:03:10.410> on<00:03:10.530> your<00:03:10.650> 16th<00:03:11.010> birthday<00:03:11.070> but<00:03:11.550> what<00:03:11.730> cell

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
get on your 16th birthday but what cell

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.670 
get on your 16th birthday but what cell
phone<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.270> get<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.930> some<00:03:13.110> degree<00:03:13.230> yeah<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:13.650> i

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
phone you get to some degree yeah but i

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.590 
phone you get to some degree yeah but i
think<00:03:13.740> you<00:03:14.100> know<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:15.180> even<00:03:15.450> more

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
think you know it's even more

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.650 
think you know it's even more
fundamental<00:03:15.840> than<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.470> if<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.610> look<00:03:17.850> at<00:03:18.090> Gen

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
fundamental than that if you look at Gen

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.010 
fundamental than that if you look at Gen
Y<00:03:18.810> where<00:03:19.080> we<00:03:19.230> live<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:20.940> know<00:03:21.060> what<00:03:21.540> kind<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.930> a

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
Y where we live you know what kind of a

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.690 
Y where we live you know what kind of a
community<00:03:22.470> we<00:03:22.560> want<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.830> be<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.040> we're<00:03:23.580> more

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
community we want to be in we're more

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.330 
community we want to be in we're more
urban<00:03:24.060> than<00:03:24.540> Gen<00:03:25.020> X<00:03:25.170> was<00:03:25.350> we're<00:03:25.800> more<00:03:25.950> urban

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
urban than Gen X was we're more urban

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.210 
urban than Gen X was we're more urban
than<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.880> boomers<00:03:27.180> were<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.440> those<00:03:28.980> numbers

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
than the boomers were and those numbers

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.370 
than the boomers were and those numbers
come<00:03:29.370> from<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:30.000> pew<00:03:30.570> research<00:03:30.900> study<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:31.230> few

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
come from a pew research study a few

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.570 
come from a pew research study a few
years<00:03:31.440> back<00:03:31.710> that<00:03:31.770> looked<00:03:32.070> at<00:03:32.190> actually<00:03:32.550> how

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
years back that looked at actually how

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.250 
years back that looked at actually how
many<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.060> us<00:03:33.150> were<00:03:33.300> living<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.630> city<00:03:33.840> centres

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
many of us were living in city centres

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.260 
many of us were living in city centres
and<00:03:34.470> then<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.460> know<00:03:35.550> about<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.760> think<00:03:36.000> it's

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
and then you know about I think it's

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.120 
and then you know about I think it's
thirty<00:03:36.510> two<00:03:36.690> percent<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:37.410> live<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:37.980> city

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
thirty two percent that live in a city

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.890 
thirty two percent that live in a city
itself<00:03:38.460> and<00:03:38.730> then<00:03:39.180> beyond<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.540> there

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
itself and then beyond that there

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.660 
itself and then beyond that there
another<00:03:40.080> 88<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.650> total<00:03:41.130> about<00:03:41.310> eighty<00:03:41.490> eight

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
another 88 a total about eighty eight

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.950 
another 88 a total about eighty eight
percent<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:42.320> Gen<00:03:43.320> Y<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:44.790> want<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.150> live<00:03:45.510> want

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
percent of Gen Y that want to live want

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.260 
percent of Gen Y that want to live want
to<00:03:46.110> live<00:03:46.260> in<00:03:46.290> an<00:03:46.500> urban<00:03:46.590> center<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.640> if<00:03:48.120> they

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
to live in an urban center so if they

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.730 
to live in an urban center so if they
can't<00:03:48.480> live<00:03:48.600> in<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.750> city<00:03:48.900> they'll<00:03:49.260> live<00:03:49.440> in<00:03:49.680> a

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
can't live in the city they'll live in a

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.170 
can't live in the city they'll live in a
nearby<00:03:49.920> suburb<00:03:50.400> where<00:03:50.550> they<00:03:50.640> can<00:03:50.790> walk<00:03:50.910> around

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
nearby suburb where they can walk around

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.390 
nearby suburb where they can walk around
kind<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.510> like<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.720> Fez<00:03:51.900> dead<00:03:52.080> near<00:03:52.290> here<00:03:52.530> or

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
kind of like the Fez dead near here or

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.680 
kind of like the Fez dead near here or
you<00:03:53.490> can<00:03:53.550> take<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.910> metra<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.240> guess<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.600> get

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
you can take the metra I guess to get

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.120 
you can take the metra I guess to get
into<00:03:54.990> the<00:03:55.110> center<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.380> see<00:03:55.500> if<00:03:55.830> that's<00:03:56.010> where

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
into the center you see if that's where

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.250 
into the center you see if that's where
your<00:03:56.250> office<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.210> it's<00:03:57.690> beyond<00:03:57.960> even

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
your office is and so it's beyond even

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.110 
your office is and so it's beyond even
what<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.710> know<00:03:58.830> what<00:03:59.100> product<00:03:59.580> we<00:03:59.700> want<00:03:59.910> it's

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
variety of reasons but didn't seem to

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.379 
variety of reasons but didn't seem to
work<00:06:12.240> so<00:06:12.389> well<00:06:12.570> so<00:06:12.780> Jim<00:06:13.380> is<00:06:13.680> trying<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.729> do<00:06:14.880> is

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
work so well so Jim is trying to do is

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:17.420 
work so well so Jim is trying to do is
trying<00:06:15.780> to<00:06:15.900> basically<00:06:16.080> you<00:06:16.710> know<00:06:16.800> tweak<00:06:17.280> that

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
trying to basically you know tweak that

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.589 
trying to basically you know tweak that
and<00:06:17.639> hopefully<00:06:17.789> succeed<00:06:18.090> where<00:06:18.389> others<00:06:18.570> have

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599 
and hopefully succeed where others have

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.260 
and hopefully succeed where others have
failed<00:06:18.719> and<00:06:19.199> again<00:06:20.099> it's<00:06:20.310> it's<00:06:20.729> extra<00:06:21.090> hard

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
failed and again it's it's extra hard

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.850 
failed and again it's it's extra hard
because<00:06:21.479> it's<00:06:21.719> not<00:06:21.870> just<00:06:21.930> getting<00:06:22.620> them<00:06:22.740> to

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
because it's not just getting them to

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.909 
because it's not just getting them to
buy<00:06:23.009> any<00:06:23.520> car<00:06:24.090> it's<00:06:24.539> getting<00:06:24.780> to<00:06:24.840> sell<00:06:25.590> them<00:06:25.800> on

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
buy any car it's getting to sell them on

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.350 
buy any car it's getting to sell them on
the<00:06:25.949> idea<00:06:26.250> of<00:06:26.370> a<00:06:26.460> well<00:06:26.639> let's<00:06:26.940> say<00:06:27.060> that<00:06:27.240> this

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.079 
is you know fairly permanent yeah be it
because<00:06:31.139> of<00:06:31.169> the<00:06:31.590> cultural<00:06:32.400> factors<00:06:32.789> be<00:06:33.000> it
