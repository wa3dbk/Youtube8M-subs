00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.940 
a really awesome a nice-looking Hulk
fill<00:02:03.149> gear<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.200> rotates<00:02:04.590> all<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> way

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
fill gear so it rotates all the way

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.630 
fill gear so it rotates all the way
around<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:06.500> there's<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.799> down<00:02:08.009> action<00:02:08.310> so

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
around and there's up and down action so

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.080 
around and there's up and down action so
that's<00:02:08.819> good<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.410> limit<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:11.370> arm<00:02:11.640> but

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
that's good this can limit this arm but

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.320 
that's good this can limit this arm but
because<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:12.900> kind<00:02:13.140> of

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
because it's kind of

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.730 
because it's kind of
loose<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.780> little<00:02:13.930> bit<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.260> can<00:02:14.350> still<00:02:14.590> do

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
loose a little bit you can still do

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.340 
loose a little bit you can still do
everything<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:16.210> arm<00:02:16.390> they<00:02:16.660> both<00:02:16.840> arms<00:02:17.170> have

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
everything the arm they both arms have

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.250 
everything the arm they both arms have
the<00:02:17.470> same<00:02:17.710> amount<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.100> articulation<00:02:19.080> got<00:02:20.080> that

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the same amount of articulation got that

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.070 
the same amount of articulation got that
joint<00:02:20.710> there<00:02:21.010> in<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.790> single<00:02:22.180> at<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.360> elbow<00:02:22.810> and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
joint there in a single at the elbow and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.100 
joint there in a single at the elbow and
hand<00:02:23.500> rotate<00:02:24.190> here<00:02:24.430> as<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.850> can<00:02:24.880> see<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.750> all

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
hand rotate here as you can see that all

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.260 
hand rotate here as you can see that all
the<00:02:26.380> weapons<00:02:26.650> fit<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.040> there<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.820> just<00:02:28.150> they

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
the weapons fit in there it's just they

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.030 
the weapons fit in there it's just they
fall<00:02:28.540> through<00:02:28.810> but<00:02:29.020> since<00:02:29.260> it's<00:02:29.410> closed<00:02:29.770> they

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
fall through but since it's closed they

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.400 
fall through but since it's closed they
won't<00:02:30.370> come<00:02:30.670> out<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.780> that's<00:02:31.960> really<00:02:32.110> good

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
won't come out so that's really good

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.030 
won't come out so that's really good
then<00:02:32.740> we<00:02:33.160> have<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.580> AB<00:02:33.900> up<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.170> down<00:02:35.350> really

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
then we have the AB up and down really

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.350
