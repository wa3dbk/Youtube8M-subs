00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.280
 welcome licked lenovo and lenovo did 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.570
 not presented that an ultrabook 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.529
 we also have a tablet that is very 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.480
 interesting because it's a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.720
 tablet that is 8 inches that's the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.609
 thinkpad has the tablet so has the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.320
 tablet 8 2 new tests 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.510
 tablet is not the first of people 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.599
 we also saw similar formats 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.130
 at acer with the w4 iconia w4 we have 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.840
 also the same thing at dell with 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.050
 the pro come and we see there the model 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.890
 from lenovo a 7-inch tablet on 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.320
 windows 8 points 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.110
 powered by bate reis and the last 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.300
 intel atom processor that has very 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.899
 good performance 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.360
 only 8.8 mm thick a 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.820
 autonomy of about 8 hours is thanks 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.710
 among others to this processor then we 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.449
 has a tablet with a very good 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.620
 finish 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.730
 I think it 's carbon fiber 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.670
 or plastic but in any case the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.989
 finish is very correct so for 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.010
 reminder the thinkpad range this is 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.619
 tablets that are rather oriented 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.840
 professional and so we find between 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.030
 other windows 8 pro with following 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.540
 office includes so it's real windows 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.000
 8 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.159
 there we have the touch interface we can to 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.220
 any time spent on the interface that 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.810
 you recognize who is the interface or 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.640
 and two classics and what do I 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.350
 wanted to tell you oh there are you saying 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.170
 that we had we are therefore a new 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.420
 looks like covered ipad and so 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.689
 the power put it up through a 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.689
 magnet 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.180
 when and if I get there I'm almost 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.920
 there is a precise meaning here there is a sense 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.920
 also so there I can use like that 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.910
 and I can at any time 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.610
 straighten and look at it I just 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.460
 make up for it to open 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.480
 automatically the camera or not 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.480
 there is more to take a picture 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.450
 so here I took a picture that's 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.400
 quite responsive it remains a photo sensor 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.460
 of tablets windows 8 not a name we 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.540
 do not ask them too much 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.940
 yeah that's pretty complete we have a 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.240
 video conferencing camera in the front there 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.430
 will have a version 3g and 4g and so that's 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.320
 a model that is pretty well finished 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.680
 I finish with the connection is very 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.610
 interesting we have on one side of the usb 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.520
 3.0 which will allow to connect a 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.770
 a small box docking a dock and that 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.800
 can give access to several usb but 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.740
 also a dvi port and all 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.760
 classic PC connectivity of the other 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.870
 side I have access to the microsd for 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.660
 able to extend the memory that is 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.000
 often 32 between 32 and 64 giga on this 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.080
 kind of device at 32 gigas we are at 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.140
 300 euros so it's a microsd port 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.700
 widely needed we also and 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.670
 that's not the case with competitors 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.350
 but we have a micro hdmi that allows very 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.700
 easily connect a screen and 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.709
 this is the point of interest 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.540
 is that you have a tablet for 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.920
 hobbies that you will be able to enter 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.780
 in your costume pocket for example 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.459
 or your bag and you're going to be able to 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.900
 any time at home at 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.560
 work and plug a screen 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.780
 whether in usb 3.0 in micro hdmi and 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.400
 then have keyboard mice without 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.810
 wire or with film to be able 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.310
 turn this little tablet into 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.950
 real pc with performance 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.320
 lembeye trail and so its about 300 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.989
 300 euros it will be 300 dollars to the states 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.730
 united for a device that is not the 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.200
 first and that has the same positioning 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.120
 than the others but who looks a little 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.390
 more provided in characteristics 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.400
 connectivity this was there 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.400
 new heitz tablets
