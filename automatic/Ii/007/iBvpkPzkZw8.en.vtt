00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
just to hold the curl while it cool down

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.720 
just to hold the curl while it cool down
and<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:52.070> was<00:04:52.280> really<00:04:52.550> amazed<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.450> how<00:04:53.960> well<00:04:54.730> the

hair<00:04:56.180> held<00:04:56.750> this<00:04:56.930> curl<00:04:57.350> after<00:04:58.190> I<00:04:58.220> removed<00:04:58.730> the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
hair held this curl after I removed the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.470 
hair held this curl after I removed the
the<00:04:59.870> clips<00:05:00.200> so<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:00.920> will<00:05:01.520> see<00:05:01.550> some<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.330> the

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
the clips so you will see some of the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.900 
the clips so you will see some of the
curl<00:05:02.690> pattern<00:05:03.170> came<00:05:03.680> out<00:05:03.830> really<00:05:04.070> really<00:05:04.220> soft

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
for me I like elusive curl so I ran my

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.480 
for me I like elusive curl so I ran my
fingers<00:05:58.440> through<00:05:58.470> my<00:05:58.740> hair<00:05:58.860> just<00:05:59.100> a<00:05:59.460> little
