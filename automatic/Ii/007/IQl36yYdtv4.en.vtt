00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.740
 Now we have a lot more to follow. 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:25.019
 You in our meeting today, the people 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.180
 will know and talk with Andrew about other 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.609
 issues during our termites encounters 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.160
 our closets, our clothes do not 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.930
 our book cabinets and there the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.530
 Andrew attractions will select to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.530
 people, let's go 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.309
 in situations like this are more 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.719
 what we imagine 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.550
 when you come across, for example, 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.260
 mdf that a lot of people talk about termite not 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.129
 attacked looking so it looks like it is 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.570
 okay right 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.870
 but I'll show you that I will not 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.800
 is not even a good look at the action of the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.920
 termites 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.780
 exactly in this mdf you did not build your 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.670
 life is your nest here and really 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.180
 destroyed and by doing so until 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.400
 stone is very sensitive and may 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.439
 Andr, how is it that who arrives in this 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.140
 state and why it goes directly 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.450
 in wood and mdf also it is 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.240
 different from termites as we saw 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.820
 previously in tmtv there in the garden 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.930
 these termites are termites that have changed 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.960
 behavior 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.150
 today they are termites that live in an environment 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.409
 urbanized and enter the buildings 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.240
 urban 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.790
 so they enter as they enter through 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.909
 only in the case of single-family houses 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.210
 They enter the ground they 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:41.100
 closes sink head cabinet day d of 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.250
 Bathroom is dumb from door and baseboards like 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.470
 I say like these to mf for example then 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.990
 forum and how I explained that the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.570
 copy is a social insect they are 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.149
 looking for cellulose to feed 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.909
 so it's a mistake there are some companies that 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.159
 They say that the house will fall to such a lonely house. 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.740
 will fall it was all wood and 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.719
 Then, in this quest you can eat clothes. 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.399
 attack can eat clothing with which you can 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.009
 cotton clothing 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.259
 he can also attack leather despite 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.750
 leather is of animal origin but because of 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.740
 of leather tanning it ends 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.630
 being attractive 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.570
 You can feed and other cururu 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.540
 materials such as the insulation cover 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.460
 electrical wires, which can cause 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.650
 is also short circuits this can 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.530
 to perceive with the naked eye those to lines 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.330
 so really is a moment a clue 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.160
 What is there termite? 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.810
 so I want to show you both here and 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.260
 if you would do the line you said in 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.710
 It's true that 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.250
 this is it here that only that is actually it 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.250
 here are the faeces of the wooden body 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.350
 dry to suffer is but it is wood 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.200
 this is a wood look is grândola 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.200
 dinho're what you usually see falls 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.510
 furniture and piano up clothes hanger 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.250
 You also have the problem is that many 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.520
 Sometimes the problem is not in the closet and 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:07.350
 if it does not fit this kind of thing here he 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.930
 it is stated that the piece of wood 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.710
 is being attacked by wood termite 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.690
 dry what is this bug this bicho is a 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.390
 insect that lives inside the 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.000
 way that little boy I already 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.280
 I explained to you live in the play that he 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.130
 is attacking right here we have 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.410
 some examples of termites is that they are well 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.610
 small to them are very 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.280
 tiny 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.710
 are termites that are often 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.410
 confused like ants for 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.180
 example and in fact is not a tip 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.830
 that I give is that the amount of this 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.270
 bug is too big 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:47.490
 the form and form of displacement and 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.980
 here we have a 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.400
 huge termite queen 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.280
 if you compare and the workers is with a 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.190
 with this queen who was this size 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.600
 it's because it's full of eggs function 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:06.270
 of the queen is laying eggs daily 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.460
 for the maintenance of the nest population 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.020
 It's not good for us to identify them now. 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.420
 will show what they are capable of 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.100
 do incitations here that are our 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.930
 cause a cause very astonishing let's go 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.489
 to show the truth is actually the 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.680
 next we have a wood that 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.260
 wood was placed is not only can 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.390
 hit her and when you open you 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.150
 realize that this one is already attacking 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.430
 cup me and the subterranean termite is 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.970
 came here he ate the whole piece of 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.990
 wood look you see this stuff 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.330
 that you see here is also a 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.360
 what a sign that occupy that passed here 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.030
 it was the subterranean termite if it's a taco we 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.770
 We'll take that piece if you can turn 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.720
 Look, you see that under the club you have 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.639
 warming still covered here 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.990
 the subterranean termite has passed through here 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.990
 also got 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.060
 Now take a look at the state 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.370
 What did this book look like? 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.590
 how termites are silent and fast 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.420
 also because the action is fast is not yes 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.820
 the action is very fast as I mentioned the 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.610
 the main subterranean termite 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.470
 attacked that book including they have 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.680
 many workers in search of pulp 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.930
 So they got a book that they 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.970
 they could have the deed of their house 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.520
 birth certificate of marriage or 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.910
 be documents citizen's importance 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.090
 Just like dead file companies 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.060
 documentation, then you need to 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.560
 be very careful because they can 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.800
 cause this kind of damage because because 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.200
 paper is cellulose and then as the 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.050
 wood is a cellulose processed in 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.730
 but it is a fantastic source of 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.200
 food for them is very important 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.660
 also to be careful with the 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.970
 preservation of documentation of 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.880
 documentation in the series of 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.630
 citizen's documentation and order and all 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.730
 that tells the story is of the 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.380
 books with our story is that it has 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.150
 a history of mankind right? 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.130
 if he does not have the control he can 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.320
 Destroy even people are taking 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.460
 you a lot of information with these 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.380
 common situations that people 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.330
 live our daily lives that our 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.070
 parents, I invite our friends to 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.450

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.370
 to give you not to let it arrive 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.040
 in these situations here that we show 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.600
 for you right you lose damage in many 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.220
 the consequences because they happen 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.340
 accidents also when strip with 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.780
