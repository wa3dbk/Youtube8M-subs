up<00:02:02.830> against<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.520> saw<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:04.600> keep<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:05.020> nice<00:02:05.260> and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
up against the saw to keep it nice and

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.870 
up against the saw to keep it nice and
straight<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:06.130> of<00:02:06.310> course<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.610> have<00:02:06.729> my

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
straight and of course I have my

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.960 
straight and of course I have my
straight<00:02:07.330> line<00:02:07.360> here<00:02:07.930> so<00:02:08.229> hey<00:02:11.700> well<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.850> was

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
straight line here so hey well that was

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:13.440 
straight line here so hey well that was
cool

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
cool

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.820 
cool
of<00:02:13.600> course<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:14.290> would<00:02:14.440> have<00:02:14.530> been<00:02:14.650> way

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
of course that would have been way

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.520 
of course that would have been way
easier<00:02:14.860> on<00:02:15.400> my<00:02:15.520> miter<00:02:15.760> saw<00:02:16.030> okay<00:02:16.930> now<00:02:17.260> I'll

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
easier on my miter saw okay now I'll

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.510 
easier on my miter saw okay now I'll
flip<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.459> around<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:19.380> square<00:02:20.380> off<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:21.130> other

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
flip it around and square off the other

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:32.430 
flip it around and square off the other
side<00:02:28.770> now<00:02:29.770> I'm<00:02:29.980> just<00:02:30.190> going<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.640> draw<00:02:31.300> an<00:02:31.750> angle

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
side now I'm just going to draw an angle

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.610 
side now I'm just going to draw an angle
on<00:02:32.980> here<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.850> really<00:02:34.750> have<00:02:34.870> no<00:02:35.050> idea<00:02:35.080> what<00:02:35.500> this

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
on here I really have no idea what this

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.870 
on here I really have no idea what this
angle<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:36.780> hey<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:38.830> looks<00:02:39.040> good<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.550> don't

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
angle is but hey that looks good I don't

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.060 
angle is but hey that looks good I don't
know<00:02:40.030> if<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.150> can<00:02:40.269> see<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.810> because<00:02:41.410> well

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
know if you can see this because well

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.710 
know if you can see this because well
it's<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.310> dark<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:42.760> here<00:02:42.820> but<00:02:43.180> I've<00:02:43.300> got<00:02:43.330> this

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
it's so dark in here but I've got this

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.620 
it's so dark in here but I've got this
one<00:02:44.200> line<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.560> I've<00:02:45.010> drawn<00:02:45.370> down<00:02:45.880> there<00:02:46.360> and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
one line that I've drawn down there and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.600 
one line that I've drawn down there and
I'm<00:02:46.690> going<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.900> use<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.230> thickness<00:02:48.190> or<00:02:48.489> the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
I'm going to use the thickness or the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.259 
I'm going to use the thickness or the
width<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.239> this<00:02:50.820> ruler<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:52.360> draw<00:02:52.600> another<00:02:52.870> line

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
width of this ruler to draw another line

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.300 
width of this ruler to draw another line
right<00:02:55.269> here<00:02:55.810> now<00:02:56.320> I'm<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.769> going<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.130> make<00:02:57.280> a

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
right here now I'm just going to make a

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.600 
right here now I'm just going to make a
line<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:58.269> square<00:02:59.019> line<00:02:59.350> connecting<00:03:00.010> this<00:03:00.340> line

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
line a square line connecting this line

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.940 
line a square line connecting this line
and<00:03:00.940> this<00:03:01.090> line<00:03:01.150> I'm<00:03:01.930> going<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.170> make<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.440> right

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
and this line I'm going to make it right

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.850 
and this line I'm going to make it right
across<00:03:03.370> here<00:03:03.910> let<00:03:04.810> me<00:03:04.900> take<00:03:05.050> it<00:03:05.170> out<00:03:05.230> here<00:03:05.470> it's

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
across here let me take it out here it's

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.740 
across here let me take it out here it's
a<00:03:05.920> little<00:03:06.010> bit<00:03:06.220> brighter<00:03:06.489> maybe<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.330> can<00:03:07.510> see

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
a little bit brighter maybe you can see

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.729 
a little bit brighter maybe you can see
these<00:03:07.900> lines<00:03:08.170> better

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
these lines better

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.050 
these lines better
okay<00:03:09.070> so<00:03:09.130> there's<00:03:09.900> lines<00:03:10.900> here<00:03:11.410> here<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.040> here

going
you<00:03:25.390> know<00:03:25.510> as<00:03:26.700> vertically<00:03:27.700> as<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.420> can<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.740> take

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
you know as vertically as I can and take

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
you know as vertically as I can and take
it<00:03:30.310> right<00:03:30.700> down<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.570> that<00:03:32.110> mark<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:36.340> cut<00:03:36.940> out

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
it right down to that mark and cut out

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.890 
it right down to that mark and cut out
this<00:03:37.500> little<00:03:38.500> angle<00:03:38.770> piece<00:03:39.390> again<00:03:40.390> trying<00:03:40.750> to

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
this little angle piece again trying to

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.920 
this little angle piece again trying to
stay<00:03:41.230> as<00:03:41.290> vertically<00:03:42.130> as<00:03:42.520> possible<00:03:43.450> let<00:03:43.840> me

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
stay as vertically as possible let me

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.750 
stay as vertically as possible let me
come<00:03:44.080> out<00:03:44.110> to<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.440> light<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.890> show<00:03:45.160> you<00:03:45.220> what

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
come out to the light and show you what

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.780 
come out to the light and show you what
I've<00:03:45.880> got<00:03:45.910> here<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:46.990> two<00:03:47.340> lines<00:03:48.340> running<00:03:48.700> down

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
I've got here is two lines running down

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.300 
I've got here is two lines running down
there<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.210> this<00:03:49.690> is<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.170> center<00:03:50.710> point<00:03:51.010> so

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
there and this is the center point so

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.180 
there and this is the center point so
now<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.730> can<00:03:51.940> separate<00:03:52.420> these<00:03:52.720> draw<00:03:53.260> or<00:03:53.590> cut<00:03:54.040> a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
now I can separate these draw or cut a

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.080 
now I can separate these draw or cut a
groove<00:03:54.430> in<00:03:55.020> this<00:03:56.020> side<00:03:56.350> of<00:03:56.650> one<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.220> this<00:03:57.820> side

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
groove in this side of one and this side

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.510 
groove in this side of one and this side
of<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.510> other<00:03:58.690> piece<00:03:59.010> okay<00:04:00.010> like<00:04:00.220> I<00:04:00.400> just

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
of the other piece okay like I just

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.790 
of the other piece okay like I just
showed<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.970> I<00:04:01.000> made<00:04:01.630> that<00:04:01.780> line<00:04:02.050> on<00:04:02.410> there<00:04:02.650> and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
showed you I made that line on there and

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.710 
showed you I made that line on there and
I<00:04:02.830> haven't<00:04:03.070> separated<00:04:03.580> my<00:04:03.760> board<00:04:04.030> yet<00:04:04.270> but<00:04:04.690> I

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
I haven't separated my board yet but I

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.000 
I haven't separated my board yet but I
thought<00:04:04.930> well<00:04:05.290> that<00:04:05.440> was<00:04:05.560> really<00:04:05.710> dumb

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
thought well that was really dumb

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.370 
thought well that was really dumb
because<00:04:06.580> if<00:04:07.390> I<00:04:07.600> separate<00:04:07.990> these<00:04:08.170> I'm<00:04:08.350> not

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
because if I separate these I'm not

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.720 
because if I separate these I'm not
going<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.650> have<00:04:08.740> a<00:04:08.800> line<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.250> other<00:04:09.370> board

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
going to have a line on the other board

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.210 
going to have a line on the other board
so<00:04:10.330> naturally<00:04:11.020> I<00:04:11.050> had<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.350> take<00:04:11.800> the<00:04:12.040> line

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
so naturally I had to take the line

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.680 
so naturally I had to take the line
around<00:04:12.730> here<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:13.810> was<00:04:14.200> able<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.530> draw<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.690> line

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
around here so I was able to draw a line

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.789 
around here so I was able to draw a line
on<00:04:16.989> this<00:04:17.709> side<00:04:18.070> of<00:04:18.310> this<00:04:18.609> board<00:04:19.320> now<00:04:20.320> I<00:04:20.350> can<00:04:20.620> cut

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
on this side of this board now I can cut

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.070 
on this side of this board now I can cut
them<00:04:20.890> out<00:04:21.450> but<00:04:22.450> wait

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
them out but wait

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.590 
them out but wait
I<00:04:23.110> had<00:04:23.440> another<00:04:23.740> revelation<00:04:24.340> all<00:04:25.000> I<00:04:25.060> have<00:04:25.450> to

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
do is now that I've got these separated

do is now that I've got these separated
is<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.420> I've<00:04:28.540> got<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.750> lines<00:04:28.960> there<00:04:29.440> the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
is and I've got the lines there the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.320 
is and I've got the lines there the
groove<00:04:30.160> that<00:04:30.370> I<00:04:30.430> want<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.669> cut<00:04:30.850> in<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.090> groove

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
groove that I want to cut in the groove

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.870 
groove that I want to cut in the groove
I<00:04:31.510> want<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.750> cut<00:04:31.930> here<00:04:32.410> is<00:04:32.530> I<00:04:33.070> can<00:04:33.310> just<00:04:33.340> line

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
I want to cut here is I can just line

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.010 
I want to cut here is I can just line
these<00:04:34.150> up<00:04:34.330> like<00:04:34.780> that<00:04:36.180> put<00:04:37.180> those<00:04:37.450> in<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.810> vise

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
these up like that put those in the vise

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.650 
these up like that put those in the vise
and<00:04:38.320> I'll<00:04:38.440> just<00:04:38.620> cut<00:04:38.980> out<00:04:39.160> this<00:04:39.520> one<00:04:39.910> section

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
and I'll just cut out this one section

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.030 
and I'll just cut out this one section
the<00:04:41.590> power<00:04:41.860> just<00:04:42.310> came<00:04:42.580> back<00:04:42.790> on<00:04:43.950> but<00:04:44.950> I'm

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
the power just came back on but I'm

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.100 
the power just came back on but I'm
going<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.250> continue<00:04:45.580> this<00:04:45.880> project<00:04:46.510> by<00:04:46.720> hand

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
way and it's a challenge to myself well

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.230 
way and it's a challenge to myself well
I've<00:04:53.140> got<00:04:53.320> both<00:04:53.500> pieces<00:04:53.830> in<00:04:54.100> my<00:04:54.250> vise<00:04:54.550> now<00:04:54.910> and

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
I've got both pieces in my vise now and

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.840 
I've got both pieces in my vise now and
I'm<00:04:55.510> just<00:04:55.540> following<00:04:56.230> this<00:04:56.380> line<00:04:56.770> all<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.820> way

I'm just following this line all the way

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.180 
I'm just following this line all the way
down

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
the second quarter and there's still

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.410 
the second quarter and there's still
seven<00:05:28.450> and<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:28.630> half<00:05:28.660> minutes<00:05:29.940> yeah<00:05:30.940> this<00:05:31.270> is<00:05:31.390> a

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
seven and a half minutes yeah this is a

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.170 
seven and a half minutes yeah this is a
good<00:05:31.690> old<00:05:31.840> fashioned<00:05:32.460> butt-kickin<00:05:33.460> it<00:05:33.970> has

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
good old fashioned butt-kickin it has

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.620 
good old fashioned butt-kickin it has
taken<00:05:34.570> a<00:05:34.960> lot<00:05:35.740> of<00:05:36.660> chiseling<00:05:37.660> and<00:05:38.850> sanding<00:05:39.850> but

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
taken a lot of chiseling and sanding but

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.870 
taken a lot of chiseling and sanding but
it's<00:05:41.140> starting<00:05:41.440> to<00:05:41.620> fit<00:05:41.920> together<00:05:42.100> and<00:05:42.670> you

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
it's starting to fit together and you

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.060 
it's starting to fit together and you
can<00:05:43.060> see<00:05:43.330> that<00:05:43.900> I<00:05:44.080> should<00:05:44.590> have<00:05:44.680> made<00:05:44.890> these

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
can see that I should have made these

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.130 
can see that I should have made these
grooves<00:05:45.370> a<00:05:45.580> lot<00:05:45.790> bigger<00:05:46.240> to<00:05:46.420> begin<00:05:46.750> with<00:05:46.930> and<00:05:47.110> I

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
grooves a lot bigger to begin with and I

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.630 
grooves a lot bigger to begin with and I
wouldn't<00:05:47.350> have<00:05:47.470> had<00:05:47.590> so<00:05:47.800> much<00:05:47.950> of<00:05:48.010> that<00:05:48.220> to<00:05:48.370> do

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
wouldn't have had so much of that to do

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.510 
wouldn't have had so much of that to do
so<00:05:49.330> anyways<00:05:49.930> it's<00:05:50.170> almost<00:05:50.620> equal<00:05:51.130> there<00:05:51.340> and

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
so anyways it's almost equal there and

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.600 
so anyways it's almost equal there and
that's<00:05:51.970> where<00:05:52.480> the<00:05:52.810> picture<00:05:53.320> will<00:05:53.770> sit<00:05:54.340> I

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
that's where the picture will sit I

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.400 
that's where the picture will sit I
don't<00:05:55.090> have<00:05:55.300> a<00:05:55.330> design<00:05:55.750> for<00:05:56.080> this<00:05:56.200> that<00:05:56.380> you

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
don't have a design for this that you

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.030 
don't have a design for this that you
can<00:05:56.620> download<00:05:56.920> because<00:05:57.520> it's<00:05:57.700> just<00:05:57.850> so<00:05:58.060> simple

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
can download because it's just so simple

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.890 
can download because it's just so simple
so<00:06:00.040> basically<00:06:00.460> here<00:06:00.820> are<00:06:01.000> your<00:06:01.180> two<00:06:01.450> pieces

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
so basically here are your two pieces

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.650 
so basically here are your two pieces
side<00:06:02.860> by<00:06:03.100> side<00:06:03.430> and<00:06:03.790> you<00:06:04.090> know<00:06:04.210> they<00:06:04.510> go

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
side by side and you know they go

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.370 
side by side and you know they go
together<00:06:04.810> like<00:06:05.410> that<00:06:05.890> so<00:06:06.550> you<00:06:07.150> know<00:06:07.270> what<00:06:08.260> I'll

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
together like that so you know what I'll

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.440 
together like that so you know what I'll
do<00:06:08.560> is<00:06:08.710> I'll<00:06:08.890> hold<00:06:09.130> the<00:06:09.280> camera<00:06:09.700> here<00:06:09.940> really

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
do is I'll hold the camera here really

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.710 
do is I'll hold the camera here really
steady<00:06:10.870> and<00:06:11.110> you<00:06:11.650> can<00:06:12.250> pause<00:06:12.520> the<00:06:12.970> video<00:06:13.090> right

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
steady and you can pause the video right

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.600 
steady and you can pause the video right
there<00:06:14.050> and<00:06:15.720> draw<00:06:16.720> your<00:06:16.930> own<00:06:17.100> these<00:06:18.100> two<00:06:18.370> pieces

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
there and draw your own these two pieces

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.020 
there and draw your own these two pieces
just<00:06:19.350> slide<00:06:20.350> together<00:06:20.830> into<00:06:21.580> those<00:06:21.760> slots

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
just slide together into those slots

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.720 
just slide together into those slots
well<00:06:23.020> let's<00:06:23.230> see<00:06:23.410> like<00:06:23.980> that<00:06:24.190> I<00:06:24.430> can<00:06:24.580> do<00:06:24.669> it

and hey it's not too bad I was you know
originally<00:06:28.570> thinking<00:06:28.870> about<00:06:29.110> gluing<00:06:29.620> this

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
originally thinking about gluing this

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.070 
originally thinking about gluing this
together<00:06:30.610> but<00:06:30.970> you<00:06:31.419> know<00:06:31.450> I<00:06:31.540> kind<00:06:31.840> of<00:06:31.870> like<00:06:32.050> it

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
together but you know I kind of like it

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.710 
together but you know I kind of like it
like<00:06:32.410> that<00:06:32.440> just<00:06:33.070> you<00:06:33.400> put<00:06:33.610> it<00:06:33.700> together<00:06:33.850> grab

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
like that just you put it together grab

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.980 
like that just you put it together grab
a<00:06:34.960> picture<00:06:35.350> I<00:06:35.830> grabbed<00:06:36.250> this<00:06:36.790> from<00:06:37.390> inside<00:06:37.870> the

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
a picture I grabbed this from inside the

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.190 
a picture I grabbed this from inside the
house<00:06:38.140> somewhere<00:06:38.980> and<00:06:39.280> it'll<00:06:40.120> set<00:06:40.300> up<00:06:40.330> like<00:06:40.870> so

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
house somewhere and it'll set up like so

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.710 
house somewhere and it'll set up like so
now<00:06:41.620> it<00:06:42.340> would<00:06:42.520> probably<00:06:42.730> be<00:06:43.150> better<00:06:43.390> with<00:06:43.690> a

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
now it would probably be better with a

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.150 
now it would probably be better with a
horizontal<00:06:44.169> picture<00:06:44.950> and<00:06:45.460> obviously<00:06:46.419> I<00:06:46.450> will

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
horizontal picture and obviously I will

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.190 
horizontal picture and obviously I will
apply<00:06:48.160> a<00:06:48.250> finish<00:06:48.580> oil<00:06:49.060> or<00:06:49.330> something<00:06:49.570> to<00:06:49.990> this

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200 
apply a finish oil or something to this

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.520 
apply a finish oil or something to this
project<00:06:50.860> and<00:06:51.370> be<00:06:52.060> done<00:06:52.300> with<00:06:52.540> it<00:06:52.720> but<00:06:52.750> you<00:06:53.380> get

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
project and be done with it but you get

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.980 
project and be done with it but you get
the<00:06:53.650> idea<00:06:53.680> from<00:06:54.430> that<00:06:54.490> and<00:06:54.940> what<00:06:55.750> have<00:06:55.900> I
