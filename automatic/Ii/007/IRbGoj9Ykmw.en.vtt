00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.080
 hello and welcome 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.570
 My name is and today I show 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.570
 you a wonderful wonderful 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.949
 essences laurent strategy we catch 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.020
 directly to what the inventer 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.820
 equipment sometimes needs catching 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.300
 directly with the effective because of that 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.379
 Of course, the first priority is her 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.809
 job speed cola and dr 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.480
 the seminar dollar I was there too 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.430
 you just did not need it because he was 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.019
 do not run around you just stand there 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.269
 there and shoot like crazy on the 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.879
 ground 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.260
 every player needs an array and barley 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.850
 the player knows with the most 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.319
 of course, the attraction should be the thunder 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.039
 Cannon and the player with the 

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:57.199
 least attraction then the crossbow 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.600
 you should not use this tactic in the 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.519
 try german version there you can 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.120
 try but I do not believe it 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.519
 will work 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.670
 I'll say so in the pc version 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.950
 make chamber choir and the snakes all the more 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.590
 slower but if you are fast and 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.130
 whole zombies is coming up to you 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.920
 we'll break your skin 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.240
 in seconds you are there 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.730
 that's why i can not 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.030
 explain so read better than silence 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.710
 Solar system still the cars for sale 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.420
 so we come to the place as you too 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.520
 I am at the beginning of the woman 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.590
 own my corner and shoot forward 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.270
 me back there you always the club 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.130
 for vending machines and of course the 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.979
 centrifuge which is also a crucial 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.509
 thing is when the centrifuge 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.820
 and here in the middle of the round 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.850
 page it about 15 tons to ten to 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.250
 Fifteen zombies is a good deal and 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.229
 is also fast so that's why it is 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.990
 also a very good point the tactics 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.759
 will play there 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.350
 the badges are of course for 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.200
 the player with the least attraction 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.569
 once back at the country exactly in the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.970
 corner and for the player with the most 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.580
 attraction turns in circles and 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.590
 Run ten rounds in front of the centrifuge on 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.620
 best also in the centrifuge if one 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.599
 then goes then reads but die 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.030
 angeht think just together in there 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.500
 and twitter then zombies how does it look 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.150
 actually with ammunition from the last 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.630
 I can easily answer you 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.970
 you have six caches that is preliminary round 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.190
 can drop four and her six it 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.799
 mostly so that you drop at the first 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.989
 at the first prevails knows so at 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.390
 get first black hole impression 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.959
 but sometimes it is like that too 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.430
 simply no one gets and 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.440
 That's why I recommend you only per round 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.010
 Two reasons to throw 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.730
 so you really had a chance too 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.530
 ammunition 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.239
 if yes then in the round no 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.129
 wanted to get ammunition easy 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.440
 The thunder can be profitable 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.019
 dogs initially and finished the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.470
 round with the sun can not be so 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.870
 bad 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.329
 so just in the next one 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.730
 time round another two Gersch throw 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.920
 the novella two black holes around the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.810
 norm and to try to price frame for 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.000
 Knows you back to the spot 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.069
 and shoots with the rule like crazy 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.609
 what first time from me to munich 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.609
 millions
