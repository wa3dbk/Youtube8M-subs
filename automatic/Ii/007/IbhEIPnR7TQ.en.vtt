00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 very good people on youtube here 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.940
 you have a new video today I bring because 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.509
 showed online and be here with very hook 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.400
 good 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.410
 and well I wanted to talk a few things 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.730
 of general pokemon changes of 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.570
 this new patch and among other things 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.820
 have restarted all the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.000
 We consider shit taking medals and 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.800
 now I do not have the first one and it's more 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.619
 difficult the gym more difficult because 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.270
 Well simply because I have been removed 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.590
 in you i am 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.590
 instead of a youtube they have put 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.489
 a lemon on a moon is a moon pokémon 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.370
 Monday 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.769
 a moon barrel and level 24 that is to say is 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.690
 stronger because it is a little stronger 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.339
 and on top is more level we are in positions 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.649
 is below then the Ghanaians 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:57.010
 both times the statistics all the 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:00.249
 world starts with zero medal and have 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.260
 fucked everyone well what happens that 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:03.969
 they have also tried to make improvements but 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.229
 they are average because for example this 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.790
 started here in the middle and they did not let you 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:12.580
 back at 7 that entrance 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.580
 there's nothing phantom shopping center 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.910
 to sit here I have also seen 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.920
 some route out there 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.870
 they have added some houses too but 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.240
 they are houses that are empty really not 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.890
 they're good for nothing because there are no missions 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.810
 and before you could talk to some 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.070
 characters that were around here and they gave you 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.420
 some money because there were several 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.400
 missions but now they have disappeared 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.400
 also no longer they are 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.300
 another thing that has also changed is the 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.300
 Fight 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.950
 first a fight in individual looks 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.189
 this is the statistics above and 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.780
 up on the right is putting the 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.969
 Pokemon stats that you have 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.759
 vale puts you in the defense attack 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:57.340
 special speed attack and the special 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:01.000
 defense the good thing that you can now put 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.020
 a tick a ticket is the opposite of the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.689
 cross but activate the car that is to say that 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.549
 can directly to rip you does not 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.060
 lack of skill and then 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.800
 click on the other pokemon simply 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.920
 he has to give him the skill 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.709
 and he paints him salt 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.810
 the ticket automatically because it already attacks 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.239
 it's worth it and it's not just a fight 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.680
 all and all the people you do not have no 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.690
 you have to activate it anyway 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.270
 but the 10 that activate only each 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.590
 once you enter the game clear the first 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.670
 Fight 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.910
 and you stay and this is more well done 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.170
 to fight train and set aside in case 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.330
 sciences fights two for two that 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.830
 let's pay attention is that they see here 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.450
 to do it the trade that there is not much 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.940
 people 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.640
 now if we want to make a group for 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.360
 to fight the fight do not be two 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.099
 people are worth but will be starting 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.410
 when and he has to give equal 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.970
 Click on mine and the dial will be part 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.340
 he has given I have also given him and below 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.549
 that I'm not recording it has 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.700
 also a chat and it puts you games well 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.880
 created is the part the group has been 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.160
 created then now or he or I 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.950
 yes if we find a fight do not use it 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.030
 two against one 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.250
 wrong then first attack the development 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.290
 and then attack bugs we burst it 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.110
 obviously the only bad thing is that you win 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.190
 Half the experience of normal 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.640
 and I feel like it's less money if 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.640
 as well 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.830
 Well really the advantages that 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.090
 has is that for example if you work a 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.180
 zone in the layer leaves a lot of level 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.239
 as is the case because here maybe it's 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.730
 of level 11 that another of the things have 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.860
 improved that the level did not appear before 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.840
 greater than 5 I think not the most was a 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.840
 level 6 and was 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.280
 it was a kitten of only it was a rhinitis and 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.480
 now it 's seem level 11 then it 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.970
 can go up a little faster 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.239
 we will think that to get the 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.890
 mushrooms because the truth is quite good 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.989
 and the good thing that also includes this is 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.000
 that I for example when talking to 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.519
 cook the flow on skype and such I can 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.290
 agree and raise the level of pokemon that 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.359
 have down is much faster that's 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.160
 something that we can take advantage of 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.040
 He already spoke with the layman and he wants 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.660
 train my nice and level 5 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.340
 so we're going to a high area and how is it going 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.530
 attack the first one knowing that only to 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.580
 charge at a stroke because I'm going to upload 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:37.389
 much faster but that I just 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.490
 go up another part is evident no I have not 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.130
 uploaded yet and another thing that also 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.500
 includes the new one won to a new patch 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.820
 the new version is that when you go up 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.910
 level and you learn an attack 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.580
 it automatically jumps to you and already it says it to you 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.830
 ok it tells you your pokemon has gone up 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.330
 level and automatically I did it before 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.220
 not before you did not notice and we had 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.020
 than having you and if it happened to you then 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.580
 it's well thought you did not miss it and already 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.120
 he lost the attack of that level 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.949
 and the truth many putada because a lot 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.650
 people a lot of people to me 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.139
 especially with the psrm under me 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.469
 michelle command did not learn clear embers 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.110
 it's the miss it 's crap because you 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:18.909
 you have a spider, all of it is level 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.210
 until the 25 lost we throw with 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:23.949
 scratches clear and I remove it and clear as 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.370
 you just started you have a shaman of 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:30.129
 level 7 you do not know that you do not have the evil 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.900
 of putting yourself to look at the skills of 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.150
 that you get used to normal pokemon and 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.490
 comes to you with pokemon line spokesperson 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.770
 man what I want to prove it is a 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.240
 thing and why it does not come out because you've 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.669
 come out we have left the part and I 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.409
 I think part of it has been removed I do not know 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.909
 why because he has brought me here 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:47.860
 an out of the grass that they 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:50.560
 steal them a lot of clear I wanted to try if 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.590
 being in a corner you could go to 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.669
 the area is that you can not access you know 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.740
 being in the part and me that is better 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.689
 that before this here but really 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.909
 I think that aesthetics could not be 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.930
 fear I get low for the area that you can not 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:04.690
 get in 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.830
 and that's what I wanted to try but it's 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.930
 Of course I think that you will not be able to 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.389
 is not that what you can not do is that 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.020
 we are far away it is not by zone but because 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.240
 we are far 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.970
 Ok, so I think that's all 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.949
 more or less from pokémon we have tried a 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.020
 little distance that all the 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:24.819
 best of the party 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.819
 I'm going he knows when he takes off 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.840
 look when he takes off for now he has 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.840
 taken away 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.310
 but try to fight that is the bad thing that 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:39.130
 is to fight when you are going to avoid me 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.740
 I think it has already been removed do not leave 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.380
 on the left he tries to fight and now 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.350
 how it will not take away when it comes out 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.910
 it's already broken if you find fighting it 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.010
 removes has to be both in the 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:54.580
 grass is not the grass but so 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:57.070
 less pegadito very close and good that's 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.500
 all for now these are the improvements I 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.150
 I'll show you what it is and have 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.490
 introduced also new pokémon that is 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.210
 there's pokemon that was not there before 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.940
 example 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.310
 in the area in the first and in the first 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:13.100
 center pokemon leaves a clip and before not 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.319
 they came out and they come out several strangers here 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.800
 appear for we arrive vision before that 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:20.449
 it suits you very well for those of the ascetic and 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.310
 have added those new pokémon have 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:24.530
 had new little things but it's still 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.000
 for developing a lot is a game that 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.430
 is in beta we have been more than a year 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.110
 in beta so it's good that I'll try 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.580
 upload something when the second one happens 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.949
 gym I want to upload it because the 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.090
 first I had it, but I was so smart 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:37.729
 do not record it 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.180
 so well I like that I had some 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:43.070
 years I raised it from ebro I see it complicated 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.720
 so go I'll show you some 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.030
 little thing if you find some secret or 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.430
 something 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:51.340
 and nothing but me for my part already finished 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:54.580
 care fly and for the fuck I get a 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:57.000
 Greetings to all and see you goodbye 

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.000
 goodbye
