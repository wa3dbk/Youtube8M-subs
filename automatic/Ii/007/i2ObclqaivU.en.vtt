00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 megamamute gave his full vacation and 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.990
 check out our offers show and then people 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.150
 come talk this wonder woman and look 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.230
 only those who have plants that are in the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.049
 Captain Quine well within crisis is it 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.510
 confirmed will make the style shake the pair 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.070
 romantic of the wonder woman as the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.710
 People are going to see the two of us together. 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.960
 It is in the movie Wonder Woman that she 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.300
 made a film solo in 2017 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.980
 As soon as we see him already doing 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.380
 production and everything else 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.079
 and now weird doctor good we gave 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.450
 a news saying that she is white actress 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.510
 She would be negotiating to 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.210
 to live a romantic couple is at the doctor 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.670
 strange but no information nor the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.430
 rumor that she could be the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.129
 nurse who has more or less 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.969
 so it's not very clear in the series 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.219
 demolisher even though the rosary 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.500
 night nurse but they switched from 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.170
 name and everything else so it's not much 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.960
 explicit because it's kind of wanted 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.360
 use the night nurse at 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.670
 some movie is theirs then a 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.770
 possibility of oit markets make the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.450
 night nurse in the film Doctor 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.200
 strange and now they will talk about 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.540
 defeat 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.189
 well one more character was promoted 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.490
 now bush has been promoted to cast 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.799
 main is who the character is today 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.840
 the good thing is and now it 's promoting 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.750
 remembering that besides him the doctor lesley 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.759
 the rap tooth and 16 fox was also 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.040
 run promoted to cast 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.600
 and also to see our 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.590
 second season all these 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:44.880
 characters 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:47.549
 in a note to my face they do not like 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.340
 not annoying causing really cool 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.210
 I just think seeing with a little is long. 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.820
 too much 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.030
 I do not like to ask seriously that you have 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.560
 many chapters many chapters 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.820
 episodes ring have 11 and 25 not 23 on 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.460
 low 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.369
 like flash and elano too so it's a 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.009
 It's not tiring, you're staying. 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:16.590
 following from afar is not tiring 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.840
 pilot not what is good is not but it is not 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.540
 thousand hours is you accompany a series 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.600
 which has 20 pizzotti coffee tanks 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.530
 understood but it's cool but it's cool if 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.640
 watched 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.620
 So how can you talk cool to us? 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.830
 It's very cool because it has several 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.120
 characters that are the incredible I think 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.040
 that the non- batman is a child in the child and 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.470
 and he is very well. 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.610
 he in the first episodes he was well 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.370
 All but after that he went 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.170
 strengthening knows and is is very cool 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.910
 also a penguin is my character 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.790
 Preferred for now 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.769
 and there will now be the joker that 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.510
 will also be between that episode that 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.690
 appeared and gave him a laugh 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.489
 Machiavellian a sensational and I go 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.160
 Love to see in Gotham that he is 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.410
 sensationally understood the 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.680
 recent episodes were a little tiring 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.930
 the last ones were three 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.370
 awesome but the last ones went well 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.420
 tiring in 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.250
 the last one was really cool but I think 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.290
 they could have done this before knowing 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.340
 if they could have taken those last 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.739
 episodes and ended the b series ex 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.410
 with a lot of history a lot of history 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.570
 many characters barely inserted after 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.190
 he got lost a little more the beginning of 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.700
 I think it's cool series. 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.049
 the last episode also quite like 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.780
 so I think it 's worth the people 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:55.769
 arrived so they like it is legal full quota 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:58.560
 cool because there's batman and kenichi is 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.230
 The best thing in the world is the penguin. 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.630
 Sensational, my very good movie has 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.110
 fish lammel the plug is very good one 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.510
 very strong female character to us 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.579
 There's a Brazilian too that I think 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.130
 she was very cool, she was online 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.760
 she made a 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.200
 that one called series I think to see and 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.820
 I liked that series, but it was 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:25.280
 canceled because people will like it 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:27.500
 new is and she and she was alien type 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.470
 do not know that he had a human body and 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.500
 then they turned into crushing I know 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.610
 there was a long plug is very funny 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.680
 and I'll go 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.990
 the bay had dropped the TV screen and I 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.210
 I hate that accent of ours. 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.850

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.140
