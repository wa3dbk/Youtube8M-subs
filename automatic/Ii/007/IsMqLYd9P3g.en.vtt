00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.569
 11am this morning rue du faubourg 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.280
 Saint-HonorÃ© in Paris in front of the very 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.510
 select is very trendy colette store 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.010
 it's one of the few shops in 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.019
 France to offer for sale some 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.670
 copies of the apple watch that 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.120
 will only arrive in the apple store at 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.070
 month of June 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.750
 they ordered their watches on 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.279
 internet or else they will try to 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.260
 buy it directly in the shop 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:29.010
 some are present on site since 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:33.030
 the day before I'm waiting for the call watch like 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.520
 about 300 people in front and 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.559
 behind me I'm waiting for a drink 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.469
 I've been here since last night 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.980
 since 22h so I got to 19 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.469
 hours last night 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.520
 yes but for an exclusive watch we are going 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.899
 say because in fact she is 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.789
 available only at colette today 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.230
 so the idea is first and foremost 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.270
 the world knows that I came to three 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.180
 days make a pre order directly 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.739
 I took there black sport in 42 I'm waiting 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.750
 really done there the fact of no longer 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.340
 having to take out my phone all all 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.140
 the five minutes august and 10 minutes this 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.660
 which would be because between the mails sms 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.220
 and the calls we're on we do not have the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.270
 phone in the hand in the pocket 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.740
 it remains to discover their name it's 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.020
 really to avoid going out his 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.080
 iphone for the five minutes consumed 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.820
 his battery we look at his wrist 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.020
 respond to a message it's very fast 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.409
 I come looking for a watch that have been 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.729
 pre-ordered mickey lamonte I think that 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.170
 I will use it for the sport for 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.680
 for work I'm going to take the gold 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.130
 direct edition it will be a normal watch 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.130
 42 mm with a Milanese bracelet I think 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.130
 that's way they do not have a lot of 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.069
 choice there is sellami the year there with 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.020
 steel bracelet in 2000 there were the 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.340
 ten sion or no no there is not there 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.369
 there was no editing there was not 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.140
 there in black jersey nor in white so I 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.579
 took the milano by the feet 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.649
 so here they are the guy who was 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.289
 before me actually he bought the sport 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.579
 and the parts without his model I know 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.539
 not he forgot was too tired the 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.189
 parties are they to pay the parties 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.140
 no but after remembering the identity 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.099
 did not look but here he did the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.099
 tail for all that for what for
