right here will be another audio log
from<00:00:37.540> here<00:00:37.750> there's<00:00:37.930> an<00:00:38.050> objective<00:00:38.380> up<00:00:38.740> in<00:00:38.950> an

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
from here there's an objective up in an

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.460 
from here there's an objective up in an
objective<00:00:39.220> down<00:00:39.910> below<00:00:40.300> you<00:00:40.360> I'm<00:00:40.750> going<00:00:41.230> up

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
objective down below you I'm going up

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.130 
objective down below you I'm going up
first<00:00:41.830> and<00:00:42.070> that's<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.340> crew<00:00:42.550> quarters<00:00:43.140> this

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
first and that's the crew quarters this

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.780 
first and that's the crew quarters this
area<00:00:44.710> is<00:00:44.770> a<00:00:44.830> little<00:00:44.860> tricky<00:00:45.340> there's<00:00:45.520> a<00:00:45.580> path

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
area is a little tricky there's a path

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.760 
area is a little tricky there's a path
to<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.090> left<00:00:46.330> and<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.570> path<00:00:47.020> to<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.320> right<00:00:47.560> you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
to the left and a path to the right you

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.160 
to the left and a path to the right you
have<00:00:47.950> to<00:00:48.070> go<00:00:48.190> down<00:00:48.370> both<00:00:48.670> of<00:00:48.700> them<00:00:49.170> they

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
have to go down both of them they

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.510 
have to go down both of them they
ultimately<00:00:50.350> go<00:00:50.740> to<00:00:50.770> the<00:00:50.920> same<00:00:51.100> place<00:00:51.340> but

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
ultimately go to the same place but

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.310 
ultimately go to the same place but
you'll<00:00:51.640> have<00:00:51.700> to<00:00:51.760> try<00:00:52.090> a<00:00:52.120> backtrack<00:00:52.810> to<00:00:52.960> get<00:00:53.140> to

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
you'll have to try a backtrack to get to

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.000 
you'll have to try a backtrack to get to
it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
it

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.250 
it
so<00:00:54.430> as<00:00:54.820> soon<00:00:54.910> as<00:00:54.970> you<00:00:55.090> enter<00:00:55.120> drop<00:00:55.660> down<00:00:55.870> here

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
so as soon as you enter drop down here

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.430 
so as soon as you enter drop down here
quick<00:00:56.730> grab<00:00:57.730> this<00:00:57.940> audio<00:00:58.330> log<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.810> then<00:00:59.320> when

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
quick grab this audio log and then when

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.840 
quick grab this audio log and then when
you<00:00:59.500> go<00:00:59.620> back<00:00:59.830> up<00:01:00.070> I'm<00:01:00.250> going<00:01:00.430> to<00:01:00.490> go<00:01:00.580> down<00:01:00.730> the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
you go back up I'm going to go down the

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.469 
you go back up I'm going to go down the
right<00:01:01.170> path<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:03.089> then<00:01:04.089> using<00:01:04.390> these

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
right path and then using these

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.020 
right path and then using these
capacitors<00:01:05.049> open<00:01:05.439> a<00:01:05.530> couple<00:01:05.740> doors<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.369> then

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
capacitors open a couple doors and then

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.050 
capacitors open a couple doors and then
you'll<00:01:07.210> come<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.689> a<00:01:07.720> room<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:09.729> a<00:01:09.790> bunch<00:01:10.000> of

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
you'll come to a room with a bunch of

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.520 
you'll come to a room with a bunch of
bunks<00:01:10.420> in<00:01:10.539> it<00:01:10.689> and<00:01:10.840> you'll<00:01:10.929> be<00:01:11.049> here<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.409> the
