00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:10.309
 hello good here is a guide to do 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.390
 a support build pm 5 pm 6 with the 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.190
 monk's character 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.670
 and we start with the skills 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.610
 the primary school to which I put is this 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.289
 path of the 100 cuffs fists hot 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.279
 with ruin hot fist 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.390
 the second wave of light and what is it 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.170
 it costs me less 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:39.879
 to reduce 40 points of the spirit 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:44.120
 divine breath is I leave this too 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.970
 is I put if it is the one that lasts me 20 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.340
 seconds 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.740
 and the mantra 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.010
 if this is fine 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.020
 the sentence now this must be changed 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.440
 passive skills let's put the 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.690
 first 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.680
 initiative the second as to put union 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.680
 with the world and the third we are going to put 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.190
 is every point that we spend in spirit 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.140
 will cure us 62 life points as we go 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.900
 to use a lot of hours of light 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.830
 It will not heal, I think it covers us two 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.320
 faces of lives 2000 of lives 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.380
 good are a beginning the skills and 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.220
 then the important thing for this character 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:34.010
 is to look for weapons that steal good life yes 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.490
 that steal lives especially me in this 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.490
 I have a case 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.540
 27 percent of the damage it inflicts is 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.150
 turns into life 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.050
 this and considering the attacks 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.890
 fast that 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:53.550
 what did you look for example 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.710
 then for each blow that is healing 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.100
 t and then you go by the bells 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.909
 you are and continue to cure we are going to make you 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.909
 a small test 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.380
 charge the skills I'm left without 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.010
 without anything 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.010
 come on, let's go 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.160
 and the 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.160
 wind 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.140
 to see if we find any leader 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.140
 very soon 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.230
 now we are at pm 6 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.240
 2400 gold 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.019
 why do you have to see some close 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.190
 the little ball that is caught of harm 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.830
 good because we already have 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.830
 a list that goes 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.390
 me bad 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.750
 of all the spirit that we have what 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.110
 we spend in the hours of light that removes 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.110
 a lot 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.019
 could step on the fire so I s 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.530
 to make that fat 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.080
 Madrid- 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.300
 very well 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:10.200
 well we can hold up perfectly 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.200
 this is all we 're going over there 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:20.390
 we will come back 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:20.390
 and nothing because that we are in pm in pm 6 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.850
 and good the truth that 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.500
 that can not stand very well against a 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.680
 propeller 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.370
 auction house for example the weapon that 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.220
 I'm commenting let's find a 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.660
 similar 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.660
 look then for example is 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.130
 I can not see the other secondary 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.340
 824 of the year 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.910
 835 29 percent damage inflicted or 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.490
 it has more that has more than mine 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.930
 because mine has 2.7 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.580
 and it costs 400 thousand euros, so this is 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.880
 like in another video that I have to how 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.220
 get 200 thousand gold in 15 minutes in the 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.349
 Another video that I have on my channel 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.940
 with 20 with half an hour already has 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.430
 four hundred thousand euros after buying 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.820
 this weapon for example 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.230
 She looks for you and looks for you and steals 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.849
 lives if you have two warriors life already 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.309
 were he who killed you 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.759
 nothing then I take the opportunity to say that 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:30.139
 I walk through my channel and I have enough 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.139
 videos tutorials and guides 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:36.220
 and nothing like that if you like to subscribe and 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.220
 see you later
