like<00:03:45.970> seventeen<00:03:46.450> magazine<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.260> also

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
like seventeen magazine and also

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.800 
like seventeen magazine and also
throughout<00:03:47.920> YouTube<00:03:48.340> how<00:03:48.760> wet<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:49.390> wild<00:03:49.480> has

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
throughout YouTube how wet and wild has

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.930 
throughout YouTube how wet and wild has
pretty<00:03:50.019> good<00:03:50.230> one<00:03:50.950> dollar<00:03:51.160> lipstick<00:03:51.640> so<00:03:51.910> I

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
pretty good one dollar lipstick so I

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.479 
pretty good one dollar lipstick so I
figured<00:03:52.329> why<00:03:52.510> not<00:03:52.540> try<00:03:52.900> them<00:03:53.019> out<00:03:53.110> so<00:03:54.100> these

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
figured why not try them out so these

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.539 
figured why not try them out so these
are<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:54.850> matte<00:03:55.780> lipsticks<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.829> I<00:03:57.160> got<00:03:57.340> the

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
are the matte lipsticks and I got the

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.479 
are the matte lipsticks and I got the
color<00:03:57.820> dollhouse<00:03:58.690> pink<00:03:59.140> cherry<00:03:59.890> bomb<00:04:00.160> which

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
color dollhouse pink cherry bomb which

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.479 
color dollhouse pink cherry bomb which
is<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:01.030> super<00:04:01.750> dark<00:04:02.110> color<00:04:02.380> probably<00:04:03.190> better

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
is a super dark color probably better

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.449 
is a super dark color probably better
for<00:04:03.579> like<00:04:03.820> nights<00:04:04.150> out<00:04:04.480> or<00:04:04.989> like<00:04:05.739> winter<00:04:06.220> time

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
for like nights out or like winter time

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.330 
for like nights out or like winter time
even<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.120> then<00:04:07.660> this<00:04:08.200> orange<00:04:08.739> II<00:04:08.890> kind<00:04:09.280> of

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
even and then this orange II kind of

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.520 
even and then this orange II kind of
color<00:04:09.610> which<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:09.970> in<00:04:12.000> pretty<00:04:13.000> Persian<00:04:13.840> so<00:04:14.350> this

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
color which is in pretty Persian so this

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.099 
color which is in pretty Persian so this
dark<00:04:14.980> cherry<00:04:15.459> bomb<00:04:15.730> color<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.299> definitely<00:04:16.810> way

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
dark cherry bomb color is definitely way

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.409 
dark cherry bomb color is definitely way
on<00:04:17.320> my<00:04:17.470> comfort<00:04:17.709> zone<00:04:17.859> but<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.250> really<00:04:18.640> figured

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
on my comfort zone but I really figured

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.400 
on my comfort zone but I really figured
why<00:04:19.630> not<00:04:19.660> try<00:04:20.080> it

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
why not try it

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.050 
why not try it
it's<00:04:20.560> only<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.800> dollar<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.519> like<00:04:21.640> if<00:04:21.790> I<00:04:21.880> don't

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
it's only a dollar and like if I don't

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.900 
it's only a dollar and like if I don't
like<00:04:22.210> it<00:04:22.270> I<00:04:22.630> don't<00:04:22.690> lose<00:04:23.320> that<00:04:23.650> much<00:04:23.950> but<00:04:24.700> I

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
like it I don't lose that much but I

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.660 
like it I don't lose that much but I
will<00:04:25.150> mostly<00:04:25.570> likely<00:04:26.130> probably<00:04:27.130> wear<00:04:27.520> this

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
will mostly likely probably wear this

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.570 
will mostly likely probably wear this
