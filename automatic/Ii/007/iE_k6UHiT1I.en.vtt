00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
wheels are gonna make into a pulley

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
wheels are gonna make into a pulley
because<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.829> sure<00:00:44.070> make<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.059> an<00:00:45.180> electric<00:00:45.690> car

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
because I sure make it an electric car

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.100 
because I sure make it an electric car
using<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.530> my<00:00:47.180> vibrating<00:00:48.180> tooth<00:00:48.360> brushes

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
using one of my vibrating tooth brushes

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.639 
using one of my vibrating tooth brushes
that<00:00:49.320> I've<00:00:49.469> cut<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> end<00:00:50.010> off<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:55.320> we'll<00:00:55.440> use

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
that I've cut the end off so we'll use

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.430 
that I've cut the end off so we'll use
that<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.010> power<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.690> I'll<00:00:57.809> turn<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
that to power it so I'll turn one of

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.360 
that to power it so I'll turn one of
these<00:00:58.590> CDs<00:00:59.690> into<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> pulley<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> I'll<00:01:02.129> cut<00:01:02.340> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
these CDs into a pulley so I'll cut a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.969 
these CDs into a pulley so I'll cut a
disc<00:01:02.640> out<00:01:02.910> with<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.500> piece<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.680> polystyrene

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
disc out with this piece of polystyrene

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.940 
disc out with this piece of polystyrene
pizza<00:01:05.820> tray<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:07.020> what's<00:01:07.229> left<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:07.830> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
pizza tray that's what's left of one of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.840 
pizza tray that's what's left of one of
them<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.540> also<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:10.159> disc<00:01:11.159> out<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.580> bit<00:01:11.760> of

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
them and also a disc out of this bit of

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.289 
them and also a disc out of this bit of
card<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.520> end<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> pulley

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
card so that we end up with a pulley

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.620 
card so that we end up with a pulley
that<00:01:16.070> looks<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.700> I've<00:01:18.299> done

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that looks like this one I've done

00:01:18.630 --> 00:02:08.570 
that looks like this one I've done
before

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.770
