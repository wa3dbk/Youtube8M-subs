we just laid boots down Kurt is a fancy

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.090 
we just laid boots down Kurt is a fancy
term<00:00:29.800> to<00:00:30.250> say<00:00:30.460> that<00:00:30.670> pitchers<00:00:31.120> get<00:00:31.510> more

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:32.100

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
external rotation in their arc of motion

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.610 
external rotation in their arc of motion
and<00:00:35.170> a<00:00:35.890> limited<00:00:36.309> internal<00:00:37.210> rotation<00:00:37.570> so<00:00:38.290> a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
and a limited internal rotation so a

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.920 
and a limited internal rotation so a

decreased internal rotation is known to
be<00:00:45.250> pathologic<00:00:46.090> or<00:00:46.210> causes<00:00:46.630> pain<00:00:46.930> so<00:00:47.500> we're

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
be pathologic or causes pain so we're

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.020 
be pathologic or causes pain so we're
going<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.770> talk<00:00:47.920> about<00:00:48.100> a<00:00:48.280> very<00:00:48.520> recent<00:00:48.820> study

that showed a particular stretch that

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.670 
that showed a particular stretch that
helped<00:00:52.210> with<00:00:52.390> this<00:00:52.540> condition<00:00:52.780> condition

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
helped with this condition condition

the sleeper stretch is affecting the

because<00:01:03.710> they're<00:01:03.950> known<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.220> become<00:01:04.610> very

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
because they're known to become very

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.180 
because they're known to become very
very<00:01:05.450> tight<00:01:05.870> and<00:01:06.080> contracted<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:06.860> actually

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
very tight and contracted and actually

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.830 
very tight and contracted and actually
enlarged<00:01:07.760> in<00:01:07.970> pitchers<00:01:08.480> because<00:01:08.690> it's

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
enlarged in pitchers because it's

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.720 
enlarged in pitchers because it's
responsible<00:01:09.410> for<00:01:09.680> slowing<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.280> arm<00:01:10.460> down

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
responsible for slowing the arm down

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.670 
responsible for slowing the arm down
through<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.150> fall<00:01:11.360> through<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:12.290> with<00:01:12.470> this

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
through the fall through so with this

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.080 
through the fall through so with this
stretch<00:01:12.980> it's<00:01:13.190> important<00:01:13.700> that<00:01:13.730> you<00:01:13.910> keep

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
stretch it's important that you keep

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.150 
stretch it's important that you keep
your<00:01:14.270> shoulder<00:01:14.600> blade<00:01:14.840> underneath<00:01:15.230> you<00:01:15.590> not
