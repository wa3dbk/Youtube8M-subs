we<00:00:00.810> have<00:00:00.989> surprising<00:00:01.650> new<00:00:01.770> information

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
we have surprising new information

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.550 
we have surprising new information
coming<00:00:02.669> out<00:00:02.850> about<00:00:02.909> this<00:00:03.330> massive<00:00:04.020> asteroid

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
coming out about this massive asteroid

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.330 
coming out about this massive asteroid
Vesta<00:00:05.779> they're<00:00:06.779> saying<00:00:07.109> that<00:00:07.340> apparently

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
Vesta they're saying that apparently

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.690 
Vesta they're saying that apparently
liquid<00:00:09.150> water<00:00:09.450> had<00:00:10.260> flowed<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.280> surface

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
liquid water had flowed on the surface

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.250 
liquid water had flowed on the surface
of<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.630> huge<00:00:12.929> asteroid<00:00:13.700> now<00:00:14.700> they<00:00:14.849> say<00:00:15.059> that

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
of this huge asteroid now they say that

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.000 
of this huge asteroid now they say that
this<00:00:16.260> happened<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:17.300> the<00:00:18.300> relatively<00:00:19.010> recent

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
this happened in the relatively recent

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.330 
this happened in the relatively recent
past<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:21.199> this<00:00:22.199> isn't<00:00:22.590> like<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.980> would<00:00:23.130> see

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
past but this isn't like you would see

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.859 
past but this isn't like you would see
here<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.910> earth<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.750> natural<00:00:25.410> water<00:00:25.710> flowing

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
here on earth with natural water flowing

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.099 
here on earth with natural water flowing
but<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.170> did<00:00:28.680> create<00:00:28.949> channels<00:00:30.109> illness

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
but it did create channels illness

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.659 
but it did create channels illness
asteroids<00:00:31.740> similar<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.489> would<00:00:32.610> see

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
asteroids similar to what you would see

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.490 
asteroids similar to what you would see
in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:32.940> craters<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.600> Arizona<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.070> earth

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
in the craters in Arizona here on earth

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.400 
in the craters in Arizona here on earth
now<00:00:37.500> they<00:00:37.649> say<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.570> on<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.960> asteroid

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
now they say that on the asteroid

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.549 
now they say that on the asteroid
there's<00:00:40.920> obviously<00:00:41.370> no<00:00:42.210> atmosphere<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.320> any

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
there's obviously no atmosphere so any

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.110 
there's obviously no atmosphere so any
water<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> surface<00:00:45.110> evaporates<00:00:46.110> quickly

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
water on the surface evaporates quickly

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.700 
water on the surface evaporates quickly
so<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.329> has<00:00:48.480> led<00:00:48.510> everyone<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.170> believe<00:00:49.320> that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
so this has led everyone to believe that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.260 
so this has led everyone to believe that
there's<00:00:49.920> no<00:00:49.980> way<00:00:50.370> you're<00:00:50.610> gonna<00:00:50.670> find<00:00:50.789> any

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
there's no way you're gonna find any

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.970 
there's no way you're gonna find any
water<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:52.410> any<00:00:53.190> sorts<00:00:53.870> on<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.170> outside<00:00:55.620> but

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
water of any sorts on the outside but

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.400 
water of any sorts on the outside but
Vesta<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.730> proving<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.930> be<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.109> very

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
Vesta is proving to be a very

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.680 
Vesta is proving to be a very
interesting<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.370> complex<00:01:00.590> planetary<00:01:01.590> body

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
interesting and complex planetary body

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.260 
interesting and complex planetary body
now<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.260> scientist<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.189> were<00:01:05.640> studying<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
now the scientist that were studying the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.030 
now the scientist that were studying the
images<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.900> Vesta<00:01:07.290> noticed<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:09.920> there<00:01:10.920> were

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
images of Vesta noticed that there were

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.580 
images of Vesta noticed that there were
these<00:01:11.159> deep<00:01:11.580> deep<00:01:12.479> gullies<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.380> were

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
these deep deep gullies that were

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.330 
these deep deep gullies that were
running<00:01:13.799> through<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:15.710> they<00:01:16.710> stated<00:01:16.979> of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
running through it and they stated of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.640 
running through it and they stated of
those<00:01:18.830> on<00:01:19.830> average<00:01:20.610> they<00:01:21.060> were<00:01:21.119> around<00:01:21.650> 3,000

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
those on average they were around 3,000

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.560 
those on average they were around 3,000
feet<00:01:22.890> long<00:01:24.140> 3,000<00:01:25.140> feet<00:01:25.290> long<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.890> 100<00:01:26.820> feet

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
feet long 3,000 feet long and 100 feet

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.740 
feet long 3,000 feet long and 100 feet
wide<00:01:28.310> they're<00:01:29.310> calling<00:01:29.939> these<00:01:30.119> channels

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
wide they're calling these channels

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.140 
wide they're calling these channels
debris<00:01:31.710> flows<00:01:32.960> this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.020> where<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:34.770> believe

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
debris flows this is where they believe

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.510 
debris flows this is where they believe
small<00:01:36.150> amounts<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> debris<00:01:37.020> mixed<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.280> with

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
small amounts of debris mixed in with

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.410 
small amounts of debris mixed in with
the<00:01:38.670> water<00:01:39.229> enough<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.880> water<00:01:42.119> did

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the water enough so that the water did

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.200 
the water enough so that the water did
not<00:01:42.450> evaporate<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.829> had<00:01:43.950> time<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.520> come

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
not evaporate and it had time to come

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.569 
not evaporate and it had time to come
down<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.720> form<00:01:46.079> these<00:01:46.320> channels<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:46.979> they<00:01:47.399> can

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
down and form these channels as they can

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.600 
down and form these channels as they can
see<00:01:48.259> on<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:50.159> surface<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.799> mixture<00:01:53.340> of

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
see on the surface so the mixture of

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.539 
see on the surface so the mixture of
elements<00:01:54.110> on<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.470> outside<00:01:55.890> holding<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
elements on the outside holding the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.350 
elements on the outside holding the
water<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.909> stopping<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.719> from<00:01:57.750> evaporating

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
water in stopping it from evaporating

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.280 
water in stopping it from evaporating
enabled<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:01.189> stream<00:02:02.189> down<00:02:02.659> this<00:02:03.659> asteroid

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
enabled it to stream down this asteroid

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.440 
enabled it to stream down this asteroid
at<00:02:04.439> any<00:02:04.649> time<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.159> encountered<00:02:05.939> something<00:02:06.329> in

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
at any time it encountered something in

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.290 
at any time it encountered something in
space<00:02:06.740> or<00:02:07.740> anything<00:02:08.009> melted<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.940> also

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
space or anything melted that also

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.130 
space or anything melted that also
flowed<00:02:10.050> down<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.410> edges<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:12.030> sides

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
flowed down the edges of the sides

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.750 
flowed down the edges of the sides
of<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:14.100> asteroid<00:02:16.100> but<00:02:17.100> that's<00:02:17.310> just<00:02:17.520> one<00:02:17.730> of

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
of the asteroid but that's just one of

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.720 
of the asteroid but that's just one of
the<00:02:17.880> latest<00:02:19.100> mysteries<00:02:20.100> here<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.460> they<00:02:20.580> have

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the latest mysteries here that they have

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.540 
the latest mysteries here that they have
revealed<00:02:21.180> when<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.690> comes<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.050> these<00:02:22.550> space

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
revealed when it comes to these space

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.970 
revealed when it comes to these space
objects<00:02:24.210> that<00:02:24.390> were<00:02:24.540> often<00:02:25.260> left<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.740> dark

objects that were often left in the dark
about<00:02:26.300> but<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.330> just<00:02:27.420> wanted<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.900> do<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.110> update

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
about but I just wanted to do the update

I'll leave a link with a lot more

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.200 
I'll leave a link with a lot more
