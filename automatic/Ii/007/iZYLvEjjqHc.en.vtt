00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.700
 hello friends with you simple and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.640
 Today I will show a new mechanism or bug in 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.260
 Minecraft Pocket Edition to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.150
 some did not write there that he did not 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.920
 it works or something didnâ€™t work for me 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.869
 these are your problems i just had it 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.650
 he checked to zero here 4 me all 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.150
 worked so already claims not to me 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.000
 this bank or mechanism is called 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.800
 invisible chest then and see if we 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.750
 go here from this building and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.350
 Click here so we go to our 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.829
 chest 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.899
 and the essence of this bug or mechanism 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.690
 is that here's what 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.230
 Our building hidden chest is the same 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.710
 it is clear further to whom it is not clear how I am 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.559
 building part all turned around then 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.440
 I just go here such steps 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.420
 here look like a sofa folded 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.670
 here here here and on top of that's how it is 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.500
 it's hard for you to get here 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.159
 Such is the structure like this one and all 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.110
 remembered it for going a few perhaps 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.270
 here's further I just have a step chest here 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.659
 are you here ahead and when i click 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.130
 there now and on the tablet or 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.470
 phone right here on you then here I am 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.509
 open why such a mechanism or 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.240
 fact who liked put huskies yes I 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.369
 By the way I wanted to tell those who wrote to me in 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.880
 comments like you stole the mechanism or 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.860
 something like that i didn't steal i 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.540
 just maybe you haven't thought 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.180
 maybe i just did a review on this one 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.240
 mechanism or just showed you it yet 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.520
 times or you have not seen inside the channel so 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.619
 that put huskies and write comments not 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.270
 We write all garbage to me in the comments 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.520
 just write good positive 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.649
