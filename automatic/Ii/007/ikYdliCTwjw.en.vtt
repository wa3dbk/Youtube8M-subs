alright guys help me diagnose this so
this<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:06.990> passenger<00:00:07.410> side<00:00:09.170> underneath<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
this is a passenger side underneath the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.279 
this is a passenger side underneath the
wheel<00:00:11.900> here's<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.049> wheel<00:00:13.259> um<00:00:14.240> if<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.630> push<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
wheel here's the wheel um if I push the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:25.849 
wheel here's the wheel um if I push the
car<00:00:16.529> up<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:19.350> noise<00:00:19.650> comes<00:00:20.070> from<00:00:21.650> this<00:00:23.119> bar<00:00:24.859> and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
car up the noise comes from this bar and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.840 
car up the noise comes from this bar and
I<00:00:26.390> guess<00:00:27.390> that's<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:31.099> there's<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.189> CD<00:00:32.610> boot

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
I guess that's the there's a CD boot

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.340 
I guess that's the there's a CD boot
it's<00:00:33.420> not<00:00:33.600> coming<00:00:33.809> from<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.170> CV<00:00:34.559> or<00:00:35.239> axle<00:00:36.350> at

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
it's not coming from the CV or axle at

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.459 
it's not coming from the CV or axle at
least<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.890> don't<00:00:38.129> think<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.230> coming<00:00:40.230> from

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
least I don't think it is coming from

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.459 
least I don't think it is coming from
right<00:00:40.559> here<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.850> bulk<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> joint<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.230> ball

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
right here the bulk the joint the ball

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.869 
right here the bulk the joint the ball
will<00:00:44.059> not<00:00:45.059> necessarily<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.539> wheel<00:00:45.750> bearings

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
will not necessarily the wheel bearings

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.430 
will not necessarily the wheel bearings
will<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.840> know<00:00:48.930> here's<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.379> wheel<00:00:51.440> but

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
will be you know here's the wheel but

00:00:52.440 --> 00:02:42.260 
will be you know here's the wheel but
I'll<00:00:52.890> make<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> noise

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.590 

coming<00:02:43.270> from<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:43.630> bar<00:02:43.990> right<00:02:44.200> here<00:02:45.180> this<00:02:46.180> bar

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
coming from this bar right here this bar

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.540 
coming from this bar right here this bar
I<00:02:48.420> don't<00:02:49.420> already<00:02:49.540> know<00:02:49.720> what<00:02:49.930> it's<00:02:50.050> called<00:02:50.550> go

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
I don't already know what it's called go

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.350 
I don't already know what it's called go
out<00:02:52.500> connects<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:56.940> wishbone<00:02:57.940> looking

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
out connects to the wishbone looking

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.340 
out connects to the wishbone looking
thing<00:02:59.220> up<00:03:00.220> there<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:01.090> can<00:03:01.239> see<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.540> half

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
thing up there you can see the half

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.420 
thing up there you can see the half
shaft<00:03:02.620> right<00:03:02.920> there

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
shaft right there

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.350 
shaft right there
as<00:03:04.360> far<00:03:04.660> as<00:03:04.690> underneath<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:06.180> then<00:03:07.180> it

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
as far as underneath it and then it

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.460 
as far as underneath it and then it
connects<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:11.970> guess<00:03:12.970> that's<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:14.140> ball

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
connects to I guess that's the ball

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.240 
connects to I guess that's the ball
joint

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
joint

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.570 
joint
oh<00:03:15.600> that's<00:03:16.600> officially<00:03:17.140> called<00:03:17.410> two<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.280> them

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
oh that's officially called two of them

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:27.780 
oh that's officially called two of them
two<00:03:18.910> ball<00:03:19.180> joints<00:03:24.030> alright<00:03:25.030> that's<00:03:25.330> about<00:03:25.540> it
