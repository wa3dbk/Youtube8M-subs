00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
because well like I said we played like

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.270 
because well like I said we played like
one<00:01:37.270> on<00:01:37.420> one<00:01:37.600> on<00:01:37.720> one<00:01:37.750> on<00:01:38.049> one<00:01:38.080> games<00:01:38.500> but<00:01:39.130> it's

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
one on one on one on one games but it's

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.340 
one on one on one on one games but it's
meant<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.760> be<00:01:39.790> for<00:01:40.090> like<00:01:40.270> 40<00:01:40.840> we<00:01:40.990> still<00:01:41.200> have

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
meant to be for like 40 we still have

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.260 
meant to be for like 40 we still have
decided<00:01:41.799> it's<00:01:41.920> meant<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.159> be<00:01:42.189> from<00:01:42.490> like<00:01:42.610> 40<00:01:43.119> to

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
decided it's meant to be from like 40 to

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.109 
decided it's meant to be from like 40 to
80<00:01:43.479> people<00:01:44.020> so<00:01:44.710> we'll<00:01:45.340> probably<00:01:45.549> decide<00:01:45.909> that

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and then MVP plus is 150 forever so it

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.030 
and then MVP plus is 150 forever so it
kind<00:02:13.209> of<00:02:13.299> discounts<00:02:13.900> as<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:14.170> go<00:02:14.319> up<00:02:14.379> but<00:02:14.830> um
