Evans comm and we are now going to talk

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.070 
Evans comm and we are now going to talk
about<00:00:16.609> proportion<00:00:17.420> for<00:00:17.660> a<00:00:17.689> 2-door<00:00:18.050> sports<00:00:18.170> car

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
about proportion for a 2-door sports car

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.040 
about proportion for a 2-door sports car
so<00:00:21.580> the<00:00:22.580> previous<00:00:22.970> tutorial<00:00:23.390> just<00:00:23.539> showed<00:00:23.780> how

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
so the previous tutorial just showed how

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.800 
so the previous tutorial just showed how
to<00:00:24.080> sketch<00:00:24.920> the<00:00:25.460> sports<00:00:25.789> car<00:00:26.060> just<00:00:26.600> gonna

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
to sketch the sports car just gonna

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.980 
to sketch the sports car just gonna
explain<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:28.310> overall<00:00:28.670> proportions<00:00:29.270> here<00:00:29.600> and

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
explain the overall proportions here and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.160 
explain the overall proportions here and
what<00:00:30.890> I'm<00:00:30.980> outlining<00:00:31.160> here<00:00:31.850> actually<00:00:32.840> just

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
what I'm outlining here actually just

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.200 
what I'm outlining here actually just
kind<00:00:33.379> of<00:00:33.440> going<00:00:33.980> over<00:00:34.280> it<00:00:34.399> back<00:00:34.640> with<00:00:35.120> the

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
kind of going over it back with the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.690 
kind of going over it back with the
market<00:00:35.539> so<00:00:35.629> it's<00:00:35.750> may<00:00:36.020> be<00:00:36.050> easier<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.440> read<00:00:36.710> but

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
market so it's may be easier to read but

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
market so it's may be easier to read but
we<00:00:38.570> start<00:00:38.870> to<00:00:39.170> look<00:00:39.829> at<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.220> general<00:00:40.790> overhang

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
we start to look at the general overhang

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.560 
we start to look at the general overhang
on<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.829> front<00:00:43.070> of<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.220> car<00:00:43.460> that's<00:00:44.120> basically

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
on the front of the car that's basically

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.970 
on the front of the car that's basically
that<00:00:44.690> distance<00:00:45.290> from<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.559> front<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:45.890> the

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
that distance from the front of the

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.549 
that distance from the front of the
wheel<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.760> front<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.450> car<00:00:47.690> that's

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
wheel to the front of the car that's

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.889 
wheel to the front of the car that's
what<00:00:48.680> we<00:00:48.770> call<00:00:48.950> an<00:00:49.070> overhang<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:49.730> that<00:00:50.690> is

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
what we call an overhang and that is

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.250 
what we call an overhang and that is
about<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:52.100> wheel<00:00:53.030> length<00:00:53.300> that's<00:00:53.690> typical<00:00:54.230> for

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
about a wheel length that's typical for

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.709 
about a wheel length that's typical for
a<00:00:54.559> wheel<00:00:55.510> link<00:00:56.510> in<00:00:56.860> diameter<00:00:58.360> that's<00:00:59.360> typical

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
a wheel link in diameter that's typical

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.110 
a wheel link in diameter that's typical
for<00:00:59.750> production<00:01:00.320> cars<00:01:00.670> I've<00:01:01.670> gone<00:01:01.879> to

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
for production cars I've gone to

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.079 
for production cars I've gone to
Thursday<00:01:02.510> little<00:01:02.750> bit<00:01:02.870> less<00:01:03.430> and<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.850> overall

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
Thursday little bit less and the overall

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.630 
Thursday little bit less and the overall
length<00:01:05.390> for<00:01:06.289> the<00:01:06.380> 2-door<00:01:06.740> sports<00:01:06.890> car<00:01:07.369> is

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
length for the 2-door sports car is

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.270 
length for the 2-door sports car is
around<00:01:08.030> two<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:08.869> a<00:01:08.930> half<00:01:09.140> I've<00:01:09.770> gone<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:10.070> little

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
around two and a half I've gone a little

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.390 
around two and a half I've gone a little
bit<00:01:10.490> over<00:01:11.020> two<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.170> three<00:01:12.290> quarters<00:01:12.740> it's<00:01:13.040> you

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
bit over two and three quarters it's you

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.710 
bit over two and three quarters it's you
know<00:01:13.490> not<00:01:13.700> that<00:01:13.729> big<00:01:13.970> of<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:14.150> deal<00:01:14.270> it's<00:01:14.450> just<00:01:14.479> a

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
know not that big of a deal it's just a

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.830 
know not that big of a deal it's just a
sketch<00:01:14.990> here<00:01:15.229> but<00:01:15.470> it's<00:01:15.619> just<00:01:15.740> a<00:01:16.840> typical

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
sketch here but it's just a typical

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.930 
sketch here but it's just a typical
portion<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:18.799> typically<00:01:19.250> use<00:01:19.340> for<00:01:19.640> a

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
portion that you typically use for a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.359 
portion that you typically use for a
sports<00:01:20.270> car<00:01:20.570> or<00:01:20.900> production<00:01:21.380> level<00:01:21.830> is<00:01:21.950> two

sports car or production level is two

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.370 
sports car or production level is two
and<00:01:22.490> a<00:01:22.549> half<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:23.000> then<00:01:23.810> also<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:24.170> rear

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
and a half and then also the rear

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.740 
and a half and then also the rear
overhang<00:01:24.860> is<00:01:25.040> around<00:01:25.340> one<00:01:26.650> which<00:01:27.650> I<00:01:28.010> have<00:01:28.040> gone

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
overhang is around one which I have gone

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.149 
overhang is around one which I have gone
2/3<00:01:29.750> as<00:01:29.900> well

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.270 

and<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> height<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.110> car<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and then the height of the car on the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.300 
and then the height of the car on the
top<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.149> tire<00:01:39.469> to<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.500> roofline<00:01:41.039> of<00:01:41.100> the

top of the tire to the roofline of the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.149 
top of the tire to the roofline of the

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.789 

you<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> lot<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.640> vehicles<00:01:51.420> like<00:01:53.360> BMW<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
you see a lot of vehicles like BMW and

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.710 
you see a lot of vehicles like BMW and
Mercedes<00:01:55.799> League<00:01:56.039> we<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.720> smaller

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
Mercedes League we have smaller

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.840 
Mercedes League we have smaller
overhangs<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.009> depends<00:01:59.429> on<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
overhangs and it just depends on the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.100 
overhangs and it just depends on the
type<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.119> car<00:02:00.829> whether<00:02:01.829> you're<00:02:01.979> looking<00:02:02.100> at<00:02:02.460> a

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
type of car whether you're looking at a

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.889 
type of car whether you're looking at a
rear<00:02:04.110> engine<00:02:04.380> I'm<00:02:05.189> sorry<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:06.210> rear-wheel<00:02:06.869> drive

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
rear engine I'm sorry a rear-wheel drive

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.380 
rear engine I'm sorry a rear-wheel drive
car<00:02:07.170> or<00:02:07.709> front-wheel<00:02:08.130> drive<00:02:08.160> car<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.269> we'll

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
car or front-wheel drive car and we'll

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.420 
car or front-wheel drive car and we'll
get<00:02:09.509> into<00:02:09.690> more<00:02:10.049> of<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:11.039> know<00:02:11.130> in<00:02:11.220> future

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
get into more of that you know in future

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
of the car so that's about it

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.770
