like the car that fits right in here

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.600 
like the car that fits right in here
it's<00:02:26.599> a<00:02:26.720> convertible<00:02:27.140> latch<00:02:27.409> deal<00:02:27.860> here<00:02:28.159> where

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
it's a convertible latch deal here where

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.740 
it's a convertible latch deal here where
it<00:02:28.700> keeps<00:02:28.879> you<00:02:28.970> out<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.239> rain<00:02:29.390> if<00:02:29.569> you
