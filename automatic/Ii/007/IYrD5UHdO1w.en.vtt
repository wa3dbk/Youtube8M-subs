walk<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> side<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.310> easy<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> go<00:01:29.759> up

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
walk up the side but it's easy to go up

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.990 
walk up the side but it's easy to go up
that<00:01:30.000> way<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:31.110> um<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.710> take<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.790> guy<00:01:32.970> down

throw<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:33.900> Nate<00:01:34.049> away<00:01:34.170> again<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.040> had

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
throw my Nate away again because I had

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.410 
throw my Nate away again because I had
this<00:01:35.340> notion<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.790> they<00:01:35.939> were<00:01:36.030> working<00:01:36.180> on

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
this notion that they were working on

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.510 
this notion that they were working on
the<00:01:36.509> plant<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.930> some<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.979> these<00:01:38.070> kills<00:01:38.369> are

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the plant and some of these kills are

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.370 
the plant and some of these kills are
headset<00:01:38.939> kills<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.750> time<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.960> walked<00:01:40.229> up
