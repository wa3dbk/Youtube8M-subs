00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.859
 first Richard negatively apparently 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.660
 team freight plans a little bit on my 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.440
 look still in the end was not enough 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.330
 Silenok play one clip while mode 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.350
 in my opinion quite normal through 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.100
 4 days 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.490
 but still the same people are dragging you 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.820
 and probably in Tomsk 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.560
 and such a psychological blow well 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.309
 obtained from which all this is likely 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.210
 rule until the end even started ok 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.960
 spent 1 time but in the second on purpose on 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.450
 goals 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.200
 although they will say it was dangerous there 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.309
 a lot of things but this 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.950
 territorially with the advantage they 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.860
 owned it and unfortunately in attack already in 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.039
 the second half of such moments as u 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:01.109
 Degtyarev started no longer created therefore 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:05.420
 that's lost 21 principle that the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.969
 happened and the trainer associates 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:14.819
 so that he doesn't have something 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:18.990
 happened and continued majesty to me 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:21.119
 another explanation is not just a sheet 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.890
 players here who comes to replace them 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.619
 basically utos 3 there they are 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.039
 holder of the 16 people we have on the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:36.500
 less will be equal to equivalent replacements 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:40.280
 there is no such play just why 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.280
 fat perlatum usually 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.080
 but not just wanted to still attack and 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.340
 Yakovlev was active on the flank wanted 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:55.259
 would only be a fresh person to him there 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.259
 add exactly for the same action and 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.130
 in a thin hammer principle he himself in return 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.420
 asked him not to change otsylochki 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.009
 said I was tired so I did not 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.500
 wait for your boyfriend's situation 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.959
 comment on missy thats what but 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.489
 here is this second goal which corner in 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.840
 Tomsk was he also led bravely to his sock 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.970
 Sorry so everyone did not play Fedorov 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.140
 but I hope that in the next game 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.140
 Mikhail becomes 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.220
 thank
