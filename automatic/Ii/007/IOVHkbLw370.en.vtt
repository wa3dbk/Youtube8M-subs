00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
go ahead and try and see if I can pause

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.880 
go ahead and try and see if I can pause
it<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.400> these<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:21.689> also<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.380> troops

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
it on one of these and also the troops

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.179 
it on one of these and also the troops
coming<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.430> will<00:00:23.760> also<00:00:24.029> be<00:00:24.390> level<00:00:25.320> 7<00:00:25.769> archers

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
coming out will also be level 7 archers

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.980 
coming out will also be level 7 archers
as<00:00:26.340> well<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.910> we'll<00:00:27.090> get<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.359> see<00:00:27.570> if<00:00:27.720> their

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
as well so we'll get to see if their

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.060 
as well so we'll get to see if their
archers<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> different<00:00:29.340> color<00:00:30.410> now<00:00:31.410> let<00:00:31.980> me

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
archers are a different color now let me

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.049 
archers are a different color now let me
see<00:00:32.219> if<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.579> pause<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.910> here<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:34.020> archer

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
see if I can pause it here the archer

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.619 
see if I can pause it here the archer
arrows<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.670> violet<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> pink<00:00:39.420> if

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
arrows are like a violet or a pink if

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.270 
arrows are like a violet or a pink if
you<00:00:39.690> will<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.379> color<00:00:41.219> which<00:00:42.000> signifies<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
you will a color which signifies the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.119 
you will a color which signifies the
upgrade<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.579> level<00:00:45.059> 7<00:00:45.450> now<00:00:46.170> that's<00:00:46.530> also<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
upgrade to level 7 now that's also the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.819 
upgrade to level 7 now that's also the
same<00:00:47.160> color<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> archer<00:00:48.539> towers<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.620> if

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
same color on the archer towers so if

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.069 
same color on the archer towers so if
you<00:00:49.980> ask<00:00:50.100> me<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.420> way<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.719> arches

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you ask me I do like the way the arches

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.100 
you ask me I do like the way the arches
look<00:00:52.320> they<00:00:52.530> look<00:00:52.739> stronger<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:54.110> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
look they look stronger and they the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.500 
look they look stronger and they the
weapons<00:00:55.500> look<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.860> little<00:00:56.010> better<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.460> well

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
weapons look a little better as well

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.540 
weapons look a little better as well
but<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> don't<00:00:58.320> believe<00:00:58.770> that'll<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> last

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
but I don't believe that'll be the last

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.330 
but I don't believe that'll be the last
level<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.300> because<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.469> level<00:01:01.829> 7<00:01:02.219> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
level just because you know level 7 is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.010 
level just because you know level 7 is
such<00:01:02.910> an<00:01:03.120> odd<00:01:04.519> such<00:01:05.519> an<00:01:05.610> odd<00:01:05.820> number<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
such an odd such an odd number and I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.850 
such an odd such an odd number and I
think<00:01:07.380> 10<00:01:07.799> or<00:01:08.130> 12<00:01:08.520> would<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.810> an<00:01:09.990> even<00:01:10.409> or

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
think 10 or 12 would be like an even or

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.899 
think 10 or 12 would be like an even or
a<00:01:10.970> probably<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.530> end<00:01:13.530> point<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> archers

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
a probably a end point for the archers

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.719 
a probably a end point for the archers
to<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.119> upgraded<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.950> that's<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.070> my<00:01:17.340> theory

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
to be upgraded to that's just my theory

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.570 
to be upgraded to that's just my theory
but<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.479> level<00:01:18.840> 7<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.530> then<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.460> me

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
but it's level 7 is it then you have me

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.420 
but it's level 7 is it then you have me
surprised<00:01:20.990> but<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> am<00:01:22.229> liking<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.770> upgrade<00:01:23.250> to

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
surprised but I am liking the upgrade to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.630 
surprised but I am liking the upgrade to
the<00:01:23.520> arc<00:01:23.700> two<00:01:23.850> towers<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.640> probably

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the arc two towers now this is probably

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
the arc two towers now this is probably
something<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.180> lot<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.360> champions<00:01:27.900> needed<00:01:28.259> as

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
something a lot of champions needed as

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.370 
something a lot of champions needed as
it<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.460> now<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.060> heroes<00:01:30.450> are<00:01:30.689> stills<00:01:31.049> I

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it is now the heroes are stills I

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.670 
it is now the heroes are stills I
wouldn't<00:01:32.250> say<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> heroes<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:33.030> overall

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
wouldn't say the heroes just overall

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.550 
wouldn't say the heroes just overall
attacking<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.829> champions<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.030> still<00:01:36.560> pretty

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
attacking a champions is still pretty

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.710 
attacking a champions is still pretty
one-sided<00:01:38.070> people<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.030> attack<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.540> are

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
one-sided people that attack you are

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.469 
one-sided people that attack you are
gonna<00:01:40.170> usually<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:41.009> star<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.850> having

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
gonna usually to star you so having

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.050 
gonna usually to star you so having
Archer<00:01:42.960> towers<00:01:43.290> upgraded<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.189> will<00:01:44.759> help

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
Archer towers upgraded to this will help

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.679 
Archer towers upgraded to this will help
out<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> lot<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.780> defenders<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:47.000> as<00:01:48.000> well<00:01:48.479> as

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
out a lot of defenders and as well as

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.230 
out a lot of defenders and as well as
the<00:01:49.079> new<00:01:49.590> unit<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.310> got<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.700> lava<00:01:50.939> troop

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the new unit that we got the lava troop

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.600 
the new unit that we got the lava troop
that<00:01:51.420> maybe<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.619> counterbalance<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.460> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that maybe just a counterbalance so that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.940 
that maybe just a counterbalance so that
we<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.939> balance<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.420> game<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.780> with<00:01:55.740> these

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
we can balance the game out with these

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.060 
we can balance the game out with these
new<00:01:56.189> units<00:01:56.610> once<00:01:57.030> people<00:01:57.560> test<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> new

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
new units once people test out the new

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.280 
new units once people test out the new
troop<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.610> they<00:02:00.000> figure<00:02:00.659> out<00:02:00.719> some<00:02:01.140> ways

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
troop and they figure out some ways

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.950 
troop and they figure out some ways
around<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.829> they<00:02:02.640> could<00:02:02.820> probably<00:02:02.969> be<00:02:03.750> pretty

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
around it they could probably be pretty

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.920 
around it they could probably be pretty
overpowered<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:04.890> I'm<00:02:05.640> liking<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.390> upgrade<00:02:06.899> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
overpowered so I'm liking the upgrade to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.169 
overpowered so I'm liking the upgrade to
the<00:02:07.079> archer<00:02:07.439> towers<00:02:07.740> 13<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.310> do<00:02:08.489> feel<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.060> as

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the archer towers 13 I do feel it as

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.070 
the archer towers 13 I do feel it as
necessary<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.649> give<00:02:10.830> us<00:02:10.950> these<00:02:11.190> new<00:02:11.370> of

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
necessary to give us these new of

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.720 
necessary to give us these new of
so<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.349> has<00:02:13.500> been<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> pretty<00:02:14.099> good<00:02:14.280> two<00:02:14.430> star

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
so this has been a pretty good two star

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.970 
so this has been a pretty good two star

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
he can I don't think he got this one

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.559 
he can I don't think he got this one
just<00:03:23.220> because<00:03:23.489> he<00:03:23.609> was<00:03:23.730> experimenting<00:03:24.120> with

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
just because he was experimenting with

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.599 
just because he was experimenting with
the<00:03:24.720> Hound<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.319> let's<00:03:25.530> see<00:03:25.739> if<00:03:25.769> we<00:03:25.859> can<00:03:26.069> go<00:03:26.220> and

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
the Hound but let's see if we can go and

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.930 
the Hound but let's see if we can go and
find<00:03:26.699> another<00:03:27.299> replay<00:03:28.199> and<00:03:28.530> see<00:03:28.560> how<00:03:29.549> they<00:03:29.730> use

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
find another replay and see how they use

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.759 
find another replay and see how they use
this<00:03:30.120> one<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.359> this<00:03:30.720> one<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.109> actually<00:03:31.319> on

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
this one that this one is actually on

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.979 
this one that this one is actually on
defense<00:03:32.430> if<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:33.120> guys<00:03:33.329> are<00:03:33.480> interested<00:03:33.690> in

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
defense if you guys are interested in

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.750 
defense if you guys are interested in
using<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.379> lava<00:03:34.590> hounds<00:03:34.889> for<00:03:35.069> defense<00:03:35.489> this

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
using the lava hounds for defense this

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.210 
using the lava hounds for defense this
is<00:03:35.940> probably<00:03:36.449> what<00:03:37.109> you<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.349> expect<00:03:37.829> if

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
is probably what you can expect if

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.789 
is probably what you can expect if
you're<00:03:38.430> gonna<00:03:38.579> do<00:03:38.819> that<00:03:39.079> now<00:03:40.079> granted<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.620> is

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
you're gonna do that now granted this is

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.259 
you're gonna do that now granted this is
a<00:03:40.829> lot<00:03:41.129> different<00:03:41.579> if<00:03:41.699> you're<00:03:41.849> in<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.060> higher

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
a lot different if you're in a higher

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.080 
a lot different if you're in a higher
Cup<00:03:42.599> range<00:03:42.870> people<00:03:43.549> don't<00:03:44.549> really<00:03:44.699> fall<00:03:45.060> for

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
Cup range people don't really fall for

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.849 
Cup range people don't really fall for
your<00:03:45.389> little<00:03:45.480> gimmicks<00:03:45.930> like<00:03:46.019> this<00:03:46.410> but<00:03:46.680> I

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
your little gimmicks like this but I

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.439 
your little gimmicks like this but I
believe<00:03:47.220> in<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.459> lower<00:03:47.699> Cup<00:03:48.000> range<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.329> could

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
believe in a lower Cup range you could

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.449 
believe in a lower Cup range you could
probably<00:03:48.660> throw<00:03:48.930> off<00:03:49.199> some<00:03:49.470> players<00:03:49.709> if

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
probably throw off some players if

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.520 
probably throw off some players if
they're<00:03:50.699> trying<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:50.940> farm<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.419> and<00:03:51.660> this<00:03:52.349> is

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
they're trying to farm you and this is

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.439 
they're trying to farm you and this is
the<00:03:52.560> lava<00:03:53.190> Helen<00:03:53.489> coming<00:03:53.790> out<00:03:54.000> of<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.239> clan

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
the lava Helen coming out of the clan

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.689 
the lava Helen coming out of the clan
castle<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.199> he's<00:03:55.500> going<00:03:55.799> for<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.069> hero<00:03:56.459> and

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
castle and he's going for the hero and

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.449 
castle and he's going for the hero and
the<00:03:56.790> golems<00:03:57.329> and<00:03:57.599> he<00:03:58.590> doesn't<00:03:58.829> do<00:03:59.099> too<00:03:59.310> much

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
the golems and he doesn't do too much

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.550 
the golems and he doesn't do too much
damage<00:03:59.519> however<00:04:00.150> when<00:04:00.540> he<00:04:00.629> does<00:04:00.840> blow<00:04:01.109> up<00:04:01.319> that

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
damage however when he does blow up that

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.920 
damage however when he does blow up that
should<00:04:01.739> scatter<00:04:02.159> and<00:04:02.519> cause<00:04:03.120> confusion<00:04:03.419> with

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
should scatter and cause confusion with

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.349 
should scatter and cause confusion with
the<00:04:04.109> enemy<00:04:04.560> troops<00:04:04.829> and<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.760> might<00:04:05.970> distract

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
the enemy troops and it might distract

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.259 
the enemy troops and it might distract
them<00:04:06.569> a<00:04:06.659> little<00:04:06.870> bit<00:04:06.989> so<00:04:07.199> that<00:04:07.230> they<00:04:08.060> just<00:04:09.060> have

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
them a little bit so that they just have

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.300 
them a little bit so that they just have
more<00:04:09.449> time<00:04:09.720> drained<00:04:10.229> on<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.709> attack<00:04:11.010> but

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
more time drained on the attack but

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.849 
more time drained on the attack but
however<00:04:12.299> in<00:04:12.810> Champions<00:04:13.470> League<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.709> don't

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
however in Champions League I don't

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.189 
however in Champions League I don't
think<00:04:14.040> it'll<00:04:14.159> cost<00:04:14.579> too<00:04:14.849> much<00:04:14.879> of<00:04:15.569> an<00:04:15.870> effect

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
think it'll cost too much of an effect

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.349 
think it'll cost too much of an effect
as<00:04:16.380> this<00:04:16.680> player<00:04:16.949> from<00:04:17.699> King's<00:04:17.940> Rock<00:04:18.180> was

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
as this player from King's Rock was

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.060 
as this player from King's Rock was
still<00:04:18.570> able<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.900> get<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.289> Town<00:04:19.500> Hall<00:04:19.739> and

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
still able to get the Town Hall and

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.350 
still able to get the Town Hall and
possibly<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.060> 50%<00:04:21.419> with

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
possibly the 50% with

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.600 
possibly the 50% with
Tech<00:04:22.719> and<00:04:23.319> you<00:04:23.469> guys<00:04:23.650> this<00:04:23.889> should<00:04:24.069> wrap<00:04:24.219> it<00:04:24.460> up

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
Tech and you guys this should wrap it up

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.820 
Tech and you guys this should wrap it up
so<00:04:24.849> you<00:04:24.909> get<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.270> see<00:04:25.509> lava<00:04:25.930> hounds<00:04:26.319> on<00:04:26.469> attack
