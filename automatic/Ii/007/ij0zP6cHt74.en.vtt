00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.139
 good guys again in kraft 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.539
 pattern a new 1.8 engine called mini 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.520
 people this case does not work with forge 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.590
 vale boys is a minecraft folder 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.240
 modified that already brings the installed mode 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.460
 and that also brings different therefore 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.740
 we need to put nothing else and if 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.180
 you want to be mods and to the counseling 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.059
 because we would have to install because 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.379
 for that version, it may be that it does not 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.940
 work correctly so that you 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.980
 I recommend that you leave it as it is 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.840
 likewise the installation the following 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.000
 at the end of the video so wait for it 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.530
 for then it is worth the thing that is what 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.410
 does this mode as I'm seeing I have 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.180
 a person I have a super character 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.280
 small the size of a mini zombie 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.500
 although with my own skin and that's how 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.809
 is going to see me and I will also see 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.820
 so to any player that is in my 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.710
 server or any player that is in 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.910
 any server is or is not 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.620
 installed this mod 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.070
 in those basic services and in addition 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.350
 it's also going to change the size they're going to 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.149
 put in small in small or in mini 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.890
 some of the mods that also appear 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.810
 in minecraft manila I would like that 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.810
 they were all but they are not all for now 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.950
 although I'm probably on my way, I'm going to 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.759
 put myself 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.549
 field of vision I have 65 that although in 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.039
 f5 look better with a field of view 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.350
 smaller so I dizzy have the 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.299
 screen so close then guys 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.640
 here we have all the modes that are 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.409
 changed with this mode to make them look 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.149
 much smaller you are going to see that 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.850
 some are super monkeys like for example 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.429
 this kripper look at what creepers guys 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.750
 look how cool how handsome the only thing 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.780
 bad is that between the grass is not going 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.520
 to see but he is super cool after 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.590
 we have the skeleton as I lie 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.299
 put my god like as I fly as 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.880
 mind sent by the skeleton here in 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.470
 this part and see how cool that also 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.270
 is where you touch is super cool 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.819
 then we have the spider that also 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.310
 you see here it gets better because there you 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.250
 like how do you have a collision box 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.140
 as part bigger die and 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.849
 sorry boy for the noise as you see the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.099
 nobody also looks super super cute 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.230
 super cool we have the zombie by the way 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.930
 and in this case because as you see also 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.540
 see little one and we have here the bad thing that 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.180
 is that in this case you can not differentiate 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.069
 a small zombie from a normal zombie 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.049
 then the only way I would have 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.780
 It would be to see how to run if you run a lot 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.299
 It is small and if it is normal then it does not and if 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.760
 for example it burns under the sun it is big 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.200
 Homeless small and even then the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.030
 only way to differentiate it 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.799
 we also have the pigment as you see 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.269
 It is also tiny, therefore also 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.010
 we have here that margin of error that 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.400
 we can confuse a big one with 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.099
 one small and the most handsome one that 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.510
 You see, it's super super cool and then 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.280
 we also have the color spider that 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.799
 it looks even smaller if it looked 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.079
 small the miraval spider that's the 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.700
 spider and this is the cave spider like 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.829
 you see even smaller this 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.150
 I would like it to happen with the pigments and 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.889
 with the zombies for example if they come 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.500
 smaller to differentiate them 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.030
 but for now that does not happen so 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.400
 Well, this is what we have for 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.379
 Now it's worth it, I have to tell you that 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.500
 how do we have a collision box 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.769
 normal we do not have a collision box 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.870
 they tell me to redesigned because it did not come out 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.180
 We can not, for example, get into 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.310
 sites with blocks one by one 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.689
 then nothing directly changes the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.849
 nine changes in minecraft 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:27.709
 playable for us is the size 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.400
 of the mods and also that we're going to have 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.560
 a 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.379
 a little lower than normal but for 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.110
 the rest is exactly the same and good 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.549
 guys, it 's a good thing that I've already 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.349
 said before that is that if we get into 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.900
 any multiplayer server too 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.390
 let's see any player in 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.189
 small let's prove it good I'm still 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.489
 put on any server by 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:51.109
 mini plex example and look at how they look 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.349
 to the players worth so this is a 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.480
 normal player or a player and see if 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.819
 I take away the advertising that is worth it 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.459
 the time that is pulled good as you see it 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.700
 give super super cute people 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:08.000
 cool though cool how cool they look 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.760
 it's super monkeys uncle good as you see 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.170
 everything is super small is super cool 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.159
 the skeleton guays also by 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.409
 true that before he had forgotten 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:18.169
 say it also look smaller 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.660
 et cetera et cetera etcetera is super 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.970
 super cool the first change for 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.800
 example then it is only to make two goals my 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.630
 cetera the cows the sheep that neither 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.160
 are going to be enlarged by the theme that 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.440
 Well, they have not done them yet 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.759
 great but otherwise it's super 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.169
 cool so guys 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.390
 this is the mod I hope that I have 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.060

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.220

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.870
 it's true we spent the station pk going very 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.310
 well if with installation it is very easy 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.890
 with the general is the file simply 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.630
 you are going to decompress this folder inside 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.720
 from the minecraft folder voucher voucher 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.540
