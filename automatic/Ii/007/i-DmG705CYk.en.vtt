00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
third reason that Scott did this just

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.530 
third reason that Scott did this just
for<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> trailer<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.670> could<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
for the trailer but it could be the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.050 
for the trailer but it could be the
first<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:43.020> second<00:01:43.439> reason<00:01:43.939> honestly<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
first or second reason honestly the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.370 
first or second reason honestly the
first<00:01:45.240> reason<00:01:45.659> seems<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> least

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
first reason seems to be the least

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.100 
first reason seems to be the least
likely<00:01:46.530> because<00:01:47.600> apparently<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.689> has<00:01:48.869> been

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
likely because apparently it has been

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.410 
likely because apparently it has been
proven<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.530> phone<00:01:49.860> guy<00:01:50.070> died<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.729> night<00:01:51.090> 4

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
proven that phone guy died on night 4

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.389 
proven that phone guy died on night 4
because<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.079> hear<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> animatronics

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
because you can hear the animatronics

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.950 
because you can hear the animatronics
enter<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> room<00:01:54.210> based<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.750> background

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
enter the room based on the background

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.660 
enter the room based on the background
you<00:01:55.290> hear<00:01:55.500> when<00:01:55.799> he's<00:01:55.950> talking<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.579> in

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you hear when he's talking to you in

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.539 
you hear when he's talking to you in
night<00:01:56.850> 4<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.409> at<00:01:58.409> night<00:01:58.590> 5<00:01:58.860> when<00:01:59.219> Freddy

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
night 4 and at night 5 when Freddy

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.060 
night 4 and at night 5 when Freddy
leaves<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.090> message<00:02:00.329> well<00:02:01.170> we<00:02:01.619> think<00:02:01.829> it's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
leaves a message well we think it's

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.639 
leaves a message well we think it's
Freddy<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.840> really<00:02:03.840> don't<00:02:04.020> see<00:02:04.079> how<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.469> could

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
Freddy I really don't see how it could

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.289 
Freddy I really don't see how it could
be<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.890> phone<00:02:05.100> guy<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.759> since<00:02:06.030> he<00:02:06.149> has<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
be the phone guy but since he has the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.449 
be the phone guy but since he has the
same<00:02:06.630> voice<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.259> might<00:02:07.469> be<00:02:07.619> him<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.190> again

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
same voice it might be him but again

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.790 
same voice it might be him but again
Scott<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.450> one<00:02:09.629> voicing<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.319> phone<00:02:10.530> guy

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
Scott is the one voicing the phone guy

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.120 
Scott is the one voicing the phone guy
so

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
so

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.070 
so
it<00:02:12.700> could<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.000> be<00:02:13.180> Scott<00:02:13.450> making<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.900> for<00:02:14.020> the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
it could just be Scott making it for the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.140 
it could just be Scott making it for the
trailer<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.680> second<00:02:15.040> reason<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.550> could<00:02:15.940> be

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
trailer the second reason it could be

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.580 
trailer the second reason it could be
Mike<00:02:16.620> because<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:18.670> message<00:02:19.030> does<00:02:19.360> say<00:02:19.690> well

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
Mike because the message does say well

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.630 
Mike because the message does say well
if<00:02:20.710> you're<00:02:20.830> hearing<00:02:21.100> this<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.280> have<00:02:21.460> made<00:02:21.610> a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
if you're hearing this you have made a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.850 
if you're hearing this you have made a
poor<00:02:21.880> career<00:02:22.210> choice<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.840> know<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:23.290> could<00:02:23.830> be

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
poor career choice you know it could be

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.460 
poor career choice you know it could be
Mike<00:02:24.310> just<00:02:25.060> warning<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.750> new<00:02:25.870> security<00:02:26.350> guard

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
Mike just warning the new security guard

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.580 
Mike just warning the new security guard

like you messed up my boy you should not

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.530 
like you messed up my boy you should not
have<00:02:29.770> picked<00:02:30.040> this<00:02:30.220> job<00:02:30.550> welcome<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.300> hell

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
have picked this job welcome to hell

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.850 
have picked this job welcome to hell
that<00:02:31.810> could<00:02:32.020> be<00:02:32.170> what<00:02:32.320> he's<00:02:32.410> trying<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.650> say<00:02:32.830> to

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
that could be what he's trying to say to

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.180 
that could be what he's trying to say to
him<00:02:33.070> because<00:02:33.430> mike<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:34.530> possibly<00:02:35.530> moved<00:02:35.860> on<00:02:36.040> to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
him because mike is possibly moved on to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.250 
him because mike is possibly moved on to
the<00:02:36.310> day<00:02:36.520> shift<00:02:36.690> because<00:02:37.690> it's<00:02:37.870> saying<00:02:38.080> that

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
the day shift because it's saying that

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.560 
the day shift because it's saying that
in<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.310> same<00:02:39.490> greenlight<00:02:39.850> page<00:02:39.880> it<00:02:40.210> says<00:02:40.390> that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
in the same greenlight page it says that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.540 
in the same greenlight page it says that
the<00:02:40.690> old<00:02:40.840> security<00:02:41.350> guard<00:02:41.620> has<00:02:42.130> complained

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
the old security guard has complained

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.890 
the old security guard has complained
that<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.820> animatronics<00:02:43.450> are<00:02:43.540> trying<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.780> get

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
that the animatronics are trying to get

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.530 
that the animatronics are trying to get
into<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.920> room<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.090> most<00:02:46.360> likely

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
into the room and that is most likely

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.030 
into the room and that is most likely
Mike<00:02:46.870> because<00:02:47.200> we<00:02:47.320> don't<00:02:47.560> know<00:02:47.680> any<00:02:47.920> other

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
Mike because we don't know any other

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.680 
Mike because we don't know any other
security<00:02:48.610> guard<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:48.940> has<00:02:49.090> worked<00:02:49.300> here<00:02:49.600> in

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
security guard that has worked here in

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.370 
security guard that has worked here in
five<00:02:49.870> minutes<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:50.200> Freddy's<00:02:50.500> by<00:02:50.650> name<00:02:50.920> so

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
five minutes of Freddy's by name so

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.830 
five minutes of Freddy's by name so
that's<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.560> second<00:02:53.950> reason<00:02:54.010> but<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.940> think<00:02:55.750> I'm

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
that's the second reason but I think I'm

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.660 
that's the second reason but I think I'm
leaning<00:02:56.020> more<00:02:56.320> towards<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.190> third<00:02:57.430> reason

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
leaning more towards the third reason

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.150 
leaning more towards the third reason
that<00:02:57.880> Scott<00:02:58.330> made<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.930> just<00:02:59.500> for<00:02:59.710> the<00:02:59.770> purpose

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
that Scott made it just for the purpose

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.100 
that Scott made it just for the purpose
of<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.430> trailer<00:03:00.850> because<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.780> phone<00:03:01.960> guy's

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
of the trailer because the phone guy's

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.560 
of the trailer because the phone guy's
talking<00:03:02.500> directly<00:03:02.740> to<00:03:03.250> us<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:04.090> screen<00:03:04.390> is

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
talking directly to us the screen is

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.050 
talking directly to us the screen is
black<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.830> don't<00:03:06.070> think<00:03:06.250> I've<00:03:06.370> noticed<00:03:06.400> the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
black and I don't think I've noticed the

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.480 
black and I don't think I've noticed the
phone<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.800> five<00:03:08.980> nights<00:03:09.100> at<00:03:09.280> Freddy's

suit trailer and I honestly don't see a

suit trailer and I honestly don't see a
reason<00:03:12.220> as<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.430> why<00:03:12.520> you<00:03:13.060> would<00:03:13.510> need<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.810> hear
