00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.919
 then we understand the theory of these 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.210
 tools 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:29.369
 now we really understand 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.489
 I managed to analyze, we'll go 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.089
 exemplifies all situations with 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.640
 bad evidence I played for you 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.050
 start getting used to it all 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.620
 all this development then 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.040
 fundamental for example now the example 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.230
 and stay for you six network hands 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.809
 standard beth food which is the first 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.229
 tool that I approached come 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.540
 this is a situation that I'm in 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.549
 valet in positive r and you go 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.180
 see that the dollar is being 200 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:04.680
 I always put of 22.5 babies the net 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.780
 initial pattern 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.290
 We do not need to put more than 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.420
 This is because because the impression you 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.670
 It's independent, you put a picture 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.950
 500 or 600 is the same 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.100
 You do not need more and invest more 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:25.140
 to represent a situation 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.950
 this value from 22.10 to 2.5 is 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.859
 extremely necessary and effective you 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.859
 represent and show the value of your hand 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.869
 How I said the game today is very fair. 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.960
 it is very competitive super difficult to 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.429
 plug is waste of ad is waste 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.770
 Of money 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.139
 now that you can see 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.939
 that the tournament passed a net without 200 

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:50.759
 The next hand I have more drama. 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.909
 also the TV plus one but only returned 40 thousand 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:59.460
 150 150 or so look at the blog 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:03.359
 Attention 665 which is more or less than 2 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.450
 to 2 and a half x babies the standard network always 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:11.100
 deal you see here spent more 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.120
 of 10 mp also with 33 thousand network chips 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.760
 pattern 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.410
 you can see that always now in the 500 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.730
 a thousand even easier to calculate 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.280
 you can see here O 2300 2.3 x you 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.290
 See I'll never get past this edge. 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.329
 Never 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.209
 is a player will hardly pass 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:32.150
 of these 2.5 in the initial realm 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.129
 if it passes because it is a hotel already I 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.379
 he is showing a lot of strength in his hand 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.379
 case is can look statistics 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.510
 it's a guy it's a star to a guy 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.730
 What are you playing because it reflects 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.560
 recreationally for sure 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.709
 so here I thought that the idea that I 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.129
 open tg opens two of 300 of council 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.920
 tokens on babies 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:58.340
 now this 10 and northeast 9 off mp you 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.659
 can see 8 700 always respecting this 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:06.379
 always respecting the 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:08.599
 tgv you see that are examples is is in 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.840
 different situations of the tournament are 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.989
 examples at different times in the tournament 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.290
 that none of me are on level 4 58 jet 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.650
 Levels 10 The Path at level 15 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.049
 so we and I always keep the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.489
 standard you see that it had 12 x 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:31.760
 the mini heise then it's always 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.970
 margin of 22 points five baby kings and 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.099
 initial default without a secret is 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.190
 extremely important to control this 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:43.669
 because if we do not 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.889
 restart the pattern controlled the moves 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:49.430
 as a result of which we ended up 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:52.069
 to see will cost you more expensive 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.690
 lose watch to erase certain hands 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.109
 Just as we were learning 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.139
 about pots on cleide otis from 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.430
 the moment we are thirsty and hase 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.379
 we'll have to pay more expensive 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.409
 then because, consequently, people 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:09.019
 to take the tribeca was beth five betty is 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.879
 surely it will come higher because 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.829
 we started already a little more expensive and 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.569
 It sure turns out to be a 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.130
 bad situation because we never want to 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.349
 an uncontrolled pot we always go 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.349
 control a lot of pot always 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.660
