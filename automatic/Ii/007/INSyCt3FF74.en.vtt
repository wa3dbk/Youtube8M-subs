one<00:03:02.629> three<00:03:02.870> nine<00:03:03.079> that's<00:03:03.709> what<00:03:03.859> they<00:03:03.950> call

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
one three nine that's what they call

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.270 
one three nine that's what they call
them<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.849> deranged<00:03:05.450> wide<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.500> truck<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.010> why

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
them the deranged wide the truck so why

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.339 
them the deranged wide the truck so why
does<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.549> board<00:03:07.760> but<00:03:08.629> yeah<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.019> think<00:03:09.109> these

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349

wheels best folks enough bones STF I got
these<00:03:28.069> originally<00:03:28.609> 54<00:03:29.269> because<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.889> last

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
these originally 54 because the last

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.610 
these originally 54 because the last
time<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.549> got<00:03:31.669> fifty<00:03:32.000> twos<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:32.540> they<00:03:33.319> shrunk

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
time I got fifty twos and they shrunk

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.939 
time I got fifty twos and they shrunk
down<00:03:33.769> like<00:03:34.010> really<00:03:34.609> quickly<00:03:35.199> so<00:03:36.199> in<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:36.769> few

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
down like really quickly so in a few

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.180 
down like really quickly so in a few
months<00:03:37.129> I<00:03:37.400> was<00:03:37.639> down<00:03:37.849> to<00:03:37.879> like<00:03:38.090> 45<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:39.769> didn't

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
months I was down to like 45 so I didn't

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.789 
months I was down to like 45 so I didn't
know<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.459> again<00:03:40.819> so<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.810> bought<00:03:42.049> 50<00:03:42.379> for<00:03:42.590> this

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
know that again so I bought 50 for this

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.800 
know that again so I bought 50 for this
time<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:43.250> now<00:03:43.760> it's<00:03:43.940> been<00:03:44.120> like<00:03:44.359> two<00:03:44.540> months

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
time and now it's been like two months

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.689 
time and now it's been like two months
or<00:03:45.049> three<00:03:45.549> maybe

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
or three maybe

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.979 
or three maybe
and<00:03:46.849> then<00:03:47.359> I'm<00:03:47.479> 250<00:03:48.169> so<00:03:48.940> then<00:03:49.940> bearings<00:03:50.540> are

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
and then I'm 250 so then bearings are

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:59.510 
and then I'm 250 so then bearings are
like<00:03:51.560> some<00:03:52.129> fucked-up<00:03:52.609> bearings<00:03:53.019> basically

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.240 

maybe<00:04:00.210> this<00:04:00.780> noise<00:04:00.990> will<00:04:01.230> go<00:04:01.350> away

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250
