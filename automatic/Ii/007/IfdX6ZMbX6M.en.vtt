00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello to all and with that of tests 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.410
 mobile.fr I'm at mwc 2015 on the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.389
 stand of johnny gironis who is a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 Chinese constructor if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.350
 which is not very well known we see 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.670
 more and more because they make 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.550
 products that are not uninteresting 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.950
 she is there I have in hand the elif s7 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.350
 which is low that was actually unveiled 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:30.780
 at mwc so it's theirs all new 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.340
 flagship which is proposed to 399 around 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.710
 from 399 euros 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.839
 but at first that will not be 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.589
 proposed in France at least under this 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:43.249
 mark there that at first I think that 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.420
 I hated it also proposes in France 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:48.149
 their products via the brand 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.440
 casam especially so in any case that 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.460
 I do not know if this form factor 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.449
 will find it in someone else's house 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.249
 should I am not pacified yet 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.620
 casam but we'll see later 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:58.409
 so what's on the agenda 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.010
 this little one finally this little us for a one 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.760
 good size 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.110
 botha el-feth 7 so the el-feth is it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.200
 has a screen 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.170
 2 5 points 2 inches it measures only 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.490
 5 mm thick johnny is very 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.270
 known anyway for these products very 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.940
 end in this series and leaf anyway 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.060
 there we at the main camera with the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.010
 8 megapixel flash in the front and 13 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.560
 megapixels on the back the screen that's 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.650
 so 5 - 2 inches and the full hd super 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.520
 super amoled 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:35.729
 we have a processor opted 64- bit agreement 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.070
 101.7 gigahertz a battery of 2750 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.259
 mignan father and runs under android 5.0 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.780
 we will go around the design so 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.460
 two faces here with the front camera 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.690
 which must be there some fla sensors 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.790
 the led 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.320
 an animation that is launched that's good 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.729
 here on the right 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.740
 we have good it's not easy with these 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.830
 devices very fine good it's the button 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.190
 on / off there here and there volume management 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.979
 here nothing on the top it's in 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.690
 aluminum does it seem and you see you 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.970
 have some kind of relief then actually 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.390
 it's two elements with a hole with 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.739
 a crack in the middle finally this is 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.630
 interesting on that side there we have the 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.950
 opportunity to put a sim I know 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.799
 not if we can put a micro sd I 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.730
 not the memory there in front of me there 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:26.310
 on the bottom so jack 3.5 the speaker 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.150
 and the blue micro usb and then to 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.700
 the back a shell finally a surface 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.150
 completely smooth glass plate 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.380
 it seems I do not know where it looks like 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.970
 glass or maybe shiny plastic 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.040
 I am I am not I am not sure there 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.290
 and the camera of course then 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.940
 I have access to lots of things to watch 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.049
 quickly in the interface 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.580
 I feel like we have something 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.930
 of rather nice go we can 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.190
 settle a notification directly 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.900
 like that so the notifications that 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.030
 appears there is no shortcut in 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.530
 quick access i feel abassi that 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.000
 happens through down I pass I got the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.769
 reflex to do that I asked myself the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.060
 question is actually this is where 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.090
 so there are some shortcuts in 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.829
 quick access here very very very fast 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.799
 intruder is very responsive that's rather 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.510
 nice we dial a number there 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.610
 is running under lollipop apparently so that 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.850
 it's really nice toc who 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.590
 10 10 open later their management timing 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:23.380
 so that I do not know how it works 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.460
 it's like that I do not know that 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.810
 we test it we will look at all 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.080
 small functions case especially in 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.510
 the camera to worry about the 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.290
 gallery I like the interface with the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.120
 back the album folders 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.700
 that seems to work well 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.360
 very very fast in any case whatever 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.150
 is music is going on here can sort 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:51.070
 by being an artist you have all the 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:55.260
 songs here I'm reading a 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:58.209
 piece rather not bad 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:05.760
 what has other me we have 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:05.760
 looked at the contacts look keyboard 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:14.830
 this is where swift greets 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.930
 the girls is opposite it's in English 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.160
 but yeah that's swiftkey there I do not know 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.269
 if it is preinstalled but in any case it 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.729
 is on this terminal 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.210
 the calendar that looks like his complaint 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.620
 m 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.620
 that's pretty cool 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.860
 these are the folders that is displayed this 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.240
 way this is it's going to be for 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.470
 can quickly add an event 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.610
 I think that there and also at all 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.950
 calendar events that has to 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.570
 show up I think is good we can 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.770
 add widgets here is displayed 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.630
 like that it is rather well done 1 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.630
 it's really elegant as an interface 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.040
 I do not know the weather for example 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.140
 that kind of things that in any case a 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.560
 very beautiful device from jonnier 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.020
 the fs7 beautiful beautiful interface design and a 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.060
 beautiful screen beautiful spec finally good all 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.020
 and everything is there more or less so that's it 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.010
 Tell me what you think 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.010
 then I tell you see you soon
