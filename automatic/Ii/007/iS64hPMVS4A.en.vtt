one<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.040> them<00:03:51.310> that<00:03:51.520> I<00:03:51.730> was<00:03:52.150> thinking<00:03:52.450> about

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
one of them that I was thinking about

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.310

way I understand it they put a lot of
lime<00:04:00.610> on<00:04:01.320> Mexican<00:04:02.320> food<00:04:02.530> which<00:04:02.709> I<00:04:02.860> didn't<00:04:03.160> know
