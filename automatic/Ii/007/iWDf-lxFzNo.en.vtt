00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
first thing is coordination what's the

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.929 
first thing is coordination what's the
first<00:00:25.329> thing<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:27.220> second<00:00:27.610> thing<00:00:27.640> is

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
first thing the second thing is

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.210 
first thing the second thing is
technique<00:00:28.329> what's<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:28.750> second<00:00:29.020> thing

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
technique what's the second thing

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.159 
technique what's the second thing
and<00:00:30.220> the<00:00:30.520> third<00:00:30.730> thing<00:00:30.970> is<00:00:31.180> confidence<00:00:31.660> what's

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
and the third thing is confidence what's

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.380 
and the third thing is confidence what's
the<00:00:32.259> third<00:00:32.379> thing

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the third thing

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.880 
the third thing
excellent<00:00:34.390> right<00:00:34.690> okay<00:00:35.140> so<00:00:35.410> the<00:00:35.500> first<00:00:35.710> thing

you come out here probably the easiest
way<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.839> start<00:00:41.650> learning<00:00:41.739> pickups<00:00:42.400> is<00:00:42.760> this

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
way to start learning pickups is this

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
that now the important thing to remember

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.340 
that now the important thing to remember
with<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.850> thing<00:01:42.119> with<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.630> technique<00:01:43.080> is

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
with this thing with this technique is

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.430 
with this thing with this technique is
not<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.310> keep<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.610> ball<00:01:44.759> too<00:01:45.030> high<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:46.229> higher

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
not to keep the ball too high the higher

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.060 
not to keep the ball too high the higher
you<00:01:46.619> keep<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> ball<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:49.530> harder<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
you keep the ball the harder it is to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.499 
you keep the ball the harder it is to
control<00:01:50.250> okay<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.149> want<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.360> keep<00:01:51.420> the

control okay so you want to keep the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.149 
control okay so you want to keep the
ball<00:01:51.600> quite<00:01:51.810> low<00:01:51.960> okay<00:01:52.319> Dylan<00:01:52.619> out<00:01:52.740> come<00:01:53.009> back

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
