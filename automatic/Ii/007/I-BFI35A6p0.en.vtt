00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819

actually<00:02:41.180> very<00:02:41.209> good<00:02:41.510> against<00:02:41.840> espera

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
actually very good against espera

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.890 
actually very good against espera
because<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.500> can't<00:02:42.680> hit<00:02:42.830> detention<00:02:43.310> sphere

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
because it can't hit detention sphere

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.690 
because it can't hit detention sphere
whereas<00:02:44.900> banishing<00:02:45.680> like<00:02:45.830> Ken<00:02:46.100> hero's

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
whereas banishing like Ken hero's

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.490

ahead<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.209> little<00:02:50.300> bit<00:02:50.510> so<00:02:51.230> banishing<00:02:51.800> light<00:02:51.980> is

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
ahead a little bit so banishing light is

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.250 
ahead a little bit so banishing light is
really<00:02:52.790> important<00:02:53.180> there<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.660> it's<00:02:54.080> also

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
really important there and it's also

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.750 
really important there and it's also
very<00:02:54.500> good<00:02:54.680> against<00:02:54.980> blue<00:02:55.190> because<00:02:55.489> it<00:02:55.640> can

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
very good against blue because it can

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.790 
very good against blue because it can
actually<00:02:55.940> hit<00:02:56.239> fast<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.650> was<00:02:57.770> my

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
actually hit fast so that was my

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
two whips in the main deck because I

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.250 
two whips in the main deck because I
think<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:14.060> is<00:03:14.239> just<00:03:14.780> extremely

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
think that it is just extremely

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.410 
think that it is just extremely
underrated<00:03:15.739> right<00:03:16.070> now<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.730> swings<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.300> it

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
underrated right now the swings that it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.420 
underrated right now the swings that it
that<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.690> presents<00:03:17.900> in<00:03:18.769> games<00:03:19.070> when<00:03:19.340> your

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
that it presents in games when your

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.190 
that it presents in games when your
opponent<00:03:19.760> doesn't<00:03:19.880> think<00:03:20.150> about<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.540> are<00:03:20.870> just

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
opponent doesn't think about it are just

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.729 
opponent doesn't think about it are just
phenomenal<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.959> got<00:03:24.110> convinced<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.590> play

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739

the second whip by my friend Dylan and

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.860 
the second whip by my friend Dylan and
he<00:03:30.560> was<00:03:30.709> probably<00:03:31.100> right<00:03:31.480> because<00:03:32.480> life<00:03:32.630> and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
he was probably right because life and

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.259 
he was probably right because life and
zombie<00:03:33.200> is<00:03:33.290> also<00:03:33.560> very<00:03:33.709> good<00:03:33.980> but<00:03:34.519> I<00:03:34.790> like

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
zombie is also very good but I like

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.850 
zombie is also very good but I like
