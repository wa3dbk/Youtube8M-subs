00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.820
 my website and has a nokia program one 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.289
 nokia reminded those with this program if 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.129
 you do not like the preview version of 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.229

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.140
 you can run this program was 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.910
 on your computer it is very easy to have a 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.550
 video on the channel teaching how to do the 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.310

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.020
 run it go to the update and 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.479
 never download windows phone update 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.759
 I count because you have not been released. 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.380

 the black nail is just to get up in 2008 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.090
 It's the black version, right? 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.429

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.259
 want to do this procedure back 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.149
 doubt that people have this is the 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.550
 preview version when you reach 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.340

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.890
 Good, guys, I already talked a little bit about the 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.880
 windows phone 18.11 video review is about 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.800
 this update 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.310
 I'm just going to add this video more 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.800
 Some things I did not say in the video 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.450
 for example, the staff has 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.040
 battery you are consuming 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.720
 really fast right? 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.700
 in my case it's working fine 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.830
 the battery only consume very fast 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.870
 when iphone is on 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.590
 arriving several notifications in time and 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.120
 time this for sure no notebook 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.660
 I can not even handle the father. 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.060
 notifications is running 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.220
 background apps for sure 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.100
 battery will consume faster but will not 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.140
 my case here with deactivates wifi is 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.930
 good stay a lot of time is about 2 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.450
 hours at 100% battery after I 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.610
 I just reloaded something nice. 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.919
 very handsome 81 people who now 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.500
 browser supports internet explorer 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.740
 for example you play a 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.260
 video is in the browser and runs the video 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.860
 on the same screen it does not open the full screen 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.860
 If you want 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.199
 only two touches 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.690
 So it was very nice in the 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.070
 notifications with you pull is the central 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.770
 of notifications it shows that the 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:18.340
 battery percentage to date 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:20.920
 information about your phone 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.030
 8.1 As I have already shown, there is dialing 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.350
 fast right 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.510
 a tip for who will do the 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.270
 update before upgrading let 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.200
 battery fully recharged 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.460
 100% 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.980
 before proceeding with the procedure 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.430
 because many people have 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.690
 claimed that it stays in the gears 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.660
 so if your device is in the 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.720
 gears in process and update 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.340
 you press the volume here - with the 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.770
 power button for 10 seconds 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.060
 the device is bound to give him rebound 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.250
 will restart 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.470
 So you waited ten minutes ago. 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.740
 20 minutes to see if it leaves the 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.790
 gears if it does not help, you 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.970
 to do that was how I got it 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.870
 do with my nokia lumia 920 when 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.120
 he stayed 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.390
 It is in this gear that you leave for the first time. 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:11.740
 I once managed to solve that center 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:14.320
 way the apparatus is then these were the 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.970
 tips is if you have questions you may 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.620
 leave comments here that I reply to 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.480
 to help the guys who want to do this 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.380
 update you have not yet done is not 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.000
 fear 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.770
 so that's what guys like the video 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.770
 online and favorite and until the next
