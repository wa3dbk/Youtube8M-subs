one<00:01:18.160> of<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.310> most<00:01:18.520> important<00:01:19.030> things<00:01:19.240> with

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
one of the most important things with

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.840 
one of the most important things with
the<00:01:19.750> planter<00:01:20.080> box<00:01:20.290> is<00:01:20.500> drainage<00:01:21.130> so<00:01:21.550> when<00:01:21.730> we

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
the planter box is drainage so when we

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.030 
the planter box is drainage so when we
built<00:01:22.090> it<00:01:22.240> we<00:01:22.390> left<00:01:22.660> some<00:01:22.900> slats<00:01:23.260> and<00:01:23.710> then

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
built it we left some slats and then

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.980 
built it we left some slats and then
we're<00:01:24.160> putting<00:01:24.310> landscape<00:01:24.940> fabric<00:01:25.180> over<00:01:25.660> the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
we're putting landscape fabric over the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.110 
we're putting landscape fabric over the
holes<00:01:26.290> that's<00:01:27.040> going<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.340> allow<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:27.670> moisture

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
holes that's going to allow the moisture

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.600 
holes that's going to allow the moisture
and<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.780> water<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.290> leak<00:01:29.470> out<00:01:29.650> but<00:01:30.130> not<00:01:30.370> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
and the water to leak out but not the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.400 
and the water to leak out but not the
soil<00:01:30.880> obviously<00:01:31.630> we<00:01:31.750> don't<00:01:31.840> want<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.110> lose<00:01:32.229> the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
soil obviously we don't want to lose the

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.950 
soil obviously we don't want to lose the
soil<00:01:32.800> we're<00:01:33.490> using<00:01:33.700> a<00:01:33.910> boxwood<00:01:34.270> called<00:01:34.570> Graham

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
soil we're using a boxwood called Graham

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.340 
soil we're using a boxwood called Graham
Blandy<00:01:35.800> boxwood<00:01:36.369> it's<00:01:36.760> a<00:01:36.880> nice<00:01:37.090> tall<00:01:37.600> narrow

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
Blandy boxwood it's a nice tall narrow

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.200 
Blandy boxwood it's a nice tall narrow
growing<00:01:38.890> box<00:01:39.100> but<00:01:39.340> so<00:01:39.430> unlike<00:01:39.760> other<00:01:39.970> blocks

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
growing box but so unlike other blocks

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.600 
growing box but so unlike other blocks
which<00:01:40.450> we<00:01:40.570> tend<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:40.869> grow<00:01:41.080> wide<00:01:41.350> this<00:01:42.190> is<00:01:42.250> going

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
which we tend to grow wide this is going

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.730 
which we tend to grow wide this is going
to<00:01:42.700> grow<00:01:42.760> nice<00:01:43.030> and<00:01:43.060> tall<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.840> little<00:01:44.320> bit<00:01:44.470> wider

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
to grow nice and tall a little bit wider

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.920 
to grow nice and tall a little bit wider
it<00:01:45.070> will<00:01:45.250> create<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.610> wall<00:01:45.940> but<00:01:46.390> it's<00:01:46.540> not<00:01:46.690> going

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
it will create a wall but it's not going

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.999 
it will create a wall but it's not going
to<00:01:47.020> get<00:01:47.080> too<00:01:47.350> wide<00:01:47.560> for<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.860> space<00:01:49.830> one<00:01:50.830> of<00:01:50.860> the

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
to get too wide for the space one of the

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.320 
to get too wide for the space one of the
things<00:01:51.160> you'll<00:01:51.310> notice<00:01:51.430> is<00:01:51.670> I've<00:01:51.880> put<00:01:52.060> little

box woods evenly spaced that's important
just<00:01:57.310> for<00:01:57.399> an<00:01:57.550> aesthetic<00:01:57.970> point<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:59.080> as<00:01:59.320> I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
just for an aesthetic point so as I

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.380 
just for an aesthetic point so as I
place<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.130> Box<00:02:00.369> woods<00:02:00.640> I'll<00:02:00.850> be<00:02:00.970> sure<00:02:01.210> that

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
place the Box woods I'll be sure that

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.180 
place the Box woods I'll be sure that
they're<00:02:01.509> evenly<00:02:01.840> spaced<00:02:02.200> I'm<00:02:02.770> going<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:02.979> start

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
they're evenly spaced I'm going to start

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.010 
they're evenly spaced I'm going to start
adding<00:02:03.399> soil<00:02:03.880> we're<00:02:04.270> going<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.479> add<00:02:04.600> soil

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
adding soil we're going to add soil

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.080 
adding soil we're going to add soil
about<00:02:05.259> halfway<00:02:05.800> up<00:02:05.979> giving<00:02:06.250> us<00:02:06.430> enough<00:02:06.729> base

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
about halfway up giving us enough base

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.020 
about halfway up giving us enough base
but<00:02:07.750> not<00:02:07.869> too<00:02:08.259> high<00:02:08.530> so<00:02:09.130> that<00:02:09.280> when<00:02:09.399> we<00:02:09.489> put<00:02:09.820> in

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
but not too high so that when we put in

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.580 
but not too high so that when we put in
the<00:02:10.060> box<00:02:10.390> woods<00:02:10.720> they're<00:02:11.200> at<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.470> right

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
the box woods they're at the right

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.330 
the box woods they're at the right
height<00:02:16.380> all<00:02:17.380> right<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:17.650> we've<00:02:17.770> got<00:02:17.950> one<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.250> our

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
height all right so we've got one of our

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.070 
height all right so we've got one of our
grand<00:02:18.610> Blandy<00:02:18.910> box<00:02:19.150> woods<00:02:19.420> up<00:02:19.570> on<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> deck

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
grand Blandy box woods up on the deck

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.860 
grand Blandy box woods up on the deck
and<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.980> root<00:02:21.190> ball<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.459> way<00:02:21.880> too<00:02:21.940> big<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.720> go

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
and the root ball is way too big to go

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.479 
and the root ball is way too big to go
in<00:02:23.019> there<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:23.470> what<00:02:23.620> I'm<00:02:23.769> doing<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.340> I'm<00:02:24.459> going

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
in there so what I'm doing is I'm going

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.420 
in there so what I'm doing is I'm going
to<00:02:24.670> wet<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.690> get<00:02:26.049> this<00:02:26.290> extra<00:02:26.680> soil<00:02:27.100> off

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
to wet it and get this extra soil off

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.750 
to wet it and get this extra soil off
and<00:02:27.820> then<00:02:28.180> put<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.660> into<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.230> box<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:30.280> key<00:02:30.549> is

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
and then put it into the box the key is

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.240 
and then put it into the box the key is
to<00:02:31.000> remove<00:02:31.360> as<00:02:31.570> few<00:02:31.930> roots<00:02:32.200> as<00:02:32.410> possible<00:02:33.040> a

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
to remove as few roots as possible a

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.640 
to remove as few roots as possible a
couple<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:33.970> choices<00:02:34.209> here<00:02:34.390> we<00:02:34.690> could<00:02:34.900> cut<00:02:35.350> this

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
couple of choices here we could cut this

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.770 
couple of choices here we could cut this
but<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.610> don't<00:02:36.670> like<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.030> way<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.480> soil

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
but I don't like the way that the soil

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.090 
but I don't like the way that the soil
is<00:02:37.900> kind<00:02:38.080> of<00:02:38.140> falling<00:02:38.350> apart<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:38.890> I'm<00:02:38.950> gonna

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
is kind of falling apart so I'm gonna

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.820 
is kind of falling apart so I'm gonna
wet<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.480> let<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.630> soil<00:02:40.810> naturally<00:02:41.500> come<00:02:41.680> off

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
wet it let the soil naturally come off

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.830 
wet it let the soil naturally come off
from<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.130> water<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.760> then<00:02:43.330> get<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.780> that

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
from the water and then get it in that

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.420 
from the water and then get it in that
will<00:02:44.049> preserve<00:02:44.350> most<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.860> root<00:02:45.010> structure

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
will preserve most of the root structure

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.580 
will preserve most of the root structure
all<00:02:46.330> right<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:46.630> we're<00:02:46.780> removing<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.290> dirt

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
all right so we're removing the dirt

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.140 
all right so we're removing the dirt
from<00:02:47.830> around<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.310> root<00:02:48.459> ball<00:02:48.489> notice<00:02:49.000> the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
from around the root ball notice the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.479 
from around the root ball notice the
beautiful<00:02:49.690> white<00:02:49.900> roots<00:02:50.110> exposed<00:02:50.440> we<00:02:51.250> want<00:02:51.430> to

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
beautiful white roots exposed we want to

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.250 
beautiful white roots exposed we want to
get<00:02:51.610> those<00:02:51.790> into<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.420> planter<00:02:52.840> box<00:02:53.049> as

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
get those into the planter box as

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.870 
get those into the planter box as
quickly<00:02:53.470> as<00:02:53.650> possible<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:54.549> we<00:02:54.670> haven't

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
quickly as possible but we haven't

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.570 
quickly as possible but we haven't
really<00:02:55.209> destroyed<00:02:55.750> any<00:02:56.049> roots<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:56.680> if<00:02:57.100> we<00:02:57.400> let

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
really destroyed any roots so if we let

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.569 
really destroyed any roots so if we let
the<00:02:57.700> water<00:02:57.940> kind<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.480> run<00:02:58.780> here<00:02:59.230> it's<00:02:59.769> removing

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
the water kind of run here it's removing

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.090 
the water kind of run here it's removing
some<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.940> soil<00:03:01.150> making<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.290> smaller<00:03:02.650> and

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
some of the soil making this smaller and

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.280 
some of the soil making this smaller and
enabling<00:03:03.640> us<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.910> get<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.150> into<00:03:04.299> this<00:03:04.480> pot
