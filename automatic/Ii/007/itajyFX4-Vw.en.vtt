00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.290 
surgeries and various things and I just
thought<00:04:26.970> that<00:04:27.570> a<00:04:27.720> fundraiser<00:04:28.229> for<00:04:28.410> Nancy

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
thought that a fundraiser for Nancy

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.320 
thought that a fundraiser for Nancy
would<00:04:30.300> be<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.570> good<00:04:30.990> way<00:04:31.169> to<00:04:31.200> offset<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:33.180> the

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
would be a good way to offset and the

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.360 
would be a good way to offset and the
expenses<00:04:33.930> that<00:04:34.020> they<00:04:34.229> might<00:04:34.470> occur

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.030 

nobody<00:04:39.370> knows<00:04:39.610> what's<00:04:39.880> in<00:04:40.060> store<00:04:40.270> for<00:04:40.330> Nancy

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
nobody knows what's in store for Nancy

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.720 
nobody knows what's in store for Nancy
in<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.250> future<00:04:42.610> if<00:04:43.000> maybe<00:04:44.610> provisions<00:04:45.610> are

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
in the future if maybe provisions are

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.310 
in the future if maybe provisions are
going<00:04:45.850> to<00:04:45.910> be<00:04:46.060> needed<00:04:47.020> at<00:04:47.170> their<00:04:47.380> home<00:04:49.320> we
