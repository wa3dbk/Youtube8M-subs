state where that's not allowed so you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.069 
state where that's not allowed so you
know<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> don't<00:01:44.430> do<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.759> either<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.840> do

you know want to use the back of that
it's<00:01:48.570> definitely<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.990> problem<00:01:49.229> okay

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.190 

what<00:01:53.939> else<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> problem<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:57.200> don't

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
what else I think is a problem I don't

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.840 
what else I think is a problem I don't
know<00:01:58.469> if<00:01:58.560> all<00:01:58.710> sling<00:01:58.979> bags<00:01:59.189> are<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.640> but

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
know if all sling bags are like this but

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.109 
know if all sling bags are like this but
this<00:02:00.000> one<00:02:00.060> hangs<00:02:01.130> out<00:02:02.130> away<00:02:02.610> from<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.939> right

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
this one hangs out away from the right

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.770 
this one hangs out away from the right
side<00:02:03.450> they're<00:02:05.060> just<00:02:06.060> aesthetically<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.600> think

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
side they're just aesthetically I think

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.469 
side they're just aesthetically I think
it<00:02:06.869> looks<00:02:07.020> kind<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.320> funny<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:08.580> not<00:02:09.090> that's<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
it looks kind of funny but not that's a

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.280 
it looks kind of funny but not that's a
huge<00:02:09.720> deal

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.630 

back<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> front<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:14.010> when<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.220> open<00:02:14.250> this

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
back to the front so when you open this

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
back to the front so when you open this
up<00:02:15.470> we're<00:02:16.470> all<00:02:16.650> familiar<00:02:16.950> with<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.820> way<00:02:18.510> now

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
up we're all familiar with the way now

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.390 
up we're all familiar with the way now
anyway<00:02:19.010> but<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.130> fact<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.460> this<00:02:20.700> has<00:02:22.400> these

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
anyway but the fact that this has these

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.660 
anyway but the fact that this has these
adjustable<00:02:23.880> dividers<00:02:24.540> okay<00:02:25.470> now<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.400> just

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
adjustable dividers okay now the just

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.240 
adjustable dividers okay now the just
little<00:02:26.970> dividers<00:02:27.390> stop<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> good<00:02:28.110> three<00:02:28.890> inches

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
little dividers stop a good three inches

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.520 
little dividers stop a good three inches
down<00:02:29.490> from<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.850> top<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.360> bag<00:02:30.570> which<00:02:31.260> means

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
down from the top of the bag which means

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.480 
down from the top of the bag which means
from<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> bag<00:02:32.190> goes<00:02:33.110> vertical<00:02:34.490> anything

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
from the bag goes vertical anything

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.190 
from the bag goes vertical anything
that's<00:02:35.640> up<00:02:35.790> here<00:02:36.060> that's<00:02:36.270> little<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:37.080> gonna

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
that's up here that's little it's gonna

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.010 
that's up here that's little it's gonna
fall<00:02:37.590> out<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.130> drop<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.550> bottom<00:02:39.020> so

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
fall out and drop to the bottom so

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.710 
fall out and drop to the bottom so
that's<00:02:40.560> less<00:02:40.920> than<00:02:40.950> ideal<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.790> think<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.330> that

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
that's less than ideal I think that that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.840 
that's less than ideal I think that that
feature<00:02:42.960> is<00:02:43.200> nice<00:02:43.430> that's<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.550> little<00:02:44.700> bit

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
feature is nice that's a little bit

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.710 
feature is nice that's a little bit
oversold<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.900> other<00:02:49.050> thing<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:50.390> these<00:02:51.390> all

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
oversold the other thing is these all

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.350 
oversold the other thing is these all
have<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:53.700> round<00:02:54.110> paracord<00:02:55.110> loop<00:02:56.090> just<00:02:57.090> after

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
have the round paracord loop just after

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.330 
have the round paracord loop just after
a<00:02:57.390> little<00:02:57.570> bit<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.780> use<00:02:58.050> all<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.770> my<00:02:58.860> knots<00:02:59.130> have

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
a little bit of use all of my knots have

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.860 
a little bit of use all of my knots have
come<00:02:59.640> on<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.790> not<00:03:00.030> all<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.240> it<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> lot<00:03:00.630> of<00:03:00.690> them

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
come on that not all of it a lot of them

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.310 
come on that not all of it a lot of them
so<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:00.990> just<00:03:01.170> tied<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.560> regular<00:03:01.740> overhand<00:03:02.340> nut

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
so I just tied it a regular overhand nut

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.020 
so I just tied it a regular overhand nut
so<00:03:04.320> they<00:03:04.950> kind<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.250> tapped<00:03:05.490> this<00:03:05.670> all<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.880> time

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
so they kind of tapped this all the time

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.260 
so they kind of tapped this all the time
I<00:03:06.060> mean<00:03:06.450> it's<00:03:06.570> not<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.720> big<00:03:06.930> deal<00:03:07.970> not<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.150> end

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
I mean it's not a big deal not the end

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.860 
I mean it's not a big deal not the end
of<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.420> world

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
of the world

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.640 
of the world
but<00:03:10.280> it's<00:03:11.280> not<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.490> great<00:03:12.410> what<00:03:13.410> else<00:03:15.620> now<00:03:16.620> a

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
but it's not that great what else now a

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.070
