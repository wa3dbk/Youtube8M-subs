eastern hognose burrowing at the hog
spot<00:00:12.230> hogg<00:00:13.230> prairie<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:15.859> when<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.890> first<00:00:17.190> came

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
spot hogg prairie and when I first came

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.370 
spot hogg prairie and when I first came
upon<00:00:17.880> her<00:00:18.300> she<00:00:20.600> seemed<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.689> indicate<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.140> she

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
upon her she seemed to indicate that she

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.150 
upon her she seemed to indicate that she
could<00:00:22.650> tell<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:24.170> so<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.199> walked<00:00:26.010> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
could tell I was here so I walked a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.960 
could tell I was here so I walked a
little<00:00:26.279> ways<00:00:26.550> away<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:28.550> wasn't<00:00:29.550> gone<00:00:29.699> for

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
little ways away and wasn't gone for

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.299 
little ways away and wasn't gone for
long<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.510> came<00:00:30.599> back<00:00:30.960> down<00:00:31.320> there<00:00:32.070> she<00:00:32.279> is

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
long but I came back down there she is

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.130 
long but I came back down there she is
digging<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:37.760> very<00:00:38.760> interesting<00:00:38.820> process<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
digging so very interesting process to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.030 
digging so very interesting process to
watch<00:00:41.840> very<00:00:42.840> exciting<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.590> see

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.330 

and<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:50.780> think<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:52.170> I'll<00:00:52.260> probably<00:00:52.290> do<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and I think what I'll probably do is

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.720 
and I think what I'll probably do is
film<00:00:54.060> her<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.540> a<00:00:54.570> little<00:00:54.660> while<00:00:55.550> but<00:00:56.550> also

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
film her for a little while but also

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.640 
film her for a little while but also
move<00:00:57.180> around<00:00:57.450> the<00:00:57.600> area<00:00:57.900> see<00:00:58.110> if<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.290> can<00:00:58.470> see

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
move around the area see if I can see

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.790 
move around the area see if I can see
any<00:00:58.830> other<00:00:59.040> hogs<00:01:00.260> burrowing<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.440> out<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
any other hogs burrowing or out and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.870 
any other hogs burrowing or out and
about<00:01:01.860> I<00:01:04.339> don't<00:01:05.339> believe<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.940> is<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:07.880> more

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
about I don't believe this is the more

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.650 
about I don't believe this is the more
colorful<00:01:09.120> animal<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.110> saw<00:01:10.320> yesterday

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
colorful animal that I saw yesterday

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:19.820 
colorful animal that I saw yesterday
that<00:01:12.660> i<00:01:12.690> took<00:01:12.810> some<00:01:13.110> footage<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:14.660> and<00:01:18.830> see

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that i took some footage of and see

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:32.500 
that i took some footage of and see
you're<00:01:19.979> at<00:01:20.130> work<00:01:20.310> here

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:40.110 

very<00:01:33.260> cool<00:01:33.620> site

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.280 

this<00:01:40.690> is<00:01:40.870> later<00:01:41.170> than<00:01:41.290> I<00:01:41.560> expected<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:44.140> the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
this is later than I expected to see the

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.550 
this is later than I expected to see the
brewing<00:01:44.620> activity<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.960> thought<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.410> last

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
brewing activity we thought that last

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.250 
brewing activity we thought that last
year<00:01:48.010> because<00:01:48.310> we<00:01:48.610> had<00:01:49.050> flooding<00:01:50.050> in<00:01:50.170> the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
year because we had flooding in the

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.980 
year because we had flooding in the
spring<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:50.950> it<00:01:51.520> was<00:01:51.700> an<00:01:52.060> unusual<00:01:52.240> spring<00:01:52.900> in

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
spring and it was an unusual spring in

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.280 
spring and it was an unusual spring in
some<00:01:53.200> ways<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:55.920> maybe<00:01:57.060> everything<00:01:58.060> was<00:01:58.290> late

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
some ways that maybe everything was late

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.770 
some ways that maybe everything was late
last<00:01:59.530> year<00:01:59.650> including<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.340> hognose<00:02:00.780> laying

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
last year including the hognose laying

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.720 
last year including the hognose laying
and<00:02:02.080> burrowing<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.650> stuff<00:02:02.830> like<00:02:02.980> that<00:02:03.040> it<00:02:03.520> has

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
and burrowing and stuff like that it has

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.480 
and burrowing and stuff like that it has
been<00:02:03.760> cool<00:02:04.240> this<00:02:04.480> spring<00:02:04.810> so<00:02:05.220> maybe<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.370> had

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
been cool this spring so maybe it had

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.990 
been cool this spring so maybe it had
the<00:02:06.610> same<00:02:06.850> effect<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.330> spring<00:02:07.660> or<00:02:07.870> maybe<00:02:08.110> they

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the same effect the spring or maybe they

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.760 
the same effect the spring or maybe they
maybe<00:02:10.000> they<00:02:10.240> don't<00:02:10.390> do<00:02:10.660> this<00:02:10.869> burrowing<00:02:11.440> and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
maybe they don't do this burrowing and

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.360 
maybe they don't do this burrowing and
nesting<00:02:12.160> until<00:02:12.550> late<00:02:12.880> June<00:02:13.660> early<00:02:13.990> July<00:02:14.410> hard

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
nesting until late June early July hard

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:27.110 
nesting until late June early July hard
to<00:02:15.520> say

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.940 

and<00:02:28.120> move<00:02:28.359> in<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.629> little<00:02:28.659> closer<00:02:29.109> here<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:29.769> see

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
and move in a little closer here and see

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.569 
and move in a little closer here and see
if<00:02:30.069> I<00:02:30.219> can<00:02:30.430> get<00:02:32.159> more<00:02:33.159> of<00:02:33.280> a<00:02:33.370> close-up<00:02:33.969> of<00:02:34.120> the

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
if I can get more of a close-up of the

00:02:35.579 --> 00:03:15.790 
if I can get more of a close-up of the
rowing<00:02:36.579> action

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.160 

it's<00:03:16.310> been<00:03:16.520> extremely<00:03:16.850> hot<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.660> last<00:03:17.900> few

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
it's been extremely hot the last few

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:52.570 
it's been extremely hot the last few
days

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.990 

looks<00:03:53.150> like<00:03:53.360> she<00:03:53.570> isnt<00:03:53.780> honoring<00:03:54.020> some<00:03:55.000> roots

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
looks like she isnt honoring some roots

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.130 
looks like she isnt honoring some roots
down<00:03:56.210> there

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.920 

think<00:04:01.560> everyone<00:04:02.130> just<00:04:02.160> pop

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:05:43.879 

she<00:04:05.469> seems<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.890> be<00:04:06.010> working<00:04:06.189> quite<00:04:06.519> hard

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.760 

yep<00:05:44.490> still<00:05:44.849> pulling<00:05:45.210> it<00:05:45.360> some<00:05:45.659> roots<00:05:46.319> in<00:05:46.590> there

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
yep still pulling it some roots in there

00:05:46.770 --> 00:06:19.970 
yep still pulling it some roots in there
sounds<00:05:47.249> like

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.450 

i<00:06:20.070> think<00:06:20.940> i<00:06:21.060> will<00:06:21.120> just<00:06:21.810> walk<00:06:22.740> it<00:06:22.920> around<00:06:23.010> and

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
i think i will just walk it around and

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.000 
i think i will just walk it around and
come<00:06:23.970> back
