00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
a tricky one and interesting as well in

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.760 
a tricky one and interesting as well in
some<00:02:10.840> stages<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.989> start<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.410> pretty

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
some stages the to start is a pretty

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.890 
some stages the to start is a pretty
much<00:02:14.980> standard<00:02:15.640> with<00:02:15.910> us<00:02:16.090> with<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> South<00:02:16.690> early

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
much standard with us with a South early

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.770 
much standard with us with a South early
coming<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.700> beating<00:02:19.030> for<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.239> while<00:02:19.390> along<00:02:19.630> the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
coming so beating for a while along the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.199 
coming so beating for a while along the
post<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.290> then<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:21.280> will<00:02:21.459> start<00:02:22.030> be

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
post and then it will start be

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.089 
post and then it will start be
interesting<00:02:22.690> when<00:02:22.810> we<00:02:22.959> go<00:02:23.620> through<00:02:23.650> Allied

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
interesting when we go through Allied

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.220 
interesting when we go through Allied
air<00:02:24.280> transition<00:02:24.910> before<00:02:25.750> getting<00:02:26.200> the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
air transition before getting the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.190 
air transition before getting the
westerlies<00:02:26.709> independent<00:02:27.280> as<00:02:27.400> menses<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:29.050> that

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
westerlies independent as menses so that

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.960 
westerlies independent as menses so that
would<00:02:29.380> be<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.500> first<00:02:29.830> tricky<00:02:30.519> part<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:30.910> then

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
would be the first tricky part and then

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.940 
would be the first tricky part and then
it's<00:02:31.360> also<00:02:31.569> looks<00:02:31.900> like<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.110> west<00:02:32.530> coast<00:02:32.739> of

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
it's also looks like the west coast of

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.280 
it's also looks like the west coast of
Tasmania<00:02:33.700> can<00:02:34.360> be<00:02:34.510> tricky<00:02:34.810> with<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.200> many

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
Tasmania can be tricky with so many

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.650 
Tasmania can be tricky with so many
troughs<00:02:35.670> forming<00:02:36.670> by<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.910> time<00:02:37.120> we<00:02:37.269> going<00:02:37.600> to

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
troughs forming by the time we going to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.390 
troughs forming by the time we going to
get<00:02:37.750> there<00:02:37.959> well<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:38.799> looks<00:02:38.830> like<00:02:39.010> it's<00:02:39.250> going

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
get there well it looks like it's going

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.039 
get there well it looks like it's going
to<00:02:39.519> be<00:02:39.580> fairly<00:02:40.060> busy<00:02:40.299> at<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.660> front<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
to be fairly busy at the front of the

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.750 
to be fairly busy at the front of the
rice<00:02:41.200> with<00:02:41.980> 5<00:02:42.250> 100<00:02:42.819> foot<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.650> how<00:02:44.650> did<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:45.519> guys

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
rice with 5 100 foot so how did you guys

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.120 
rice with 5 100 foot so how did you guys
feel<00:02:46.330> about<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.750> well<00:02:47.650> it's<00:02:47.830> going<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.040> be

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
feel about that well it's going to be

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.430 
feel about that well it's going to be
interesting<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.690> tricky<00:02:50.049> thing<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.319> that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
interesting and the tricky thing is that

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.539 
interesting and the tricky thing is that
the<00:02:50.560> boat<00:02:50.739> are<00:02:50.950> quite<00:02:51.989> go<00:02:52.989> well<00:02:53.200> might<00:02:53.650> go<00:02:53.830> well

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
the boat are quite go well might go well

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.970 
the boat are quite go well might go well
on<00:02:54.610> different<00:02:55.090> range<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.930> conditions<00:02:56.110> so

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
on different range of conditions so

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.530 
on different range of conditions so
there's<00:02:57.220> white<00:02:57.430> board<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:57.880> are<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.000> narrow<00:02:58.239> boat

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
there's white board we are a narrow boat

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.940 
there's white board we are a narrow boat
so<00:02:58.750> we<00:02:58.870> should<00:02:59.019> be<00:02:59.170> okay<00:02:59.380> on<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.590> light<00:02:59.739> there

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
so we should be okay on the light there

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.400 
so we should be okay on the light there
the<00:03:00.580> other<00:03:00.640> boys<00:03:00.880> might<00:03:01.120> be<00:03:01.239> okay<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:01.750> reaching

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
the other boys might be okay in reaching

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.670 
the other boys might be okay in reaching
heavy<00:03:02.980> air<00:03:03.190> type<00:03:03.609> of<00:03:03.760> things<00:03:03.970> so<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.600> guess<00:03:05.500> it's

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
heavy air type of things so I guess it's

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.319 
heavy air type of things so I guess it's
going<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:05.890> be<00:03:05.950> interesting<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.549> see<00:03:06.730> anything

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
going to be interesting to see anything

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.690 
going to be interesting to see anything
it's<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.660> probably<00:03:08.410> what<00:03:09.190> we're<00:03:09.340> looking<00:03:09.609> out

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
it's a probably what we're looking out

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.770 
it's a probably what we're looking out
at<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:09.880> moment<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.180> everyone's<00:03:10.510> going<00:03:10.750> to

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
at the moment is everyone's going to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.130 
at the moment is everyone's going to
have<00:03:10.900> their<00:03:11.109> turn<00:03:11.500> at<00:03:12.280> some<00:03:12.549> stage<00:03:12.850> so<00:03:13.140> so

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
have their turn at some stage so so

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.199 
have their turn at some stage so so
we're<00:03:14.350> looking<00:03:14.440> forward<00:03:14.829> to<00:03:14.950> when<00:03:15.880> we<00:03:16.000> get<00:03:16.120> our

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
we're looking forward to when we get our

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.690 
we're looking forward to when we get our
conditions<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.810> do<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:16.989> use<00:03:17.650> our<00:03:18.010> speed<00:03:18.280> as<00:03:18.459> as

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
conditions to do it use our speed as as

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.150 
conditions to do it use our speed as as
best<00:03:18.910> as<00:03:19.060> we<00:03:19.090> can<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:20.200> have<00:03:20.319> you<00:03:20.440> done<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.769> hub

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
best as we can and have you done the hub

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.039 
best as we can and have you done the hub
a<00:03:21.280> price<00:03:21.489> per<00:03:21.670> poop<00:03:21.850> I've<00:03:22.329> done<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.720> five<00:03:22.989> times

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
a price per poop I've done it five times

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.199 
a price per poop I've done it five times
yeah<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.680> will<00:03:23.829> be<00:03:23.859> my<00:03:24.069> sixth<00:03:24.370> fix<00:03:24.970> it's

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
yeah that will be my sixth fix it's

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.840 
yeah that will be my sixth fix it's
something<00:03:25.540> like<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.750> hundred<00:03:25.870> footer<00:03:26.850> 100-foot

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
something like a hundred footer 100-foot
