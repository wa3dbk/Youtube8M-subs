you're<00:01:54.119> doing<00:01:54.539> with<00:01:54.749> the<00:01:54.929> math<00:01:55.140> before<00:01:55.469> you

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
you're doing with the math before you

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.800 
you're doing with the math before you
start<00:01:56.100> making<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.429> recipe<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:57.210> way<00:01:57.420> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
start making the recipe that way you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.300 
start making the recipe that way you
don't<00:01:57.929> make<00:01:58.109> any<00:01:58.319> mistakes<00:01:58.770> along<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.159> way

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
don't make any mistakes along the way

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.550 
don't make any mistakes along the way
it's<00:02:00.179> kind<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> hard<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.659> do<00:02:00.869> math<00:02:01.049> sometimes

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
it's kind of hard to do math sometimes

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.529 
it's kind of hard to do math sometimes
on<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.859> fly<00:02:02.069> like<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.549> had<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.819> think<00:02:02.939> about<00:02:03.060> 1/8

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539

on the fly like I had to think about 1/8
plus<00:02:03.840> 1/8<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.499> took<00:02:04.710> me<00:02:04.859> a<00:02:04.890> little<00:02:05.039> bit<00:02:05.249> of

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
plus 1/8 that took me a little bit of

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.570 
plus 1/8 that took me a little bit of

equals<00:02:08.940> 3<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.960> might<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.410> oh<00:02:10.560> that's<00:02:10.800> 2<00:02:11.220> but

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
equals 3 you might think oh that's 2 but

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.010 
equals 3 you might think oh that's 2 but
if<00:02:11.760> when<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.180> write<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.480> out<00:02:12.570> you<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:12.990> see

if when you write it out you can see

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.600 
if when you write it out you can see
that<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.530> actually<00:02:13.710> 3<00:02:14.450> so

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
that it's actually 3 so
