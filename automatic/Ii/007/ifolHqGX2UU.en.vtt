00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
was sorting the Commons and I found some

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.959 
was sorting the Commons and I found some
weird-looking<00:00:42.559> fake<00:00:43.559> cards<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.789> are

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969

pretty cool so I thought I was gonna
make<00:00:49.860> some<00:00:49.890> tokens<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.850> know<00:00:50.969> using<00:00:51.600> my<00:00:51.750> last

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
make some tokens you know using my last

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.380

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
paper thin well it's because they are

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.719 
paper thin well it's because they are
papers<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.420> sticker<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.729> never

and I thought well plenty of people use
stand<00:02:43.590> again<00:02:43.829> so<00:02:44.130> just<00:02:44.880> wanted<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.209> use<00:02:45.510> this

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
stand again so just wanted to use this

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
stand again so just wanted to use this
an<00:02:45.870> example<00:02:46.170> as<00:02:46.440> an<00:02:46.650> example<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.910> here's<00:02:48.209> a

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
an example as an example so here's a

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.440 
an example as an example so here's a
picture<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.099> we<00:02:50.459> just<00:02:50.880> align<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:52.970> right<00:02:53.970> like

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
picture and we just align it right like

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.190 
picture and we just align it right like
this<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:56.040> not<00:02:56.280> perfect<00:02:56.760> but<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.269> can

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
this and it's not perfect but you can

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.720 
this and it's not perfect but you can
reapply<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.680> like<00:02:59.040> because<00:02:59.220> it's<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.459> sticker

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
reapply it like because it's a sticker

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.619 
reapply it like because it's a sticker
so<00:03:00.739> while<00:03:01.739> you're<00:03:02.040> saying<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.489> fine<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.269> so

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
so while you're saying it's fine and so

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.960 
so while you're saying it's fine and so
is<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.930> sticker<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.620> then<00:03:05.370> they<00:03:05.790> actually

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
is the sticker and then they actually

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.520 
is the sticker and then they actually
are<00:03:06.299> pretty<00:03:06.660> sticky<00:03:07.019> so<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.769> can<00:03:09.260> reapply<00:03:10.260> it

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
are pretty sticky so you can reapply it

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.379 
are pretty sticky so you can reapply it
as<00:03:11.040> many<00:03:11.459> times<00:03:11.579> as<00:03:11.940> you'd<00:03:12.180> like<00:03:12.209> I'd<00:03:12.629> say<00:03:13.220> and
