00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.819 
a good answer to this question so we're
going<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:16.670> again<00:02:17.030> assess<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.959> see<00:02:18.560> why

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
going to again assess that and see why

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.520 
going to again assess that and see why
it<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.130> good<00:02:19.310> answer<00:02:19.570> okay<00:02:20.570> i'm<00:02:20.780> also<00:02:21.380> going

it is a good answer okay i'm also going
to<00:02:21.590> see<00:02:21.739> if<00:02:21.829> there's<00:02:21.980> anything<00:02:22.220> wrong<00:02:22.370> with<00:02:22.549> it

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
to see if there's anything wrong with it

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.330 
to see if there's anything wrong with it
and<00:02:23.269> again<00:02:24.269> we<00:02:24.900> will<00:02:25.110> look<00:02:25.470> at<00:02:25.680> an<00:02:25.890> improved

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
and again we will look at an improved

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.750 
and again we will look at an improved
version<00:02:26.519> okay<00:02:27.480> what<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:28.200> student<00:02:29.129> could

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
version okay what this student could

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.820 
version okay what this student could
have<00:02:29.819> written<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.450> make<00:02:30.629> a<00:02:30.659> ver<00:02:31.049> SI<00:02:31.349> even

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
have written to make a ver SI even

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.830 
have written to make a ver SI even
better<00:02:32.099> than<00:02:32.760> good<00:02:33.409> okay<00:02:34.819> so<00:02:35.819> its<00:02:36.420> first<00:02:36.540> of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840

concerned with the paraphrase language

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.000 
concerned with the paraphrase language
especially<00:03:02.780> for<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.870> introduction<00:03:04.230> but<00:03:04.829> also

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
for the key the information in the graph

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.759 
for the key the information in the graph
okay<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.269> you're<00:03:09.390> not<00:03:09.420> copying<00:03:10.079> chunks

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
okay so that you're not copying chunks

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.550 
okay so that you're not copying chunks
of<00:03:11.239> language<00:03:12.239> from<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.870> question<00:03:13.349> or<00:03:13.530> the

of language from the question or the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.360 
of language from the question or the
graph<00:03:14.329> they<00:03:15.329> also<00:03:15.540> look<00:03:16.170> at<00:03:16.319> how<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.560> describe

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
graph they also look at how you describe

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.780 
graph they also look at how you describe
your<00:03:17.670> trends<00:03:18.329> and<00:03:18.510> proportions<00:03:19.230> okay<00:03:20.129> what

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
your trends and proportions okay what

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.839 
your trends and proportions okay what
language<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.299> use<00:03:21.709> how<00:03:22.709> accurate<00:03:23.430> your

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
language you use how accurate your

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.030 
language you use how accurate your
proportions<00:03:24.840> are<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:27.660> they'll<00:03:28.380> also<00:03:28.650> look<00:03:28.889> at

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
proportions are so they'll also look at

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.610 
proportions are so they'll also look at
comparison<00:03:30.000> they<00:03:30.150> want<00:03:30.359> to<00:03:30.510> see<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:31.139> that

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
you're comparing the trends of one thing

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.080 
you're comparing the trends of one thing
to<00:03:34.200> another<00:03:34.349> okay<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.220> differences<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
to another okay the differences and the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.699 
to another okay the differences and the
similarities<00:03:36.590> okay<00:03:39.290> they're<00:03:40.290> going<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.590> look

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
similarities okay they're going to look

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.830 
similarities okay they're going to look
at<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:40.889> structure<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.430> your<00:03:41.549> essay<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.510> ensure

they're also going to look at the

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.559 
they're also going to look at the
linking<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.859> ideas<00:03:59.310> okay<00:03:59.849> so<00:03:59.910> instead<00:04:00.450> of

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
linking of the ideas okay so instead of

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.110 
linking of the ideas okay so instead of
just<00:04:00.780> giving<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.230> list<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.739> sentences<00:04:02.370> they're

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
just giving a list of sentences they're

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.720 
just giving a list of sentences they're
going<00:04:03.419> to<00:04:03.630> decide<00:04:04.380> well<00:04:04.739> are<00:04:05.040> your<00:04:05.519> ideas

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
going to decide well are your ideas

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.509 
going to decide well are your ideas
linked<00:04:06.599> logically<00:04:07.169> together<00:04:07.620> okay<00:04:09.980> then<00:04:10.980> in

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
linked logically together okay then in

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.210 
linked logically together okay then in
the<00:04:12.209> more<00:04:12.810> detail<00:04:13.260> into<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.709> lesson<00:04:14.040> they're

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
the more detail into the lesson they're

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.619 
the more detail into the lesson they're
going<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.549> look<00:04:14.730> at<00:04:14.879> the<00:04:15.030> range<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.510> vocabulary

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629

going to look at the range of vocabulary
and<00:04:16.079> structure<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:16.889> they're<00:04:17.190> going<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.489> decide

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
and structure so they're going to decide

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.300 
and structure so they're going to decide
whether<00:04:18.510> you're<00:04:18.810> repeating<00:04:19.500> vocabulary<00:04:20.190> too

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
whether you're repeating vocabulary too

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.820 
whether you're repeating vocabulary too
much<00:04:20.519> or<00:04:21.269> if<00:04:21.599> you're<00:04:21.750> repeating<00:04:22.199> grammatical

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
and vocabulary structure too much or if

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.409 
and vocabulary structure too much or if
you've<00:04:25.770> got<00:04:25.949> enough<00:04:26.310> different<00:04:26.970> types<00:04:27.240> of
