00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.690
 good guys and girls you know that here 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.940
 in the channel we are delivered to the top 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.830
 with the universe of dragon ball and how not 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.750
 with that new dragon ball super series 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.730
 that is giving so much to talk about 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.400
 chapters because they like many others 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.259
 because they do not like it and because they criticize the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.300
 animation thing we've tried a lot 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.489
 here also in the channel but the truth 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.259
 is that no fan of the saga can be 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.769
 lose this new dragon ball series 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.929
 super and the truth is that between passions 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.480
 and disappointments that are unleashing the 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.710
 series in equal parts among the fans 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.620
 ah and good then a wish between all and 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.540
 is to have on your shelf each 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.510
 of the chapters that are issued from dragon 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.270
 super ball and this will be possible in the 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.130
 last number of v jump has been 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.170
 precisely in which it has been confirmed 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.270
 the dvd and blu-ray release of 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.120
 super dragon ball for the end of the year in 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.350
 Japanese lands 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.410
 specifically, it will be day 2 of 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.020
 December although since November 3 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.000
 will be available to rent I know 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.490
 the pack is going to be put on sale and 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.070
 will be composed of two discs that go 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.190
 to include 12 episodes the second pack 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.850
 he will also arrive to japan obviously 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.820
 first in March 2016 in which 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.950
 will arrive 12 other remaining chapters 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.350
 price has been confirmed and is in yen 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.440
 and in the change in euros we would be 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.420
 talking about 80 and 110 euros depending 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.790
 of the chosen version a price 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.100
 quite high everything has to be said a 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.619
 dvd and blu-ray dragon ball pack 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.130
 super that at the moment we do not know if 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.220
 will come to Europe but of course 80 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.369
 euros for 12 chapters to me it seems 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.530
 quite expensive and 110 euros in the case of 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.840
 bluray I do not know how you see it 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.520
 We'll see if well, spend more time and 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.290
 obviously this lowers the price but 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.410
 Of course I believe that the authentic ones 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.410
 fans are going to want the series yes or yes
