a<00:01:27.810> couple<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:28.080> things<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.380> are<00:01:28.560> actually

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
a couple of things that are actually

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.210 
a couple of things that are actually
missing<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.460> cloud-based<00:01:30.150> app<00:01:30.570> I

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
missing with this cloud-based app I

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.929 
missing with this cloud-based app I
imagine<00:01:32.220> they'll<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.369> adding<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:32.820> those

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
imagine they'll be adding all those

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.249 
imagine they'll be adding all those
features<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:33.720> soon<00:01:33.930> they<00:01:34.079> just

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
features to it here soon they just

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.080 
features to it here soon they just
probably<00:01:34.500> wanted<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:34.950> out<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.820> fast

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
probably wanted to get this out as fast

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.520 
probably wanted to get this out as fast
as<00:01:36.210> they<00:01:36.329> could<00:01:36.390> since<00:01:36.840> Apple<00:01:37.229> made<00:01:37.380> them

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
