00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.370
 hello people here trade with a new 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.680
 tutorial and the first one in the entire list 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.860
 where I'm going to teach how to record a 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.759
 Play without cameras or capture is 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.429
 purchased 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:19.780
 so they save money and the only thing that 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:22.310
 you need is your play or xbox 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.990
 in my case play 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.730
 it's all they need is a webcam 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.760
 just a webcam I recommend that 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.829
 be the one that comes to play with games 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.610
 like the wonder book or games like that 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.120
 as well 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.390
 they just released a 4 forgiveness too 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.910
 they can use a normal webcam but they 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.960
 I recommend the play 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.150
 then they will need a laptop and what 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.880
 will do is connect the webcam to the laptop 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.970
 and put the webcam pointing to the TV of 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:03.200
 so that the edges do not protrude 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:05.740
 and then they will do this on the laptop they will go to 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.950
 your search engine 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.939
 others do have if they have van dyck and 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.090
 action sing now or some applications 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.710
 webcam use the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.740
 but in this case if you can not 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.399
 install or something here they go to your search engine and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.140
 leave on the link two pages of 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.540
 captures online here is screencast 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.820
 or matic 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.790
 this page so famous but what leaves 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.740
 it's a demo to use 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.160
 but it 's withdrawal if you do not have on youtube 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.840
 the super creation is 15 minutes 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.480
 this separates the 15 minutes and comes a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.220
 little good but sometimes you can cut it 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.660
 in the middle of a video something that's why I do not 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.500
 I recommend a lot has HD has so many 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.770
 formats and here on the page I will put them 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.910
 everyone and I'll show you a little 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.910
 you need java 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.450
 goes on windows 7 mac i can not say that 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.450
 in guadalix go they give him to execute 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.300
 wait for it to charge a little and here it is 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.580
 automatic screening 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.870
 here the microphone will come out and everything 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.240
 record and the most important thing 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.780
 I do not have any webcam but if the 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.180
 had it come out that the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.250
 camera and choose the always there 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.740
 choose the because it is usually removed from 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.520
 suddenly I do not know every time I do I do not know 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.540
 if it is usually put automatically in without 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.319
 camera 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.600
 so I would give you to go to record you will pass 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.760
 from the screen 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.890
 or if not then it would be deleted when editing the 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.840
 video and everything but we recommend a lot 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.200
 is 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.200
 and now we could go to power soft 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.390
 which is the one I recommend most since 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.650
 is if it 's free is not the money 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.560
 nothing here you can see an image 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.439
 and as it says here it has pc screen 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.069
 but we are not interested in what interests us 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:22.590
 is without a time limit so what about the 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.720
 webcam the pc screen not us 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.370
 Interested webcam yes but how is the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.580
 time limit is better 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.799
 here what mac or windows says I can not 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.379
 say go guadalinex because I do not 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.959
 I've tried capturing so many sounds from 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.410
 system or microphone so they can 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.220
 talk to 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:48.140
 to your laptop while you're talking to 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.410
 the webcam or put the sound after 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.720
 why 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:59.410
 this improve your videos with the ponderosa 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:02.020
 edited function so what he said 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.640
 have to edit the videos so I 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.860
 can then put the sound apart or 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.050
 something 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.690
 and I convert your videos any format 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.060
 this to upload it faster or something is 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.130
 I will teach it also needs java 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.840
 most of these pages need 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.070
 Java 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.070
 they give him to execute 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.860
 a power show 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.740
 How are you already using me to 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.740
 record is also worth 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.460
 quick key already registered to this is that 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.900
 It has me in auto program open as 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.140
 I'm doing now with qantas and 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.810
 study will recognize that a key 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.910
 record for the video or something is f10 by 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.700
 I get this but do not worry 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.500
 the virtual sound card is not 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.970
 worry most of the computer what 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.970
 they have in my case not 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.140
 or not very good and here I would go there two 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.970
 audio inputs we would really go to 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:12.060
 record here look how it comes out right here 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:15.540
 webcam and if there is one that is the one 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.440
 here select to edit it the 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.870
 resolution and everything 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.139
 and it has the same as having an account of 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.479
 the details 21 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:30.259
 and it's very good is the one I recommend 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:35.289
 has hd and all- inclusive and the gameplay 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:38.319
 to be with an original play webcam 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.569
 if it is a normal as I said before 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:42.879
 nothing happens either, it depends on the quality 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:45.399
 I have and everything but if it's a play 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:48.460
 You will look great no one will notice 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:50.860
 which is recorded with a webcam because a 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.649
 difference that the cameras show that 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.869
 is a camera because they tend to move or 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:58.180
 blur the image and if it is in a 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:06:00.309
 capturing the inheritance is noted because 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:04.059
 nothing or nothing moves but in this 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:06.770
 case nothing moves and the quality of 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:09.610
 image is good 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:12.630
 so nothing if you liked it like 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.340
 subscribe we help a lot 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.340
 and then nothing until the next
