00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.160 
well and also handles the hyperdrive
extremely<00:02:23.640> well<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:24.030> ridiculously<00:02:24.900> fast

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
extremely well it's ridiculously fast

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.000 
extremely well it's ridiculously fast
I'm<00:02:25.829> very<00:02:26.250> happy<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.879> so<00:02:27.950> UEFI<00:02:28.950> is

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
I'm very happy with it so UEFI is

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.160 
I'm very happy with it so UEFI is
definitely<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.549> good<00:02:29.700> thing<00:02:29.870> I'll<00:02:30.870> tell<00:02:31.109> you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
definitely a good thing I'll tell you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.330 
definitely a good thing I'll tell you
that<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.230> just<00:02:34.439> thought<00:02:34.590> I'd<00:02:34.799> show<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.099> that

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
that so I just thought I'd show you that

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.770 
that so I just thought I'd show you that
that<00:02:35.519> I've<00:02:35.609> switched<00:02:35.790> back<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.060> Windows<00:02:36.420> 8<00:02:36.629> and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
that I've switched back to Windows 8 and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.020 
that I've switched back to Windows 8 and
the<00:02:37.290> boot<00:02:37.470> time<00:02:37.739> with<00:02:38.129> that<00:02:38.310> new<00:02:38.459> drive<00:02:38.760> is

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
the boot time with that new drive is

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.020 
the boot time with that new drive is
ridiculous<00:02:39.780> now<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.680> have<00:02:40.890> HCI<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.970> I

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
ridiculous now that I have HCI on and I

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.080 
ridiculous now that I have HCI on and I
have<00:02:42.799> UEFI<00:02:43.799> enabled<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.640> there<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.239> have<00:02:45.390> it

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
have UEFI enabled so there you have it

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.490 
have UEFI enabled so there you have it
just<00:02:48.090> figured<00:02:48.389> I'd<00:02:48.480> show<00:02:48.659> the<00:02:48.750> boot<00:02:48.900> time<00:02:49.109> have

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
just figured I'd show the boot time have

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.129 
just figured I'd show the boot time have
a<00:02:49.590> good<00:02:49.680> one<00:02:49.799> everybody
