00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.730
 we have to realize now it's a joke 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.669
 We stand shortly before Climax and are now determined we must act 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.440
 and we have no useful concepts 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.580
 there are no holistic concepts 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.110
 There are many individual ideas that they have someone of the cake counter 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.850
 and never before has been hot but is true that the 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.950
 Urban planning is 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.410
 Presentions we still have today 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.410
 the twentieth 19 years police officer 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.300
 up to 40 percent we have to become one hundred percent 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.740
 and this 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.600
 Reform and revolution disrupted planning session sit up 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.390
 Results 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.110
 holistic 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.070
 stand out 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.120
 Derek the fish world is determined 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.030
 should 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.030
 reinforced the responsibility of urban planning 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.570
 that is important to me 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.000
 and I know enough to change the tracks completely 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.170
 and it will 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.130
 if we really want to achieve all these goals for the new development areas 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.680
 to give a view the door she had very little to do with what 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.620
 After the war, renewable energies are certainly here 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.550
 a very important point and are necessary for our future 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.590
 just the discussion that always reminds me of the possible merger advantage 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.840
 avoid 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.400
 burn and then start using the incinerator and then see 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.560
 I have the potential savings that lie in the stock and in the building envelope and there 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.650
 must now conditionally them and this discussion we must lead 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.890
 and we have to lead the historical robe inventory building 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.420
 I will not mind 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.810
 my problem is not that I want to rehabilitate more energy me too 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.540
 contrary to periods the moment are given and in size 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.959
 the stocks 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.619
 just can not be done 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:21.889
 I still think it is 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.079
 this goal 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.969
 is so important and then you have to recognize that the politicians 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:28.719
 and then you have his 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:33.409
 Submit Scarlett there and put music there so we can do this 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.299
 Thus, Baumann's goal is not to worry about more expensive energy 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.119
 do 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:42.599
 um and shape man these price increases times included 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.999
 and you just have to tune it if you have it in the spot you want 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.779
 wants to look at it and whether it's worth it 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.779
 and not under the aspect we have to do it 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:58.089
 then you will see that a building renovation is relatively fast 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:01.999
 The Zerbst perhaps back a little to the monument protection 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.259
 but of course in the old town in Bamberg 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:07.909
 Percent very different encounters 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.680
 Of course, in the old town comes 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.189
 the world heritage status is natural 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.180
 a tip from our point of view very strict preservation of monuments to right 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.320
 Historic Preservation Who to 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.769
 but they end up in the old town 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.649
 the energy standard still has been 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:28.419
 we wanted to hand-in small art pieces to the gallery 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.279
 Although it is often considered that way, it's just historical 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:36.419
 the prehistory is optimal the history of the building and possible 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.619
 drive around times Euro 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.199
 The houses of the unchanged claims have always been Nauen 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:46.609
 fit and living in a vibrant state, it is still possible today 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.879
 Alternative to end 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.029
 more we wanted to prevent the catastrophic prevent 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:53.609
 such is the collapse 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.419
 It went on at this fourth event for the Green New Deal in Bamberg 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:02.430
 Basis of a broad very informative and image data lecture by Professor 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.079
 Dröge 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.229
 and the question of how a sustainable city of the future could look like was there 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.839
 It was thematized that it deals with both the topic of renewable energies 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.629
 and of course also in the focus but also in the area consumption 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.799
 Energy savings new mobility concepts and the individual 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.529
 Behavior of the people of the population itself 

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:27.109
 central was the demand that it was basically the name to report all the actors 

00:04:27.109 --> 00:04:31.749
 be brought into the boat be it the actors institutional kind of private 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:34.879
 Act »Economy percent of business and administration 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.349
 Percent to inform and to 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.900
 to involve in the theme central to the important for all events 

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:47.879
 Almunia stands out vho and the high importance ultimately citizens 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.170
 To bring citizens and local actors on board 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.360
 and jointly develop strategies to share goals together 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.510
 formulate a joint public relations work 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.220
 The topic of renewable instead and the way must be there with fun and joy 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.670
 The index finger should not be conveyed while holding it up 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.890
 raised or not so often but it really has the incentive 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.650
 This topic should be further communicated 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.190
 Although quintessence from all events now finally as well 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.370
 Quintessence that holistic concepts of IT are needed 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.410
 positive examples are good are important to do that and to give suggestions 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.790
 but they have to be involved in an overall way 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.259
