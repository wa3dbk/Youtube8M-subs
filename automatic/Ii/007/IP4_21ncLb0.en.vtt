java<00:03:07.980> Hernandez<00:03:08.670> now<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.510> guy<00:03:09.920> has<00:03:10.920> made

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
java Hernandez now this guy has made

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.920 
java Hernandez now this guy has made
probably<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.970> move<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.360> his<00:03:12.390> life<00:03:12.720> I'm

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
probably the move of his life I'm

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.060 
probably the move of his life I'm
betting<00:03:13.200> for<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.530> when<00:03:13.680> he<00:03:13.830> went<00:03:13.980> to

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
betting for that when he went to

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.410 
betting for that when he went to
Manchester<00:03:14.400> United<00:03:14.790> them<00:03:14.940> figure<00:03:15.180> would<00:03:15.270> get

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
Manchester United them figure would get

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.750 
Manchester United them figure would get
better<00:03:15.570> than<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.840> but<00:03:16.290> he's<00:03:17.160> our<00:03:17.310> only<00:03:17.400> gone

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
better than that but he's our only gone

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.790 
better than that but he's our only gone
and<00:03:17.940> gone<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.300> real<00:03:18.480> madrid<00:03:18.840> they<00:03:19.350> wanted

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
and gone to real madrid they wanted

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.640 
and gone to real madrid they wanted
themselves<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.550> be<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:21.810> have<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.200> backup

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
themselves to be to have a backup

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.830 
themselves to be to have a backup
striker<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.489> do<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.670> decent<00:03:23.910> job<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.750> is

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
striker that can do a decent job that is

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.090 
striker that can do a decent job that is
exactly<00:03:24.989> what<00:03:25.350> they've<00:03:25.500> got<00:03:25.680> right<00:03:25.860> here<00:03:25.890> in

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
exactly what they've got right here in

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.979 
exactly what they've got right here in
Javier<00:03:26.340> Hernandez<00:03:26.790> now<00:03:26.970> I've<00:03:27.239> given<00:03:27.720> him<00:03:27.840> a

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
Javier Hernandez now I've given him a

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.900 
Javier Hernandez now I've given him a
racing<00:03:28.590> downgrade<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:28.980> one<00:03:29.250> because<00:03:29.550> last

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
racing downgrade of one because last

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.790 
racing downgrade of one because last
season<00:03:30.209> was<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.540> worst<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:31.050> his<00:03:31.200> four<00:03:31.440> seasons

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
season was the worst of his four seasons

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.520 
season was the worst of his four seasons
at<00:03:32.010> Manchester<00:03:32.910> but<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.269> do<00:03:33.450> think<00:03:33.900> he<00:03:34.380> will

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
at Manchester but I do think he will

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.050 
at Manchester but I do think he will
have<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.709> pretty<00:03:35.010> solid<00:03:35.190> time<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.640> he<00:03:35.700> does<00:03:35.880> get

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
have a pretty solid time and he does get

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.240 
have a pretty solid time and he does get
played<00:03:36.300> at<00:03:36.480> Real<00:03:36.630> Madrid<00:03:36.959> with<00:03:37.080> all<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.530> all

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
played at Real Madrid with all the all

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.520 
played at Real Madrid with all the all
the<00:03:38.360> assists<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.540> chances<00:03:40.019> created<00:03:40.200> for<00:03:40.440> him

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
the assists and chances created for him

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.930 
the assists and chances created for him
but<00:03:40.590> nonetheless<00:03:40.769> his<00:03:41.100> writings<00:03:41.489> I've<00:03:41.670> kept

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
but nonetheless his writings I've kept

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.970 
but nonetheless his writings I've kept
his<00:03:42.120> pace<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.840> same<00:03:43.019> dribbling<00:03:43.590> down<00:03:43.680> by<00:03:43.830> one

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
his pace the same dribbling down by one

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.229 
his pace the same dribbling down by one
shooting<00:03:44.220> down<00:03:44.400> by<00:03:44.489> two<00:03:44.549> defending<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.090> same

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
shooting down by two defending the same

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.080 
shooting down by two defending the same
passed<00:03:45.510> down<00:03:45.720> by<00:03:45.750> two<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.200> physicality<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:47.130> 69

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
passed down by two and physicality of 69

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.880 
passed down by two and physicality of 69
now<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.480> do<00:03:48.720> think<00:03:49.140> he<00:03:49.260> will<00:03:49.380> be<00:03:49.500> very<00:03:49.530> good<00:03:49.769> for

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
now I do think he will be very good for

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.289 
now I do think he will be very good for
them<00:03:50.010> as<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.250> said<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.519> I<00:03:50.610> think<00:03:50.820> all<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.060> these

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
them as I said and I think all of these

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.940 
them as I said and I think all of these
signings<00:03:51.660> are<00:03:51.840> actually<00:03:52.200> very<00:03:52.440> solid

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
signings are actually very solid

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.170 
signings are actually very solid
signings<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.400> would<00:03:53.610> think<00:03:53.790> that<00:03:53.880> most<00:03:54.120> of

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
signings you would think that most of

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.729 
signings you would think that most of
the<00:03:54.299> time<00:03:54.450> that's<00:03:54.870> why<00:03:55.049> clubs<00:03:55.260> would<00:03:55.380> buy<00:03:55.560> them

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
the time that's why clubs would buy them

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.500 
the time that's why clubs would buy them
but<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:56.160> definitely<00:03:56.910> all<00:03:57.150> going<00:03:57.269> to<00:03:57.330> be<00:03:57.390> very

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
but I definitely all going to be very

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.970 
but I definitely all going to be very
good<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.260> he<00:03:58.320> in<00:03:58.440> this<00:03:58.560> episode<00:03:58.769> guys
