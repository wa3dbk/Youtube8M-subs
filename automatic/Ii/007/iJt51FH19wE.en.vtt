trailer<00:05:54.950> I'm<00:05:55.729> looking<00:05:56.030> forward<00:05:56.270> to<00:05:56.330> this<00:05:56.479> but

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
trailer I'm looking forward to this but

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.170 
trailer I'm looking forward to this but
is<00:05:57.200> that<00:05:57.580> it<00:05:58.750> it<00:05:59.750> just<00:06:00.050> it<00:06:00.320> gave<00:06:00.889> way<00:06:01.250> too<00:06:01.550> much

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
is that it it just it gave way too much

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.360 
is that it it just it gave way too much
and<00:06:02.539> because<00:06:03.410> it<00:06:03.530> gave<00:06:03.740> too<00:06:04.039> much<00:06:04.160> I<00:06:04.310> think

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
and because it gave too much I think

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.219 
and because it gave too much I think
