does for today's demo we actually

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.480 
does for today's demo we actually
program<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.929> follow<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.500> red<00:00:16.859> ball<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.400> I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
program it to follow a red ball so I
