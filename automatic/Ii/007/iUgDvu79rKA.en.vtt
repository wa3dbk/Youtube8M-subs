00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.840
 while alex gonzález would have all the municipalities of lima 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:11.930
 the protesters have gone well 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.589
 jimmi simpson 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.699
 he's a logist boy 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.699
 representative of the green alternative movement 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.220
 and let's say 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 three before hearing what could propose an ecologist for Lima 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.689
 in the city 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.689
 anti-ecological as it were 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.670
 if you let us know what a good night and offer chaos 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.360
 good p 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.320
 I see that it has basically two proposals one loves 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.790
 lima sure that has to do with the security city 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.850
 what does the metro veronesi build a subway to start its 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.920
 terrarium iu-green is to say the one that does not imitate I almost imagine 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.620
 let's start with the second the green meter how is this 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.620
 the green meter the escudito 3 a terrarium 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.010
 that I did not rechristened as the name of green meter 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.390
 since 1974 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.200
 the government of Peru then 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.079
 invested 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.510
 28 million dollars 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.090
 to do a study 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.170
 of the situation of the dec of vehicular chaos that he already had had the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.790
 great capital of lima 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.890
 This studio 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.710
 important 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.020
 very accurate 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.200
 determined 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.280
 the importance of generating 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.560
 the development of an underground train min this underground train 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.270
 to solve the chaos 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.740
 in which it is found those of Lima and that would oppose 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.020
 the reason is given to this important project 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.470
 we have from the dgt would project to define because I would have to go the 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.830
 doctor víctor the rest is without a doubt 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.920
 not only determines the route 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 if not the comparative advantages of an efficient transport 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:50.610
 safe 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.100
 economic 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.950
 he would allow that in Lima 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.689
 per cent did not have pollution levels 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.360
 that today we have 4 112 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.300
 carcinogenic gases 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.090
 built or because it would be electrical seriousness in how the clearing works that 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.800
 yes it is an electric train 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.040
 July happened to energy 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.249
 that the mobile and that would mobilize it 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:15.280
 this is different from the way the capital is currently transported 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.759
 that is why the issue of selling green na - t comes 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:21.759
 it's a train that would share from stone bridge 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.759
 and he was heading like that to lurin 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.140
 would go through 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.139
 are the important gesink that would undoubtedly allow it 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.799
 in which he the recovery of the climate that has 13 million trips this in 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.429
 the actuality of the real after it fell down to an input how many 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:42.949
 kilometers are 60 kilometers at least that the project forgive 60 or more 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:44.899
 clark were 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:49.839
 60 kilometers of the underground train is the most expensive do not look at what 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:53.479
 it is not so much if we compare with the recent important investments 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.720
 300 million dollars 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.660
 I have just been informed by Metropolitan Apostle this project therefore 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.370
 how much it would cost a subway is disposable that the second does not subrogate 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.630
 some scopes are in process 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.710
 the authorization of this train from this underground train that observed it 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.389
 we are green meter 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.689
 so that he not only percent have a ditch an exact figure 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:16.690
 2000 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.090
 500 to two thousand 400 million dollars would cost this text of 1400 and 1500 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.420
 this figure is being handled by technical specialists that I have 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.429
 summoned 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.300
 in Lima they get lost every year and jaime alto 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.400
 2000 million dollars that charges men incombustible that burns 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:35.869
 four hours a day 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:37.829
 the citizens of the towns 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.879
 they can not be in their homes they employ being transport sectar contributing in 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.879
 conditions really subhuman but like that man fly amb the game like 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.170
 we would do to finance a work of 2 thousand 400 million dollars is a work 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:54.069
 mascaraque vermouth 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.129
 no but you 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.230
 in nepal international cooperation there the inter-American development bank is 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.169
 just celebrated 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:02.319
 in copenhagen 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.939
 One of the most interesting proposals is how we promote the countries 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.569
 developing countries can develop projects of this nature 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.799
 in the face of climate change how to reduce emissions 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.650
 how to generate cities like Lima 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.769
 what is a city 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.400
 July city whose soil structure has been studied 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.349
 34 years ago carbon bonds believe you 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.380
 Of course there is that proposal that is so interesting 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.820
 six billion dollars are in the flower of the fund of interest for the 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.770
 internationals that we could take advantage of that we can put it 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.800
 that initiative that since you want this humanist party candidate 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.009
 boost 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.430
 travel and feel 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.340
 fast insurance and especially for me the great pollution that lime has 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.330
 cheering by toxic gases 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.259
 then we would have a city facing the future 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.669
 now we would have a 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:54.819
 an ere 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.430
 in the metropolitan 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.660
 parallel to a train I tell him to go to eat the radio coffin that 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.650
 they are building 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.960
 that there was also a subterranean motorcycle more or less by the same route 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.180
 live from oz auto 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.050
 mckee the train and relaunched electric train that we like to give them 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.969
 the quindío salvador begins 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.410
 the one who goes away 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.520
 let's go to the city 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.770
 for the measure 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.370
 by the area of ​​her life arias and bobby is the metropolitan that is a 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.229
 displacement prototype 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:26.930
 this underground stress lies within a plan that could integrate 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.840
 these two initiatives I who am not the mayor 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.009
 that will contribute 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.430
 to interact 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.120
 all the good initiatives that have been done to date 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:42.000
 no doubt we have 4 million involuntary trips burning oil in a 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.120
 corner of fifty magnet minibuses that has a passenger technically 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.030
 viable and profitable 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.150
 you only know now the problem is that this metropolitan that has been 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.710
 constructed 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.830
 that will operate as we saw the association of atoms pollute less than 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.580
 10 meters flat in sincé 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.580
 although they need to really work the nine solution 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.090
 more riders that makes us come together been built 9 your sixth day of 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.580
 runners falls 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.699
 I wanted more time the meter per kilometer look at you 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.360
 percent and city is like santiago de chile bogotá 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.260
 New York London in London is 150 years old 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.499
 is demonstrated 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:23.800
 to be transported underground is much faster efficient 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.900
 maybe not in cities much more 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.880
 small in terms of herediano 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.640
 every time it is a small city in terms of slim areas it is much more 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.270
 extensive and here comes the justification just this preserve 10 kilometers we are going to 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.470
 build with this subway train on another green 125 kilometers like this is 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.270
 conceived 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.919
 the year 74 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:46.770
 in that we already went to the 34 years ago but this proposal above all goes 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.939
 to allow to recover what I told him the works we need and not the felines 

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:55.210
 to dedicate them to their children to devote to other activities 4 5 hours 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.520
 currently employed 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.150
 the citizens of this great capital to be able to move to their workplace 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.720
 and abandoned their children and leave the family this is going to recover 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.830
 to decontaminate lima with the meter see
