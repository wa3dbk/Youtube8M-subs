00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello, I'm the melo 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.649
 and I think we are all clear that the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.629
 way of communicating has changed the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.800
 social networks and especially mobile 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.269
 have created a new way of 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.160
 communication I think I'm not the only one 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.290
 that right now I could not live without this 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.670
 thing in mobile a smartphone like what 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.259
 you want to call what is clear is that 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.119
 it is an invention of the devil has improved 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.160
 many things yes but it is that we are 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.300
 losing many others because of this 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.500
 I'm sure I'm not the only one who has 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.450
 seen in the situation of staying with 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.450
 someone and what happens what amount 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.860
 of aragon is happening this is happening 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.420
 is happening you know this amÃ©lie that 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.980
 says according to the same say how many 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.540
 people having an orgasm for what 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.010
 very sure that now in a lot of 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.530
 people who have stayed and are like this 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.210
 we are losing the magic the worst is 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.850
 that there is always one that does not have a mobile 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.040
 is not attentive to the mobile and is in plan 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.510
 to agree if I stay in my house besides 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.550
 now mothers have it very difficult 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.900
 to punish their children or when their 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.610
 son or his daughter has spent a lot of time 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.590
 in front of the computer or it's time to 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.360
 sleep or eat tells you child leave the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.870
 computer and the child that does goes to the 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.870
 bed and what 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.660
 or even you I do 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.700
 I need to rest insomnia is so 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.560
 fashionable now that everyone has 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.530
 Insomnia is caused in its greatest 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.570
 part for this its mostly better yesterday 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.820
 how much more is that he will also know the phrase 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.530
 is fine is the last thing I think about 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.310
 when I go to bed and first thing is what 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.310
 I think how I get up 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.030
 It's a lie the last thing you do to the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.620
 to lie down is look at the mobile and what 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.180
 first you do when you get up too 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.710
 inspires again to have a mobile or it 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.600
 is depriving a lot of things in 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.890
 how to relate to others by 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.470
 example now you're debating about 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.880
 one issue and it ends quickly is that 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.500
 there is room for debate there is always the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.650
 typical smartass that takes out the mobile for 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.979
 all since not that if not fuck yes 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.860

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.810
 they have made the report in the nasa and everything 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.450
 they are whores that is the nasa of your report 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.970
 about it all this that you go to a place 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.690
 and you do not know you do not know the site and 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.299
 you need a map a map who has a 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.250
 map now what the fuck is a map a map 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.200

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.909
 google maps battle maps yes what 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.799
 You want to go from Barcelona to Madrid 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.870
 the Atlantic is no longer seen by anyone 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.180
 streets fighting over bending that damn 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.819
 gigantic map from the very same 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.340
 hell made to make fun of us 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.299
 I have seen my parents cry for not 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.299
 be able to fold a map 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.110
 even the fact of flirting is losing 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.300
 the magic of applications that even you 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.400
 they tell how far the person is in 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.960
 question there are applications that tells you 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.960
 what gay are you next 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.000

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.180
 that is my father many family dramas 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.730
 have been caused by this now the 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.280
 The best courtship there is Spain 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.840
 come to have a smartphone with internet 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.340
 constant can even become 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.960
 dangerous and people who have run out 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.960
 teeth for having a smartphone 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.150
 this for instagram 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.250
 not all the dentists in the world 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.530

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.090
 to see to see also calm the tits 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.739
 that not all are disadvantages and things 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.360
 bad can be helpful for example 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.069
 If you go to a party where you do not know 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.480
 nobody to make you interesting or 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.480

 I will venture, I believe that in a 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:18.239
 future people will not need 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:22.289
 have contact between them 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.370
