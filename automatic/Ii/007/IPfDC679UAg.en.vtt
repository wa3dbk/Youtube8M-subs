per gallon but the trip was mostly

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.729

uphill<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.750> next<00:01:04.019> morning<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.350> started<00:01:04.620> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
uphill the next morning it started to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.410 
uphill the next morning it started to
snow<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.370> had<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> good<00:01:05.640> two<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:06.150> three

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
snow and we had a good two or three

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.990 
snow and we had a good two or three
inches<00:01:06.780> by<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.140> evening<00:01:07.460> needless<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.550> say<00:01:08.580> I

inches by that evening needless to say I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.850 
inches by that evening needless to say I
was<00:01:09.360> really<00:01:09.750> happy<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.350> had<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.530> remote

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
was really happy that we had the remote

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.300 
was really happy that we had the remote
start<00:01:11.040> system<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.730> the<00:01:12.000> rubber<00:01:12.180> floor<00:01:12.450> mats

however<00:01:14.310> our<00:01:14.610> rear<00:01:15.180> wheel<00:01:15.210> drive<00:01:15.720> tests<00:01:16.110> are

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
however our rear wheel drive tests are

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.990 
however our rear wheel drive tests are
struggled<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.920> get<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.370> from<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> standstill

I<00:01:18.360> would<00:01:18.990> strongly<00:01:19.290> suggest<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.010> go

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
I would strongly suggest that you go

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
I would strongly suggest that you go
with<00:01:20.250> either<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.700> four-wheel<00:01:21.120> drive<00:01:21.150> or<00:01:21.690> put

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
with either the four-wheel drive or put

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.680 
with either the four-wheel drive or put
some<00:01:22.290> extra<00:01:22.440> weight<00:01:22.800> in<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:22.979> truck<00:01:23.190> bed<00:01:23.690> while

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
some extra weight in the truck bed while
