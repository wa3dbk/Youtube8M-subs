00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.590
 ah 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.080
 hello friend said in this video we are going to 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.270
 teach how to leave our seminar 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.620
 Android faster than usual in 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.390
 the case that we do not have any 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.630
 custom or we can not see block it 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.900
 good for it we will make simple steps 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.850
 first we go to configurations 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.109
 the screen or show 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.879
 in the animation part and you are not 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.839
 There animations this will not help 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.839
 save more 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.980
 faster, although the 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.030
 animations 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.060
 what we had before 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.799
 another thing if you occupy internet 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.799
 go and put in the options menu 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.670
 more configuration 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.360
 go down to the game to activate 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.010
 accessories 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.010
 and they put him in that activity 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.010
 something else too 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.860
 and you have many accounts 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.330
 synchronized 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.630
 for example facebook or up 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.230
 and they are not occupying them reflect and you 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.650
 they put 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.570
 screening synchronization according to 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.310
 that they are not occupying so that they do not 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.480
 is sending organizations to each 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.890
 while and this is 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.810
 consumed ram memory 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.600
 Now if you have a wallpaper 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.640
 animated background screen this I want 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.360
 that they remove it and leave it in some background 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.940
 of screen 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.620
 simple or that does not consume us ram and here 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.270
 which animated paper 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.390
 and a lot of quick memory 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.400
 another is an application that I suggest 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.129
 that you commission it a good 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.750
 find in place thor the application is 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.750
 llama advanced sarsfield 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.349
 you can find it for free 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.030
 the application 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.700
 is to close applications that do not close 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.459
 definitely 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.349
 then you go in and you're going to 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.349
 appear the actions that are open 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.860
 and above it tells you how much ram memory 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.540
 is available in this case I have left 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.040
 83 black 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.909
 they can also use it as a widget 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.909
 kept there 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.349
 2 is only a doubt 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.370
 and it will look like the room in which 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.950
 be good these are simple steps not 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.040
 it means that your cell phone is one minute 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.170
 it will be 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.290
 on a shovel and that your battery goes to 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.540
 last a month not but these simple 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.150
 steps will help us make our cell 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.290
 be a little more fluid 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.290
 you will not have so many problems 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.769
 I hope this video of the 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.769
 insufficiency
