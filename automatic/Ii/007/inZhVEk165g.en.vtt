with<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.160> diagram<00:00:11.640> is<00:00:11.940> showing<00:00:12.120> here<00:00:12.660> it's

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
with this diagram is showing here it's

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.350 
with this diagram is showing here it's
showing<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.350> epicenters<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.310> the<00:00:14.460> 1906

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
showing the epicenters of the 1906

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.140 
showing the epicenters of the 1906
earthquake<00:00:15.510> and<00:00:16.170> then<00:00:16.619> 1989<00:00:17.550> earthquakes

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
earthquake and then 1989 earthquakes

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.540 
earthquake and then 1989 earthquakes
both<00:00:18.779> earthquakes<00:00:19.380> happen<00:00:19.800> right<00:00:20.009> along<00:00:20.339> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
both earthquakes happen right along the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.419 
both earthquakes happen right along the
San<00:00:20.789> Andreas<00:00:20.820> Fault<00:00:21.560> do<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.619> have<00:00:22.830> your<00:00:23.099> your

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:23.429 
San Andreas Fault do you have your your

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.759 
San Andreas Fault do you have your your
pieces<00:00:23.849> of<00:00:23.970> foil<00:00:24.179> shaped<00:00:24.539> okay<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.499> looks

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
pieces of foil shaped okay that looks

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.310 
pieces of foil shaped okay that looks
really<00:00:26.070> good<00:00:26.339> so<00:00:26.609> let's<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.140> first

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
really good so let's do that the first

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.349 
really good so let's do that the first
transverse<00:00:29.009> fall<00:00:29.279> together<00:00:29.519> may<00:00:29.999> be<00:00:30.060> right

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
transverse fall together may be right

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.970 
transverse fall together may be right
here<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.720> might<00:00:30.929> be<00:00:31.079> a<00:00:31.109> little<00:00:31.289> River<00:00:31.650> Valley

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
here this might be a little River Valley

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.560 
here this might be a little River Valley
something<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.360> mountain

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
something like that this is a mountain

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.810 
something like that this is a mountain
top<00:00:33.930> something<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.430> see

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
top something like that so you can see

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.790 
top something like that so you can see
that<00:00:36.150> even<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.600> shape<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> foil<00:00:37.290> might

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
that even the shape of the foil might

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.100 
that even the shape of the foil might
mimic<00:00:38.280> how<00:00:38.460> actual<00:00:39.060> land<00:00:39.300> might<00:00:39.570> be<00:00:42.110> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
mimic how actual land might be you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.960 
mimic how actual land might be you
notice<00:00:43.410> you've<00:00:43.710> got<00:00:43.740> some<00:00:44.100> bending<00:00:44.490> there<00:00:44.700> oh

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
notice you've got some bending there oh

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.400 
notice you've got some bending there oh
look<00:00:45.480> at<00:00:45.630> that<00:00:45.660> look<00:00:45.930> at<00:00:45.990> that<00:00:46.050> look<00:00:46.260> at<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
look at that look at that look at a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.330 
look at that look at that look at a
deform<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.040> there

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
deform right there

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.280 
deform right there
Oh<00:00:47.370> perfect<00:00:48.150> look<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.750> we've<00:00:48.870> got<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.080> new

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
Oh perfect look that we've got a new

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.520 
Oh perfect look that we've got a new
mountain<00:00:53.600> see<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.630> wonder<00:00:55.020> why<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.170> chose<00:00:55.410> that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
mountain see I wonder why I chose that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.750 
mountain see I wonder why I chose that
because<00:00:55.590> there's<00:00:55.890> pretty<00:00:56.190> much<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.490> same

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
because there's pretty much the same

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.140 
because there's pretty much the same
only<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:58.520> yeah<00:00:59.520> they're<00:00:59.790> just<00:01:00.000> going

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
only like yeah they're just going

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.600 
only like yeah they're just going
different<00:01:00.600> ways<00:01:00.720> from<00:01:00.930> before<00:01:01.370> what<00:01:02.370> did<00:01:02.460> you

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
different ways from before what did you

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.599 
different ways from before what did you
notice<00:01:02.810> okay<00:01:04.189> shakey<00:01:05.189> bent<00:01:05.489> bent<00:01:05.999> bent<00:01:06.539> noise

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:07.609 
notice okay shakey bent bent bent noise

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.190 
notice okay shakey bent bent bent noise
we're<00:01:08.609> gonna<00:01:08.700> kind<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.149> wrap<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.749> with<00:01:09.990> with

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
we're gonna kind of wrap it up with with

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.380 
we're gonna kind of wrap it up with with
earthquakes<00:01:10.469> take<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> look<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.460> processes<00:01:12.179> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
earthquakes take a look at processes and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.459 
earthquakes take a look at processes and
then<00:01:12.990> we're<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.499> move<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.299> volcanoes

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:15.469 
then we're going to move on to volcanoes

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.429 
then we're going to move on to volcanoes
it's<00:01:16.469> a<00:01:16.590> great<00:01:16.799> program<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.600> they<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:18.929> they're

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
it's a great program and they if they're

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.739 
it's a great program and they if they're
for<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> challenge<00:01:20.219> they<00:01:20.579> should<00:01:20.789> do<00:01:21.420> it

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749 
for the challenge they should do it

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:22.969 
for the challenge they should do it
but<00:01:21.929> if<00:01:22.020> you're<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.229> for<00:01:22.469> the<00:01:22.530> challenge<00:01:22.890> you

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
but if you're not for the challenge you

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.999 
but if you're not for the challenge you
shouldn't<00:01:23.249> do<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.429> at<00:01:23.490> all<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.719> it<00:01:25.350> takes<00:01:25.829> you

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
shouldn't do it at all but it takes you

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.099 
shouldn't do it at all but it takes you
very<00:01:26.249> far<00:01:26.579> you<00:01:26.789> can<00:01:27.179> get<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.329> really<00:01:27.869> good

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
very far you can get a really good

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.410 
very far you can get a really good
education<00:01:28.289> you<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.490> go<00:01:29.609> to<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.759> good<00:01:29.939> college<00:01:30.179> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
education you can go to a good college a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.270 
education you can go to a good college a
good<00:01:30.659> high<00:01:30.810> school<00:01:30.869> when<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:32.039> into

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.429 
passed and I actually didn't even know
about<00:01:36.060> Doolin<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.810> got<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> letter<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.380> the

I'll be signing in under my username and

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.370 
I'll be signing in under my username and
then<00:02:05.600> we'll<00:02:06.600> each<00:02:06.720> have<00:02:06.750> different<00:02:07.260> titles

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
then we'll each have different titles

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
then we'll each have different titles
for<00:02:07.800> ours<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.250> then<00:02:08.340> we'll<00:02:08.490> combine<00:02:08.670> them<00:02:09.000> in
