 I bought this from an online store and 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.729
 It's also in Valencia I bought it 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.560
 it cost very cheap and that if it is not appreciated 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.380
 a lot but it 's velvet and such that 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.040
 it is very beautiful because it is that 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.830
 I have this one that is there 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.509

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.060
 I bought second-hand it works well 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:16.550
 I have a two year warranty 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.830

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.710

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.990

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.560
 but what we use to see the 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.920
 movies and all that because there was so 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.100
 of the east symbol of modern warfare 3 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.770
 and it 's very cool here is where more or 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.070
 less then the other TV we have is 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.450
 the one in is a 40 inch sound 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.710
 too big I do not like to play in 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.710
 this screen for nothing 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.549

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.530
 my brother right now and nothing there then 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.840
 is watching what I tell you 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.430
 this is my brother's just 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.200
 load the game my brother did not either 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.659
 like to play with the battery because it weighs 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.540
 much the command then we do not like it and 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.390
 we have it with the charging cable and it plays 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.519
 forming is this and such then my brother 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.430
 Well, the tritons have these 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.650
 gave my gm what happens that the micro 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.590
 it stopped working for a day to 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.659
 another I do not know why I do not know either but 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.489
 well and that's what I was using 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:31.439
 my brother right now because like my 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:33.209
 computer helmets were given to me and then 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.090
 I am using I his and in the 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.680
 mine and to talk then use these 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.359
 the few who entertain themselves with the xbox 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:48.650
 the diet because they broke the truth 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:53.030
 this is the one where we have the movies 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:57.370
 and all that there are the movies and such and 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:02.719
 that's a guide or something like that 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:06.290
 warfare 3 and such this is the router of or 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:10.639

 a lot but good we have it here this is 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.960

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.780
 cables in the east load and play what 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.080
 I have here and this is because of the 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.610
 command battery and this is what the 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.300
 what the triton was to plug 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.210
