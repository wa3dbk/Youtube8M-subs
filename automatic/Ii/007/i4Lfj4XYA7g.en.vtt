00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.909
 I think I'm going to take off the wing, will it? 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.049
 talk boy like you've seen there 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.730
 my channel has changed a bit 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.890
 So I came to talk a little about the changes. 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.480
 what has happened and what galley is 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.710
 arriving now to know a little of my 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.230
 trick 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.029
 As you know, I am one of the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.820
 Brazilians better positioned in the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.369
 leader borges do forza and together with 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.099
 Motor sport fusion crew is a team 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.840
 virtual motoring is worth it 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.670
 Talk about the guys competing for the top 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.280
 between teams recognized by the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.620
 site was the dotcom status in general the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.399
 Who is the game of 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.469
 running 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:49.500
 Do you know who these guys on my channel are? 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.870
 here is seeing more and more br disputing and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.579
 winning in the racing games and I'm going 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.710
 being to you the best and 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.850
 taboos or at least and tacos that I am 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.420
 using tips and some curiosities 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.909
 but if I go for you shortcuts 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.060
 for you to get there soon 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.750
 forza is the need at last what was 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.460
 will be us until now. 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.009
 videos were 11 on the forais 1 and in this 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.280
 time is the game that I have been 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.350
 dedicated more and more will not be just this 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.159
 I'm hoping to get out of grid 2 too. 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.070
 It was where I started in xbox will scroll 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.220
 simulation with forza 4 has some time 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.250
 also have some knowledge of the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.020
 to pass you have maybe I'll play one 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:47.520
 gran turismo 5 but I have a ps3 and 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.810
 maybe roll is also like you 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.470
 saw there 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.570
 the tgs to the game station Brazil in me 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.670
 supported there to spend this kind of 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.469
 content for you and I think that 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.180
 as I'm the only one at least not 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.979
 knows anyone who brings content 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.599
 same as mine on youtube I really wanted 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.510
 I had more but I currently think 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.280
 that it's me and if you know anyone 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.160
 what does this guy do? 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.750
 because I searched I did not find 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.209
 but if you know 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.890
 I wanted you to access the link is 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.750
 so the link for me in the description there 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.130
 no one to contact to unify the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.209
 community about same-day racing games 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:37.020
 No youtube, there it is, we will not 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.030
 enjoy and I'm going to setap for you 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.220
 now that you most enjoy 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:47.850
 pass the arrowp that I got the top 8 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:50.250
 and then we go there practically naked 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:03:00.810
 step I used here was the following to 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:03.300
 conversion if original golf mk2 exchange 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.069
 sports broadcast line 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:10.650
 racing transmission and differential 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:13.260
 also chosen the 3 after 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.600
 bumper after the front bar 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.780
 the rear always the two with the 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.530
 Correct the odds and not move and 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.730
 weight loss the last will not tinker 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.980
 in nothing 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.799
 thing you 're going to mess with in the cooling 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.720
 second option to street 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:45.359
 after that I put on a run 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:49.769
 the width is the penultimate one in the front you 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:57.840
 put the last one in the air you put this one 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:04:02.579
 there 50 and the aerodynamics of the car stops 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.190
 shocks and known strength and in the rear 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:09.120
 You leave the original I tried to put 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:15.180
 this error there but hits the top 100 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:18.810
 using original not even for shock 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:24.030
 rear leaves original and the skirt also 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:27.830
 can leave the original than the video you 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.830
 lilac and thanks
