00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
is because there's not that many online

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.780

you did not collect $200 pretty much

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.500

outdid<00:02:48.980> themselves<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:50.030> only<00:02:50.420> thing<00:02:50.720> that

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
outdid themselves the only thing that

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.060

lets<00:02:51.770> it<00:02:51.980> down<00:02:52.190> it's<00:02:52.610> not<00:02:52.730> online<00:02:53.020> because

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
lets it down it's not online because

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.370 
lets it down it's not online because
Microsoft<00:02:55.070> took<00:02:55.460> it<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.670> step<00:02:55.700> further<00:02:56.380> by

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
Microsoft took it a step further by

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.460 
Microsoft took it a step further by
making<00:02:57.890> us<00:02:58.040> have<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.490> pay<00:02:58.960> just<00:02:59.960> to<00:03:00.110> go<00:03:00.290> online

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
making us have to pay just to go online

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.280 
making us have to pay just to go online
so<00:03:01.460> I<00:03:01.490> never<00:03:02.060> got<00:03:02.210> a<00:03:02.270> chance<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.870> play<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.140> but
