00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.090 
going to be made about this endeavor I
don't<00:04:38.810> think<00:04:38.900> so<00:04:39.230> because<00:04:39.260> there's<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.890> lot

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
don't think so because there's a lot

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.990 
don't think so because there's a lot
more<00:04:40.130> clever<00:04:40.580> people<00:04:40.820> out<00:04:41.150> there<00:04:41.390> than<00:04:41.630> me<00:04:43.000> but

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
if in one small way I get other people

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.370 
if in one small way I get other people
to<00:04:47.800> realize<00:04:48.800> that<00:04:49.390> collectively<00:04:50.390> we<00:04:50.540> all<00:04:51.020> can

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
to realize that collectively we all can

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.370 
to realize that collectively we all can
make<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.590> statement<00:04:51.980> about<00:04:52.280> how<00:04:53.120> powerful<00:04:53.780> just
