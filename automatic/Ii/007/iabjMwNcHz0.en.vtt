another<00:00:01.979> episode<00:00:02.129> of<00:00:02.460> running<00:00:03.120> technique<00:00:03.419> TV

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
another episode of running technique TV

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.690 
another episode of running technique TV
today<00:00:04.859> I'm<00:00:05.009> just<00:00:05.130> going<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.400> run<00:00:05.549> you<00:00:05.670> through

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
today I'm just going to run you through

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.720 
today I'm just going to run you through
some<00:00:06.000> basics<00:00:06.720> about<00:00:06.899> joint<00:00:07.379> movement<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.490> that

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
some basics about joint movement so that

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.730 
some basics about joint movement so that
we<00:00:08.849> can<00:00:09.000> all<00:00:09.150> understand<00:00:09.809> how<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.440> that

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
we can all understand how it is that

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.280 
we can all understand how it is that
running<00:00:10.980> technique<00:00:11.309> works<00:00:11.840> and<00:00:12.840> if<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.110> use

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
running technique works and if we use

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.990 
running technique works and if we use
some<00:00:13.530> consistent<00:00:14.130> language<00:00:14.250> around<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.820> it

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
some consistent language around that it

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.240 
some consistent language around that it
makes<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.330> much<00:00:15.450> easier<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.929> both<00:00:16.650> understand

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
makes it much easier to both understand

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.939 
makes it much easier to both understand
and<00:00:17.520> also<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.850> evaluate<00:00:18.650> people's<00:00:19.650> running

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
and also to evaluate people's running

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.800 
and also to evaluate people's running
technique<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.970> I'll<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.240> run<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.570> through<00:00:21.600> a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
technique so I'll just run you through a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.980 
technique so I'll just run you through a
little<00:00:21.900> bit<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.320> now<00:00:22.699> I<00:00:23.699> just<00:00:24.000> refer<00:00:24.960> to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
little bit of that now I just refer to

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.339 
little bit of that now I just refer to
my<00:00:25.230> trusty<00:00:25.740> little<00:00:25.769> running<00:00:26.519> man<00:00:26.699> here<00:00:27.349> I'll

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
my trusty little running man here I'll

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.230 
my trusty little running man here I'll
just<00:00:28.410> talk<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> little<00:00:29.010> bit<00:00:29.189> about<00:00:29.220> each<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.970> his

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
just talk a little bit about each of his

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.319 
just talk a little bit about each of his
major<00:00:30.539> joint<00:00:31.170> areas<00:00:31.500> involved<00:00:31.980> in<00:00:32.099> running<00:00:32.329> so

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
major joint areas involved in running so

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.400 
major joint areas involved in running so
I'm<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.600> talk<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> little<00:00:33.899> bit<00:00:34.020> about<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
I'm going to talk a little bit about the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.049 
I'm going to talk a little bit about the
hips<00:00:34.620> then<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:36.170> ankle<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.290> foot<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.059> also

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
hips then the ankle and foot and also

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.709 
hips then the ankle and foot and also
the<00:00:39.540> lower<00:00:39.780> back<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.760> hips<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.480> runner

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the lower back so the hips and runner

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.279 
the lower back so the hips and runner
they<00:00:43.500> move<00:00:43.890> from<00:00:44.640> flexion<00:00:46.820> to<00:00:47.820> extension<00:00:48.289> so

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
they move from flexion to extension so

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.860 
they move from flexion to extension so
we<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:49.710> his<00:00:49.920> front<00:00:50.280> leg<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.180> thigh<00:00:51.480> here

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
we can see his front leg and thigh here

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.610 
we can see his front leg and thigh here
that's<00:00:52.410> what's<00:00:52.710> called<00:00:53.010> hip<00:00:53.370> flexion<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:55.500> if

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
that's what's called hip flexion and if

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.680 
that's what's called hip flexion and if
we<00:00:55.739> look<00:00:55.920> at<00:00:56.010> his<00:00:56.129> back<00:00:56.370> leg<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:56.850> that's

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
we look at his back leg here that's

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.430 
we look at his back leg here that's
actually<00:00:58.430> extended<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.780> when<00:01:01.020> your

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
actually extended so when your

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.900 
actually extended so when your
physiotherapist<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.489> talking<00:01:02.850> about

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
physiotherapist is talking about

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.340 
physiotherapist is talking about
extension<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.899> flexion

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
extension and flexion

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.969 
extension and flexion
really<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.270> reinterpret<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.770> just

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
really you can reinterpret that is just

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.789 
really you can reinterpret that is just
being<00:01:08.270> bent<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.540> straight<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.470> probably

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
being bent and straight it's probably

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.520 
being bent and straight it's probably
the<00:01:10.860> easiest<00:01:10.890> way<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> remember<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:13.110> when

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
the easiest way to remember so when when

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.200 
the easiest way to remember so when when
the<00:01:13.619> joint<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.010> flexed<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.760> definitely<00:01:15.090> got

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the joint is flexed it's definitely got

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.690 
the joint is flexed it's definitely got
a<00:01:15.240> bend<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.900> keep<00:01:16.110> join<00:01:16.350> here<00:01:16.680> has<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
a bend in it so keep join here has a

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.620 
a bend in it so keep join here has a
bend<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.750> angle<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.409> when<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.770> straight<00:01:20.630> as

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
bend and angle and when it's straight as

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.289 
bend and angle and when it's straight as
we<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.950> following<00:01:23.670> leg<00:01:23.850> here

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
we can see on the the following leg here

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.530 
we can see on the the following leg here
it's<00:01:24.990> actually<00:01:25.409> extended<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:27.030> same<00:01:27.270> goes<00:01:27.509> for

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
it's actually extended so same goes for

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.870 
it's actually extended so same goes for
the<00:01:27.810> knee<00:01:27.960> joint<00:01:28.290> seeing<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.130> bent<00:01:29.340> flexed

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the knee joint seeing a bent flexed

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.149 
the knee joint seeing a bent flexed
position<00:01:30.259> here<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.409> well<00:01:32.000> if<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.240> changed<00:01:34.159> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
position here as well if I changed the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.030 
position here as well if I changed the
angle<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.880> his<00:01:36.000> knee<00:01:36.270> joint<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.750> little<00:01:37.040> just

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
angle of his knee joint a little just

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.260 
angle of his knee joint a little just
putting<00:01:38.479> out<00:01:39.479> there<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:40.110> would<00:01:40.560> say<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.759> that

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
putting out there I would say that that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.740 
putting out there I would say that that
knee<00:01:42.450> joint<00:01:42.659> then<00:01:43.079> was<00:01:43.560> now<00:01:44.450> extended<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
knee joint then was now extended and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.700 
knee joint then was now extended and
that's<00:01:45.930> something<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.560> definitely

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that's something that you definitely

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.660 
that's something that you definitely
don't<00:01:47.159> want<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.390> running<00:01:49.369> so<00:01:50.369> if<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.520> look

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
don't want to do in running so if I look

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.649 
don't want to do in running so if I look
now<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.899> ankle<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.710> foot<00:01:53.450> it's<00:01:54.450> where

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
now to the ankle and foot it's where

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.060 
now to the ankle and foot it's where
it's<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.930> little<00:01:55.049> bit<00:01:55.200> more<00:01:55.380> complicated

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
it's a little bit more complicated

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.950 
it's a little bit more complicated
because<00:01:56.159> people<00:01:56.640> talk<00:01:56.850> about<00:01:56.969> dorsiflexion

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
because people talk about dorsiflexion

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.670 
because people talk about dorsiflexion
and<00:01:58.320> plantarflexion<00:01:59.930> so<00:02:00.930> I'll<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.380> show<00:02:01.649> you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and plantarflexion so I'll just show you

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.149 
and plantarflexion so I'll just show you
how<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.920> looks<00:02:02.130> now<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.030> when<00:02:03.270> my<00:02:03.899> foot<00:02:04.200> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
how that looks now so when my foot and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.220 
how that looks now so when my foot and
ankle<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.640> dorsiflexion

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
ankle is in dorsiflexion

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.230 
ankle is in dorsiflexion
imagine<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:07.830> just<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.310> lower<00:02:08.790> leg<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
imagine that is just a lower leg and a

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.080 
imagine that is just a lower leg and a
foot<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.350> see<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.800> toes<00:02:11.090> are

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
foot there you can see that the toes are

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.700 
foot there you can see that the toes are
pointed<00:02:12.150> up<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.840> foots<00:02:13.050> pointed<00:02:13.410> up

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
pointed up and the foots pointed up

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.680 
pointed up and the foots pointed up
so<00:02:14.220> that's<00:02:14.430> Dorsey<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:17.060> if<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.150> actually<00:02:18.300> took

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
so that's Dorsey and if I actually took

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.530 
so that's Dorsey and if I actually took
this<00:02:18.900> guy<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.560> pointed<00:02:20.430> his<00:02:20.460> foot<00:02:20.910> down

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
this guy and pointed his foot down

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.060 
this guy and pointed his foot down
that<00:02:22.320> would<00:02:22.530> be<00:02:22.970> plantar<00:02:24.770> now<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.860> other

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
that would be plantar now the other

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.370 
that would be plantar now the other
important<00:02:26.640> area<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.120> running<00:02:27.480> which<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.720> often

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
important area in running which is often

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.330 
important area in running which is often
overlooked<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.460> lower<00:02:29.670> back<00:02:30.140> and

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
overlooked is the lower back and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.560 
overlooked is the lower back and
strangely<00:02:32.340> enough<00:02:32.460> that<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.060> we<00:02:33.420> also

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
strangely enough that that we also

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.600 
strangely enough that that we also
talked<00:02:33.870> about<00:02:33.900> flexion<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.800> extension<00:02:35.010> with

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
talked about flexion and extension with

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.460 
talked about flexion and extension with
the<00:02:35.730> lower<00:02:35.940> back<00:02:36.150> also<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.320> if<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.130> had

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
the lower back also so if I had

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
the lower back also so if I had
someone's<00:02:40.470> lower<00:02:40.830> back<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:42.740> I'm<00:02:43.740> sure<00:02:43.800> myself

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
someone's lower back and I'm sure myself

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.690 
someone's lower back and I'm sure myself
a<00:02:44.760> little<00:02:44.970> runner<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:46.620> his<00:02:46.980> back<00:02:47.250> was<00:02:47.280> like

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
a little runner and his back was like

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.250 
a little runner and his back was like
this<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.570> would<00:02:49.260> say<00:02:49.470> he's<00:02:49.710> back<00:02:49.980> it's<00:02:50.340> fixed

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
this I would say he's back it's fixed

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.590 
this I would say he's back it's fixed
but<00:02:52.260> if<00:02:52.530> he<00:02:52.710> was<00:02:52.860> upright<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.600> straightened

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
but if he was upright and straightened

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.810 
but if he was upright and straightened
as<00:02:55.230> our<00:02:55.440> little<00:02:55.680> running<00:02:55.890> man<00:02:56.040> years<00:02:56.340> that's

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
as our little running man years that's

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.140 
as our little running man years that's
actually<00:02:57.330> his<00:02:57.840> back<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.350> extended<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.820> that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
actually his back is extended so that

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.190 
actually his back is extended so that
just<00:03:00.480> gives<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.780> little<00:03:01.050> bit<00:03:01.170> of
