 Now I am expecting to see first hand the thickness 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:12.070
 This is too big. 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:16.570

 I just believe in my line with this. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.579

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.860
 And then I made this a little rough. 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.790
 That's the pizza that made it faster to speed up 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:05.370

 Then the side was plugged in. 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:41.810
 I'd rather plug it in to go, and then the color of the puzzle was red . 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:47.950

 If you turn on this, you have to spend a lot of space between them. 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:28.270
 The fur that was sprayed with the wrong stomach hid the attitude . 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.210
 But the college will not be able to see the laugh . 124 seaweed is going to do it. 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.540
 That's what I said. 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.540

 But I put it this way. 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:11.900
 This is where I have the opportunity to relax . 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:15.169
 Ppajyeoyo ppajyeoya wrong variety, so I'm going to continue to do so, 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:19.840
 This is a little bit like this. 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.840
 So, as you can see, 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.160

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:06.749
 So when I beat the betrayal, I did not have it and I did not have it. 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:17.220

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.980
 Job says this 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.390
