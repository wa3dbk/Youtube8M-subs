00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 We 'll do it for you today. 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.670
 see 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.320
 It's a very fast and well recipe mine. 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.190
 practice that I do so the normally 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.289
 with the study kobra that is the hollow flu 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.340
 carioca stage who does not know is kind a 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.710
 crepe and it is actually made with tapioca 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.390
 Only I'm going to do it my way. 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.210
 another another way also not 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.510
 need some of that that as 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.540
 tapioca flour because I do not know 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.059
 account and I do not think I did not 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.760
 so I'm going to make the video sour and it's 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.610
 very simple very fast and very easy already 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.460
 needs an egg a spoonful of water and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.829
 sour sprinkles actually and is made with 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.460
 12 but did not have 2 on the cruise and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.850
 for me it really pays to eat then how 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.370
 Who was going to do it? I'm going to pick it up. 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:05.480
 very generous of sour sprinkles or sings 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.480
 Here in the pot, I'm going to break a little egg. 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:25.549
 and a spoonful of fine brandy 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:33.039
 tablespoon of water already put here to 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:33.039
 hit well hit it up a little bit 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:47.060
 I just think it's starting as if it were 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.729
 make an electro 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.470
 I already knew my frying pan in the 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.520
 hour or anything she is already different 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:10.700
 So she needs to come and put looks and I go. 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:17.690
 to put here with wives just a little bit 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:20.829
 fire to burn not too high without the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.829
 get burned 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:40.550
 drying a hole is more like this 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:41.480
 that do not have I have no more pa 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.020
 mass right 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.840
 so you can see the ownership is going to stay 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:52.400
 but here it is very easy to go to 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.380
 Later it is green too. 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.630
 I will not do better these things 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.440
 which is very lacking when you come to 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.650
 get the place a little more here 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.650

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:21.560
 thing because it's actually a cheese 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:24.050
 normal military man is very skinny but it is 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.970
 What I have, I can not buy 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.940
 something else today asks you but it is 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.580
 more essential here is to show brand 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.130
 perfect for stuffing with various things 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.200
 You can make candy to make candy. 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.100
 better to use light sweet flour that 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.610
 brazilian people 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.190

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.180
 similar to that of LED very similar to the 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.140
 deserve 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.520

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.600
 They are hoping to here with it or because 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.010
 people get longer 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.320
 It is a bit more then that's it right 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.270
