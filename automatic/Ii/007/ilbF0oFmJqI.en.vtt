00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
that I drilled straight through and made

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.929 
that I drilled straight through and made
a<00:01:34.020> seat<00:01:34.380> when<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> can't<00:01:35.159> say<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
inside of the pipe and there's a hole

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
inside of the pipe and there's a hole
here<00:01:40.939> to<00:01:41.939> be<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.649> with<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> fuel<00:01:43.979> line<00:01:44.130> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
here to be like the with a fuel line of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.810 
here to be like the with a fuel line of
hook<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.640> to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.550 

alright<00:01:49.820> next<00:01:50.060> I'll<00:01:50.390> show<00:01:50.570> you<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.990> main

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
alright next I'll show you the main

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.630 
alright next I'll show you the main
flywheel<00:01:53.410> it's<00:01:54.410> a<00:01:55.450> an<00:01:56.450> inch<00:01:56.960> wide<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:57.800> 4

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
flywheel it's a an inch wide and 4

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.920 
flywheel it's a an inch wide and 4
inches<00:01:59.000> in<00:01:59.180> diameter<00:02:01.060> weighs<00:02:02.060> about<00:02:02.270> 2<00:02:02.630> pounds

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
inches in diameter weighs about 2 pounds

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.410 
inches in diameter weighs about 2 pounds
I<00:02:04.330> think<00:02:05.330> it's<00:02:05.450> what<00:02:05.870> like<00:02:05.990> two<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.320> half<00:02:06.500> I

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
I think it's what like two and a half I

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.970 
I think it's what like two and a half I
had<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:08.600> made<00:02:09.100> in<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:11.510> machine<00:02:12.380> shop<00:02:12.410> at<00:02:12.860> my

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
had this made in the machine shop at my

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.720 
had this made in the machine shop at my
school<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:14.050> know<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.290> had<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.100> friend<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.520> there

nice<00:02:20.810> it's<00:02:21.200> held<00:02:21.410> on<00:02:21.620> held<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.280> place<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.550> little

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
nice it's held on held in place a little

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.630 
nice it's held on held in place a little
set<00:02:23.090> screw<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.430> there<00:02:28.240> now<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:30.190> still<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.370> did

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
set screw and there now I still I did

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.140 
set screw and there now I still I did
keep<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.150> original<00:02:32.600> flywheel<00:02:33.080> on<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:34.150> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
keep the original flywheel on and the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.280 
keep the original flywheel on and the
magneto<00:02:35.770> that's<00:02:36.770> going<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.690> be<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.840> ignition

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
magneto that's going to be the ignition

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.730 
magneto that's going to be the ignition
source<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.860> was<00:02:40.760> originally<00:02:40.910> going<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.360> go<00:02:41.510> with

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
source I was originally going to go with

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.350 
source I was originally going to go with
automotive<00:02:42.740> coil<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.490> breaker<00:02:43.700> point<00:02:44.090> set

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
automotive coil and a breaker point set

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.150 
automotive coil and a breaker point set
up<00:02:44.620> but<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:45.740> would<00:02:45.830> have<00:02:45.860> been<00:02:45.980> too

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
up but that would have been too

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.030 
up but that would have been too
complicated<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:49.160> this<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.310> nice<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.760> simple

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
complicated so this is nice and simple

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.520 
complicated so this is nice and simple
now<00:02:52.040> it's<00:02:52.790> going<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.120> be<00:02:53.269> spark<00:02:53.989> controlled

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
now it's going to be spark controlled

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.330 
now it's going to be spark controlled
like<00:02:54.739> a<00:02:54.769> Maytag<00:02:55.900> not<00:02:56.900> valve<00:02:57.620> control<00:02:58.100> there's

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
like a Maytag not valve control there's

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
like a Maytag not valve control there's
no<00:02:58.459> vows<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:59.450> stroke<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:01.370> for<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.670> governor<00:03:02.150> I

no vows to stroke so for the governor I

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.000 
no vows to stroke so for the governor I
took<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:04.300> which<00:03:05.300> is<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.769> governor<00:03:06.769> from<00:03:06.800> a

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
note to come to engine then I mounted on

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.180 
note to come to engine then I mounted on
a<00:03:12.820> quarter<00:03:13.820> twenty<00:03:14.150> boat<00:03:15.010> falling<00:03:16.010> down

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
a quarter twenty boat falling down

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:24.580 
a quarter twenty boat falling down
everywhere<00:03:19.780> yeah<00:03:20.780> Twitter<00:03:21.140> 20<00:03:21.470> volt<00:03:23.470> then<00:03:24.470> is

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
everywhere yeah Twitter 20 volt then is

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:32.170 
everywhere yeah Twitter 20 volt then is

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.569 

that<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:33.140> going<00:03:33.349> to<00:03:33.409> go<00:03:33.590> on<00:03:33.799> this<00:03:33.950> gear<00:03:34.280> here

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
that is going to go on this gear here

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.380 
that is going to go on this gear here
which<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:34.939> from<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.329> paper<00:03:35.359> shredder<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:37.390> gear

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
which is from a paper shredder a gear

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.809 
which is from a paper shredder a gear
teeth<00:03:38.659> happen<00:03:39.109> to<00:03:39.230> be<00:03:39.379> almost<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:40.370> exact<00:03:40.790> same

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
teeth happen to be almost the exact same

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.099 
teeth happen to be almost the exact same
size<00:03:41.480> so<00:03:41.989> close<00:03:42.290> enough<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.890> work<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.810> it's

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
size so close enough to work and it's

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:49.390 
size so close enough to work and it's
going<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.349> be<00:03:45.439> mounted<00:03:45.590> like<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:48.219> so<00:03:49.219> the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
going to be mounted like that and so the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.589 
going to be mounted like that and so the
ignition<00:03:49.519> cut<00:03:50.450> out<00:03:51.430> i'll<00:03:52.430> use<00:03:52.730> a<00:03:52.760> small<00:03:53.209> limit

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
ignition cut out i'll use a small limit

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.300 
ignition cut out i'll use a small limit

there's<00:04:23.810> nothing<00:04:23.960> wouldn't<00:04:24.590> be<00:04:24.650> really<00:04:24.889> much

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
there's nothing wouldn't be really much

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.560 
there's nothing wouldn't be really much

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
engine you would just move the limits

from governor school its maximum must be
up<00:04:40.430> there<00:04:40.460> its<00:04:40.940> minimum<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.840> back<00:04:42.050> there

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.439 

shouldn't<00:04:46.340> have<00:04:46.460> any<00:04:46.639> real<00:04:46.880> problems<00:04:49.449> start

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
shouldn't have any real problems start

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.420 
shouldn't have any real problems start
it<00:04:50.630> I<00:04:50.810> probably<00:04:51.139> just<00:04:51.409> use<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.560> drill<00:04:51.889> start<00:04:52.280> it

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
it I probably just use a drill start it

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.159 
it I probably just use a drill start it
since<00:04:52.669> there's<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:52.940> nice<00:04:53.120> nut<00:04:53.449> right<00:04:53.690> there<00:04:53.720> to

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
since there's a nice nut right there to

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.399 
since there's a nice nut right there to
spin<00:04:54.470> it<00:04:54.500> with<00:04:55.570> there's<00:04:56.570> no<00:04:56.690> spark<00:04:56.990> plug<00:04:57.229> in<00:04:57.380> uh

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
spin it with there's no spark plug in uh

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:05.400 
spin it with there's no spark plug in uh
that's<00:04:57.710> why<00:04:57.860> it's<00:04:58.010> been<00:04:58.159> so<00:04:58.190> freely

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.810 

nothing<00:05:06.410> i<00:05:06.470> like<00:05:06.650> about<00:05:06.890> this<00:05:07.070> motor<00:05:07.370> has<00:05:07.610> it's

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
nothing i like about this motor has it's

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.080 
nothing i like about this motor has it's
got<00:05:08.440> two<00:05:09.440> piston<00:05:10.010> rings<00:05:12.250> well<00:05:13.250> I'll<00:05:13.640> see<00:05:13.940> that

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
got two piston rings well I'll see that

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.210 
got two piston rings well I'll see that
very<00:05:14.330> often<00:05:14.570> on<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.470> equipment<00:05:15.680> that<00:05:15.980> i<00:05:16.040> work

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
very often on the equipment that i work

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.670 
very often on the equipment that i work
on<00:05:16.430> usually<00:05:17.420> these<00:05:17.600> cheap<00:05:18.050> little<00:05:18.230> engines

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
on usually these cheap little engines

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.230 
on usually these cheap little engines
only<00:05:18.830> have<00:05:19.100> one<00:05:19.340> ring<00:05:20.590> but<00:05:21.590> i<00:05:21.890> was<00:05:22.640> pleased<00:05:23.030> to

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
only have one ring but i was pleased to

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
only have one ring but i was pleased to
find<00:05:23.510> when<00:05:23.810> i<00:05:23.890> took<00:05:24.890> it<00:05:24.950> apart<00:05:25.310> initially<00:05:26.260> that

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
find when i took it apart initially that

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.920 
find when i took it apart initially that
in<00:05:27.470> fact<00:05:27.770> you<00:05:28.460> can<00:05:28.670> see<00:05:28.880> that<00:05:28.910> probably<00:05:29.780> not

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
in fact you can see that probably not

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.360 
in fact you can see that probably not
it's<00:05:30.410> got<00:05:30.560> two<00:05:30.830> rings<00:05:31.160> on<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:33.830> fists<00:05:34.040> and<00:05:34.280> the

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
it's got two rings on the fists and the

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.310 
it's got two rings on the fists and the
Pistons<00:05:34.550> are<00:05:34.850> really<00:05:35.030> nice<00:05:35.180> shape<00:05:37.480> so<00:05:38.480> I'll

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
Pistons are really nice shape so I'll

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.680 
Pistons are really nice shape so I'll
get<00:05:39.590> a<00:05:39.650> video<00:05:40.010> of<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:40.490> running<00:05:40.730> sometime<00:05:41.150> when

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
get a video of it running sometime when

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.800 
get a video of it running sometime when
I<00:05:41.720> finish<00:05:42.110> it<00:05:43.960> that's<00:05:44.960> it<00:05:45.200> for<00:05:45.230> now<00:05:45.530> though
