think it's cool and yeah this was like
six<00:02:40.989> dollars<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:42.420> basically<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:44.200> had<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.160> get

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
six dollars so I basically I had to get

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.870 
six dollars so I basically I had to get
it<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.730> next<00:02:45.760> time<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.120> got<00:02:46.299> was<00:02:46.599> honestly<00:02:47.349> I
