separated the slug summoning and her

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.640 
separated the slug summoning and her
byakugan<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:25.140> that's<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.439> my<00:01:25.619> opinion

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
byakugan but that's just my opinion

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.100 
byakugan but that's just my opinion
anyway<00:01:26.280> maybe<00:01:26.729> they<00:01:26.909> tie<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.299> somehow<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:27.930> I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
anyway maybe they tie in somehow but I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.200 
anyway maybe they tie in somehow but I
forgot<00:01:28.619> anyway<00:01:29.100> at<00:01:29.250> least<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.700> good<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.030> see

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
forgot anyway at least it's good to see

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.690
