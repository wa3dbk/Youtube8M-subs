00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.920 
here for some reason he's gonna make
sure<00:01:29.969> that<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.149> Tesla's<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> way

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
sure that that Tesla's out of the way

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.969 
sure that that Tesla's out of the way
because<00:01:31.049> apparently<00:01:31.530> that's<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> most

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
because apparently that's the most

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.139

important<00:01:32.369> thing<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.640> base<00:01:32.790> right<00:01:33.000> now

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
important thing in the base right now

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.389 
important thing in the base right now
and<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> queen<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.710> gonna<00:01:34.890> almost<00:01:35.040> go<00:01:35.250> down

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399
