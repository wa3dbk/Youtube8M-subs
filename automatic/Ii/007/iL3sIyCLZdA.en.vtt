you'll<00:02:02.930> see<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.320> it's<00:02:03.530> really<00:02:03.830> wobbly<00:02:04.280> and

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
you'll see that it's really wobbly and

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.420 
you'll see that it's really wobbly and
almost<00:02:04.970> kind<00:02:05.240> of<00:02:05.300> an<00:02:05.420> exact<00:02:05.900> pattern<00:02:06.350> I'm<00:02:07.070> some

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
almost kind of an exact pattern I'm some

people<00:02:07.670> have<00:02:07.790> suggested<00:02:07.910> that<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:08.600> might<00:02:09.080> need

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
people have suggested that I might need

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.510 
people have suggested that I might need
to<00:02:09.350> just<00:02:09.530> work<00:02:09.710> on<00:02:09.860> developing<00:02:10.070> the

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
to just work on developing the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
stabilizer muscles to help me I guess

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.260 
stabilizer muscles to help me I guess
essentially<00:02:14.600> stabilize<00:02:15.140> my<00:02:15.440> bench<00:02:15.680> press<00:02:16.270> it

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
essentially stabilize my bench press it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.030 
essentially stabilize my bench press it
could<00:02:17.420> also<00:02:17.540> be<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:17.900> my<00:02:18.320> upper<00:02:18.500> body<00:02:18.680> is<00:02:18.890> just

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
could also be that my upper body is just

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.470 
could also be that my upper body is just
really<00:02:19.250> weak<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.790> that's<00:02:19.940> probably<00:02:20.390> a

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
really weak and that's probably a

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.080 
really weak and that's probably a
combination<00:02:20.930> code<00:02:21.790> still<00:02:22.790> going<00:02:23.030> through

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
combination code still going through
