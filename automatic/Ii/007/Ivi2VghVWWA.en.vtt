00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.639
 so reloe almost next episode of five 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.349
 do not minecraft video yet 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.580
 also aware this is again five 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.360
 things I picked out you now 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.699
 introduce quickly 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.840
 who still has ideas to send one 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.939
 You could not do things that you actually do 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.990
 white minecraft just by pn me here 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.920
 Send me in and if you are alright 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.480
 are they coming 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.800
 and you are also back to it as for 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.510
 the resourceful had to write now 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.929
 they the comments and then it goes well 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.969
 the first thing is brain 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.200
 games and he writes i know you do 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.940
 For a long time no fifth in minecraft 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.129
 videos more but I had it five files 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.200
 rausgesucht moment for a long time no 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.790
 more every wednesday comes a new one 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.960
 video of it once a week as often 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.230
 which ones do and five times those 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.090
 week 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.129
 that would be a bit that much anyway 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.800
 you can redstone on no consequence to the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.930
 above, even if you apply this edge 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.969
 edge does not place normal blocks 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.070
 Signal goes through and yes that's right 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.680
 glos it is an exception with respect to 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.789
 redstone line because with and can 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.949
 to do the following you can just 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.140
 crazy redstone stairs so build the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.820
 extremely cheap are what means cheap 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.680
 if only two trees easy 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.090
 save space compared to normal 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.770
 Of course it is not possible to lure because 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.990
 here the signals cut off big 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.270
 the only exception is the redstone 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.310
 knew about this transported up 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.680
 is a thing that I actually 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.270
 already aware of it not so im 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.530
 foreground is worth mentioning 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.869
 That's why I immediately joined in 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.020
 yes, it is also quite useful 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.840
 me and unfortunately the next thing 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.880
 is from hd marcel hd and he writes it 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.799
 have complicated terms I have 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.869
 Found out that when you put sand 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.390
 to a pillar and under it two or 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.009
 three blocks apart and there is a sand 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.659
 blog puts down one of the two 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.159
 replacement man a lot of sense but I believe 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.430
 I figured out what it meant 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.770
 and can that be so short 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.509
 demonstrating principle means the sand 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.860
 So you can torch on with sand 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.350
 drops or helped himself to drop 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.689
 yes , but you can also sand is sand 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.670
 So groups that sand each other 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.140
 drop, so to speak, and the whole thing will 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.880
 demonstrate in taiwan two games and 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.710
 several sand view in flight then continued 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.550
 they would destroy each other 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.620
 during the impact 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.270
 although not a hair step at all 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.930
 car was a torch or not 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.310
 recipe or other sand can be 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.290
 destroying each other while falling and falling off 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.090
 then run out the items I mean 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.380
 not very useful now, though 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.020
 kinda weird because 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.610
 Actually , here are not half blocks 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.470
 or any other entities that 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.450
 damage this in here but the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.730
 Falling sand itself provides practical 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.880
 for dropping himself 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.530
 somehow interesting the next one 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.060
 thing is little crazy lp 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.220
 sign up for creative mode 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.780
 an empty bucket with right click on 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.130
 the water makes the water go away 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.610
 But the bucket does not feel 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.110
 also have to be explained yes and that in the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.000
 Creative Motezuma can be handy 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.470
 infinite grow and that of the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.600
 Bucket full is exactly the other way around 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.340
 Of course you can also water 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.200
 place without the appropriate 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.640
 Something goes wrong somehow 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.800
 which is especially useful or 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.020
 pointless what seems to make sense 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.610
 because you assume creative mode 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.810
 that one need not sympathize things 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.030
 exactly over blocks set 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.740
 therefore, no one changes as well 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.480
 i say i know no metadata of 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.400
 a bucket or a rather 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.450
 generally when something comes in 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.540
 that means you can finally get out 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.950
 take is somehow for creative 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.090
 monologues black but otherwise never 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.980
 I do not know if it's deliberate 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.660
 I have to teach that once I fill 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.040
 have not tried that with the 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.610
 full time that jan delay has to 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.570
 but I do 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.220
 otherwise the next thing is from 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.900
 you can sign up for lightning play 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.570
 now breed big spruce 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.209
 the 1 4 x 4 actually twice 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.410
 twice 26 lingenfeld plants earlier 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.120
 This only went with young trees and 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.270
 want troops and now has 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.530
 with this tag also sap left but his 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.750
 The latest is also with the spring 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.130
 summer so set a tree will be 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.590
 accordingly so big and that something 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.670
 tinkering 4 x 4 meant probably second 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.410
 twice second place 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.690
 I have to go for a short time 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.300
 make it work i try it 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.340
 just here, that's enough free 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.500
 ways 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.200
 just give it a try and it will work 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.910
 So also huge fichtenbauer the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.709
 a weird looking fir tree 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.510
 Keep that looks that looks rather sooner 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.400
 after thann as the here but with 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.870
 a 4 x 4 drops that works too 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.140
 be made where they frankly yet 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.829
 Not 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.810
 I assumed that this only 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.090
 with the jungle trees or old here 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.990
 with the baroque sampling goes 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.129
 apparently it is also here now 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.759
 spruce grower can get a fir 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:33.180
 Breeding is not quite nice and the 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:36.509
 last thing for today is from x3 noppel 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.830
 x3 signs with f3 + b siekmann hit 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.289
 for hit box for every player mans 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.180
 broad yes that 's a thing that have 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.620
 I already have 100 times this 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.509
 I got sent but thought 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.360
 that is worth mentioning in the vig but 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.560
 apparently it's only forest for so 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.360
 many nicks seem to send in 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.800
 to be well known but there will be 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.509
 no one now beats with it 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.310
 took time off packs the 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.780
 What you do not know online 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.569
 but inevitably I have the business 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.190
 heard so often taken sorry if 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.199
 is not that famous 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.639
 from kurt f 3 and b and there you can the 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.990
 hit box form if that means where you are 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.969
 Something can happen here 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.159
 it's only so easy for me to get behind 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:14.610
 even if you beat it easily 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.810
 for example, they are not complete 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.539
 on the box beats but easier 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.279
 besides, of course, nothing happens because it can 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.620
 I have over yes yes I would 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.940
 already that the Switzerland where I but it 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.169
 not on directly on the hid prox how 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.879
 war that no harm which on 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.229
 the box incorrect cantus for example 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:29.819
 Now I have pig as well 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.099
 but still meet because there is still the 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.180
 hit box is and that's just that 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.279
 history box so you can 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.169
 practically with fcb the show 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.990
 leave now what is open 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.069
 player also my player the box 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.810
 the red that on the corresponding the 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.650
 eye level mag can spectator motor too 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.969
 in north rhine 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.520
 and then you get to this quickly 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.930
 Eye level then from there to see and at 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.440
 player as accordingly accordingly 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.849
 good is then just the eye level that 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:00.870
 probably the coordinate at f3 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:06:02.699
 because there is if you are here at 1 80 61 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.909
 48 or so is probably the 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.500
 eye level and next year lint 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.940
 Somewhere that was in old times 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.259
 you always see the eye level 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.370
 has probably got displayed 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.349
 is taken out now you can still see 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.419
 in any case diffuse coordinate 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:16.740
 probably synonymous with it 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.900
 otherwise yes I know what else 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.400
 but it could be nicer smaller 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.180
 shortcut if you want to know easy 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.409
 give it a try and then you see 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.750
 come through a bit quickly 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.979
 just because I'm a bit late too 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.719
 I'm the video right now 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.190
 finish and upload maybe 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.639
 another small bonus story for him 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.379
 also a 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.689
 But I was not given as a fact 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:39.569
 You could imagine the jazz 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:46.229
 session, that is the crate 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:49.680
 crate in isny crate where still one 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:52.219
 crate in it and adhere to the 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.240
 jazz session goes with the new one 

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:55.560
 I have metadata lonely things 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.749
 not really taken as a fact 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.460
 but the whole thing is just like that by the way 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:00.810
 and as a small eyecatcher 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.580
 otherwise see you next time 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.180
