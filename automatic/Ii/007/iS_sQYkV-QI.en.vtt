00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.240 
like any other game and don't change
anything<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:41.740> you<00:01:42.400> would<00:01:42.520> do<00:01:42.640> before<00:01:42.970> and<00:01:44.250> you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
anything you you would do before and you

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.010 
anything you you would do before and you
just<00:01:45.460> gotta<00:01:45.670> give<00:01:45.820> up<00:01:45.909> give<00:01:46.360> your<00:01:46.509> best<00:01:46.689> and

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
just gotta give up give your best and

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.420 
just gotta give up give your best and
see<00:01:47.229> what<00:01:47.320> happens<00:01:47.619> yeah<00:01:48.009> I<00:01:48.040> think<00:01:48.130> we<00:01:48.310> showed

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
see what happens yeah I think we showed

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.770 
see what happens yeah I think we showed
that<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.670> lot<00:01:48.790> of<00:01:48.820> character<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.329> last<00:01:49.479> game<00:01:49.689> we

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
that a lot of character the last game we

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.120 
that a lot of character the last game we
were<00:01:49.869> down<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.049> nothing<00:01:50.500> after<00:01:50.680> basically<00:01:50.920> two

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
were down to nothing after basically two

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.670 
were down to nothing after basically two
chefs<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.610> came<00:01:52.509> back<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:52.900> able<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.439> win<00:01:53.590> the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
chefs and came back and able to win the

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.050 
chefs and came back and able to win the
game<00:01:53.710> I<00:01:53.890> think<00:01:54.100> that<00:01:54.250> gives<00:01:54.759> a<00:01:54.820> lot<00:01:54.970> of

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
game I think that gives a lot of

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.910 
game I think that gives a lot of
confidence<00:01:55.329> the<00:01:55.900> Senators<00:01:56.290> are<00:01:56.439> not<00:01:56.590> buying

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
confidence the Senators are not buying

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.740 
confidence the Senators are not buying
into<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.310> theory<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:57.700> experience<00:01:58.420> relieves

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
into the theory that experience relieves

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.690 
into the theory that experience relieves
pressure<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.560> firmly<00:01:59.920> believed<00:02:00.399> they<00:02:00.549> can

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
pressure and firmly believed they can

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.530 
pressure and firmly believed they can
put<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.970> hammer<00:02:01.210> down

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
put the hammer down

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.420 
put the hammer down
