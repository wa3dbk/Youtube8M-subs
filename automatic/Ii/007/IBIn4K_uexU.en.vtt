launching a new home monitoring system I

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.050 
launching a new home monitoring system I
think<00:00:24.590> the<00:00:24.740> first<00:00:25.130> things<00:00:25.490> you<00:00:25.730> mentioned

about the product is that it actually
works<00:00:28.250> all<00:00:28.490> in<00:00:28.640> a<00:00:28.670> deck<00:00:28.910> technology<00:00:29.600> so<00:00:29.869> it's

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
works all in a deck technology so it's

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.170 
works all in a deck technology so it's
all<00:00:30.260> on<00:00:30.500> wireless<00:00:30.800> it's<00:00:31.580> completely
