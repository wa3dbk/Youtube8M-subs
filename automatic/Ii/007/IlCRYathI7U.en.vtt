00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.410
 Welcome to the center we have seen 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 our product range a little bit 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.580
 we have now extended one 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.950
 Properties with this hire, I have the 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.139
 possibility of oil pipe water pipe and 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.240
 Gasoline line itself to press 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.669
 similar to hydraulic press 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.439
 the same with the shop system 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.339
 Quality works very well and me 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.550
 I am very flexible 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.979
 we have different floors for it 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.380
 connections as well as various adapters 

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:32.230
 and of different threads 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.610
 other threads to come and offer 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.770
 I think a very high one 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.420
 flexibility to the course then too 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.230
 in our product range still quite 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.300
 expands 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.010
 There are rotatable connections which follow 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.830
 attachment of the hose still rotatable 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.330
 are and solid connections what the im 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.770
 individual means like the whole 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.660
 works like the whole thing together 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.810
 being set will now explain us in the end 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.950
 found the technology because now go 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.750
 hello my name is he long and not 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.800
 People like you from individual refugees 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.079
 completely redone 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.689
 We have the hoses in stainless steel 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.640
 or nylon we deliver these hoses 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.710
 sections in 30 centimeters and if 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.880
 that should not fit then cut 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.539
 Just pick something up and we'll do it 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.409
 for example with the new castle 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.969
 It is very important that we have the new ones 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.340
 stop with tape wrapped around it 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:24.460
 that does not fit just with tension 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:27.270
 Wrap a twice in the penalty area and 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.270
 then that should be enough 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.280
 with this in the hose that 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.360
 Law was that a 90 degrees 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.250
 this one consists of one 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.950
 at all mother screwing the four and 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.479
 the connection itself on this page 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.929
 Ever mother comes the hose then 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.950
 a crash to the profits and there turn 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.830
 then comes the connection turned in 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.879
 so that the whole thing is really tight 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.470
 Here you can see the calls very well 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:17.720
 or hose is squeezed with it 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.680
 the whole thing just solid and falls while 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.200
 the connection in the hose 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.459
 is pressed to open the cone to 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.870
 continue with it a little further 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.670
 the hose then through the cries 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.060
 The whole thing will be fixed correctly 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.060
 we do it once 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.890
 very important is that he struck up to 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.540
 end a shot 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.860
 very important is that the cone completely 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:05.360
 English is the oil with it 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:09.010
 right now we're looking at it 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.010
 Whole mother in the cabins 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.920
 choosing that is too heavy screw that 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.730
 all times just in one 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.360
 vise when to order the whole not 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.980
 to damage 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:33.560
 we save that with two wooden boards in the 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:34.970
 main floor one because of him then 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.890
 to the bulky goods simply with the appropriate 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.739
 tool as long turn to bottom out 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.090
 sitting here we use a 27 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.560
 Exclusions identical taped to it 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:49.580
 the whole thing not even more power and 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.840
 turn it all the way down to the bottom 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.840
 stuck on the connection 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.170
 that's how it looks when it's done 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.030
 here is the connection the over robots 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.440
 take care with the hose green 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.730
 that everything is very clear to us that it is 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.380
 really can not solve again 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.290
 and if you still have that with other side 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.790
 the offer can be made that way 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.130
 Our sleep is finished now 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.989
 important is that we have at least one 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.000
 rotatable connection have to make you look 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.080
 can still position as needed 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.470
 and the hose is not 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.700
 the toilet tv we turned a lot of fun today 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.700
 in the silver and until next time
