00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
cards but this one has a little twist to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.359 
cards but this one has a little twist to
it<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.880> makes<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.060> worthwhile<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:28.080> show<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
it that makes it worthwhile to show and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.680

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
and this is the Atari ST version so

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.780 
and this is the Atari ST version so
basically<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.790> computer<00:00:39.450> strip<00:00:39.870> poker

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
imagine there's a data disk because they

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.550 
imagine there's a data disk because they
sold<00:01:04.500> actually<00:01:05.430> extra<00:01:06.240> girls<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.900> different
