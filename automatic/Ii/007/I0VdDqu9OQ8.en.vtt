00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.180
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.520
 Today we bake croissants 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.090
 I took a measuring cup 300 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:46.739
 Milliliters of milk are then added 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:49.050
 crumble a cube of yeast into it 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:55.769
 In addition, two to three tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.370
 the whole thing now with a fork 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.050
 stir 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.070
 So that the yeast and the sugar something 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.399
 Can solve 500 grams of flour in one 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.490
 give mixing bowl 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:10.490
 and now add the yeast milk 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:24.260
 also a teaspoon of salt and 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.970
 the whole thing now for five to ten 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.320
 minutes with either one 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.330
 kitchen machine or hands 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.230
 neatly knead so that one 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.230
 supple dough arises 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.380
 cover the dough now and for 30 to 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.680
 Go at room temperature for 45 minutes 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.680
 to let 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:52.880
 then the dough again 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:56.770
 then knead a bow 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.570
 Take fresh-wrap 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.580
 cover the dough with it and for one 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:08.710
 hour in the refrigerator store a piece 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.710
 Place butter between the plastic wrap 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.290
 and then flat with a rolling pin 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.550
 roll out 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.560
 the mother should be around 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.710
 have room temperature then works on the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.710
 best 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.830
 then some flour on the worktop 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.250
 distribute the dough out of the fridge 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.250
 pick up 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:48.100
 the rolling pin is something and now the 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.100
 roll out dough 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:04.590
 that piece of butter in the middle of the dough 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:07.220
 Then place the race with something 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.220
 Brush in milk 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.370
 and the piece of butter in the dough, so to speak 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.370
 wrap up from all four sides 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.370
 skip 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.170
 and then 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.520
 roll out again 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.120
 now turn from one side and the 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.920
 beat the other side and the other side 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.110
 dough for ten to 15 minutes in the 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.700
 Store the fridge with the butter 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.420
 not too soft at the next 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.420
 roll out 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.080
 the dough now simply from the 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.540
 get the fridge and roll it out again 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.790
 the whole now at least two more 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.470
 do it three times and always the 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.470
 rest the refrigerator units 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:32.230
 just roll out and then two pages 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:34.090
 store in a refrigerator and store 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.120
 After two or three times we can 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:41.440
 start with a pizza cutter or 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.920
 knife small triangles from the dough too 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.920
 to cut 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.250
 the part is enough for about 20 pieces 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.900
 Now maybe take a triangle 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:31.460
 then dial in the worktop something 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.530
 Roll out the triangle a little bit again and 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:39.210
 then from the top up to the top 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:45.449
 roll the top press something to 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:52.680
 a croissant form and then 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:55.500
 put the croissants on a baking tray 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.949
 now about 20 minutes approximately 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.909
 then let go with egg yolk 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.909
 reap 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:17.010
 and in the preheated oven at 200 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:23.050
 Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:24.720
 so they should look like that then I wish 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.410
 have fun imitating 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.410
 Until next time 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.700
 st 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.940
 I am
