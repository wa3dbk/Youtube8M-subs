00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
want to talk about today is casting on

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.400 
want to talk about today is casting on
for<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> knitted<00:00:10.769> scarf<00:00:11.000> project<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.900> cast<00:00:13.139> on

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
for a knitted scarf project to cast on

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.170 
for a knitted scarf project to cast on
you<00:00:13.679> will<00:00:13.799> need<00:00:13.980> your<00:00:14.219> needles<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:15.049> your<00:00:16.049> yarn

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
you will need your needles and your yarn

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.939 
you will need your needles and your yarn
now<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.359> method<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.960> am<00:00:19.080> using<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.710> cast

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
now this method that I am using to cast

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.269 
now this method that I am using to cast
on<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.400> called<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.970> longtail<00:00:21.660> cast<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.859> it's

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
on is called a longtail cast on and it's

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.910 
on is called a longtail cast on and it's
probably<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:24.300> most<00:00:24.449> widely<00:00:24.720> used<00:00:25.019> cast<00:00:25.650> on

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
probably the most widely used cast on

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.169 
probably the most widely used cast on
for<00:00:26.220> knitted<00:00:26.519> projects<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.859> it's<00:00:29.179> probably

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
for knitted projects and it's probably

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.720 
for knitted projects and it's probably
the<00:00:30.269> fastest<00:00:30.779> way<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.019> cast<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.250> once<00:00:32.520> you

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
the fastest way to cast on and once you

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.810 
the fastest way to cast on and once you
kind<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.000> get<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.300> technique<00:00:33.719> down<00:00:34.820> it's

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
kind of get the technique down it's

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.090 
kind of get the technique down it's
really<00:00:35.969> quite<00:00:36.270> simple<00:00:36.680> so<00:00:37.680> you're<00:00:37.829> going<00:00:38.070> to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
really quite simple so you're going to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.940 
really quite simple so you're going to
start<00:00:38.430> out<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.610> your<00:00:38.940> yarn<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.950> when

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
start out with your yarn and when

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.010 
start out with your yarn and when
casting<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.700> you're<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.480> once<00:00:42.899> again

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
casting on you're going to once again

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.470 
casting on you're going to once again
have<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.440> long<00:00:43.800> tail<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.969> need<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.300> make

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
have a long tail and you need to make

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
have a long tail and you need to make
sure<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.200> start<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:46.770> with<00:00:46.829> your<00:00:47.250> tail

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
sure that you start out with your tail

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.700 
sure that you start out with your tail
long<00:00:48.030> enough<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.660> accommodate<00:00:48.960> all<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
long enough to accommodate all the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.069 
long enough to accommodate all the
stitches<00:00:50.129> you're<00:00:50.309> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.610> cast<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.449> good

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
stitches you're going to cast on a good

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.950 
stitches you're going to cast on a good
rule<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> thumb<00:00:52.500> would<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.120> one<00:00:54.120> inch<00:00:54.480> per

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
rule of thumb would be one inch per

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.380 
rule of thumb would be one inch per
stitch<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:56.219> casting<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.270> you're

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
stitch for casting on so if you're

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.569 
stitch for casting on so if you're
casting<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.899> 15<00:00:58.410> stitches<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.039> want<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> start

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
casting on 15 stitches you want to start

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.150 
casting on 15 stitches you want to start
with<00:00:59.730> about<00:01:00.030> 15<00:01:00.600> inches<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.590> always<00:01:01.770> cut

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
with about 15 inches you can always cut

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.429 
with about 15 inches you can always cut
off<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.579> extra<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.989> don't<00:01:04.170> allow

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
off the extra but if you don't allow

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.420 
off the extra but if you don't allow
enough<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.949> start<00:01:05.220> with

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
enough to start with

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.100 
enough to start with
you're<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.390> unravel<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.990> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
you're going to have to unravel it and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.770 
you're going to have to unravel it and
start<00:01:07.380> over<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:08.820> when<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.090> cast<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.600> you're

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
start over so when you cast on you're

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.960 
start over so when you cast on you're
going<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.110> start<00:01:10.470> with<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> slip<00:01:11.130> knot<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.790> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
going to start with a slip knot and a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.890 
going to start with a slip knot and a
slip<00:01:12.299> knot<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:13.920> twist<00:01:14.220> your<00:01:14.520> yarn

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
slip knot is you just twist your yarn

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.830 
slip knot is you just twist your yarn
like<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.700> grab<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.909> slower<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
like that and grab the slower one and

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.700 
like that and grab the slower one and
you're<00:01:19.049> creating<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.710> little<00:01:21.080> loop<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.409> you're

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
you're creating a little loop and you're

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
you're creating a little loop and you're
going<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> put<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:24.210> needle<00:01:24.450> and

going to put that on your needle and
you're<00:01:25.170> going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> tighten<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.009> bit<00:01:26.479> one

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
you're going to tighten it a bit one

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.200 
you're going to tighten it a bit one
thing<00:01:27.780> when<00:01:27.960> you're<00:01:28.140> casting<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.670> do

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
thing when you're casting on is you do

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.069 
thing when you're casting on is you do
not<00:01:30.420> want<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.460> cast<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.939> too<00:01:33.720> tightly

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
not want to cast on too tightly

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.190 
not want to cast on too tightly
otherwise<00:01:34.799> working<00:01:35.400> your<00:01:35.549> first<00:01:36.170> row<00:01:37.170> of

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
otherwise working your first row of

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.859 
otherwise working your first row of
stitches<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.070> difficult<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.150> could<00:01:39.720> end

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
stitches is difficult and you could end

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.230 
stitches is difficult and you could end
up<00:01:40.079> with<00:01:40.140> also<00:01:40.710> uneven<00:01:41.400> edges<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.000> don't

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
up with also uneven edges so you don't

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.130 
up with also uneven edges so you don't
want<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.450> cast<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.930> too<00:01:43.229> tightly<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.720> once<00:01:45.960> you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
want to cast on too tightly so once you

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.859 
want to cast on too tightly so once you
have<00:01:46.350> your<00:01:48.649> slip<00:01:49.649> knot<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:49.860> your<00:01:50.040> needle<00:01:50.430> you

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
have your slip knot on your needle you

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.780 
have your slip knot on your needle you
want<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.930> take<00:01:52.110> your<00:01:52.320> two<00:01:54.049> strings<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.320> yarn

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
want to take your two strings of yarn

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.590 
want to take your two strings of yarn
the<00:01:56.790> tail<00:01:57.090> one<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.719> go<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.600> you're

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the tail one can go here and you're

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.030 
the tail one can go here and you're
going<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.869> just<00:02:01.259> kind<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.590> create<00:02:03.920> like<00:02:04.920> a

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
going to just kind of create like a

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.510 
going to just kind of create like a
little<00:02:05.070> upside-down<00:02:06.920> or<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:07.950> mean<00:02:08.160> an<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.520> there

little upside-down or I mean an a there
your<00:02:10.610> first<00:02:10.880> step<00:02:11.240> is<00:02:11.540> your<00:02:11.900> hold<00:02:12.530> your<00:02:12.710> needle

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070
