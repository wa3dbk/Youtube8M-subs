you you can you can smell it poking

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.770 
you you can you can smell it poking
around<00:02:34.590> back<00:02:34.950> there<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.820> mostly<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.450> bourbon

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
around back there but mostly the bourbon

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.720

maybe about that much and that's just to
help<00:04:17.680> maybe<00:04:17.950> reduce<00:04:18.340> some<00:04:18.580> of<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:19.300> pinch

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
help maybe reduce some of the the pinch

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.840

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
know that I think that water really

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.820 
know that I think that water really
dramatically<00:04:28.150> changes<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:29.170> nose<00:04:29.380> except

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
dramatically changes the the nose except

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.110 
dramatically changes the the nose except
that<00:04:29.950> maybe<00:04:30.130> things<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.670> are<00:04:30.760> getting<00:04:30.970> lost
