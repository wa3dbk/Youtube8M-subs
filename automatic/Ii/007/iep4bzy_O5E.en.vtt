the helmet so sort of wobbles around on
your<00:01:48.240> head<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> bit<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> suppose<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.680> it's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
your head a bit but I suppose it's it's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.550 
your head a bit but I suppose it's it's
more<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.659> sort<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> costume<00:01:51.869> play<00:01:52.290> than

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
more for a sort of costume play than

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
more for a sort of costume play than
running<00:01:53.369> around<00:01:53.460> trying<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.909> defend<00:01:54.390> enemies

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
running around trying to defend enemies

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.270 
running around trying to defend enemies
of<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.930> galaxy<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.950> breathing<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> little

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
of the galaxy so breathing is a little

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.770 
of the galaxy so breathing is a little
bit<00:01:59.399> tricky<00:02:00.149> inside<00:02:00.420> they're<00:02:00.630> getting

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
bit tricky inside they're getting

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.749 
bit tricky inside they're getting
there's<00:02:00.899> no<00:02:01.049> holes<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.530> breathing<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.340> you

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
there's no holes for breathing so you

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.730 
there's no holes for breathing so you
sort<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.630> get<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.840> smell<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.290> vinyl<00:02:04.560> plastic

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
sort of get that smell of vinyl plastic

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.639 
sort of get that smell of vinyl plastic
I<00:02:05.009> suppose<00:02:05.250> it'll<00:02:05.490> never<00:02:05.670> go<00:02:05.850> away<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:06.360> you

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
I suppose it'll never go away if you

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.070 
I suppose it'll never go away if you
enjoy<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.849> and<00:02:08.849> you'll<00:02:09.060> you'll<00:02:09.450> appreciate<00:02:09.690> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
enjoy it and you'll you'll appreciate I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.640 
enjoy it and you'll you'll appreciate I
thought<00:02:10.319> there'd<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.530> holes<00:02:10.800> actually<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
thought there'd be holes actually in the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.800 
thought there'd be holes actually in the
the<00:02:13.160> plastic<00:02:13.550> there<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.730> might<00:02:13.910> put<00:02:14.150> some<00:02:14.660> in

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
the plastic there I might put some in

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.449 
the plastic there I might put some in
there<00:02:14.930> maybe<00:02:15.349> later<00:02:15.590> we'll<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:16.099> see<00:02:16.250> how<00:02:16.430> it

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
there maybe later we'll just see how it

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.080 
there maybe later we'll just see how it
goes<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:17.690> all<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:17.959> all<00:02:18.050> really<00:02:19.090> pretty

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
goes but all in all really pretty

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.550 
goes but all in all really pretty
impressed<00:02:20.480> with<00:02:20.599> this<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:20.840> does<00:02:20.989> fit<00:02:21.200> my<00:02:21.349> head

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
impressed with this it does fit my head

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.410 
impressed with this it does fit my head
and<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:21.739> got<00:02:21.890> what<00:02:22.250> I'd<00:02:22.370> say<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.670> was<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.849> model

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
and I got what I'd say it was a model

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.250 
and I got what I'd say it was a model
super<00:02:23.900> large<00:02:24.080> head<00:02:24.319> but<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.500> large<00:02:25.280> head<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.569> it

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
super large head but a large head so it

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.990 
super large head but a large head so it
would<00:02:27.500> fit<00:02:27.680> quite<00:02:28.069> happily<00:02:28.400> probably<00:02:28.819> anybody

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
would fit quite happily probably anybody

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.809 
would fit quite happily probably anybody
I<00:02:29.239> reckon<00:02:30.220> even<00:02:31.220> with<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.340> full<00:02:31.519> head<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.700> hair

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
I reckon even with a full head of hair

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.910 
I reckon even with a full head of hair
underneath<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.540> you'd<00:02:32.930> be<00:02:33.500> able<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.739> get<00:02:33.830> away

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
underneath it you'd be able to get away

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.970 
underneath it you'd be able to get away
with<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:34.540> anyway<00:02:35.650> thanks<00:02:36.650> for<00:02:36.680> having<00:02:36.950> a
