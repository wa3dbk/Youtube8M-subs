00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.129
 So everything is very new to São 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.900
 there is not really 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.760
 years of delay compared to what is 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.330
 happening on the Sunday river that is not 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.940
 proposing a change of culture in the city 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:53.180
 understand that the pedestrian has 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.699
 have priority over everything but the 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.460
 public transport services which

 after registration the bicycle is 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.160
 photographed each user can record 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.410
 how many bikes do you want to face? 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.409
 was actually a popular appeal of 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.090
 more than 22 thousand people asked for 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.490
 by a structure so that they could 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.680
 run your bikes here do 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.170
 integration with public transport is the 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.330
 first thing it took 24 hours we did not 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.940
 today we have a very high cost to 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.500
 that it works 24 hours in life already has 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.870
 a great demand from those people who 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.280
 work and they need to have a 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.270
 for a period of hours 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.270
 more extended 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:02:01.920
 6 8 7 5 and 6 1 on top of the main team 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:05.700
 do são paulo only number one is a delight 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 has rational and more and so super heavy 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.489
 I needed this one on the subway. 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.010
 all this is part of program 400 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.050
 kilometers of bike paths to the city 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.640
 of sao paulo to offer 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.430
 infrastructure 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.069
 people will start naturally I had 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.140
 with the Mayor of Brussels these days and 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.709
 I asked him who started the first 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.630
 is cycling or cycling 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.370
 He told me the cycle path because 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.260
 no one had the courage to use 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.519
 bicycle without safety 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.470
 then process offer the 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.349
 infrastructure and people naturally 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.360
 have appropriated public space to 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.730
 make a person understand this is difficult 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.170
 which hurts common sense if as well as 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.019
 next look bike path speak otherwise 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.250
 it is never the case in the first month of 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.549
 second month 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.010
 There you campaign and set the example. 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.420
 these changes are slower but are 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.420
 less slow 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.320
