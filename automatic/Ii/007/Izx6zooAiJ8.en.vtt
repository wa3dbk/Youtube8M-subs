problem<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.810> lot<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.080> guys<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.229> which<00:01:10.710> are

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
problem a lot of guys have which are

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.469 
problem a lot of guys have which are
you're<00:01:10.979> saying<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.670> lot<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.940> guys<00:01:12.150> rely

you're saying is that a lot of guys rely
on<00:01:12.630> bulking<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.440> cutting<00:01:13.800> and<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.610> works

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
on bulking and then cutting and it works

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
on bulking and then cutting and it works
once<00:01:15.240> or<00:01:15.420> twice<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:15.870> it's<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> long-term

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
principles but they're not personalized

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.319 
principles but they're not personalized
or<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.420> basically<00:01:33.799> generic<00:01:35.149> principles<00:01:36.149> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
or just basically generic principles and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.319 
or just basically generic principles and
then<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.990> third<00:01:37.229> problem<00:01:37.649> is<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.729> lot<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.119> guys

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
then the third problem is a lot of guys

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.149 
then the third problem is a lot of guys
are<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.869> not<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.320> wouldn't<00:01:40.710> say<00:01:40.890> bad

what would you say the solutions are do
those<00:01:59.340> three<00:01:59.520> big<00:01:59.789> mistakes<00:02:00.149> okay<00:02:00.960> okay<00:02:01.259> for

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320

those three big mistakes okay okay for
sure<00:02:01.619> man<00:02:01.799> no<00:02:01.979> problem<00:02:02.310> are<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.880> summed<00:02:03.179> all

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
sure man no problem are you summed all

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.380 
sure man no problem are you summed all
that<00:02:03.450> up<00:02:03.600> pretty<00:02:03.750> good<00:02:03.960> man<00:02:04.200> hit<00:02:04.859> a<00:02:04.890> wall<00:02:05.100> what

that up pretty good man hit a wall what
I'm<00:02:06.390> now<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.810> did<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.350> guess<00:02:08.160> when<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.340> comes<00:02:08.580> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
I'm now you did I guess when it comes to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
think everybody's probably wondering so

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.599 
think everybody's probably wondering so
why<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.650> then<00:03:32.859> if<00:03:33.010> that's<00:03:33.189> common

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
why is it then if that's common

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.520 
why is it then if that's common
knowledge<00:03:33.639> that<00:03:34.000> not<00:03:34.810> everybody<00:03:35.199> has<00:03:35.290> access

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
knowledge that not everybody has access

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.699 
knowledge that not everybody has access
to<00:03:35.980> that<00:03:36.099> and<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:37.510> truth<00:03:37.780> is<00:03:37.989> this<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.470> truth

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
to that and the truth is this the truth

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.349

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.689 
and your goals that's one thing but the
second<00:03:57.549> thing<00:03:57.699> is<00:03:57.849> it's<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.359> space<00:03:59.109> it's<00:03:59.379> not

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
second thing is it's a space it's not

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.159 
second thing is it's a space it's not
affordable<00:04:00.699> affordably<00:04:01.599> know<00:04:01.720> everybody

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
affordable affordably know everybody

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:03.689 
affordable affordably know everybody
notable<00:04:02.680> I've<00:04:03.069> been<00:04:03.190> doing<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.400> for<00:04:03.579> eight

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:03.699 
notable I've been doing this for eight

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:05.280 
notable I've been doing this for eight
years<00:04:03.909> and<00:04:04.060> this<00:04:04.209> is<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.449> first<00:04:04.720> time<00:04:04.930> I<00:04:04.989> went

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
years and this is the first time I went

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.319 
years and this is the first time I went
that<00:04:05.470> relic<00:04:05.919> so<00:04:06.129> it's<00:04:06.280> absolutely<00:04:06.849> I<00:04:07.000> think

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
that relic so it's absolutely I think

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.369 
that relic so it's absolutely I think
that's<00:04:07.479> probably<00:04:07.629> why<00:04:07.900> there's<00:04:08.109> such<00:04:08.229> a<00:04:08.260> big

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
that's probably why there's such a big

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.159 
that's probably why there's such a big
gap<00:04:08.739> there<00:04:09.340> is<00:04:09.519> what<00:04:09.819> people<00:04:09.970> know<00:04:10.329> we're<00:04:11.079> not

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
gap there is what people know we're not

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.780 
gap there is what people know we're not
presenting<00:04:11.769> anything<00:04:12.250> new<00:04:12.549> or

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
presenting anything new or

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.979 
presenting anything new or
groundbreaking<00:04:13.449> here<00:04:13.599> we're<00:04:13.780> basically

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
groundbreaking here we're basically

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.439 
groundbreaking here we're basically
saying<00:04:14.379> that<00:04:15.030> customized<00:04:16.030> solution

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
saying that customized solution

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.569 
saying that customized solution
obviously<00:04:16.599> is<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.440> best<00:04:17.620> route<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.979> go<00:04:18.010> but

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
obviously is the best route to go but

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.699 
obviously is the best route to go but
despite<00:04:19.570> people<00:04:19.900> knowing<00:04:20.169> that<00:04:20.349> there's<00:04:20.560> such

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709
