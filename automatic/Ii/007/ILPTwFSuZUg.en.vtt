00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.750 
once you try that rectangle you'll see
some<00:00:36.360> nodes<00:00:36.630> around<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.410> rectangle<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.399> we

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
some nodes around that rectangle and we

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.040 
some nodes around that rectangle and we

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.469 
just look at what I have one screen and
your<00:01:35.340> objects<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.299> your

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
your objects that you have in your

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.780 
your objects that you have in your
workspace<00:01:36.750> should<00:01:37.020> look<00:01:37.170> similar<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> so

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
workspace should look similar to that so

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.340 
workspace should look similar to that so
after<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.479> let's<00:01:39.930> go<00:01:40.079> ahead<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
after you do that let's go ahead and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.359 
after you do that let's go ahead and
make<00:01:40.439> sure<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.159> white

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
make sure that we have the white

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.609 
make sure that we have the white
rectangle<00:01:41.579> selected<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.990> go<00:01:43.170> back<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.500> our

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
rectangle selected and go back to our

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.280 
rectangle selected and go back to our
toolbar<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.579> select<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.540> transparency

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
toolbar and select the the transparency

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.520 
toolbar and select the the transparency
tool<00:01:46.759> you<00:01:47.759> hold<00:01:47.970> down<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> control<00:01:48.630> key<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
tool you hold down the control key and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.620 
tool you hold down the control key and
drag<00:01:49.860> downward<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.850> make<00:01:51.119> sure<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.390> there's

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
drag downward and make sure that there's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.300 
drag downward and make sure that there's
just<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.930> little<00:01:52.229> bit<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.619> fading<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
just a little bit of fading at the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.999 
just a little bit of fading at the
bottom<00:01:53.640> edge<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> white<00:01:54.329> rectangle<00:01:55.009> and

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
bottom edge of the white rectangle and

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.709 
bottom edge of the white rectangle and
I'm<00:01:56.250> gonna<00:01:56.430> select<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> selection<00:01:57.149> tool<00:01:57.299> and

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
I'm gonna select the selection tool and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.109 
I'm gonna select the selection tool and
I'm<00:01:58.290> gonna<00:01:58.439> resize<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.250> width<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.790> just

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
I'm gonna resize the width of this just

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.730 
I'm gonna resize the width of this just
a<00:02:00.270> little<00:02:00.390> bit<00:02:00.570> because<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.350> seems<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> little

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
a little bit because it seems a little

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.370 
a little bit because it seems a little
bit<00:02:02.009> off<00:02:02.040> for<00:02:02.759> me<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.110> should<00:02:04.140> have

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
bit off for me but you should have

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.600 
bit off for me but you should have
something<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.189> your<00:02:05.310> workspace

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
something like that in your workspace

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.700 
something like that in your workspace
and<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.600> should<00:02:06.750> start<00:02:06.960> looking<00:02:07.320> like<00:02:07.350> it's

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
and it should start looking like it's

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.330 
and it should start looking like it's
actually<00:02:08.220> reflecting<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.739> shell<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:11.069> type

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
actually reflecting on a shell like type

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.820 
actually reflecting on a shell like type
of

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
of

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.520

in other words a glossy button so once

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.290 
in other words a glossy button so once
you<00:02:14.650> have<00:02:14.770> that<00:02:15.040> let's<00:02:15.280> go<00:02:15.430> ahead<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:15.970> click

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
the back of all those objects and then

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.760 
the back of all those objects and then
we're<00:02:40.720> gonna<00:02:40.840> go<00:02:41.050> ahead<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.410> go<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.530> the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
we're gonna go ahead and go to the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.100 
we're gonna go ahead and go to the
feathering<00:02:42.160> tool<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:43.360> we're<00:02:43.600> going<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.810> give

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
feathering tool and we're going to give

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.470 
feathering tool and we're going to give
this<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.290> slight<00:02:44.680> feathery<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:46.030> make<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.300> look

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
this a slight feathery to make it look

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.060 
this a slight feathery to make it look
similar<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.080> objects<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.590> we<00:02:47.770> have<00:02:47.800> at

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
similar to the objects that we have at

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.010 
similar to the objects that we have at
the<00:02:48.160> top<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:49.210> so<00:02:49.360> now<00:02:49.540> we<00:02:49.600> have<00:02:49.810> something

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
the top and so now we have something

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.960 
the top and so now we have something
that's<00:02:50.290> almost<00:02:50.470> complete<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.550> last<00:02:51.760> thing

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
that's almost complete the last thing

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.460 
that's almost complete the last thing
that<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.209> want<00:02:52.240> to<00:02:52.450> do<00:02:52.600> is<00:02:52.780> just<00:02:52.959> go<00:02:53.140> ahead<00:02:53.320> and

that you want to do is just go ahead and

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.100 
that you want to do is just go ahead and
select<00:02:53.620> your<00:02:53.860> text<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:55.390> let's<00:02:55.630> go<00:02:55.780> ahead<00:02:55.870> and
