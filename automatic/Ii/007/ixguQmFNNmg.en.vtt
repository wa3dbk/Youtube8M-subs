little<00:01:08.200> diversions<00:01:08.740> that<00:01:08.979> were<00:01:09.600> put<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:10.690> there

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
little diversions that were put in there

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.590 
little diversions that were put in there
to<00:01:10.960> irrigate<00:01:11.380> small<00:01:12.190> parcels<00:01:12.759> of<00:01:12.850> land<00:01:12.880> for

to irrigate small parcels of land for

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.719 
to irrigate small parcels of land for
agricultural<00:01:14.170> production<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:15.190> we<00:01:15.310> need<00:01:15.520> to

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
agricultural production so we need to

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.670 
agricultural production so we need to
make<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.420> so<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.720> fish<00:01:16.899> can<00:01:16.930> get<00:01:17.200> past<00:01:17.470> these

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
make it so the fish can get past these

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.950 
make it so the fish can get past these
mountains<00:01:18.159> barriers

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.260

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.090 
sill downstream of that so there was a
lot<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.299> scour<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.109> erosion<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.799> created

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
lot of scour and erosion and it created

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.949 
lot of scour and erosion and it created
a<00:02:33.310> vertical<00:02:33.670> jump<00:02:33.819> barrier<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.480> fish<00:02:34.660> weren't

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
a vertical jump barrier and fish weren't

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.470 
a vertical jump barrier and fish weren't
able<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.470> get<00:02:35.680> upstream<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.310> downstream<00:02:36.480> so

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
able to get upstream and downstream so

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.670 
able to get upstream and downstream so
this<00:02:37.630> will<00:02:37.780> keep<00:02:37.900> fish<00:02:38.139> in<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.410> stream<00:02:38.650> and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
this will keep fish in the stream and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.590 
this will keep fish in the stream and
allow<00:02:39.040> them<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.250> pass<00:02:39.489> freely<00:02:39.850> up<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.239> down<00:02:40.359> as

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
allow them to pass freely up and down as

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.569 
allow them to pass freely up and down as
