I<00:02:38.970> guess<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.390> smoke<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.880> essentially<00:02:41.880> these

are e-cigarettes in terms of a study or

are e-cigarettes in terms of a study or
report<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:45.420> yeah<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.690> mean<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.080> you've

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
report on it yeah I mean you you've

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.290 
report on it yeah I mean you you've
eight<00:02:46.620> photos<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.130> they<00:02:47.190> both<00:02:47.370> produce<00:02:47.640> vapor

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
eight photos and they both produce vapor

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.540 
eight photos and they both produce vapor
they<00:02:48.510> both<00:02:48.750> heat<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.350> liquid<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.070> produce<00:02:50.430> a

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
they both heat a liquid and produce a

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.400 
they both heat a liquid and produce a
vapor<00:02:50.760> they<00:02:51.330> might<00:02:51.540> be<00:02:51.690> quite<00:02:51.900> different<00:02:52.140> in

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
vapor they might be quite different in

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.930 
vapor they might be quite different in
terms<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.740> their<00:02:52.920> experience<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
terms of their experience and the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.000 
terms of their experience and the
quality<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.510> how<00:02:54.630> they<00:02:54.750> deliver<00:02:54.900> nicotine<00:02:55.200> but

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
quality of how they deliver nicotine but

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.040 
quality of how they deliver nicotine but
fundamentally<00:02:56.730> they<00:02:57.000> are<00:02:57.180> similar

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
fundamentally they are similar

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.020 
fundamentally they are similar
I<00:02:58.170> suppose<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.710> compared<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.070> tobacco<00:02:59.370> okay<00:02:59.970> so

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
I suppose it compared to tobacco okay so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.970 
I suppose it compared to tobacco okay so
both<00:03:00.300> good<00:03:00.600> news<00:03:00.870> items<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.620> regard

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
both good news items in that regard

you<00:03:08.670> must<00:03:08.850> be<00:03:08.970> pretty<00:03:09.360> encouraged<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.740> is

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
you must be pretty encouraged this is

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.590 
you must be pretty encouraged this is
actually<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.340> most<00:03:11.490> comprehensive<00:03:11.910> report

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
actually the most comprehensive report

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.000 
actually the most comprehensive report
that's<00:03:12.780> been<00:03:12.900> published<00:03:13.320> anywhere<00:03:13.740> in<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
that's been published anywhere in the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.530 
that's been published anywhere in the
world<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.460> far<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.880> brings<00:03:15.090> together<00:03:15.300> all

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
world so far so it brings together all

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.180 
world so far so it brings together all
the<00:03:15.810> current<00:03:16.140> evidence<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.650> think<00:03:16.890> we<00:03:16.980> can

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
the current evidence and I think we can

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.370 
the current evidence and I think we can
be<00:03:17.280> really<00:03:17.580> confident<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.930> comes<00:03:19.170> to

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
be really confident that it comes to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.800 
be really confident that it comes to
some<00:03:19.590> realistic<00:03:20.010> conclusions<00:03:20.790> not<00:03:21.420> just<00:03:21.660> for

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
some realistic conclusions not just for

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.660 
some realistic conclusions not just for
the<00:03:21.870> UK<00:03:22.230> actually<00:03:22.440> but<00:03:22.800> for<00:03:23.010> countries<00:03:23.430> across

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670

the UK actually but for countries across
the<00:03:23.820> world<00:03:24.030> about<00:03:24.450> how<00:03:24.600> they<00:03:24.780> should<00:03:24.840> deal

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
the world about how they should deal

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.810 
the world about how they should deal
with<00:03:25.230> this<00:03:25.710> what's<00:03:26.340> been<00:03:26.520> called<00:03:26.700> a

with this what's been called a

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.910 
with this what's been called a
disruptive<00:03:27.450> technology<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.440> electronic

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
disruptive technology of the electronic

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.180 
disruptive technology of the electronic
cigarette<00:03:29.340> were<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.330> astounded<00:03:31.260> by<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.560> the

cigarette were you astounded by the the

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
findings or did you expect it 95 percent

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.360 
findings or did you expect it 95 percent
less<00:03:35.610> damaging<00:03:36.180> than<00:03:36.240> smoking<00:03:37.250> well<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.310> think

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
less damaging than smoking well I think

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.430 
less damaging than smoking well I think
the<00:03:38.610> devices<00:03:39.120> have<00:03:39.240> evolved<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:39.930> think<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.260> key

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
the devices have evolved I think the key

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.260 
the devices have evolved I think the key

kind<00:05:17.520> of<00:05:17.639> popularity<00:05:18.240> of<00:05:18.270> any<00:05:18.629> other<00:05:18.840> stop

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
kind of popularity of any other stop

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.839 
kind of popularity of any other stop
smoking<00:05:19.529> aid<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:19.979> I'm<00:05:20.189> sure<00:05:20.400> actually<00:05:20.610> the

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
smoking aid and I'm sure actually the

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.640 
smoking aid and I'm sure actually the
marketing<00:05:21.300> has<00:05:21.419> something<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:21.900> do<00:05:22.169> with<00:05:22.199> that

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
marketing has something to do with that

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.080 
marketing has something to do with that
so<00:05:22.919> I<00:05:22.949> think<00:05:23.099> we<00:05:23.310> need<00:05:23.460> some<00:05:23.669> marketing

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
so I think we need some marketing

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.939 
so I think we need some marketing
particularly<00:05:24.479> the<00:05:24.569> point-of-sale<00:05:24.930> but<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:25.740> am

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
particularly the point-of-sale but I am

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.570 
particularly the point-of-sale but I am
concerned<00:05:26.460> about<00:05:26.639> some<00:05:27.090> of<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.900> really

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
concerned about some of the the really

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.040 
concerned about some of the the really
creative<00:05:29.580> marketing<00:05:30.240> that<00:05:30.389> might<00:05:30.629> appeal<00:05:31.020> to

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
creative marketing that might appeal to

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.260 
creative marketing that might appeal to
children<00:05:31.229> so<00:05:31.800> I<00:05:31.830> think<00:05:32.089> governments<00:05:33.089> across

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
children so I think governments across

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.879 
children so I think governments across
the<00:05:33.389> UK<00:05:33.839> now<00:05:34.020> are<00:05:34.169> looking<00:05:34.440> at<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.680> right

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
the UK now are looking at the right

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.950 
the UK now are looking at the right
balance<00:05:35.159> of<00:05:35.460> regulation<00:05:36.180> and<00:05:36.360> promotion<00:05:36.870> of

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
balance of regulation and promotion of

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.079 
balance of regulation and promotion of
these<00:05:37.080> products<00:05:37.529> right<00:05:37.650> let<00:05:38.069> me<00:05:38.190> pick<00:05:38.849> up<00:05:38.969> on

these products right let me pick up on

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.550 
these products right let me pick up on

of these you can have custard flavor you

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.570 
of these you can have custard flavor you
can<00:05:46.229> have<00:05:46.409> sweet<00:05:46.740> flavors<00:05:47.069> I<00:05:47.190> mean<00:05:47.430> that

sounds<00:05:48.240> a<00:05:48.330> little<00:05:48.449> bit<00:05:48.750> close<00:05:49.199> to<00:05:49.469> Alko<00:05:49.830> pop

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
sounds a little bit close to Alko pop

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:52.579 
sounds a little bit close to Alko pop
sort<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.550> thinking<00:05:51.029> it<00:05:51.509> could<00:05:51.960> appeal<00:05:52.349> to

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:52.589 
sort of thinking it could appeal to

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:54.829 
sort of thinking it could appeal to
youngsters<00:05:53.069> directly<00:05:53.849> so<00:05:54.210> the<00:05:54.330> flavors<00:05:54.719> are

00:05:54.829 --> 00:05:54.839 
youngsters directly so the flavors are

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:57.290 
youngsters directly so the flavors are
really<00:05:54.870> interesting<00:05:55.560> and<00:05:55.819> and<00:05:56.819> there's<00:05:57.240> a

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
really interesting and and there's a

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.089 
really interesting and and there's a
hypothesis<00:05:58.110> that<00:05:58.139> the<00:05:58.379> flavors<00:05:58.770> will<00:05:58.949> be

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
hypothesis that the flavors will be

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:00.740 
hypothesis that the flavors will be
appealing<00:05:59.430> to<00:05:59.639> young<00:05:59.759> people<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:00.479> I<00:06:00.569> think

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
appealing to young people and I think

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.089 
appealing to young people and I think
some<00:06:00.900> of<00:06:00.930> the<00:06:01.050> research<00:06:01.379> suggests<00:06:01.589> that<00:06:01.919> some

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
some of the research suggests that some

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:03.379 
some of the research suggests that some
of<00:06:02.189> the<00:06:02.279> flavors<00:06:02.610> might<00:06:02.789> be<00:06:02.939> more<00:06:03.089> appealing

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
of the flavors might be more appealing

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.450 
of the flavors might be more appealing
to<00:06:03.599> young<00:06:03.750> people<00:06:04.110> than<00:06:04.650> others<00:06:04.770> but<00:06:05.339> we've

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
to young people than others but we've

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.010 
to young people than others but we've
also<00:06:05.610> got<00:06:05.879> to<00:06:05.969> remember<00:06:06.060> that<00:06:06.330> their<00:06:06.569> flavors

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.559

are<00:06:07.169> playing<00:06:07.379> part<00:06:07.770> of<00:06:08.009> the<00:06:08.250> of<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.909> the<00:06:09.240> story

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
are playing part of the of the the story

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.209

about<00:06:09.810> why<00:06:10.110> these<00:06:10.169> products<00:06:10.680> are<00:06:10.800> appealing

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
about why these products are appealing
