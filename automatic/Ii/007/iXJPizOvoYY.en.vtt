 Good day, dear viewers 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.750

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.910
 and today tell you about this deck 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.619
 cards like feet but before i start 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.750
 I would like to talk about it 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.510
 our sponsor and the sponsor is like 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.780

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.760

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.309
 look look well and we continue and 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.160
 so could that what a deck why am I 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.670
 I just wanted to take and review it 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.670
 in fact it is a deck of minimalism such 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.149
 solid sk driving just as you see 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.020
 on the box there is essentially nothing to eat here 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.140
 inscription 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.969
 legs about what is minimalism the authors themselves 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.320
 say minimal play cards 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.830
 and everyone on the downside has a few 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.080
 inscriptions on where it is produced and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.729
 you won't see anything else on it 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.670
 focus does not need to be adjusted because 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:23.020
 as a matter of fact, no inscriptions 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:27.280
 open the box and we have here on the tongue 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.070
 such a little expression was that 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.930
 that simple thoughts inspire confidence well yes 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.079
 not bad because it's like 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.540
 advertise the cards themselves they too 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.470
 very, very simple, as you can see box 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.570
 from the inside 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.200
 red because i have red 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.820
 legs but it will vary in 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.369
 whichever color you them 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.860
 buy because there are blue and red and 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.140
 yellow green and purple and now 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.479
 and blue color that generally very happy 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.560
 everyone told me unfortunately not them 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.329
 buy in blue design from me bye 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.979
 that only one such deck is natural 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.380
 I will order to me what is very 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.950
 liked these cards especially all that 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.880
 they are hidden 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.340
 as you can see shirt shirt absolutely 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.370
 simple nothing so remarkable in 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.959
 there is no red just a new thing 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.140
 red you will probably have some other 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.530
 if you buy what we have inside us 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.569
 inside them customized 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.689
 customized peak ace 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.519
 here you will see minimal playing cards 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.609
 inscription 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:35.129
 peak ace all all end i mean here 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:39.180
 in this way have reklamka reklamka 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.689
 us house playing cards house of playing 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.719
 cards 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.879
 he is connected with the blue crown 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:49.200
 so the quality is naturally very very 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.669
 good will we have it reklamka in 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.549
 Basically, it can be left in the deck 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:56.579
 because she doesn't stand out and 2 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.370
 The joker looks like this 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.919
 us joker and in the form of stars is also pretty 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.739
 cool low-key video will be fine 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:07.290
 it seems to me all the rest 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.049
 cards are absolutely normal except for 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.209
 customization of colors that is here for example 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.919
 I didn't like it at first 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.139
 it seemed that Nikita was not very 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:18.449
 quality is actually very cool 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.540
 It looks like you understand it in time. 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:24.510
 as it's a good deck perfect 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.939
 worked out details i.e. they are color 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.370
 beat very well the whole thing 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.699
 Essentially this deck is very, very very 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.150
 like the index as you can see the standard 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:40.259
 cover coverage of these cards we have 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.919
 cover cover we have magic finish well 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:46.650
 naturally at the base of the bush they 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:47.909
 are printed here in this way fine 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.310
 suitable for cardistry 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.560
 but we immediately want to note that they 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.409
 Great for tricks 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.239
 there are not just cards for something 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.329
 the only thing is literally 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.739
 universal cards for everything 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.109
 why are they suitable for tricks you 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.299
 You can ask me everything is very simple 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.669
 they have at least two 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.829
 small little small but very good 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.290
