00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.540
 And then it goes well that the paladin by 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.290
 You give the game a quiet game and that's it. 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.059
 same 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.460
 I'm bringing a current game here today. 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.650
 to do an analysis and why you 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.279
 You must be wondering and I answer. 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.900
 because daemon is nostalgia to the series 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.670
 guys, if you 're watching this 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.119
 video now has more or less mine 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.689
 age between six to 17 and 23 years or more 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.030
 any less 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.579
 It sure marked a lot of your hand. 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.340
 childhood I remember that fight they had 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.860
 among the best will be pokémon the cert 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.710
 shimon because it was too much 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.840
 The delay because of this is not because my 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.520
 better because of that although always 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.219
 I have this, I believe that most 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.379
 had both of them explode together in the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.510
 past digimon globe had that 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.879
 crazy opening with angelica singing 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.710
 I seriously remember that on record 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.859
 passed because mon in eliana program 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.820
 Remember that little guy I play there 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.949
 good times 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.820
 although he always had a preference for 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.830
 Pokémon 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.140
 I think with regard to promotions in 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.670
 time for sure the image of the pokémon 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.159
 was much more used by industry 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.890
 because your digimon is even acceptable 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.810
 think about it today, since observing well 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.750
 the pikachu image draws much more 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.090
 children's attention because it is yellow 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.350
 cute face and that a monte album is a 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.450
 dinosaur né 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.400
 if you did not live that, say it is 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.159
 more or less the fever that is up 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.750
 saving on 10 today more or less 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.850
 I can not say that at that time it was 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.369
 because she was involved was not 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.770
 child and behind everything that has received this 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.540
 name of daemon then with 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.970
 I'm sure I'll say that I had much more 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.850
 thing at that time than today I just 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.640
 I hear even good enough to let us chat 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.200
 analysis of the game digimon austral hubble 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.479
 is a developed arena fighting game 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.390
 by the own published by bandai namco 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.200
 games for playstation 3 and xbox 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.549
 360 in November of this year 2014 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.590
 For those who do not understand what I wanted 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.290
 say with arena fighting and did not play 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.369
 games predecessors those hubble rudder 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.630
 after john 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.630
 let's say this game 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.130
 very similar to smash bros of nintendo 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.830
 where you have to keep pounding on your 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.680
 Enemies have many explosions on the screen 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.420
 scores for each combo anyway you 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.550
 can check in the background to understand 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.440
 better the story of the game is very simple 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.570
 you first have to choose who you 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.110
 will start play will be available 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.030
 the douro long the xote mon the gabo good and the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.220
 Good lake that was what I chose 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.520
 although I find vital mon boy very much 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.270
 cooler than brother water but they appeal 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.710
 is the main character serve with baby 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.900
 beauty and when your character 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.060
 The game starts and the initial idea is 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.920
 live tournament where you should go 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.560
 passing the peace and winning the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.110
 simple competitors phases work 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.630
 so some random battles with the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.460
 showed logs that you must win 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.320
 without great difficulty 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.020
 and in the end you face the say 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.510
 boss who is just the helm you 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.390
 will unlock by earning the days of 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.850
 hands boss puts unlockables are peep 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.890
 mon has one tone rode the mon and mon the ob 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.590
 phases are very simple there is no break 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.500
 heads and just go ahead killing a 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.110
 enemy rounds advance more kill 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.660
 one more round and then will face the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.300
 last digimon won goes to the next 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.090
 stage and does it all again to remind you that 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.610
 each of an enemy you face from 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.100
 that occur without being the boss 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.500
 there is a certain standard for you to follow 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.690
 for example has an enemy that if you 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.630
 to get near him he hits with a stick in 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.880
 you and it's just you to avoid hitting three 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.430
 times with some attack repeating this 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.290
 five times you defeat another 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.060
 thing I said three times because 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.670
 usually when you give the room 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.730
 attack time to turn and hit 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.920
 and that's just for some the most 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.500
 are foolish enemies who with one or two 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.300
 attacks or whether they are eliminated are several types 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.530
 of phase but to be easy 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.940
 understanding here 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.160
 let's say you have the phases that you 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.320
 need to win the other has the phases that 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.900
 have a three-minute countdown 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.359
 which in the case is only to accumulate more points 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.040
 the only different phase of that kind is caught 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.329
 the flag you have to finish the 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.870
 stage with the flag 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.090
 in the game you jump defend and attack and it is 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.310
 Of course completing the special barbie you 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.229
 can also develop for those who never 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.780
 assisted digimon have developed a 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.550
 stage and with the older brother 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.889
 stronger for some time 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.830
 another thing to boxes in the scenario that you 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.990
 can break and come to life or letters 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.650
 had a temporary benefit in each 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.689
 fight 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.210
 completing all the phases you take a 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.129
 serious cold water bath let's talk about that 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.680
 this tournament only served to know who 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.569
 was the strongest to save the clearing 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.289
 of a brother there who was infected by a 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.780
 virus 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.750
 this last phase is like a slap in the face 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.590
 Serious is a kind of breed chow was 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.259
 easy not 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.930
 I want to see you overcome these guys they 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.789
 the peace of enemies and are not the 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.069
 silly types that appear in the first 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.139
 stages of the game so great that you 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.690
 you need a lot of patience to stay 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.629
 says piano and hitting them who 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.860
 now have little to do with the patterns 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:22.830
 ending with the enemies reach the 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.270
 boss who is the least of timon too 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.029
 great that at first you will stay 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.310
 scared to face but later 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:31.440
 fell a little relieved to know that 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.330
 you will fight with your developed brother 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.550
 in my case I fought with marilyn monroe 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.159
 this final battle for more incredible than 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.349
 seems easy and if someone is having 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.789
 difficulty to pass leaves to a 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.430
 tip here for you 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.710
 pressing the triangle button yo I 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.490
 demonstrate a kind of wrong who or 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.099
 I do not know 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.349
 So stay away, they only did that, not 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.930
 let your enemy even breathe and you 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.729
 win easy easy series guys without 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.589
 Exaggeration was too easy 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.169
 but pay attention when you're out 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:02.669
 from the battlefield the fire goes up 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.710
 you can be burned 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.779
 After that the game is over you will be 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.849
 seen as a hero in the world dje and now 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:10.979
 You can finally play with your friends. 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:12.960
 with multiple blocked characters 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:14.789
 remembering that there are still others that you 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.810
 Just block to play the game 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.120
 again 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.639
 so the game lasts around two 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.900
 hours when you want to put more 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.300
 A few hours, right? 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.039
 although the game seems silly and simple 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.240
 I found it very interesting mainly 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:30.580
 because it is digimon 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.220
 it's about recovering those good ones. 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.120
 memories of the time of child knows if it is 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.610
 pretty cool 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.940
 Palladino I 've never had a hand I can 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.190
 play the game for sure but no doubt 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.490
 the emotion will be greater for those who 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.680
 watch or watched at the time demonshow 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.110
 bramble receives 50 note and where to cut the 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.300
 critical goal and in other portals that 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.360
 assign games notes can not much 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.160
 said he did not stay on that 50 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.500
 the biggest problem of the game according to 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.990
 they are something I did not mention here and 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.729
 maybe you have not even noticed 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.419
 there is an online mode and we agree 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:08.770
 we are in 2014 it 's bobearam movies could 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:10.360
 put the online mode that would be a 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.699
 great attraction too 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.889
 well I hope you have enjoyed feet that
