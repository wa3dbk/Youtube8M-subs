00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.370
 as people like on wednesday 26 november 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:12.630
 Lived in 2014 despite the camera and then 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.940
 let's go and we have 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.320
 I had a new rubric 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.690
 actually longer but me 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.580
 I thought so look if the people 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.109
 I'm interested in that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.900
 not only about these comments 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.650
 make fun of the funniest 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.420
 comments of the week or commentary of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.300
 week or let's see how we do it 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.620
 But yes, as I said I can 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.559
 Do not just want to make fun of me 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.960
 these comments but if possible 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.629
 is also called examples then 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.730
 to make it clear that these comments 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:51.030
 really a bit I do not want to 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.750
 say stupid are further because spectators 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.840
 form 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.809
 I would say he was so inexperienced 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:02.760
 Unsuspecting him in this direction so under 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.960
 which video was mine? 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.970
 comment i will introduce you first 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.130
 video show the title of it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.210
 can you you times so I know I 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.560
 It may be that he has his comment 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.159
 again, I do not know 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.830
 this is my fight mail and this is here 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.990
 the headline top ten bodybuilder 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.360
 but not the youtuber 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.369
 Already question mark so exclamation point 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.590
 question mark exclamation mark this is mine 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:31.170
 I did a video recently and there 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.970
 somebody has me somehow directly somehow 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.340
 left a comment today 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.680
 and here you can have a look 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.210
 look at 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.240
 this is the user battery you are really 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.460
 so unsuspecting point point who says 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.770
 that the top ten bodybuilders are not 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.170
 without steroids create question mark 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.170
 they would do a lot without steroids 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.759
 can build muscle mass and also 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.130
 her body fat percentage under six 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.840
 but bring it with steroids 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.619
 of course it's easier and they come 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.240
 even further and now hold on tight 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.220
 That's why they are the best 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.020
 and not the average would be 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.810
 fitness youtube take asteroids 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.330
 while maybe a few of those 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.360
 very far ahead or at the very front 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.360
 there 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:27.200
 Now the following will be easy 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.960
 just a few left below put by 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.230
 former top 5 not even top ten 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.650
 but top five top six top 7 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.590
 Bodybuilders really on the fbb 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.330
 stage and really either 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.460
 mister olympia were or place two 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.580
 three four five, and so on has 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.490
 that is, they have the best of the best 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.500
 how they looked before their career or 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.630
 or where I would say 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.130
 he so natural when and where the was young 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.220
 just started a training so 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.670
 the beginning time where you still natural track 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.490
 and or after having your career 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.630
 have stopped 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.240
 that is, have their benefits career 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.340
 hanged a nail like they just then 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.140
 have completely shrunk 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.360
 and now one or the other will say 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.980
 yes, but then you have a career 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.660
 finished and I who trains once the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.540
 People are still training only 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.220
 if you finish your professional career then 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.820
 they are not hitting those anymore 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.130
 whole gummy bears in the blood stream 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.420
 or in the muscles if 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.490
 You understand what I mean 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.290
 So the extra vitamins let that then 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.420
 away because you can no longer money 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.190
 so why do hundreds then for what 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.050
 or thousands of euros to the window 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.700
 throw out because you anyway no money 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.180
 Do more with it but do some training 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.709
 most then somehow continue 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.660
 and a very stark example yes 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.160
 So you 're there too , I believe 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.540
 There are also such channels 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.610
 if you look at that you have yours 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.800
 Do not look like the people of the 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.590
 professional career and directly let's say 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.930
 23 years after the professional career 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.209
 have not seen or look anything with 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.880
 super super genetics or that over 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.560
 crass yet to have wii games but 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.510
 the field just completely away everything 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.040
 All right, pull some left 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.109
 down below in there and there are synonymous 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.280
 a channel currently as I said I show 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.840
 you guys and I do not know 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.430
 if 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.260
 five or ten years left his canal 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.389
 will exist but that is really 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.620
 quite blatantly so I will give you my video 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.300
 left put under 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.250
 I also get some of her 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.110
 Professional career left under put 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.820
 so you can see how massive it is 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.500
 and maybe then 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.840
 right after that a link pulls you 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.160
 really all left pure and direct 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.830
 afterwards a link became for example 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.990
 let's say stopped as a pro has 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.430
 or and so on and so forth 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.199
 pull out a few before after 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.000
 pictures are all clear thank you for 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.460
 I'll watch it and maybe 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.850
 repeat regularly until the 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.850
 guys
