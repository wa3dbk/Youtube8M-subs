00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
and I've been getting considerably

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.990 
and I've been getting considerably
better<00:00:31.019> without<00:00:31.470> us<00:00:31.590> without<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.669> chat<00:00:32.969> about

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
better without us without a chat about

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.270 
better without us without a chat about
those<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:33.660> I'm<00:00:33.960> not<00:00:34.290> even<00:00:34.559> close<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.130> being

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
those but I'm not even close to being

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.150 
those but I'm not even close to being
after<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.630> point<00:00:37.050> where<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> want<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.980> be

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
after at the point where I want to be

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.010 
after at the point where I want to be
but<00:00:38.340> I'm<00:00:39.030> getting<00:00:39.329> there<00:00:39.480> I'm<00:00:39.719> getting<00:00:39.750> there

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
but I'm getting there I'm getting there

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.619 
but I'm getting there I'm getting there
training<00:00:40.440> makes<00:00:40.860> perfect<00:00:41.430> as<00:00:41.640> usual<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.570> I've

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
training makes perfect as usual so I've

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.600 
training makes perfect as usual so I've
been<00:00:42.750> playing<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.200> about<00:00:43.260> eight<00:00:43.710> hours<00:00:44.040> when

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
been playing for about eight hours when

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.389 
been playing for about eight hours when
this<00:00:44.760> footage<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.239> recorded<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.399> am

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
this footage is recorded so I am

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.459 
this footage is recorded so I am
considerably<00:00:48.120> much<00:00:48.480> better<00:00:48.809> than<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> was

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
considerably much better than I was

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.500 
considerably much better than I was
during<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.309> first<00:00:50.520> video<00:00:50.730> when<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> hadn't

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
during the first video when I hadn't

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.869 
during the first video when I hadn't
even<00:00:51.660> played<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.289> one<00:00:52.469> hour<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> big

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
even played for one hour so it's a big

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.520 
even played for one hour so it's a big
difference<00:00:54.300> there<00:00:54.510> I've<00:00:54.870> been<00:00:55.140> getting<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
difference there I've been getting a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.200 
difference there I've been getting a
good<00:00:55.680> feel<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:55.980> therefore<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> recoil<00:00:57.059> of

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
good feel for therefore the recoil of

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.150 
good feel for therefore the recoil of
the<00:00:57.270> guns<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.020> kind<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.530> start<00:00:58.770> learning

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the guns and and kind of start learning

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.740 
the guns and and kind of start learning
the<00:00:59.280> maps<00:00:59.489> again<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.270> kind<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.539> start

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the maps again and kind of start

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.150 
the maps again and kind of start
learning<00:01:01.079> how<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> enemy<00:01:01.590> looks<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
learning how the enemy looks like and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.860 
learning how the enemy looks like and
stuff<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.879> well<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.480> actually<00:01:03.600> thought

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
stuff like that well I actually thought

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.859 
stuff like that well I actually thought
I<00:01:03.930> would<00:01:04.909> address<00:01:05.909> one<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> biggest

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
I would address one of the biggest

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.130 
I would address one of the biggest
issues<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.560> seems<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> many<00:01:08.820> other

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
issues it seems like you and many other

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.609 
issues it seems like you and many other
people<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.650> YouTube<00:01:11.310> or<00:01:11.840> overall<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.320> in

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
people have on YouTube or overall in in

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.039 
people have on YouTube or overall in in
gaming<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.310> especially<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> game<00:01:16.020> that

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
gaming and especially in a game that

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.050 
gaming and especially in a game that
come<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> Shrike<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.820> mouse

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
come to Shrike and that's the mouse

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.160 
come to Shrike and that's the mouse
settings<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.520> sensitivity<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.960> might<00:01:22.140> be

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
settings and sensitivity so you might be

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230 
settings and sensitivity so you might be
asking<00:01:22.530> yourself<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:23.430> kind<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.729> Mouse<00:01:24.000> do

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.730 
asking yourself what kind of Mouse do
you<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.780> might<00:01:24.960> think<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.560> some

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
because after all I might not be the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.880 
because after all I might not be the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
playing on flag for long time so I kind

playing on flag for long time so I kind
of<00:02:09.629> know

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
of know

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.260 
of know
you<00:02:10.380> should<00:02:10.680> do<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.100> even<00:02:11.280> though<00:02:11.670> my<00:02:11.850> reaction

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
you should do it even though my reaction

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.330 
you should do it even though my reaction
scales<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.810> my<00:02:12.900> aiming<00:02:13.230> skills<00:02:13.530> are<00:02:13.830> as

scales and my aiming skills are as

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.830 
scales and my aiming skills are as
Gilda's<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:15.240> they<00:02:15.510> should<00:02:15.570> be<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.380> say<00:02:16.820> so

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
Gilda's as they should be so to say so

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.140 
Gilda's as they should be so to say so
many<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.080> might<00:02:19.290> think<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.620> dpi<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.820> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
many of you might think that dpi is the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.000 
many of you might think that dpi is the
same<00:02:21.420> thing<00:02:21.840> as<00:02:22.130> sensitivity<00:02:23.130> no<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:24.120> not

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
same thing as sensitivity no it's not

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.450 
same thing as sensitivity no it's not
dpi<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.990> higher<00:02:28.200> deeper<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:28.920> have<00:02:29.160> and

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
dpi is the higher deeper you have and

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.390 
dpi is the higher deeper you have and
the<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.150> higher<00:02:30.660> res<00:02:31.170> picture<00:02:31.830> your<00:02:32.190> mouse

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
the the higher res picture your mouse

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.230 
the the higher res picture your mouse
will<00:02:32.730> take<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.360> analyze<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.340> key<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.520> making

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
will take and analyze a key a making

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.400 
will take and analyze a key a making
your<00:02:36.420> mouse<00:02:36.680> more<00:02:38.060> accurate<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.390> if<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.260> have

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
your mouse more accurate and if you have

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.070 
your mouse more accurate and if you have
a<00:02:40.440> very<00:02:40.710> high<00:02:40.980> DPI<00:02:41.580> on<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.270> gonna<00:02:42.600> seem<00:02:42.870> like

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
a very high DPI on it's gonna seem like

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.650 
a very high DPI on it's gonna seem like
you<00:02:43.200> have<00:02:43.320> very<00:02:43.590> high<00:02:43.650> high<00:02:44.400> sensitivity<00:02:45.000> so

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
you have very high high sensitivity so

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.780 
you have very high high sensitivity so
it<00:02:45.750> moves<00:02:46.020> around<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.590> lot<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.010> might<00:02:47.310> think

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
it moves around a lot so you might think

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.210 
it moves around a lot so you might think
now<00:02:48.120> I'm<00:02:48.390> gonna<00:02:48.690> lower<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.200> DPI<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> little<00:02:50.040> bit

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
now I'm gonna lower the DPI a little bit

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.760 
now I'm gonna lower the DPI a little bit
to<00:02:50.760> make<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:50.970> easier<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.959> control<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.620> mouse

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
to make it easier to control the mouse

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.510 
to make it easier to control the mouse
never<00:02:53.310> do<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.760> never<00:02:54.540> ever<00:02:55.110> do<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.560> always

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
never do that never ever do that always

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.540 
never do that never ever do that always
have<00:02:56.790> your<00:02:56.970> mouse<00:02:57.240> on<00:02:57.540> maximum<00:02:58.350> dpi<00:02:58.770> for<00:02:59.459> the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
have your mouse on maximum dpi for the

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.990 
have your mouse on maximum dpi for the
absolute<00:03:00.180> best<00:03:00.480> accuracy<00:03:01.490> the<00:03:02.490> only<00:03:02.790> thing

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
absolute best accuracy the only thing

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.660 
absolute best accuracy the only thing
you<00:03:03.180> actually<00:03:03.390> want<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.020> change<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.920> the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
you actually want to change is the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.690 
you actually want to change is the
settings<00:03:06.180> in<00:03:06.510> game<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.050> sensitivity<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.160> your

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
settings in game the sensitivity of your

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.630 
settings in game the sensitivity of your
mouse<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.330> game<00:03:09.840> never<00:03:10.530> ever<00:03:10.920> on<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.459> mouse

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
mouse in game never ever on the mouse

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.320 
mouse in game never ever on the mouse
itself

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
itself

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.120 
itself
so<00:03:12.510> keep<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> DPI<00:03:13.200> will<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:13.560> have<00:03:13.740> it<00:03:13.890> and

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
so keep the DPI will you have it and

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.490 
so keep the DPI will you have it and
then<00:03:14.640> change<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.239> mouse<00:03:15.510> settings<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.320> what

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
then change the mouse settings to what

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.600 
then change the mouse settings to what
you<00:03:17.310> feel<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:19.050> comfortable<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.920> game<00:03:20.310> and

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
you feel is it's comfortable in game and

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.199 
you feel is it's comfortable in game and
if<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:22.260> basically<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.220> have<00:03:23.430> sensitivity

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
if the basically you have sensitivity

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.000 
if the basically you have sensitivity
from<00:03:24.390> 1<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.350> 10<00:03:25.769> in<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.519> game<00:03:26.730> options<00:03:27.360> so<00:03:28.290> you

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
from 1 to 10 in the game options so you

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.770 
from 1 to 10 in the game options so you
might<00:03:29.190> be<00:03:29.220> thinking<00:03:29.400> like<00:03:29.880> but<00:03:30.150> wait<00:03:30.360> Anders

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
might be thinking like but wait Anders

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.930 
might be thinking like but wait Anders
I'm<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.170> put<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.530> on<00:03:31.680> one<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.190> it's<00:03:32.340> still<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.640> bit

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
I'm a put it on one but it's still a bit

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.050 
I'm a put it on one but it's still a bit
too<00:03:33.239> high<00:03:33.510> sensitivity<00:03:34.310> yes<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.670> might<00:03:35.850> be

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
too high sensitivity yes you might be

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.270 
too high sensitivity yes you might be
completely<00:03:36.660> correct<00:03:36.870> about<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.560> all<00:03:37.980> the

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.520 
of course which most you have but for me
personally<00:03:41.519> one<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.780> setting<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:43.320> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
personally one a setting of the

personally one a setting of the
sensitivity<00:03:44.160> one<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.700> way<00:03:45.120> too<00:03:45.180> high<00:03:45.600> I

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
sensitivity one is way too high I

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.780 
sensitivity one is way too high I
actually<00:03:46.320> have<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.800> on<00:03:47.720> 0.3<00:03:48.720> one<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:49.920> one<00:03:50.220> third

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
actually have it on 0.3 one so one third

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.320 
actually have it on 0.3 one so one third
of<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.690> minimum<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.590> can<00:03:52.769> set<00:03:53.040> on<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.760> the

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
of the minimum you can set on in the

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.470 
of the minimum you can set on in the
options<00:03:55.160> but<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.550> then<00:03:56.880> we<00:03:57.030> come<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.239> the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
options but and then we come to the

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.330 
options but and then we come to the
second<00:03:58.050> thing<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.380> get<00:03:58.530> might<00:03:58.890> be<00:03:59.040> thinking

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
second thing you get might be thinking

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.970 
second thing you get might be thinking
like<00:03:59.459> but<00:04:00.030> errors<00:04:00.330> how<00:04:00.870> do<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.200> get<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.560> to

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
like but errors how do you get it to

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.830 
like but errors how do you get it to
become<00:04:02.489> less<00:04:02.730> than<00:04:02.970> one<00:04:03.180> if<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.600> can't

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
become less than one if you can't

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.750 
become less than one if you can't
actually<00:04:04.050> change<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.769> less<00:04:04.950> than<00:04:04.980> one<00:04:05.250> you

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
actually change it to less than one you

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.210 
actually change it to less than one you
can't<00:04:06.000> change<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.480> in<00:04:06.660> your<00:04:06.870> options<00:04:07.190> but<00:04:08.190> you

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
can't change it in your options but you

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.699 
can't change it in your options but you
can<00:04:08.640> change<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.269> in<00:04:09.480> your<00:04:09.660> developer<00:04:10.260> console

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
can change it in your developer console

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.590 
can change it in your developer console
and<00:04:10.890> how<00:04:11.549> do<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.760> get<00:04:11.970> your<00:04:12.120> developer

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
and how do you get your developer

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.810 
and how do you get your developer
console<00:04:12.959> it's<00:04:13.140> extremely<00:04:13.830> easy<00:04:13.950> all<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.459> do

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
console it's extremely easy all you do

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.020 
console it's extremely easy all you do
is<00:04:14.940> go<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.239> game<00:04:15.690> options<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.530> then<00:04:17.010> you<00:04:17.220> check

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
is go to game options and then you check

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.940 
is go to game options and then you check
for<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.330> world<00:04:18.539> that<00:04:18.810> says<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:19.320> words<00:04:19.530> that

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
for the world that says the words that

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.250 
for the world that says the words that
says<00:04:20.220> developer<00:04:21.209> console<00:04:21.690> and

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
says developer console and

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.130 
says developer console and
you<00:04:22.380> press<00:04:22.650> enable<00:04:23.280> or<00:04:23.490> Jess<00:04:24.060> so<00:04:24.540> or<00:04:24.780> own

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
you press enable or Jess so or own

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.320 
you press enable or Jess so or own
basically<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:25.950> it's<00:04:26.100> on<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.580> then<00:04:26.610> you<00:04:27.180> go

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
basically so it's on and then you go

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.880 
basically so it's on and then you go
into<00:04:27.510> your<00:04:27.660> keyboard<00:04:28.170> and<00:04:28.320> mouse<00:04:28.530> settings

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
into your keyboard and mouse settings

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.670 
into your keyboard and mouse settings
and<00:04:29.310> find<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:30.000> same<00:04:30.210> word<00:04:30.510> err<00:04:30.870> developer

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
and find the same word err developer

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.400 
and find the same word err developer
console<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:32.370> check<00:04:32.640> which<00:04:32.910> mouse<00:04:33.630> or<00:04:34.050> which

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
console and check which mouse or which

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.400 
console and check which mouse or which
key<00:04:35.280> it's<00:04:35.520> binded<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.390> you<00:04:36.780> can<00:04:36.960> only<00:04:37.110> change

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
key it's binded to you can only change

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.460 
key it's binded to you can only change
it<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.890> be<00:04:38.160> be<00:04:38.820> like<00:04:39.030> zero<00:04:39.480> or<00:04:39.870> a<00:04:39.900> question<00:04:40.260> mark

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
just change it to our button you want to

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.790 
just change it to our button you want to
want<00:04:44.730> to<00:04:44.850> have<00:04:45.000> it<00:04:45.090> on<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:45.450> then<00:04:46.080> you<00:04:46.110> press<00:04:46.590> it

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
want to have it on and then you press it

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.610 
want to have it on and then you press it
and<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.220> should<00:04:47.460> get<00:04:47.670> a<00:04:47.970> small<00:04:48.660> little<00:04:49.110> window

messages<00:04:56.760> from<00:04:56.970> in-game<00:04:57.450> and<00:04:57.780> stuff<00:04:57.990> like

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
messages from in-game and stuff like

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.700 
messages from in-game and stuff like
that<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:58.680> basically<00:04:59.490> what<00:04:59.670> you<00:04:59.790> do<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.090> type

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
that and basically what you do you type

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.480 
that and basically what you do you type
sensitivity<00:05:01.970> and<00:05:03.170> space<00:05:04.170> and<00:05:04.560> then<00:05:05.070> you<00:05:05.220> type

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
sensitivity and space and then you type

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.520 
sensitivity and space and then you type
in<00:05:05.700> what<00:05:05.940> sensitivity<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:06.900> want<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.380> hit

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
in what sensitivity you want and hit

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.590 
in what sensitivity you want and hit
enter<00:05:08.100> so<00:05:08.130> basically<00:05:08.790> what<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.000> do<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.420> get<00:05:09.540> my

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
enter so basically what I do to get my

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.750 
enter so basically what I do to get my
sensitivity<00:05:10.470> is<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:11.270> type<00:05:12.270> sensitivity<00:05:13.260> space

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.940 

0.32<00:05:17.760> or<00:05:18.590> 0.3<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.950> our<00:05:21.050> 0.3<00:05:22.050> one<00:05:22.380> actually<00:05:22.890> I

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
0.32 or 0.3 to our 0.3 one actually I

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.320 
0.32 or 0.3 to our 0.3 one actually I
have<00:05:23.130> it<00:05:23.250> on<00:05:23.370> now<00:05:23.580> but<00:05:23.820> when<00:05:24.000> this<00:05:24.090> was

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
have it on now but when this was

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.100 
have it on now but when this was
recorded<00:05:24.480> and<00:05:25.200> I<00:05:25.260> had<00:05:26.000> 0.32<00:05:27.000> I'm<00:05:27.780> slowly

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
recorded and I had 0.32 I'm slowly

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.260 
recorded and I had 0.32 I'm slowly
working<00:05:28.440> my<00:05:28.620> way<00:05:28.740> down<00:05:29.250> to<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.790> lower

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
working my way down to the lower

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.990 
working my way down to the lower
sensitivity<00:05:30.690> and<00:05:31.350> also<00:05:31.800> you<00:05:32.400> can<00:05:32.550> do<00:05:32.640> the<00:05:32.670> same

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
sensitivity and also you can do the same

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.540 
sensitivity and also you can do the same
thing<00:05:33.360> with<00:05:33.630> that<00:05:34.050> with<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.440> EVP<00:05:34.980> if<00:05:35.220> you<00:05:35.370> want

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
thing with that with the EVP if you want

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.020 
thing with that with the EVP if you want
less<00:05:36.060> than<00:05:36.330> one<00:05:36.660> then<00:05:37.500> you<00:05:37.650> press<00:05:37.920> type<00:05:38.490> zoom

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
less than one then you press type zoom

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.990 
less than one then you press type zoom
and<00:05:39.450> it<00:05:40.110> should<00:05:40.410> pop<00:05:40.800> up<00:05:41.010> off<00:05:41.190> by<00:05:41.340> itself<00:05:41.700> or

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
and it should pop up off by itself or

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.670 
and it should pop up off by itself or
like<00:05:42.210> you<00:05:42.330> can<00:05:42.360> look<00:05:42.750> it<00:05:42.900> up<00:05:42.930> and<00:05:43.170> YouTube<00:05:43.560> and

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
like you can look it up and YouTube and

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.770 
like you can look it up and YouTube and
stuff<00:05:43.890> like<00:05:44.070> that<00:05:44.250> but<00:05:44.490> I<00:05:44.670> have<00:05:45.090> it<00:05:45.210> still<00:05:45.510> on

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
stuff like that but I have it still on

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.940 
stuff like that but I have it still on
the<00:05:46.050> original<00:05:46.830> one<00:05:47.190> on<00:05:47.460> soon<00:05:48.200> so<00:05:49.200> what<00:05:49.530> else<00:05:49.740> do

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
the original one on soon so what else do
