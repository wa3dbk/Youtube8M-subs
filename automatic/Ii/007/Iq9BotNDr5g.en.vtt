design<00:00:02.610> and<00:00:02.909> printed<00:00:03.389> hand<00:00:03.899> powered<00:00:04.350> fan

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
design and printed hand powered fan

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.800 
design and printed hand powered fan
doesn't<00:00:05.400> require<00:00:05.700> any<00:00:06.060> motor<00:00:06.359> or<00:00:06.600> any

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
doesn't require any motor or any

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.470 
doesn't require any motor or any
batteries<00:00:07.290> just<00:00:07.319> hand<00:00:07.859> power<00:00:11.179> you<00:00:12.179> can<00:00:12.300> see<00:00:12.389> it

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
batteries just hand power you can see it

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.269 
batteries just hand power you can see it
gets<00:00:12.660> up<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.900> speed<00:00:13.139> pretty<00:00:13.349> quickly<00:00:15.920> and<00:00:16.920> all

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
gets up to speed pretty quickly and all

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.920 
gets up to speed pretty quickly and all
I'm<00:00:17.430> doing<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.789> tapping<00:00:18.060> my<00:00:18.359> finger<00:00:18.690> up<00:00:18.810> and

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
I'm doing is tapping my finger up and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.929 
I'm doing is tapping my finger up and
down<00:00:18.990> like<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.490> so<00:00:20.490> I'll<00:00:20.609> hold<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.880> up

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
down like that so I'll hold it up

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.500 
down like that so I'll hold it up
closest<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:21.960> see<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.410> motion<00:00:24.500> and<00:00:26.510> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
closest you can see it in motion and the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.960 
closest you can see it in motion and the
fan<00:00:27.930> blades<00:00:28.260> are<00:00:28.410> adjustable<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.550> can

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
fan blades are adjustable so you can

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.429 
fan blades are adjustable so you can
basically<00:00:30.090> adjust<00:00:30.539> them<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.779> whatever

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
basically adjust them to whatever

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.200 
basically adjust them to whatever
preference<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.160> want<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.520> actually<00:00:32.910> quite

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
preference you want I actually quite

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.940 
preference you want I actually quite
enjoy<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.320> quite<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> fun

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
enjoy this because it's quite a fun

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.060 
enjoy this because it's quite a fun
little<00:00:35.100> game<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.579> see<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:37.070> which

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
little game to see which which

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.160 
little game to see which which
configuration<00:00:38.760> gives<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> most<00:00:39.270> wind<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.870> so

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
configuration gives the most wind and so

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.130 
configuration gives the most wind and so
on<00:00:40.850> now<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.120> actually<00:00:42.239> backwards<00:00:43.020> I'm

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
on now this is actually backwards I'm

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.600 
on now this is actually backwards I'm
doing<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.469> backwards<00:00:43.590> towards<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.309> camera

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
doing it backwards towards the camera

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.000 
doing it backwards towards the camera
typically<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.780> user<00:00:45.989> would<00:00:46.230> her<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.770> this

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
typically the user would her have this

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.639 
typically the user would her have this
facing<00:00:47.670> them<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.899> then<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.789> and

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
facing them and then do it like this and

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.779 
facing them and then do it like this and
it's<00:00:52.649> actually<00:00:53.039> pretty<00:00:53.250> cool

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
it's actually pretty cool

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.209 
it's actually pretty cool
now<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.660> actually<00:00:55.020> went<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.530> few<00:00:55.590> designed

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
now I actually went for a few designed

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.099 
now I actually went for a few designed
models<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.820> was<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> first<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.690> made<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
models this was the first one I made and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.750 
models this was the first one I made and
this<00:00:58.199> was<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> proof<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> concept<00:00:59.190> out<00:00:59.640> of

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this was just a proof of concept out of

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.970 
this was just a proof of concept out of
cardboard<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.570> did<00:01:01.050> work<00:01:01.260> I've<00:01:01.829> actually

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
cardboard I did work I've actually

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979 
cardboard I did work I've actually
broken<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.640> since<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.300> worked<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.930> I

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
broken it since then but it worked and I

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.899 
broken it since then but it worked and I
could<00:01:04.170> spin<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.890> was<00:01:05.010> pretty<00:01:05.220> poor<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:05.850> it

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
could spin it it was pretty poor but it

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
could spin it it was pretty poor but it
gave<00:01:06.210> me<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.450> proof<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.960> concept<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
gave me a proof of concept on the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.420 
gave me a proof of concept on the
general<00:01:08.880> design<00:01:09.030> now<00:01:09.810> disclaimer<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.830> got<00:01:11.220> this

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
general design now disclaimer I got this

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.000 
general design now disclaimer I got this
general<00:01:12.030> idea<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.780> tapping<00:01:13.380> motion<00:01:13.799> for

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
general idea of the tapping motion for

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.969 
general idea of the tapping motion for
the<00:01:14.100> fan<00:01:14.340> from<00:01:15.060> another<00:01:15.509> YouTube<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.200> Japanese

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the fan from another YouTube a Japanese

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.730 
the fan from another YouTube a Japanese
youtuber<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> saw<00:01:18.420> his<00:01:18.600> videos<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.470> I

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
youtuber now I saw his videos like I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.230 
youtuber now I saw his videos like I
think<00:01:19.799> two<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.220> three<00:01:20.400> years<00:01:20.729> ago<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.150> he

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
think two or three years ago and he

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
think two or three years ago and he
makes<00:01:21.420> wooden<00:01:21.840> fans<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.409> they<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:23.009> this

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
makes wooden fans and they have this

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.640 
makes wooden fans and they have this
finger<00:01:24.150> motion<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.689> spin<00:01:24.960> them<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.409> fought

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
finger motion to spin them and I fought

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.620 
finger motion to spin them and I fought
with<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> time<00:01:26.070> wow<00:01:26.250> that's<00:01:26.490> really<00:01:26.759> good<00:01:27.090> but

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
with the time wow that's really good but

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.420 
with the time wow that's really good but
I'm<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:27.840> very<00:01:27.900> good<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.259> woodwork<00:01:28.680> well<00:01:29.040> now<00:01:29.400> I

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
I'm not very good at woodwork well now I

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
I'm not very good at woodwork well now I
have<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> 3d<00:01:30.000> printer<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:31.020> some

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
have a 3d printer and I can do some

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.859 
have a 3d printer and I can do some
basic<00:01:31.350> design<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.130> made<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.329> also<00:01:33.689> had

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
basic design I made this one I also had

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.990 
basic design I made this one I also had
some<00:01:34.020> other<00:01:34.170> designs<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.040> one<00:01:35.340> problem

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
some other designs like this one problem

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.760 
some other designs like this one problem
with<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.450> was<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.259> couldn't<00:01:37.530> stand

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
with this one was that it couldn't stand

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.910 
with this one was that it couldn't stand
on<00:01:37.950> its<00:01:38.130> own<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.520> always<00:01:38.700> tips<00:01:39.030> over<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.439> it's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
on its own it always tips over and it's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980 
on its own it always tips over and it's
facing<00:01:41.130> away<00:01:41.430> from<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.790> user<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.840> wasn't

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
facing away from the user so that wasn't

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.899 
facing away from the user so that wasn't
much<00:01:43.229> good<00:01:43.560> then<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.310> came<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.640> with<00:01:44.790> another

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
much good then they came up with another

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.609 
much good then they came up with another
one<00:01:45.270> which<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.380> just

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
one which was like this and it just

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.499 
one which was like this and it just
clips<00:01:47.009> together<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.670> reason<00:01:47.939> why<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.119> made<00:01:48.390> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
clips together the reason why I made it

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.270 
clips together the reason why I made it
like<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.960> because<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.290> wanted<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.680> avoid

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
like that is because I wanted to avoid

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.370 
like that is because I wanted to avoid
overhangs<00:01:50.939> during<00:01:51.329> printing<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.079> made<00:01:52.259> it

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
overhangs during printing so I made it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.440 
overhangs during printing so I made it
as<00:01:52.500> two<00:01:52.799> parts<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.369> clicked<00:01:53.670> together<00:01:56.450> but

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
as two parts that clicked together but

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.179 
as two parts that clicked together but
in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.719> end<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.439> design<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.159> I

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
in the end this is the design that I

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.130 
in the end this is the design that I
ended<00:01:59.460> up<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.759> with<00:01:59.939> now<00:02:00.780> if<00:02:00.960> you're

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
ended up going with now if you're

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.840 
ended up going with now if you're
curious<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.590> see<00:02:01.619> how<00:02:01.920> fast<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.399> thing<00:02:02.460> can

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
curious to see how fast this thing can

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.060 
curious to see how fast this thing can
spin<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.840> my<00:02:03.990> fan<00:02:04.290> here<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.799> we're<00:02:04.979> just

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
spin I have my fan here and we're just

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.709 
spin I have my fan here and we're just
going<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> point<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> fan<00:02:05.880> at<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.509> I'm

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
going to point the fan at this and I'm

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.169 
going to point the fan at this and I'm
just<00:02:06.750> gonna<00:02:07.079> hold<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.799> piece<00:02:08.069> here<00:02:08.369> away<00:02:09.119> so

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
just gonna hold this piece here away so

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.419 
just gonna hold this piece here away so
it<00:02:09.539> doesn't<00:02:09.599> get<00:02:09.929> stuck

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
it doesn't get stuck

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.039 
it doesn't get stuck
anything<00:02:10.759> so<00:02:11.150> let's<00:02:11.329> start<00:02:11.629> with<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.900> lowest

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
anything so let's start with the lowest

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.699 
anything so let's start with the lowest
speed

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.849 

oops<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.640> mean<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.629> find<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.989> way<00:02:19.109> of<00:02:19.260> there<00:02:19.769> we

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
oops I mean you find a way of there we

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.470 
oops I mean you find a way of there we
go<00:02:21.019> that's<00:02:22.129> kind<00:02:23.129> of<00:02:23.250> fast<00:02:23.489> but<00:02:24.299> it's<00:02:24.420> not

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
go that's kind of fast but it's not

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.410 
go that's kind of fast but it's not
super<00:02:24.750> fast<00:02:25.079> let's<00:02:25.290> go<00:02:25.439> up<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.680> our<00:02:25.769> next

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
super fast let's go up to our next

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.370 
super fast let's go up to our next
option

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.160 

a<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:32.010> quicker

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
a bit quicker

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.220 
a bit quicker
let's<00:02:35.170> go<00:02:35.320> up<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.590> our<00:02:35.620> top<00:02:35.980> speed

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:48.230 

that's<00:02:39.830> pretty<00:02:40.099> fast

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.810 

now<00:02:49.170> for<00:02:49.380> anyone<00:02:49.590> that's<00:02:49.950> downloaded<00:02:50.670> this

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
now for anyone that's downloaded this

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.430 
now for anyone that's downloaded this
and<00:02:51.000> printed<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.450> for<00:02:51.780> themselves

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
and printed it for themselves

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.870 
and printed it for themselves
I'm<00:02:52.590> going<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.920> show<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.070> now<00:02:53.340> how<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.700> goes

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
I'm going to show you now how it goes

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.400 
I'm going to show you now how it goes
together<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.480> pretty<00:02:54.660> simple<00:02:55.110> but<00:02:55.290> I'll

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
together it's pretty simple but I'll

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.190 
together it's pretty simple but I'll
show<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.680> anyway<00:02:56.160> okay<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.840> should<00:02:58.050> have

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
show you anyway okay so you should have

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.560 
show you anyway okay so you should have
eight<00:02:58.470> propellor<00:02:58.980> bits<00:02:59.250> and<00:03:00.000> what<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.420> want

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
eight propellor bits and what you want

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.090 
eight propellor bits and what you want
to<00:03:00.630> do<00:03:00.750> is<00:03:00.960> just<00:03:01.170> start<00:03:01.440> by<00:03:01.620> putting<00:03:01.920> those

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
to do is just start by putting those

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.600 
to do is just start by putting those
into<00:03:02.640> your<00:03:02.930> little<00:03:03.930> hub<00:03:04.080> here<00:03:04.410> now<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.250> might

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
into your little hub here now you might

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.400 
into your little hub here now you might
have<00:03:05.730> little<00:03:06.030> of<00:03:06.090> strands<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.630> plastic<00:03:07.230> and

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
have little of strands of plastic and

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.350 
have little of strands of plastic and
depending<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.340> how<00:03:08.610> well<00:03:08.850> your<00:03:08.970> printer

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
depending on how well your printer

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.960 
depending on how well your printer
handles<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.470> kind<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.920> small<00:03:11.250> print<00:03:11.700> with

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
handles this kind of small print with

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.900 
handles this kind of small print with
supports<00:03:12.870> but<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:13.770> can<00:03:13.920> just<00:03:14.130> squeeze<00:03:14.760> them

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
supports but you can just squeeze them

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.500 
supports but you can just squeeze them
in<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:15.920> won't<00:03:16.920> put<00:03:17.100> these<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.460> in<00:03:17.670> any<00:03:17.850> specific

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
in I won't put these in in any specific

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.260 
in I won't put these in in any specific
or<00:03:19.170> color<00:03:19.590> order<00:03:20.100> just<00:03:20.580> do<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.820> randomly<00:03:23.270> some

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
or color order just do it randomly some

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.910 
or color order just do it randomly some
of<00:03:24.360> them<00:03:24.480> might<00:03:24.870> be<00:03:24.900> tighter<00:03:25.290> than<00:03:25.440> others

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
of them might be tighter than others

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.710 
of them might be tighter than others
they're<00:03:26.250> all<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.400> January<00:03:26.940> quite<00:03:27.240> a<00:03:27.270> tight<00:03:27.510> fit

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
they're all a January quite a tight fit

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.050 
they're all a January quite a tight fit
which<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:28.020> good<00:03:28.230> because<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.590> means<00:03:28.800> you<00:03:29.010> can

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
which is good because it means you can

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.200 
which is good because it means you can
adjust<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.270> angle<00:03:30.300> easily<00:03:31.610> if<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.880> can't

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
adjust the angle easily if you can't

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.700 
adjust the angle easily if you can't
pick<00:03:33.420> them<00:03:33.600> in<00:03:33.720> if<00:03:33.900> they're<00:03:34.080> really<00:03:34.320> too<00:03:34.470> tight

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
pick them in if they're really too tight

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.280 
pick them in if they're really too tight
just<00:03:34.920> give<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.220> very<00:03:35.490> light<00:03:35.700> sanding<00:03:36.290> around

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
just give it a very light sanding around

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.210 
just give it a very light sanding around
the<00:03:37.710> edge

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
the edge

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.130 
the edge
okay<00:03:38.880> so<00:03:39.870> we've<00:03:40.470> loaded<00:03:40.770> up<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.310> propeller<00:03:42.140> oops

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
okay so we've loaded up a propeller oops

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.590 
okay so we've loaded up a propeller oops
let<00:03:43.650> me<00:03:43.710> just<00:03:43.950> get<00:03:44.430> that<00:03:44.820> be<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.000> plastic<00:03:45.450> off

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
let me just get that be a plastic off

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.730 
let me just get that be a plastic off
okay<00:03:47.660> there<00:03:48.660> we<00:03:48.750> go<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.020> we've<00:03:49.140> loaded<00:03:49.320> up<00:03:49.590> a

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
okay there we go so we've loaded up a

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.010 
okay there we go so we've loaded up a
propeller<00:03:50.190> now<00:03:50.730> we've<00:03:50.880> got<00:03:51.030> our<00:03:51.120> base<00:03:51.330> here

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.580 

slide<00:03:55.020> this<00:03:55.260> route<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:57.230> that<00:03:58.230> will<00:03:58.380> just

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
slide this route and that will just

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.920 
slide this route and that will just
stand<00:03:58.920> there<00:03:59.040> now<00:03:59.640> this<00:03:59.850> one<00:04:00.120> you've<00:04:00.450> got<00:04:00.480> a

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
stand there now this one you've got a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.660 
stand there now this one you've got a
bit<00:04:01.110> which<00:04:01.260> is<00:04:01.410> centered<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.370> bit<00:04:02.520> which<00:04:02.640> is

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
bit which is centered and a bit which is

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.910 
bit which is centered and a bit which is
off<00:04:02.940> centered<00:04:03.450> now<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.290> doesn't<00:04:04.500> matter<00:04:04.650> which

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
off centered now it doesn't matter which

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.740 
off centered now it doesn't matter which
way<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.220> put<00:04:05.340> this<00:04:05.670> around<00:04:05.880> as<00:04:06.330> long<00:04:06.480> as<00:04:06.540> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
way you put this around as long as the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.810 
way you put this around as long as the
center<00:04:07.080> B<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.320> on<00:04:07.560> there<00:04:07.830> now<00:04:08.340> depending<00:04:08.760> on

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
center B is on there now depending on

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.340 
center B is on there now depending on
whether<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.120> have<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.420> on<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.810> right<00:04:10.050> or

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
whether you have this on the right or

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.650 
whether you have this on the right or
the<00:04:10.410> left<00:04:10.740> we'll<00:04:11.310> put<00:04:11.490> a<00:04:11.520> bias<00:04:11.880> towards<00:04:12.570> an

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
the left we'll put a bias towards an

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.450 
the left we'll put a bias towards an
easier<00:04:12.990> spin<00:04:13.320> in<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.560> certain<00:04:13.860> direction<00:04:13.950> so

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
easier spin in a certain direction so

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.760 
easier spin in a certain direction so
you<00:04:14.550> can<00:04:14.700> experiment<00:04:15.570> with<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.530> we<00:04:16.620> got

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
you can experiment with that so we got

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.950 
you can experiment with that so we got
our<00:04:16.950> finger<00:04:17.640> piece<00:04:17.820> here<00:04:18.120> slide<00:04:18.600> this<00:04:18.780> little

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960 
our finger piece here slide this little

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.110 
our finger piece here slide this little
thing<00:04:19.230> through<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.860> we'll<00:04:20.520> put<00:04:20.730> that<00:04:20.880> on<00:04:20.940> the

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
thing through and we'll put that on the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.160 
thing through and we'll put that on the
off<00:04:21.570> center<00:04:21.930> hole<00:04:22.290> just<00:04:23.300> push<00:04:24.300> that<00:04:24.510> in<00:04:24.780> there

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
off center hole just push that in there

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.410 
off center hole just push that in there
it's<00:04:25.320> kind<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:25.590> tight<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.250> then<00:04:26.880> this<00:04:27.060> is<00:04:27.270> the

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
it's kind of tight and then this is the

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.880 
it's kind of tight and then this is the
bit<00:04:27.540> where<00:04:27.570> you<00:04:27.720> have<00:04:27.810> to<00:04:27.930> be<00:04:28.020> careful<00:04:28.380> joining

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
bit where you have to be careful joining

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.400 
bit where you have to be careful joining
this<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.370> this<00:04:29.520> this<00:04:30.270> pole<00:04:30.540> is<00:04:30.570> only<00:04:30.990> around

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
this to this this pole is only around

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.070 
this to this this pole is only around
three<00:04:31.710> millimeters<00:04:32.550> maybe<00:04:33.420> it's<00:04:33.600> whiny<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.960> bit

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
three millimeters maybe it's whiny a bit

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.990 
three millimeters maybe it's whiny a bit
more<00:04:34.320> with<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.560> shell<00:04:35.190> so<00:04:35.670> you<00:04:35.730> have<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:35.910> be

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
more with the shell so you have to be

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.910 
more with the shell so you have to be
very<00:04:36.180> careful<00:04:36.720> when<00:04:37.380> you're<00:04:37.470> joining<00:04:37.710> these

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
very careful when you're joining these

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.530 
very careful when you're joining these
parts<00:04:38.280> you<00:04:38.460> don't<00:04:38.550> snap<00:04:39.000> this<00:04:39.780> beam<00:04:40.730> so<00:04:41.730> push

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
parts you don't snap this beam so push

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.920 
parts you don't snap this beam so push
on<00:04:42.750> there<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.470> there<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:43.950> go<00:04:44.100> your<00:04:44.940> fan<00:04:45.240> is

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
on there and there you go your fan is

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.009 
on there and there you go your fan is
ready<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.380> spin

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:50.019 

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:52.600
