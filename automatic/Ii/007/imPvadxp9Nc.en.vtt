really saw the similarities when I saw

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.900 
really saw the similarities when I saw
Goku<00:00:38.109> like<00:00:38.289> flying<00:00:38.620> around<00:00:38.949> strafing<00:00:39.699> and

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
Goku like flying around strafing and

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.910 
Goku like flying around strafing and
dodging<00:00:40.870> keyless<00:00:41.199> and<00:00:41.379> all<00:00:41.440> that<00:00:41.530> stuff<00:00:41.620> and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
dodging keyless and all that stuff and

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.759 
dodging keyless and all that stuff and
then<00:00:42.160> he<00:00:42.249> landed<00:00:42.760> on<00:00:42.879> the<00:00:42.940> ground<00:00:43.359> and<00:00:43.870> when<00:00:44.649> he

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
then he landed on the ground and when he

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.709 
then he landed on the ground and when he
started<00:00:45.070> moving<00:00:45.489> on<00:00:45.609> the<00:00:45.699> ground<00:00:45.999> he<00:00:46.600> was

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
started moving on the ground he was

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.989 
started moving on the ground he was
actually<00:00:46.899> like<00:00:47.260> sprinting<00:00:47.949> and<00:00:48.159> instead<00:00:48.969> of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:48.999 
actually like sprinting and instead of

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:51.119 
actually like sprinting and instead of
like<00:00:49.239> hovering<00:00:49.629> over<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.109> ground<00:00:50.350> as<00:00:50.559> they<00:00:51.070> do

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
like hovering over the ground as they do

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.579 
like hovering over the ground as they do
in<00:00:51.519> you<00:00:51.940> know<00:00:52.030> pretty<00:00:52.149> much<00:00:52.269> every<00:00:52.870> other<00:00:53.019> DBZ

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
in you know pretty much every other DBZ

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.040 
in you know pretty much every other DBZ
game<00:00:53.769> ever<00:00:54.219> we're<00:00:54.940> like<00:00:55.210> you're<00:00:55.719> on<00:00:55.870> the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
game ever we're like you're on the

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.840 
game ever we're like you're on the
ground<00:00:56.319> and<00:00:56.620> you're<00:00:56.710> moving<00:00:56.829> around<00:00:57.190> but<00:00:57.399> your

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
ground and you're moving around but your

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.549 
ground and you're moving around but your
character<00:00:58.179> is<00:00:58.239> still<00:00:58.479> hovering<00:00:58.629> I<00:00:59.019> always

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
character is still hovering I always

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.989 
character is still hovering I always
thought<00:00:59.679> that<00:00:59.829> was<00:01:00.069> a<00:01:00.100> neat<00:01:00.339> little<00:01:00.519> tiny

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 
thought that was a neat little tiny

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.419 
thought that was a neat little tiny
touch<00:01:01.539> about<00:01:02.019> battle<00:01:02.710> royale<00:01:03.039> is<00:01:03.069> that<00:01:03.309> your

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
touch about battle royale is that your

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.220 
touch about battle royale is that your
characters<00:01:03.819> feet<00:01:04.120> actually<00:01:04.390> moved<00:01:04.870> they<00:01:05.050> like

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
characters feet actually moved they like

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.530 
characters feet actually moved they like
just<00:01:05.890> run<00:01:06.250> on<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.520> ground<00:01:06.760> and<00:01:07.030> that<00:01:07.060> really

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
just run on the ground and that really

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.420 
just run on the ground and that really
reminded<00:01:07.990> me<00:01:08.020> about<00:01:08.170> oriel<00:01:08.800> I<00:01:09.010> really<00:01:09.310> think

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
reminded me about oriel I really think

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.740 
reminded me about oriel I really think
that<00:01:09.550> they're<00:01:09.760> taking<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:10.090> lot<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.270> mechanics

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
that they're taking a lot of mechanics

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.120 
that they're taking a lot of mechanics
from<00:01:10.960> that<00:01:11.260> game<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.680> they're<00:01:11.770> putting<00:01:12.010> it

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
from that game and they're putting it

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.570 
from that game and they're putting it
into<00:01:12.430> this<00:01:12.850> which<00:01:13.480> is<00:01:13.810> neat<00:01:14.140> um<00:01:15.100> it's<00:01:15.340> better

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
into this which is neat um it's better

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.180

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
take away the booze saga i mean III

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.150 
take away the booze saga i mean III
don't<00:02:42.459> know<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:44.170> I've<00:02:44.349> said<00:02:44.530> before<00:02:44.590> I

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
don't know and as I've said before I

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.949 
don't know and as I've said before I
don't<00:02:45.489> think<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:45.940> they<00:02:46.090> would<00:02:46.180> make<00:02:46.329> a<00:02:46.360> DBZ

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
don't think that they would make a DBZ

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.979 
don't think that they would make a DBZ
game<00:02:47.260> without<00:02:47.769> at<00:02:48.220> least<00:02:48.250> up<00:02:49.180> until<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.750> cell

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
game without at least up until the cell

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.440 
game without at least up until the cell
saga<00:02:50.319> so<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.880> know<00:02:52.000> if<00:02:52.150> they're<00:02:52.299> not

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
saga so you know if they're not

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.960 
saga so you know if they're not
mentioning<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.110> cell<00:02:53.290> saga<00:02:53.590> then<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.790> can

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
mentioning the cell saga then you can

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.370 
mentioning the cell saga then you can
still<00:02:55.239> pretty<00:02:55.510> much<00:02:55.630> safely<00:02:55.989> assume<00:02:56.349> that

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
still pretty much safely assume that

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.960 
still pretty much safely assume that
they're<00:02:56.620> gonna<00:02:56.769> put<00:02:57.099> it<00:02:57.220> in<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.430> game<00:02:57.610> because

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
they're gonna put it in the game because

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.400 
they're gonna put it in the game because
like<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.660> said<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.840> don't<00:02:58.989> think<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.260> they

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
like I said I don't think that they

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.839 
like I said I don't think that they
would<00:02:59.500> make<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.680> DBZ<00:03:00.040> game<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.489> doesn't<00:03:00.670> at

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
would make a DBZ game that doesn't at

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.119 
would make a DBZ game that doesn't at
least<00:03:00.879> go<00:03:01.239> up<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.599> cell<00:03:01.840> saga<00:03:02.110> so<00:03:02.769> that

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
least go up to the cell saga so that

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.770 
least go up to the cell saga so that
that<00:03:03.730> means<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.150> there<00:03:04.269> could<00:03:04.480> be<00:03:04.510> other

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
that means that there could be other

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.970 
that means that there could be other
things<00:03:05.079> that<00:03:05.170> they're<00:03:05.349> not<00:03:05.440> going<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.860> include

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
things that they're not going to include

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.089 
things that they're not going to include
now<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.640> have<00:03:07.299> heard<00:03:07.599> that<00:03:07.629> GT<00:03:08.260> characters<00:03:08.739> are

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
now I have heard that GT characters are

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.710 
now I have heard that GT characters are
probably<00:03:09.519> going<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.760> be<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:09.879> no-go<00:03:10.360> for<00:03:10.390> this

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
probably going to be a no-go for this

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.390 
probably going to be a no-go for this
game<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.650> that's<00:03:11.829> a<00:03:11.980> little<00:03:12.220> disappointing

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
game so that's a little disappointing

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.330 
game so that's a little disappointing
but<00:03:12.819> hey<00:03:13.480> at<00:03:13.870> least<00:03:14.319> we're<00:03:14.769> hopefully<00:03:15.160> getting

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
but hey at least we're hopefully getting

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.670 
but hey at least we're hopefully getting
up<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.790> boot<00:03:15.970> saga<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.629> at<00:03:17.470> least

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
up to the boot saga and at least

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.330 
up to the boot saga and at least
hopefully<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.870> battle<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.350> gods<00:03:20.560> special

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
hopefully the the battle of gods special

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.520 
hopefully the the battle of gods special
maybe<00:03:21.549> there's<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.880> few<00:03:22.209> levels<00:03:22.510> based<00:03:23.079> on<00:03:23.350> that

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
maybe there's a few levels based on that

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.979 
maybe there's a few levels based on that
movie<00:03:23.859> so<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.670> know<00:03:24.790> we<00:03:24.970> we<00:03:25.389> are<00:03:25.569> supposed<00:03:25.900> to

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
movie so you know we we are supposed to

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.140 
movie so you know we we are supposed to
have<00:03:26.109> super<00:03:26.440> saiyan<00:03:26.650> god<00:03:26.829> goku<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:27.819> that<00:03:27.970> would

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
have super saiyan god goku so that would

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.879 
have super saiyan god goku so that would
possibly<00:03:28.420> even<00:03:28.930> mean<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.440> we<00:03:29.530> get<00:03:29.709> like

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
possibly even mean that we get like

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.500 
possibly even mean that we get like
bills<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.609> you<00:03:30.670> know<00:03:30.760> characters<00:03:31.180> from<00:03:31.329> that

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
bills and you know characters from that

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.509 
bills and you know characters from that
movie<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.049> all<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.349> that<00:03:32.380> would<00:03:32.620> be<00:03:32.739> really

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
movie and all that that would be really

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.270 
movie and all that that would be really
cool<00:03:33.670> if<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:34.150> ask<00:03:34.180> me<00:03:34.690> but<00:03:35.290> anyway<00:03:35.980> like<00:03:36.190> I

say this about any DBZ game when it
comes<00:03:53.980> out<00:03:54.130> I'm<00:03:54.370> usually<00:03:54.579> very<00:03:54.819> critical<00:03:55.720> but

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
comes out I'm usually very critical but

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.949

what I'm seeing I am liking there's
little<00:03:59.319> things<00:03:59.530> that<00:03:59.680> they're<00:03:59.889> adding<00:04:00.190> here

for and honestly I can't wait to get

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.289 
for and honestly I can't wait to get
this<00:04:04.720> game<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.139> speaking<00:04:05.530> of<00:04:05.739> that<00:04:06.000> I'm<00:04:07.000> kind

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
this game and speaking of that I'm kind

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.170 
this game and speaking of that I'm kind
of<00:04:07.419> assuming<00:04:07.569> that<00:04:08.200> they<00:04:08.950> are<00:04:09.190> wanting<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.819> at

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
of assuming that they are wanting to at

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.699 
of assuming that they are wanting to at
least<00:04:10.359> go<00:04:10.720> up<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.079> booth<00:04:11.230> saga<00:04:11.560> or

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
least go up to the booth saga or

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.770 
least go up to the booth saga or
something<00:04:12.130> in<00:04:12.250> this<00:04:12.340> game<00:04:12.579> and<00:04:12.790> maybe<00:04:13.599> they

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
something in this game and maybe they

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.839 
something in this game and maybe they
only<00:04:13.989> have<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:14.620> same<00:04:14.829> and<00:04:15.130> Frieza<00:04:15.370> saugus

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
only have the same and Frieza saugus

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.259 
only have the same and Frieza saugus
complete<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.539> like<00:04:16.750> ready<00:04:17.079> to<00:04:17.169> go<00:04:17.410> so<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.609> don't

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
complete and like ready to go so I don't

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.630 
complete and like ready to go so I don't
know<00:04:19.359> we<00:04:19.510> haven't<00:04:19.630> gotten<00:04:19.900> any<00:04:20.079> really

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
know we haven't gotten any really

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.850 
know we haven't gotten any really
legitimate<00:04:21.640> formal<00:04:22.510> news<00:04:22.840> about<00:04:23.409> our<00:04:23.469> release

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
legitimate formal news about our release

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.469 
legitimate formal news about our release
dates<00:04:24.159> so<00:04:24.370> I'm<00:04:24.550> assuming<00:04:24.700> it's<00:04:25.090> going<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.330> take

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
dates so I'm assuming it's going to take

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.740 
dates so I'm assuming it's going to take
them<00:04:25.599> a<00:04:25.659> little<00:04:25.780> while<00:04:26.020> if<00:04:26.260> they<00:04:26.380> really

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
them a little while if they really

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.360 
them a little while if they really
want<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:26.960> finish<00:04:27.110> this<00:04:27.350> all<00:04:27.530> up<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.040> we

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
want to finish this all up and we

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.070 
want to finish this all up and we
haven't<00:04:28.550> even<00:04:28.670> gotten<00:04:28.940> an<00:04:29.270> estimated<00:04:29.900> release

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
haven't even gotten an estimated release

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.440 
haven't even gotten an estimated release
date<00:04:30.530> really<00:04:31.010> because<00:04:31.280> there's<00:04:31.430> been<00:04:31.640> a<00:04:31.850> ton

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
date really because there's been a ton

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.360 
date really because there's been a ton
of<00:04:32.690> release<00:04:32.990> date<00:04:33.230> skepticism<00:04:33.950> I've<00:04:34.100> made<00:04:34.340> a

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
of release date skepticism I've made a

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.360 
of release date skepticism I've made a
million<00:04:34.880> videos<00:04:35.210> on<00:04:35.540> what<00:04:36.500> my<00:04:36.650> theory<00:04:37.010> of<00:04:37.250> the

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
million videos on what my theory of the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.220 
million videos on what my theory of the
release<00:04:37.640> date<00:04:37.880> is<00:04:37.910> for<00:04:38.390> that<00:04:38.570> week<00:04:38.810> you<00:04:39.050> know
