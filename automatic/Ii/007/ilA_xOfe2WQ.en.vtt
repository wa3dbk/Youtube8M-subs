00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:13.260
 hello friends with you today yourself smart 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:16.860
 and we'll take a video on how to throw 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.510
 yourself ipy how can we reset it suddenly 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.880
 we have cycles opportunity network not 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.520
 It works like this 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.279
 I will unscrew the internet from us 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.090
 you may have a shutdown 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.910
 a case when you have no internet and 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.040
 Now I'm what for this Anapa 1 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.600
 the first thing we need to do is check 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.350
 network card driver removal 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.090
 reinstall 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.949
 that is, we check drivers 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.540
 I go to the management now see 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.059
 our drivers 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.570
 Well, we went to the device manager and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.519
 here we see if you have 10 you reflect 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.650
 there is some question or other 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.940
 devices install drivers for 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.159
 today network card 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.049
 remove old drivers and set by 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.180
 Download new driver from 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.030
 official site 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.190
 so the next is possible to check with you 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.619
 all stand correctly following us 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.520
 need to do a system restore 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.740
 roll back to the previous state and 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.210
 then maybe your network will start 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.500
 work the internet ie the following 3 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.040
 check for viruses computer check 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.060
 for viruses 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.220
 virus scan scan utilities 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.070
 there doctor web scanners for example and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.330
 after that maybe you will hit 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.150
 will find what viruses 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.310
 but in general I have a previous video I 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.610
 told what to do if not 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.540
 the site opens and there following 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.680
 maybe you have no virus but 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.810
 fourth point now view 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:58.560
