00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.819
 and then executive start 

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.000
 come out 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.390
 totally unique car 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.630
 which 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.270
 about the way the fighters of the fifth 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.670
 generations by the number of new 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.969
 technology 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.549
 Akb Pakhomov car 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.579
 47 golden eagle watch work afterburner 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.160
 engine and car instantly 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.089
 almost rises a year 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.810
 it happens due to 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.999
 aerodynamic layout 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.149
 47 itar tass is if i can say 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:27.609
 implemented michigan 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.560
 in the second ever high 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.759
 engaged in such aircraft 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.199
 and reverse sweep 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.220
 the wing on which business 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.920
 was implemented only here in Russia 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.720
 and only because of this 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.230
 so that we can finally create those 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.630
 materials that 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.760
 do not allow wings 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.740
 collapse under heavy loads 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.220
 are now away from the first half 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.310
 accompanying his plane he stayed by 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.250
 Essentially 1 Look at the drawing wing 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.900
 in the press that covered 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.920
 sets a completely unique form 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.010
 this toyota car 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.550
 unique opportunity 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.170
 but now we see 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.170
 that's what 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.700
 especially front mode engine not 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.950
 melo carries the aircraft allows 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.570
 do these currencies 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.000
 47 continues its flight 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.990
 I repeat this is a unique machine 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.790
 unique in its capabilities 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.450
 the plane on which new ones are being worked out 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.890
 technology demonstrator 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.110
 here you see working out the front 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.700
 horizontal tail plane 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.840
 at a practical minimum speed 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.230
 does not pass 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.720
 passes over our heads 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.400
 You see what a precise job 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.610
 and now I give the floor 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.280
 one more our expert 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.070
 CEO and you still dry films 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.640
 where was this car Michael 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.010
 aslanovich pohosyan and someone else remains 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.710
 steady 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.180
 the opinion that the best summer in the west 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.620
 until 410 Russia still 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.560
 I am sure this is advanced 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.980
 traditionally powers 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.410
 and the possibilities of our valiant in nothing 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.060
 inferior possible complexes which 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.110
 created by our foreign partners 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.480
 and when we talk about the future of aviation then I 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.720
 convinced that 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.729
 what is preserved scientific technical 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.550
 potential of our industry with you
