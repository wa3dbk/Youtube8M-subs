 revolverlab.com with an eye on technology 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.639
 iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus even have 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.920
 row six in the title of the sixth 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.570
 fact they are this already 9 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.360
 respectively 10 smartphone companies 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.960
 apple in some sense of the word jubilee as 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.210
 not a twist 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.699
 iphone 6 can be called the most 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.609
 loud announcement from apple since 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.050
 iphone 4 exit kupertinovtsy never 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.180
 did not make such drastic changes in 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.519
 design and size of devices exactly 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.550
 four years, the apple resisted and walked 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.750
 against the flow that moment when 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.910
 android smartphones grew by leaps and bounds 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.250
 iphone remained a classic example 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.960
 smartphone dialers but even such a giant 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.660
 how apple could not resist 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.559
 tempted and made a big smartphone with 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.360
 large display 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.030
 my name is Ivan Guchkov this site 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:55.920
 revolverlab.com iphone 6 review 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:58.410
 turn on the exterior iphone 6 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.539
 good on the one hand the company follows 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.520
 trends increasing device dimensions 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.650
 on the other hand in the design concept 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.260
 entered the very first developments 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.330
 I think you agree iphone 6 case 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.880
 similar to the first generation iphone 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.479
 exactly rounded shapes bring us back 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.880
 back to basics 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.040
 because of the increase in the size of the power key 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.990
 moved to the right side and this 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 absolutely right decision display 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.100
 the smartphone is neatly smoothed at the corners 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.259
 and in the color model space gray is created 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.479
 the impression that the display and housing 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.400
 device is one monolithic 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.310
 designs from design minuses 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.290
 bulging camera even and peephole 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.390
 protected by sapphire crystal it looks like 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.759
 at least strange now 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.619
 iphone 6 smartphone bulging camera 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.150
 will be a good motive to 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.000
 to put on an expensive case and 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.159
 level this bulging and last 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.320
 oddity design this is dividing 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.720
 strips on the back of the case in 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.850
 for many plums people even 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.920
 they didn’t believe that this would be the external 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.780
 kind of commercial version of the device in 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.060
 the rest is still the same old and kind 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.909
 iphone which pleasantly cools the hand and not 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.290
 raises doubts about the build quality 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.320
 it's amazing that iphone 6 has become thinner 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.039
 iphone 5s although it would seem why else 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.840
 thinner 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.390
 as for usability 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.850
 smart 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.890
 she is one-handed if you sat all the time 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.480
 on small iPhones and not prepared 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.910
 to exit iphone 6 exercising on 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.280
 androids i feel sorry for you max 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.230
 I would not give an estimate for the design of the iphone 6 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.000
 a ten-point scale I would put 8 with 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.250
 half points when you look at 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.200
 iphone 6 display and after on its 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.330
 paper specifications are not 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.970
 stop surprising it turns out 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.190
 4.7 inches display is not 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.140
 must have permission vibes 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.720
 to be the best display on 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.760
 market perfect viewing angles when turning 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.709
 which color palette does not change 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.690
 very soft picture and great 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.200
 figure of brightness and readability on 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.600
 the sun 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.610
 iphone of the very first model differed from 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.600
 competitors constancy and best 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.120
 display quality 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.670
 this time was no exception 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.830
 spare peppy huge performance in 2k 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.140
 and so on when you look at the display 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.370
 iphone 6 you have no desire 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.130
 delve into the technical specifications 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.959
 you just realizing what he is 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.239
 must be for a pleasant daily 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.430
 use iphone 6 display 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.440
 deserves 10 out of 10 points on my 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.910
 secret subjective scale which 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.299
 parameters should be in modern 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.959
 a smartphone to grunt everyone on the market 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.700
 multi-core gigabytes of RAM 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.340
 unhappy one gigabyte 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.260
 RAM dual core processor a8 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.120
 that's all you need to 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.250
 become better mobile gaming 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.430
 device in 2014 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.989
 Yes, and 2015, for sure, too, iphone 6 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.120
 shows amazing results in 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.489
 benchmarks with a larger display 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.010
 This is the best smartphone for games except 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.140
 Of course the iphone 6 is definitely in synthetics 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.390
 among android there are such monsters 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.940
 which surpass the iphone in terms of 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.100
 but by the number of games they are optimized for 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.470
 he simply has no competitors apple 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.690
 made a tricky move by removing the grocery 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.010
 ruler device with a memory capacity of 32 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.320
 gigabyte gradation 16 64 and 128 very 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.420
 strongly motivates the buyer to refuse 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.410
 from the minimum configuration and pay extra 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.730
 dollars for a version with 64 or 128 gigabytes 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.340
 lovers of mobile photography always 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.320
 appreciated iphone and iphone 6 won't become 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.330
 except yes he has no such 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.959
 Optical stabilization as in iphone 6 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.549
 plus 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.039
 but this is no worse 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.169
 remembering the presentation of iphone 6 many 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.629
 left bewilderment when they learned that in 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.520
 new iphone camera remains the same 8 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:32.470
 megapixels how much they told us about 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.930
 improved optics and savings in two 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.400
 times the amount of light in words 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.650
 it doesn't sound very convincing 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.990
 but in practice the quality of the photographs is 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.030
 compared to the iphone 5s has grown significantly 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.490
 you should not write off 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.590
 the previous suit this smartphone is capable 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.289
 take incredibly cool pictures 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.750
 My attitude to the world of iphone 6 remains 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.190
 the same as before iphone is the most 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.319

 photos of my instagram followers 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.940
 often ask what kind of smartphone was 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.560
 This or that photo is taken 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.990

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:11.050
 take pictures whenever possible 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.940
 video recording on iphone can also be long 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.849
 just tell how to tell 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.340

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.050
 knows but in the sixth iphone the apple company 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.639
 he significantly improved the musical 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.009
 component is now the sound from the headphones 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.139

 laughed at android users for 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.349
 indecent little battery life 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.630
 arrange the situation has changed dramatically 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.940
 the size of android devices increased to 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.889
 indecent values ​​and with him grew 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.169
 batteries android smartphones work 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:43.120
 much longer though merit it 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.039
 It is not a technological marvel and 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.349
 banal increase in capacity 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.539
 battery in iphone 6 failed

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.509
 longer than your big brother 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.310
 iphone 5s in video device mode 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.069

 brightness the rest is difficult to describe all 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.509

 mobile operator and type of communication one 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:11.259
 the day of full operation of the device can 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.240
 endure but nothing more for
