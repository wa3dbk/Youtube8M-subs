00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 mister and yes judging by your record 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.240
 list you have a great experience in 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.090
 trade but I never had to see 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.099
 take you into action she try what 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.770
 people don't sell with pleasure to you 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.420
 wanted to buy 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.880
 Here, for example, this pen I already have a lot 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.900
 years old 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:32.750
 try to sell me a new you 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.820
 have been using this pen for many years. 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:40.680
 mister pastor what quality pens for 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.730
 you important pen this pen you a lot 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.239
 write yes perhaps and you could clarify 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.940
 but probably well, probably half a day I sit with 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.110
 with a pen in one hand and with a telephone 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.350
 please tell me in another clearly 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.090
 you never run out of ink 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.039
 mid phone conversation about yes 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.290
 many times and usually at the most responsible 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.869
 the moment for example when you need to write 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.510
 The phone is clear and the other pen is with you 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.070
 always at hand is not usually accounted for 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.590
 fumble around the table or call for help 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.820
 secretary 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.310
 probably you would prefer not to think about 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.520
 what ink can run out true yes 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.369
 of course but how to do it while you 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.560
 I can use this pen 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.650
 show you another specifically for such 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.369
 people like you enough for half a year even 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.530
 if you write a lot imagine 6 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.909
 months you can write as many as you like 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.110
 without thinking about how it would end blackened 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.079
 half a year 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.460
 not bad of course tell mister pastor 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.170
 what else is important when you use pen 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.810
 when I write on the table with most 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.579
 there are no problems 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.439
 enter the data in the table of the joke 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.000
 here's the wall like these then my pen does not write 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.060
 so itâ€™s important for me to have a pen 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.860
 wrote on the wall understanding what's the point 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.310
 have a pen that cannot be written on 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.560
 the wall 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.270
 but in our pens provided 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.030
 can of pressure so you can 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.540
 write in any position 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.010
 even holding it vertically up with 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.040
 There are no entries in the wall problem tables. 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.230
 it will be interesting so mister foster we 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.660
 make sure that the ink in this pen 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.910
 enough for six months 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.709
 they write in any position so you 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.270
 will be able to make these wall tables 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.850
 then i will call and after dinner pen 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.170
 I will only have you 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:44.320
 the signature here is fine and I will take 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.850
 ten not bad miller thanks by the way 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.910

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.910
 price
