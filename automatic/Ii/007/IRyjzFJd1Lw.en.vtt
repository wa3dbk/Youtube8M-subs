00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.639
 hello to all then today in this video 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.220
 I wanted to show you what I took of 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.820
 new bean collection 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.860
 source in the world was I went 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.360
 mainly to see what i do 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.150
 could be of interest because obviously 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.550
 always from the sites you never understand if a 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.350
 product may like you or not 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.640
 and what I bought at the end is 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:36.130
 what struck me most though 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.350
 approved some little things to see if 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.170
 could interest me and for example one 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.140
 what I didn't like were i 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.910
 casal the pencil what from one 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.620
 part has a color and one on one side 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.930
 on the other side there is another color 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.450
 I didn't like it I was willing to 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.490
 try one but I didn't like it because 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.450
 I found them very hard so already 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.130
 on the hand 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.110
 the application on the hand made me 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.000
 bad so I thought to figured 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.360
 on the eye how it can do 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.549
 so I let it go this is 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.280
 the only product that I say 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.500
 disappointed in quotes when viewing online 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.630
 shop one thing instead on which I have 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.200
 left the eyes but then I have not 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.650
 taken and maybe I regretted it a little and I did 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.930
 two in one glaze had eyes 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.909
 fantastic bristles 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.890
 I was there redheads now take it there 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.090
 take I take then I said okay but 12 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.159
 euros I can save and I can 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.260
 take other because of brushes are 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.729
 really full however that was 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.070
 really great for those who are 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.100
 looking for an eye brush but I see it 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.360
 also suitable for the concealer also 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.900
 many other little things for those who are 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.090
 looking for 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.070
 I found it really good as 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.500
 bristles then you have to see after that one 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.159
 it washes as it works however first impact 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.260
 it was fantastic indeed good I know 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.869
 we will see maybe with the sales if there will be 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.430
 even further in time it 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.460
 I will definitely take it because it was 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.580
 really great 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.280
 ok i'll show you what i 've got 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:19.599
 took two things and they are an extra volume 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.140
 lip gloss that I took the 27th pal 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.140
 red 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.540
 this is the color here and it is me 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.599
 immediately liked what he has 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.049
 hit most of all he already has to see it 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.829
 so I thought this what I want 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.329
 then tried it convinced me even more 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.819
 if it focuses maybe you can see it too 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:47.120
 better color however is a fuchsia in 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.989
 fuchsia pink with golden reflections and lo 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.739
 swatch is this part is the sma fato 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.139
 I don't know if you can see it in the reflections 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.409
 but they are something spectacular 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:06.290
 I really loved it and it has 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:08.959
 a cost of 6 euros and 90 for 6.5 billion 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.260
 product and a duration of 12 months 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.700
 with a truly spectacular opening 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.419
 we will see how it will behave obviously 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.849
 on the lips and how much it lasts then I have 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:22.549
 wanted to take is a long lasting 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.739
 lipstick then I always took 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.040
 heels long lasting the shadow ones 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.569
 this time in the shop were not in fact 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.699
 I stayed there for a moment he says he doesn't 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.799
 they still arrived and therefore not 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:35.810
 I could see them live though already 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.699
 on the site they were colors that more or less not 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.290
 I was interested, however, maybe live 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.989
 a change ideal proof sees the 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.639
 but there were no nuances and therefore 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.829
 better for my portfolio because 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.590
 so I didn't buy a single one though 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.419
 this time he wanted to try those lipsic 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.139
 for the lips so I took the 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:59.750
 coloring and in their two that is this 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:04:01.970
 here and there I also show here and then 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.760
 blossomed here too the color is 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.460
 It is spectacular and very special to me 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.900
 loved it too 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.569
 I was 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.329
 I liked both 2 this the two so that 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.130
 the 3 however obviously this obviously 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:20.810
 maybe someone doesn't like it for me though 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.490
 to me it seemed a lot more color 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.449
 particular much nicer than the 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.850
 3 which maybe was a little more I don't want 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:31.280
 say banal but already seen while this 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.610
 I had never seen it is a rose has 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:41.560
 also launched this with reflections 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:44.630
 spectacular and beautiful and these were 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.880
 my purchases them of the colors in the 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.190
 word but I wanted to show you two more 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.169
 things because I was not me for balances 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.560
 approached by kiko instead this time 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.419
 precisely that I entered there I saw two 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.930
 little things and I wanted to take ho 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:03.650
 took a palette this does what it did 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:07.820
 part of the bike directs the number 3 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.460
 in use lavender that at the time had it 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.360
 I caught the eye but then I'd chosen 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:20.720
 opted for another 8 grams of product 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:24.380
 24 36 months from the opening and these are the 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:29.780
 colors are three colors matt is a color 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:32.510
 shimmer veils or blossomed here are a 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.680
 dark brown matt a cyclamen pink 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:40.099
 matt a pink shimmer is a lilac in fact 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.169
 I really liked lavender matt here 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.940
 the fact that brands are more colors 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.849
 shimmer I admit to me personally 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:50.690
 most like those matt and I have it 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:53.270
 paid 5 euros then another thing that me 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.520
 attracted and the color right from there 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.620
 exposed attracted me was a 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.820
 lipstick of those on offer now a 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.860
 one euro and 90 e and is the number 88 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:10.340
 also this in the very particular color 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:13.639
 so beautiful here I show it is 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.979
 blossomed this is a red not the 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.580
 classic red fire because a red more 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.770
 dark 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.670
 but I don't know if you see this, too 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.050
 of reflexes 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:27.140
 I could not even tell you what color 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:30.510
 I don't understand if I'm a little gold or 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:33.480
 I know a little red, but I don't know 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:35.280
 only that one color is fantastic and it is me 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:41.450
 immediately liked then for a plane 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:45.300
 90 even more ok this year all 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:47.910
 little thing I got from da kiko io 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.770
 I hope I have been helpful I send you a 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.670
 big kiss nor see you in the next 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.670
 hello video
