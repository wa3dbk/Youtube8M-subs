00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
within the electronic foot control so

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.070 
within the electronic foot control so
this<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.789> video<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.150> going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.420> show<00:00:18.510> how<00:00:18.779> and

here's why although I don't have bad

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.220 
here's why although I don't have bad
control<00:00:22.789> nice<00:00:23.789> slow<00:00:24.650> transition<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.949> fast<00:00:26.250> is

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.760 

see<00:00:31.230> that's<00:00:31.439> kind<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:32.750> kind<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.840> off<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.140> square

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
see that's kind of kind of off on square

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
then show you how I'm hooking up the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:02:43.990 
then show you how I'm hooking up the
electronic<00:00:59.430> control

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.670 

okay<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.060> here's<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.600> insides<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.350> stock

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
okay so here's the insides of the stock

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.340 
okay so here's the insides of the stock
control<00:02:49.130> hell-bent<00:02:50.130> first<00:02:50.400> out<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:51.140> wish<00:02:52.140> there

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
control hell-bent first out I wish there

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.509 
control hell-bent first out I wish there
was<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.500> way<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.130> convert<00:02:53.520> this<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:55.370> here's<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
was a way to convert this and here's the

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.370 
was a way to convert this and here's the
insides<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.209> new<00:02:57.360> control<00:02:57.750> I've<00:02:58.140> already

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
insides of the new control I've already

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.340 
insides of the new control I've already
taken<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.769> apart<00:02:59.120> it<00:03:00.120> comes<00:03:00.360> apart<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.989> goes

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
taken it apart it comes apart and goes

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.940 
taken it apart it comes apart and goes
together<00:03:01.530> pretty<00:03:01.890> easily<00:03:03.050> here's<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.230> there's

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
together pretty easily here's a there's

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.270 
together pretty easily here's a there's
not<00:03:05.130> much<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.970> little<00:03:06.239> circuit<00:03:06.570> board

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
not much to it that little circuit board

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.910 
not much to it that little circuit board
drives<00:03:08.280> all<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.610> function<00:03:09.019> of<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.500> control

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
drives all the function of the control

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:21.729 
drives all the function of the control
so<00:03:11.850> there's<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.209> old<00:03:14.600> there's<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.840> new<00:03:20.390> um

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
so there's the old there's the new um

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.240 
so there's the old there's the new um
I'll<00:03:22.739> unplug<00:03:23.780> machine<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:25.080> disconnect<00:03:25.709> these

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
I'll unplug machine and disconnect these

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
two wires here and then route them

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.030 
two wires here and then route them

here plug it in and reassemble the new

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.000 
here plug it in and reassemble the new
control<00:03:42.570> I<00:03:42.750> had<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.200> bit<00:03:43.410> of<00:03:43.440> trouble<00:03:43.680> putting

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
control I had a bit of trouble putting

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.530 
control I had a bit of trouble putting
the<00:03:44.100> strain<00:03:44.370> relief<00:03:44.519> on<00:03:44.940> that's<00:03:45.209> kind<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.450> a

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
the strain relief on that's kind of a

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.000 
the strain relief on that's kind of a
bugger<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.870> get<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> wrestle<00:03:46.500> around<00:03:46.560> with<00:03:46.860> it

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
bugger you get a wrestle around with it

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.670 
bugger you get a wrestle around with it
it<00:03:47.790> goes<00:03:48.000> from<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.299> outside<00:03:48.360> in<00:03:49.140> not<00:03:49.440> from<00:03:49.590> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
it goes from the outside in not from the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.610 
it goes from the outside in not from the
inside<00:03:49.980> out<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:51.540> then<00:03:51.750> part<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.080> it<00:03:52.200> clamps

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
inside out and then part of it clamps

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.539 
inside out and then part of it clamps
down<00:03:53.000> onto<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.150> onto<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:55.140> cord<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:56.280> then<00:03:56.430> you

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
down onto the onto the cord and then you

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.940 
down onto the onto the cord and then you
have<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.760> push<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.150> whole<00:03:57.299> thing<00:03:57.830> through<00:03:58.830> the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
have to push the whole thing through the

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.340 
have to push the whole thing through the
hole<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.489> in<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.820> bottom<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.419> of<00:04:01.169> the

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
hole in the in the bottom of the of the

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.750 
hole in the in the bottom of the of the
case<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.769> had<00:04:01.919> to<00:04:01.950> use<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> pair<00:04:02.609> of<00:04:02.639> pliers<00:04:03.590> to

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
case I had to use a pair of pliers to

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:14.119 
case I had to use a pair of pliers to
so<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:08.060> got<00:04:09.060> my<00:04:09.180> wiring<00:04:10.430> all<00:04:11.430> hooked<00:04:11.790> up<00:04:12.140> I'm<00:04:13.140> got

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
so I got my wiring all hooked up I'm got

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.580 
so I got my wiring all hooked up I'm got
the<00:04:14.280> part<00:04:14.489> plugged<00:04:14.760> in<00:04:15.229> now<00:04:16.229> I'll<00:04:16.350> just

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
the part plugged in now I'll just

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.370 
the part plugged in now I'll just
assemble<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.250> case<00:04:18.239> there's<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.720> there's<00:04:19.320> a

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
assemble the case there's a there's a

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.600 
assemble the case there's a there's a
slot<00:04:19.769> on<00:04:20.100> one<00:04:20.340> side<00:04:20.579> of<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:23.870> right<00:04:24.870> there<00:04:25.610> that

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
slot on one side of the right there that

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.879 
slot on one side of the right there that
goes<00:04:26.789> on<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.060> pivot<00:04:27.419> to<00:04:28.229> take<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.530> case<00:04:28.740> apart

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
goes on the pivot to take the case apart

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.659 
goes on the pivot to take the case apart
you<00:04:29.759> just<00:04:30.030> compress<00:04:30.780> it<00:04:30.990> at<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.350> at<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.370> slot

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
you just compress it at the at that slot

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.409 
you just compress it at the at that slot
slide<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:34.400> slide<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.580> hinge<00:04:35.759> down<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.300> I'll

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
slide that slide the hinge down and I'll

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:55.850 
slide that slide the hinge down and I'll
just<00:04:36.630> do<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.930> same<00:04:37.710> thing<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:38.070> Reverse<00:04:54.830> okay

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
just do the same thing in Reverse okay

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.950 
just do the same thing in Reverse okay
and<00:04:56.220> we'll<00:04:56.520> give<00:04:56.639> me<00:04:56.759> a<00:04:56.789> second<00:04:57.210> for<00:04:57.389> to<00:04:57.750> plug

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
and we'll give me a second for to plug

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.930 
and we'll give me a second for to plug
it<00:04:58.110> in<00:04:58.759> okay<00:04:59.759> so<00:05:00.120> we've<00:05:00.270> got<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.570> new<00:05:01.940> foot

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
it in okay so we've got the new foot

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.689 
it in okay so we've got the new foot
control<00:05:03.380> hooked<00:05:04.380> up<00:05:04.590> this<00:05:04.860> one's<00:05:05.070> electronic

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
control hooked up this one's electronic

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:13.210 
control hooked up this one's electronic
and<00:05:06.509> let's<00:05:07.169> see<00:05:07.349> what<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:07.590> difference<00:05:07.889> is

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.420 

okay

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
okay

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.830 
okay
it's<00:05:15.060> just<00:05:15.240> barely<00:05:15.479> touching<00:05:15.930> up

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:29.260 

alright<00:05:20.669> there's<00:05:21.669> much<00:05:22.210> more<00:05:22.540> control

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.730 

so<00:05:30.270> it's<00:05:30.419> not<00:05:30.539> the<00:05:30.720> on/off<00:05:31.020> switch<00:05:31.050> that<00:05:31.410> the

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
so it's not the on/off switch that the

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.030 
so it's not the on/off switch that the
old<00:05:31.860> control<00:05:32.250> was

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:50.570 

all<00:05:39.040> the<00:05:39.370> way<00:05:39.460> throughout

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:59.970 

okay<00:05:51.580> I<00:05:51.610> give<00:05:51.880> that<00:05:52.060> a<00:05:52.090> thumbs<00:05:52.300> up

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.040
