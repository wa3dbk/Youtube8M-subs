00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 so now it's about the playmobil 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.480
 Football is the prerequisite of the game 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.220
 first the playmobil football game has to be 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.620
 It takes two to build up 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.550
 playmobil footballer and someone creates 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.450
 a goalkeeper 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.279
 These are the gatekeepers here so that's it 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.820
 the goalie you can open here 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.430
 stick 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.090
 there is such a small bracket on 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.340
 gate 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.099
 of course, that can best hold because 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.050
 Then he can stretch his arms upwards 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.359
 on this little lever, the goalkeeper 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.550
 turn and with straight arms, it can 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.680
 Of course, the balls hold best 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.120
 you need two players for the game 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.380
 they choose one each 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.410

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.129
 the abutment point there you can the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:53.910
 put a small well on the legs 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:55.260
 there it shall then stand around it 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.870

 gates each the goal line here and there 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:18.060
 around the gate there is the repulsion and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.790
 around the gate is also the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.890
 so-called penalty room 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.210
