00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you that if you don't want to use your

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.800 
you that if you don't want to use your
own<00:01:13.560> thumper<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:14.970> go<00:01:15.090> ahead<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.299> press<00:01:15.450> m

own thumper you can go ahead and press m
and<00:01:15.840> look<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.350> icons<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.950> look<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.280> these

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and look for icons that look like these

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.060 
and look for icons that look like these
and<00:01:18.110> that<00:01:19.110> means<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.409> another<00:01:19.740> player<00:01:19.890> is

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and that means that another player is

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.590 
and that means that another player is
already<00:01:20.310> set<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.759> thumper<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.570> just

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
already set up a thumper so you can just

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.359 
already set up a thumper so you can just
go<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.049> waypoint<00:01:22.259> help<00:01:22.770> protect<00:01:23.130> there's

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
go to this waypoint help protect there's

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.490 
go to this waypoint help protect there's
and<00:01:23.610> you'll<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.880> part<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> Spoils<00:01:24.750> but

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and you'll get a part of the Spoils but

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.920 
and you'll get a part of the Spoils but
oftentimes<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.880> isn't<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.450> great<00:01:27.630> idea

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
oftentimes this isn't a great idea

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.330 
oftentimes this isn't a great idea
because<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.320> lot<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.560> players<00:01:28.799> will<00:01:29.040> set<00:01:29.220> up

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
because a lot of players will set up

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.010 
because a lot of players will set up
their<00:01:29.490> thumpers<00:01:29.880> without<00:01:30.329> knowing<00:01:30.720> how<00:01:30.960> many

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
resources are in the area because they

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.700 
resources are in the area because they

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
slam it down jet pack up a little bit

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.670 
slam it down jet pack up a little bit
and<00:02:03.030> you'll<00:02:03.180> see<00:02:03.329> these<00:02:03.479> white<00:02:03.750> waves<00:02:04.049> moving

and you'll see these white waves moving

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.760 
and you'll see these white waves moving
across<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:06.020> triangle<00:02:07.020> every<00:02:07.409> couple<00:02:07.649> of

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
across the triangle every couple of

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.550 
across the triangle every couple of
seconds<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.539> you<00:02:09.539> want<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.810> follow<00:02:09.989> where

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
seconds and you want to follow where

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.350 
seconds and you want to follow where
those<00:02:10.770> waves<00:02:11.129> are<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
those waves are going to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.960 
those waves are going to
as<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:13.140> go<00:02:13.320> closer<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:14.340> whatever<00:02:14.790> it's

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
as you go closer to whatever it's

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.430 
as you go closer to whatever it's
pointing<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.390> if<00:02:15.600> there's<00:02:15.750> going<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.960> be<00:02:16.020> more

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
pointing to if there's going to be more

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.810 
pointing to if there's going to be more
or<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.770> there<00:02:19.770> should<00:02:19.980> be<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.130> peek<00:02:20.370> at<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.700> end

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
or so there should be a peek at the end

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.180 
or so there should be a peek at the end
to<00:02:23.750> right<00:02:24.750> here<00:02:24.930> that's<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.200> beak<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
to right here that's the beak the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.710 
to right here that's the beak the
highest<00:02:26.520> point<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.030> we're<00:02:27.300> all<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.570> waves

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
highest point and we're all the waves

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.340 
highest point and we're all the waves
are<00:02:27.900> pointed<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.640> get<00:02:30.060> here<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:31.230> go

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
are pointed to so you get here you go

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.380 
are pointed to so you get here you go
ahead<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.650> see<00:02:31.740> how<00:02:31.800> much<00:02:31.920> there<00:02:32.100> is

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
ahead and see how much there is

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.340 
ahead and see how much there is
eighty-two<00:02:33.390> percent<00:02:33.420> that's<00:02:33.900> not<00:02:34.140> bad

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
eighty-two percent that's not bad

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.750 
eighty-two percent that's not bad
ideally<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.010> want<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.220> go<00:02:35.310> for<00:02:35.490> one<00:02:35.610> hundred

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
ideally you want to go for one hundred

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.510 
ideally you want to go for one hundred
percent<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:37.470> can't<00:02:37.680> always<00:02:37.890> find<00:02:38.220> that

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
percent but you can't always find that

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.610 
percent but you can't always find that
so<00:02:39.120> sometimes<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.140> have<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.290> deal<00:02:40.440> with

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
so sometimes you have to deal with

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.830 
so sometimes you have to deal with
anywhere<00:02:40.950> from<00:02:41.010> 80<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.490> 90<00:02:41.880> percent<00:02:42.270> that's

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
anywhere from 80 to 90 percent that's

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.300 
anywhere from 80 to 90 percent that's
still<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> lot<00:02:43.320> better<00:02:43.470> than<00:02:43.740> settling<00:02:44.100> for

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
still a lot better than settling for

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.500 
still a lot better than settling for
another<00:02:44.520> player<00:02:44.790> who<00:02:44.970> might<00:02:45.120> have<00:02:45.180> set<00:02:45.390> up
