00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.080
 hello this is a video tutorial for 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.270
 show them how you are going to change the 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.720
 applications with the information of the 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:14.060
 same with the tight year in backup if 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.179
 you usually say update or 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.250
 change the phone's software followed 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:22.310
 it is interesting not to lose the information 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.710
 of some applications or games of 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.490
 water if you those bones really do not 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.529
 I use many games so no one there is a 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.520
 it would work to attract me but if 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.900
 of some other applications 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.900
 for this it is very simple 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.670
 let's start 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.970
 cell phone we have to have installed 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.690
 from the market the taita nembra here is 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.220
 do this same I have the pro version 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.920
 that is to say that I bought it though and 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.540
 let's also say a light evaluation that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.890
 can download from marketing 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.320
 let's just say what they have to 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.510
 do is have to keep in mind that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.259
 to be able to use this they have to be 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.100
 root users there is no let's say a 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:11.310
 application of this type for users 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.009
 that do not have administrator access to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.340
 team that 's simply because the 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.850
 application information is in 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.740
 the system files 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.610
 once we enter the country of cow 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.260
 we have 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.700
 this symbol there and if we come here we see 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.490
 backup copy all 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.010
 user applications and notice that 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.350
 we have some other options data of 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.770
 systems and applications more users 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.100
 data copy system because I do not say 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.100
 the system data because restore 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.750
 system data in some other snores 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.130
 we have installed what it will bring is 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.770
 conflict and we probably have 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.500
 many because of crisis and we have to 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.300
 reinstall then let's say I would like 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.300
 install the note s 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.890
 for nothing android as some are 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.690
 rooms that have the touchwiz interface 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.870
 we are going to have errors and probably 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.030
 we have to reinstall the rice 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.510
 so I usually what I do is 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.269
 I make a backup of the system with the cloud 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.349
 bourbon and cow applications 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.880
 but in this way we play do it here 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.600
 we can choose all applications 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.240
 What we want 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.760
 to weather we can say for 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.280
 default in my case I have to 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.590
 changed all we do is a 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.890
 that we select we give to the team of 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.890
 up here 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.240
 let say 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.610
 this will show us and it will tell us 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.920
 let's say the progress 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.520
 obviously let's see I'm not going to make ourselves 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.470
 wait 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.480
 online so 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.840
 I have a low battery, that's why you're 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.970
 asking came in energy saving mode 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.630
 but with this this took a while 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.630
 When this is over, we come back 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.540
 good we see that the backup finally 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.660
 ends once it ends it goes by 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.150
 movement once those who cap it 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.420
 we ended up showing in the area of 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.450
 notification that the copy job has 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.060
 finalized basically once 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.760
 we have this what we can do is 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.560
 integrate it with let's say with dropbox 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.790
 I have, let's say at this moment, 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.410
 deactivated here but I have 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.350
 integration with dropbox is to say that 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.570
 synchronize this backup with my folder 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.790
 dropbox in case at some point 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.790
 let's say on the sd card 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.560
 once we made the backup it's like 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.409
 we restore forgiveness a little bit there is how 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.430
 we do to restore if we change from 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:05.189
 good thing to do is install one is 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.190
 that we are here we go to the same menu that 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:10.760
 before 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:14.200
 to the restoration part and restore and 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:18.889
 see what network whatever it is restore 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.650
 missing apps with your data if your mouth 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.530
 I will look again list 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.419
 applications that are missing in this 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.689
 rom yes yes the case is that there was some 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.969
 application that has already installed the 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:33.650
 we can erase and restore but not 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:36.110
 restore over by is generally 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.529
 conflicting because the 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.689
 versions because the data does not match 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:44.840
 with the evaluation then basically 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.999
 what we are going to do is choose those 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.409
 that we want and restore once 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:50.389
 restored because you're actually 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:53.330
 applications are applications of others 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.370
 android versions some where 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.620
 read well then we left one hundred meters 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.039
 there were problems but basically let's say 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.949
 can choose choose apps more data and 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.960
 then it's not that they choose what they are 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.199
 the applications that have restore it 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.580
 give the tiger that is there let's say that is 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.050
 just once they finish they go to 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.419
 have not only the applications 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.310
 installed but also going to be the 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.589
 applications installed with the 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.849
 information at the moment in what 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:22.969
 made 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.589
 I hope this video was useful 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.619
 finally there are enough doubts 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:30.439
 how it works and also cow this 

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:33.800
 let's say it's pretty simple we see it has 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:36.740
 some others as I said they can 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.509
 restore can more ride and restore 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.029
 system applications 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:43.399
 I do not recommend it except in cases 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:46.689
 where they are restoring the same version 

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:51.819
 from darron bueno I hope it's useful 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.819
 anything they ask me now
