so we wait for this to be done verily

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.230 
so we wait for this to be done verily
putting<00:04:49.410> anything<00:04:49.620> new<00:04:49.919> so<00:04:50.550> it's<00:04:50.699> last<00:04:50.910> time<00:04:51.150> I

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
putting anything new so it's last time I

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.850 
putting anything new so it's last time I
think<00:04:51.479> it<00:04:51.660> stopped<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.889> pictures<00:04:54.830> so<00:04:55.830> I

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
think it stopped the pictures so I

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.930 
think it stopped the pictures so I
really<00:04:56.220> shouldn't<00:04:56.550> take<00:04:56.729> that<00:04:56.910> long

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940
