00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.500
 I'm following 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.900
 love 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.900
 what 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.800
 Oh 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.830
 Hmm 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.830
 Hmm 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.800
 Ah ah ah 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.800
 Hmm 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:43.030
 It's a small pencil but it's hard to use 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:47.320
 Quite that Tteyuu seems it is I'd often I 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:51.640
 Quite in the thread there is no resistance gone out on the surface of the water 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.460
 There is a thing that movement is hard to put out that thread is pulled, but 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:59.809
 Of this page 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:06.020
 Since I made it with emphasis on the part that it was easy to handle it, 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:10.180
 The work signature of will come out quite smoothly, so I will use it very much 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:15.700
 I think that comfort is sustained and finished for editing 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:20.310
 That's right, I've sent music , but that's how it works well, but 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.110
 First cast then after cast 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:29.260
 line as much as possible it is is 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.310
 First of all, the main premise is to roll the line so that it falls in a straight line 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.820
 So much 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:41.920
 Yes This is how the lure is pulled by the thread when the line is sagging 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.100
 Because it does not move only if it moves to the end, it will eliminate the slack as good as possible 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.270
 Is the best 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.800
 It is a tip in moving this 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:55.490
 The other the Most parents are after 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:02:01.230
 In ale than you enough movement much'll tapping this out to have yarn dandruff 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:07.290
 Instead of trying to move that lure , let's do it like this 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:08.190
 It's not the easiest thing to move if you can do it with an image that lets you play it 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.460
 I think 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.540
 Toka PC often 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.540
 I understand that
