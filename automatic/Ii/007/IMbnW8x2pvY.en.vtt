00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
brush it looks like that it is very

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.429

dense<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.910> not<00:00:30.119> flimsy<00:00:30.689> at<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:30.929> they<00:00:31.199> have

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
dollars and forty-five cents I think

it's somewhere around that but I'll just
compare<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.219> elf<00:00:38.520> complexion<00:00:39.120> brush

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it's pretty massive it's still quite

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.750

already<00:01:24.900> watched<00:01:25.080> them<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.350> they<00:01:25.439> haven't

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
already watched them and they haven't

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.690 
already watched them and they haven't
showed<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:25.950> all<00:01:26.040> which<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.189> pretty<00:01:26.490> impressive

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
showed at all which is pretty impressive

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.520 
showed at all which is pretty impressive
let's<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.330> go<00:01:27.479> ahead<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.200> straight

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
let's just go ahead and get straight

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.170 
let's just go ahead and get straight
into<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.189> first<00:01:29.610> impression<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.090> I've

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
into the first impression so I've

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.149 
into the first impression so I've
already<00:01:30.390> bronze<00:01:30.750> up<00:01:30.990> my<00:01:31.020> face<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.890> kind<00:01:32.130> of

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
already bronze up my face just kind of

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.890 
already bronze up my face just kind of
put<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.490> where<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.820> would<00:01:33.119> normally<00:01:33.270> bronze<00:01:33.750> my

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
put it where I would normally bronze my

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.690 
put it where I would normally bronze my
face<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.380> I'm<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.770> use<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> massive

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
face and I'm going to use it's a massive

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.760 
face and I'm going to use it's a massive
a<00:01:35.970> contour<00:01:36.420> brush<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:36.869> going<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.170> attempt<00:01:37.650> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
a contour brush I'm going to attempt to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
a contour brush I'm going to attempt to
contour<00:01:38.430> my<00:01:38.820> face<00:01:38.850> I'm<00:01:39.329> gonna<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.659> using<00:01:39.840> my

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
contour my face I'm gonna be using my

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.840 
contour my face I'm gonna be using my
Australis<00:01:40.560> HD<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:40.979> tool<00:01:41.159> palette<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.700> I'm

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
Australis HD on tool palette and I'm

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.429 
Australis HD on tool palette and I'm
just<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.360> using<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.049> spray

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
just going to be using that to spray

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.650 
just going to be using that to spray
shade<00:01:43.920> better<00:01:44.220> Oh

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.550 

let's<00:01:48.660> align<00:01:48.930> they're<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.620> too<00:01:50.010> bad<00:01:54.560> all

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
let's align they're not too bad all

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.290 
let's align they're not too bad all
right<00:01:55.620> that's<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.070> good<00:01:56.100> solid<00:01:56.490> contour<00:01:57.090> line

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
right that's a good solid contour line

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.360 
right that's a good solid contour line
say<00:01:57.630> first<00:01:57.900> impressions<00:01:58.380> picks<00:01:58.740> up<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.070> lot<00:01:59.250> of

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
say first impressions picks up a lot of

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.040 
say first impressions picks up a lot of
powder<00:01:59.610> even<00:02:00.060> though<00:02:00.150> it's<00:02:00.360> synthetic<00:02:00.630> a

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
powder even though it's synthetic a

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.270 
powder even though it's synthetic a
little<00:02:01.290> bit<00:02:01.380> goes<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> long<00:02:01.740> way<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:01.980> just

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
little bit goes a long way so just

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.920 
little bit goes a long way so just
dabbing<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.150> as<00:02:03.360> well

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
dabbing it as well

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.900 
dabbing it as well
I'm<00:02:04.020> going<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:04.710> how<00:02:04.980> good<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.550> blend

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
I'm going to see how good it is to blend

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.810 
I'm going to see how good it is to blend
out<00:02:09.050> okay<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.350> was<00:02:10.500> me<00:02:10.710> being<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.670> bad

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
out okay so that was me being really bad

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.610 
out okay so that was me being really bad
at<00:02:12.060> doing<00:02:12.210> my<00:02:12.420> contour<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.260> little<00:02:13.530> bit

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
at doing my contour it is a little bit

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.290 
at doing my contour it is a little bit
hard<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.980> find<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.340> out<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.820> actually<00:02:14.940> did

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
hard to find it out and I actually did

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.080 
hard to find it out and I actually did
put<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.810> lot<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.260> contour<00:02:17.070> powder<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.790> that's

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
put a lot of contour powder on so that's

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.880 
put a lot of contour powder on so that's
after<00:02:21.330> me<00:02:21.600> blending<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.620> little<00:02:22.830> bit

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
after me blending it in a little bit

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.380 
after me blending it in a little bit
more<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.280> would<00:02:23.340> normally<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.880> take<00:02:24.120> another

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
more I would normally just take another

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.090 
more I would normally just take another
brush<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.870> just<00:02:25.140> want<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.410> go<00:02:25.709> over<00:02:25.890> it

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
brush and just just want to go over it

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.920 
brush and just just want to go over it
and<00:02:26.370> blend<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.910> again<00:02:27.060> it's<00:02:27.540> something<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.810> I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
and blend it again it's something that I

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.330 
and blend it again it's something that I
wouldn't<00:02:28.230> normally<00:02:28.320> do<00:02:30.590> see<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:32.070> did<00:02:32.220> that

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
wouldn't normally do see I just did that

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.400 
wouldn't normally do see I just did that
tiny<00:02:32.670> stroke<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.390> was<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.840> didn't<00:02:34.200> have<00:02:34.230> to

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
tiny stroke that was it I didn't have to

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.830 
tiny stroke that was it I didn't have to
do<00:02:34.530> much<00:02:34.560> at<00:02:34.860> all

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.600 

I'm<00:02:41.840> just<00:02:42.050> going<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.260> go<00:02:42.350> ahead<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.740> try<00:02:43.340> and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
I'm just going to go ahead and try and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.610 
I'm just going to go ahead and try and
contour<00:02:44.000> my<00:02:44.150> nose<00:02:44.180> with<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:44.870> really<00:02:45.380> thick

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
contour my nose with this really thick

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.130 
contour my nose with this really thick
master<00:02:45.950> brush<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.340> see<00:02:46.490> if<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.760> works<00:02:49.960> put<00:02:50.960> way

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
master brush and see if it works put way

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.290 
master brush and see if it works put way
too<00:02:51.170> much<00:02:51.530> product<00:02:51.890> on<00:02:52.100> as<00:02:52.310> usual<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:52.940> yeah

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
too much product on as usual and yeah

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.360 
too much product on as usual and yeah
pretty<00:02:53.930> bad<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.710> a<00:02:54.740> little<00:02:54.890> bit<00:02:55.010> hard<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.220> do

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
pretty bad it is a little bit hard to do

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.590 
pretty bad it is a little bit hard to do
this<00:02:55.490> because<00:02:55.580> it's<00:02:55.790> quite<00:02:56.030> thick

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
this because it's quite thick

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.830 
this because it's quite thick
why<00:02:56.720> did<00:02:56.960> I<00:02:57.020> put<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.530> much<00:02:57.680> on<00:02:58.450> I'm<00:02:59.450> just<00:02:59.690> gonna

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
why did I put so much on I'm just gonna

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.390 
why did I put so much on I'm just gonna
go<00:03:00.020> ahead<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.260> blend<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.710> out<00:03:00.800> see<00:03:01.160> how<00:03:01.190> it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
go ahead and blend it out see how it

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.230 
go ahead and blend it out see how it
goes<00:03:01.580> this<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.270> not<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.990> best<00:03:03.140> look<00:03:03.850> it's<00:03:04.850> okay

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
goes this is not the best look it's okay

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.300 
goes this is not the best look it's okay
and<00:03:05.510> applying<00:03:05.840> onto<00:03:06.440> Patino's<00:03:06.920> it's<00:03:07.130> really

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
and applying onto Patino's it's really

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.470 
and applying onto Patino's it's really
not<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.520> best<00:03:07.550> I<00:03:07.880> probably<00:03:08.210> wouldn't

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
not the best I probably wouldn't

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.850 
not the best I probably wouldn't
recommend<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:09.050> and<00:03:09.140> it's<00:03:09.320> really<00:03:09.470> hard<00:03:09.710> to

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
recommend it and it's really hard to

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.140 
recommend it and it's really hard to
find<00:03:10.010> out<00:03:10.220> I'm<00:03:10.430> just<00:03:10.610> gonna<00:03:10.700> go<00:03:10.910> ahead<00:03:11.000> and

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
find out I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.550 
find out I'm just gonna go ahead and
blend<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.600> out<00:03:11.720> with<00:03:11.750> this<00:03:12.020> elf<00:03:12.260> brush<00:03:14.560> okay

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
blend it out with this elf brush okay

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
I was expecting it to be really hard to

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.860 
I was expecting it to be really hard to
burn<00:04:20.400> down<00:04:20.550> to<00:04:20.730> be<00:04:20.940> thick<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.390> bulky<00:04:21.630> because

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
burn down to be thick and bulky because

burn down to be thick and bulky because
of<00:04:22.200> its<00:04:22.440> size<00:04:22.590> but<00:04:23.100> it's<00:04:23.460> got<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:23.640> really<00:04:23.820> nice

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
edge and you can really get that contour
