00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
how to look at cars properly you could

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.389 
how to look at cars properly you could
already<00:00:34.200> tell<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.829> thing<00:00:35.040> probably

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
already tell that this thing probably

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.850

the<00:00:40.200> front<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:41.070> know<00:00:41.160> another<00:00:41.460> thing<00:00:41.550> about

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the front you know another thing about

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.090 
the front you know another thing about
Quattro's<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:43.290> everything<00:00:43.800> should<00:00:43.950> be

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
Quattro's is that everything should be

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.029 
Quattro's is that everything should be
the<00:00:44.250> same<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> what<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.239> mean<00:00:45.480> by<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:46.260> that

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the same and what I mean by that is that

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.319 
the same and what I mean by that is that
the<00:00:47.129> tire<00:00:47.370> should<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> same<00:00:48.090> they

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the tire should be the same they

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.340 
the tire should be the same they
shouldn't<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.750> pay<00:00:49.020> different<00:00:49.670> sizes<00:00:50.670> or

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
shouldn't have pay different sizes or

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
shouldn't have pay different sizes or
staggered<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.469> don't<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.280> these

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
staggered you don't do that to these

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.770 
staggered you don't do that to these
cars<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.000> throws<00:00:54.149> them<00:00:54.270> all<00:00:54.449> off<00:00:54.629> so

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
cars because it throws them all off so

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.990 
cars because it throws them all off so
obviously<00:00:55.440> both<00:00:55.680> sides<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.430> need<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.670> now

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
obviously both sides really need it now

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.450 
obviously both sides really need it now
this<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.210> something<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.070> I'll<00:00:59.070> tell<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.430> I

86 yeah it does have a little rust in
that<00:01:05.220> little<00:01:05.460> corner<00:01:05.640> sometimes<00:01:06.180> you'll<00:01:06.360> see

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
that little corner sometimes you'll see

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.980 
that little corner sometimes you'll see
it<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.229> necessarily<00:01:08.360> do<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.689> rust

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it but not necessarily do you see rust

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.010 
it but not necessarily do you see rust
on<00:01:10.200> these<00:01:10.380> vehicles<00:01:10.909> because<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.720> zinc

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
on these vehicles because the the zinc

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.600 
on these vehicles because the the zinc
when<00:01:13.260> they<00:01:13.380> dip<00:01:13.619> these<00:01:13.830> cars<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.369> just

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
when they dip these cars was just

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.190 
when they dip these cars was just
amazing<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.210> some<00:01:15.479> strange<00:01:15.780> reason<00:01:15.869> that

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
amazing but for some strange reason that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.399 
amazing but for some strange reason that
this<00:01:16.409> particular<00:01:17.220> car<00:01:17.700> has<00:01:17.729> rusting<00:01:18.689> over

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
this particular car has rusting over

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.800 
this particular car has rusting over
here<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.180> actually<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> first

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
here but this is actually the first

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
here but this is actually the first
eight<00:01:22.110> four<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.560> I've<00:01:22.710> seen<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.130> that

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
eight four that I've seen like that that

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.570 
eight four that I've seen like that that
may<00:01:23.850> mean<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.170> yeah<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.890> fender

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
may mean that yeah that this this fender

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.280 
may mean that yeah that this this fender
was<00:01:26.700> painted<00:01:27.180> probably<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:27.869> an<00:01:27.960> aftermarket

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
was painted probably with an aftermarket

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.980 
was painted probably with an aftermarket
fender<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.729> probably<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.420> reason<00:01:30.810> why

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
fender and that's probably a reason why

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.710 
fender and that's probably a reason why
it<00:01:31.049> was<00:01:31.259> probably<00:01:31.530> cheap<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.130> then<00:01:32.909> sometimes

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
it was probably cheap and then sometimes

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.600 
it was probably cheap and then sometimes
what<00:01:33.869> happens<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.409> see<00:01:34.650> look<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.130> even<00:01:35.430> worse

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
what happens is see look it's even worse

things brand new what will happen with

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.740 
things brand new what will happen with
these<00:02:46.100> is<00:02:46.400> when<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.000> first<00:02:47.209> start<00:02:47.330> them<00:02:47.660> in

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
these is when you first start them in

the morning they will always have a
little<00:02:53.690> tapping<00:02:54.110> noise<00:02:54.260> up<00:02:54.470> at<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.680> top<00:02:54.890> for

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
little tapping noise up at the top for

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.979 
little tapping noise up at the top for
about<00:02:55.430> five<00:02:55.730> seconds<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.300> then<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.540> goes<00:02:56.690> away

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
about five seconds and then it goes away

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.320 
about five seconds and then it goes away
very<00:02:57.370> common<00:02:58.370> on<00:02:58.489> these<00:02:58.610> three<00:02:58.880> O's<00:02:59.060> it's

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
very common on these three O's it's

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.910 
very common on these three O's it's
almost<00:02:59.540> like<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.840> oil<00:03:00.020> just<00:03:00.260> doesn't<00:03:00.620> stay<00:03:00.770> up

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
almost like the oil just doesn't stay up

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.190 
almost like the oil just doesn't stay up
there<00:03:01.070> properly<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.270> will<00:03:02.690> find<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:03.110> a
