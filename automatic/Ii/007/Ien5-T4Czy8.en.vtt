your remote is now able to control

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.620 
your remote is now able to control
iTunes<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.280> want<00:02:03.429> to<00:02:03.489> press<00:02:03.670> ok<00:02:04.060> we're

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
iTunes so you want to press ok we're

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.630 
iTunes so you want to press ok we're
done<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.560> there<00:02:05.770> you<00:02:05.890> go<00:02:06.069> you<00:02:06.130> have<00:02:06.250> them

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
done and there you go you have them

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.600 
done and there you go you have them
paired<00:02:06.970> in<00:02:07.239> so<00:02:07.660> step<00:02:07.989> number<00:02:08.200> 3<00:02:08.649> consists<00:02:09.550> of

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
paired in so step number 3 consists of

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.330 
paired in so step number 3 consists of
the<00:02:09.789> basic<00:02:10.239> operations<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:11.470> let's<00:02:11.680> go<00:02:11.890> on<00:02:12.069> to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
the basic operations so let's go on to
