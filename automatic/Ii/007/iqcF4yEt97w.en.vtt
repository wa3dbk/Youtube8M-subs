00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
hi this is a jailbroken iOS follow me on

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.080 
hi this is a jailbroken iOS follow me on
Twitter<00:00:20.250> basically<00:00:21.250> all<00:00:21.520> I'm<00:00:21.760> going<00:00:21.880> to<00:00:21.940> do

today is show you a little tweak the

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.310 
today is show you a little tweak the
when<00:00:27.070> I<00:00:27.100> first<00:00:27.190> got<00:00:27.610> my<00:00:27.790> iPhone<00:00:28.180> I<00:00:28.510> found<00:00:28.840> that

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
when I first got my iPhone I found that

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.830 
when I first got my iPhone I found that
I'd<00:00:29.740> had<00:00:29.980> like<00:00:30.190> the<00:00:30.310> 3GS<00:00:30.790> and<00:00:31.180> then<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.540> four

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
I'd had like the 3GS and then the four

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.970 
I'd had like the 3GS and then the four
beforehand<00:00:32.559> but<00:00:33.460> when<00:00:34.150> I<00:00:34.270> opening<00:00:34.660> up<00:00:34.809> apps<00:00:35.080> it

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
beforehand but when I opening up apps it

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.910 
beforehand but when I opening up apps it
just<00:00:36.640> seemed<00:00:37.330> so<00:00:38.370> slow<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:41.290> it<00:00:41.440> actually

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
just seemed so slow and and it actually

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.619 
just seemed so slow and and it actually
did<00:00:42.129> my<00:00:42.280> head<00:00:42.430> in<00:00:42.580> and<00:00:42.970> so<00:00:43.150> search<00:00:43.360> around

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
did my head in and so search around

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:44.970 
did my head in and so search around
everywhere<00:00:43.989> to<00:00:44.140> see<00:00:44.350> if<00:00:44.470> there<00:00:44.650> was<00:00:44.770> anything

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
everywhere to see if there was anything

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.860 
everywhere to see if there was anything
that<00:00:45.160> week<00:00:45.580> you<00:00:45.879> know<00:00:46.000> you<00:00:46.059> could<00:00:46.270> speed<00:00:46.660> up

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
that week you know you could speed up

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.950 
that week you know you could speed up
and<00:00:47.940> speed<00:00:48.940> up<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.210> actual<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.750> whole

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
and speed up the actual the whole

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.960 
and speed up the actual the whole
process<00:00:50.320> of<00:00:50.620> this<00:00:50.800> and<00:00:51.489> there<00:00:51.640> was<00:00:51.730> something

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
process of this and there was something

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.049 
process of this and there was something
count<00:00:52.360> there<00:00:53.040> and<00:00:54.040> it's<00:00:54.280> actually<00:00:54.460> called

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
count there and it's actually called

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.969 
count there and it's actually called
it's<00:00:55.570> just<00:00:55.780> simple<00:00:56.019> well<00:00:56.110> simply<00:00:56.559> called<00:00:56.830> a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
it's just simple well simply called a

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.509 
it's just simple well simply called a
speed<00:00:57.280> intensifier<00:00:58.080> so<00:00:59.080> as<00:00:59.500> you<00:00:59.680> can<00:00:59.739> see<00:00:59.800> it's

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
speed intensifier so as you can see it's

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.340 
speed intensifier so as you can see it's
coming<00:01:00.760> beyond<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.089> default<00:01:01.629> and<00:01:01.870> for<00:01:02.199> some

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
coming beyond the default and for some

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.110 
coming beyond the default and for some
reason<00:01:02.650> you<00:01:02.769> can<00:01:02.920> make<00:01:03.070> it<00:01:03.250> slower

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
reason you can make it slower

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.240 
reason you can make it slower
I<00:01:04.150> don't<00:01:04.690> know<00:01:04.750> why<00:01:05.080> people<00:01:05.650> want<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:05.890> do<00:01:06.070> that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
I don't know why people want to do that

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.160 
I don't know why people want to do that
or<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:07.570> can<00:01:07.720> do<00:01:07.900> it

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
or you can do it

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.330 
or you can do it
fastest<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.830> after<00:01:12.340> you<00:01:12.430> do<00:01:12.549> the<00:01:12.670> changes

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
fastest so after you do the changes

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.910 
fastest so after you do the changes
still<00:01:15.340> a<00:01:15.370> respring<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:17.080> your<00:01:17.260> changes<00:01:17.710> to

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
still a respring for your changes to

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.190 
still a respring for your changes to
make<00:01:18.430> effect<00:01:18.820> I've<00:01:19.030> got<00:01:19.210> fast<00:01:19.570> read<00:01:19.869> spring

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
make effect I've got fast read spring

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.950 
make effect I've got fast read spring
which<00:01:21.130> just<00:01:21.399> search<00:01:21.670> on<00:01:22.000> I<00:01:22.390> think<00:01:22.689> it's<00:01:22.780> on<00:01:22.899> the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
which just search on I think it's on the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.859 
which just search on I think it's on the
BigBoss<00:01:23.320> repo<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:25.210> it<00:01:25.360> does<00:01:25.509> it<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.659> lot

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
BigBoss repo and it does it a lot

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.330 
BigBoss repo and it does it a lot
quicker<00:01:27.869> anyway<00:01:28.869> so<00:01:29.409> this<00:01:29.649> will<00:01:29.890> see<00:01:30.310> a

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
quicker anyway so this will see a

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.539 
quicker anyway so this will see a
dramatic<00:01:31.329> change<00:01:32.200> in<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.710> speed<00:01:33.039> that<00:01:33.310> apps

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
dramatic change in the speed that apps

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.730 
dramatic change in the speed that apps
open<00:01:33.820> up<00:01:34.119> don't<00:01:34.600> worry<00:01:34.780> about<00:01:34.899> that<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.710> now

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
open up don't worry about that so now

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.789 
open up don't worry about that so now
when<00:01:39.159> we<00:01:39.189> go<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.460> open<00:01:39.700> Twitter<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:41.439> done

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
when we go to open Twitter it's done

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.569 
when we go to open Twitter it's done
straight<00:01:42.250> away<00:01:42.630> messages<00:01:44.280> straight<00:01:45.280> away

phone everything is just so much so much
quicker<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:53.409> can<00:01:53.560> see<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:54.100> spinning

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
quicker and you can see the spinning

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.940 
quicker and you can see the spinning
spinning<00:01:57.219> icon<00:01:57.490> it's<00:01:58.119> just<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:58.869> so<00:01:59.469> much

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
spinning icon it's just so so much

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.669 
spinning icon it's just so so much
quicker<00:02:00.390> there's<00:02:01.390> also<00:02:01.570> an<00:02:02.049> add-on<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.380> this

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
quicker there's also an add-on to this

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.080 
quicker there's also an add-on to this
now<00:02:02.890> as<00:02:03.100> well<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:03.820> can<00:02:03.969> actually

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
now as well that you can actually

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:12.270 
now as well that you can actually
overclock<00:02:05.049> your<00:02:05.079> device<00:02:07.500> which<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:11.280> think

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
overclock your device which I think

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.920 
overclock your device which I think
that's<00:02:12.400> one<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.420> from<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.720> same

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
that's one that is this from the same

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.760 
that's one that is this from the same
repo<00:02:14.940> big<00:02:15.940> boss<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.540> will<00:02:17.140> just<00:02:17.380> check<00:02:17.560> and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
repo big boss so I will just check and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.570 
repo big boss so I will just check and
input<00:02:18.040> there<00:02:18.250> put<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.640> links<00:02:18.940> below<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:20.580> yeah

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
input there put the links below so yeah

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.640 
input there put the links below so yeah
which<00:02:21.790> just<00:02:22.510> speeds<00:02:22.810> up<00:02:23.020> absolutely

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
which just speeds up absolutely

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.950 
which just speeds up absolutely
everything<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.130> makes<00:02:24.580> your<00:02:24.730> device<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:25.510> much

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
everything so makes your device so much

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.080 
everything so makes your device so much
quick

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
quick

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.540 
quick
just<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:27.870> much<00:02:28.019> better<00:02:28.290> than<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:28.950> was<00:02:29.099> before<00:02:29.160> I

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
just so much better than it was before I

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.199 
just so much better than it was before I
think<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:30.269> opens<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:31.050> an<00:02:31.170> absolute<00:02:31.590> instant

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
think just opens in an absolute instant

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.880 
think just opens in an absolute instant
but<00:02:33.209> I'll<00:02:33.330> see<00:02:33.510> if<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.840> have<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.410> if<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.709> see

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
but I'll see if you have like if you see

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
down here I have like the bouncy icons
