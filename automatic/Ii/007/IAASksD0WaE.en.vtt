00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.189
 This is a sort of final say 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.320
 last season we are third 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.769
 and then you have preliminary Europe 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.110
 league 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.769
 and if we win tomorrow we will be 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.330
 in the europa league 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.010
 and for that you have last season 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.539
 naturally played football 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.600
 to finally get something I prize 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.039
 and that would be that price tomorrow if 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.310
 if it is difficult , it is difficult 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.960
 to become 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.789
 and I see it as a challenge and have 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.830
 I have faith in ours 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.410
 players that they can play their game 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.960
 tomorrow what we want and then have to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.010
 we go for profit

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.320
 sir we are right there 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.480

 seemed so 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.500
 or butterfly pitching will spoil 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.629
 tomorrow and I think sometimes for a whole 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.730
 fixed so they leave our thinking too 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.650
 be conscious tomorrow only we 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.320
 chose the bus last week 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.250
 also let him come because they are there too 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.780
 had some difficulty with that 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.580
 we knew that and certainly on such a thing 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.350
 bad felt and we have them ourselves 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.549
 hurt the counter a few times 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.140
 say it 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.640
 and he also has to deal with it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.840
 tomorrow it will be a little different 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.770
 become a competition 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.770
 we must not be naive 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.310
 is a big game fishing for la

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.710
 for the europa league you lionel

 one day tumor

 million new winter are right 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.829
 so as long as we have the me now minutes 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.659
 can beats wondering what if a group s 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.579
 individual on regular course of those games 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.460
 those plows such as carly wait 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.009
 its just really good team to be the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.420
 just underestimate it and learn there 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.930
 you just get a lot out of that 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.210
 level 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.219
 and experience they need to take and 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.110
 then yes then the 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.200
 competition matches it sounds crazy 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.070
 can be easier in the future 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.430
 to become 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.799
 you take that with you and you become that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.020
 as a team think much more self-confident and 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.819
 you will be more patient there and then 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.030
 ultimately you have to compete 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.030
 able to pull
