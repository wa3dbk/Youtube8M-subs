up oh yeah oh yeah okay oh yeah and for

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.840 
up oh yeah oh yeah okay oh yeah and for
the<00:03:34.330> back<00:03:34.510> it's<00:03:34.750> similar<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.700> similar<00:03:36.700> to

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
the back it's similar to the similar to

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.610 
the back it's similar to the similar to
