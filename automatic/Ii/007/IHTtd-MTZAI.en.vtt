which<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.280> great<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:42.740> think<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:44.340> both

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.370 
which is great I think that they both
look<00:01:44.939> great<00:01:46.369> next<00:01:47.540> domination<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> Thor<00:01:49.079> I
