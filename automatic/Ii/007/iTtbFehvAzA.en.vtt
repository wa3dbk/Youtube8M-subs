00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:04.290
 hi to all and under dragone happy to 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.210
 find you on this dewar video 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.280
 will do my aim to answer the question 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.710
 that we all pose on war frame 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.440
 that she is there weapons and tears the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.440
 more powerful in the game and yes as much 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.910
 on the beginnings of war frame the content 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.289
 leave something to be desired 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.369
 really allowed to go around 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.350
 all the weapons at the time now 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.630
 with almost every weapon output 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.939
 week on Wednesday night via updates to 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.279
 day when adding additional content 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.170
 on the on the mag 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.669
 well we get lost a little bit on 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.739
 what are the weapons to do or not 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.360
 not to do and then it's true that we have 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.969
 really to have made a weapon is the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.120
 fear and rise level 30 and then 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.730
 after m so the loire formatted for 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.960
 win rites dishes and that's 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.640
 difficult to really know what you 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.780
 a weapon and that's why I 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.250
 decided so via also this video of 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.220
 start a small series of videos that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.070
 will be 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.840
 surely very useful for the community 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.170
 way to test weapons and climbs 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.930
 at the most of the statistics so 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.400
 really analyzed the statistics is 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.890
 really what because she you 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.160
 in-game so it will be small series 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.470
 videos that will that will be 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.570
 line soon on my channel and 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.190
 so suddenly it will be videos that 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.150
 will last nearly five minutes we will have a 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.020
 share weapons 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.630
 secondary harness or main weapon of 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.640
 melee and we will analyze together precisely 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.130
 it's a shame 2.0 they went out tonight 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.990
 for a month and a half two months 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.970
 damage 2.0 we'll explain a little 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.740
 what were the changes 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.210
 made 1 what were taken 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.009
 account in particular in relation to 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.140
 elements that were the fusion 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.680
 of elements that now brings more 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.420
 or fewer things and also as in 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.190
 fashion and weapons ie not 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.800
 pay attention to their characteristics which 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.500
 are important major let's say and 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.360
 how can fashion and weapons 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.090
 eboded more or less on the scream more or 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.420
 less based on elemental damage and 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.240
 so 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.190
 so here we will see all this so well 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.470
 listen I say very soon for more 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.720
 information about weapons than about 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.580
 which you may want to 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.200
 kraft and where to just leave out 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.200
 here soon very soon
