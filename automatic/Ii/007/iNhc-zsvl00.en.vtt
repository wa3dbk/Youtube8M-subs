00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
of the actions that had led up to us

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.890 
of the actions that had led up to us
losing<00:05:20.100> this<00:05:20.190> game<00:05:20.430> some<00:05:21.360> of<00:05:21.419> the<00:05:21.510> actions

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
losing this game some of the actions

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.080 
losing this game some of the actions
when<00:05:22.229> I<00:05:22.320> start<00:05:22.560> getting<00:05:22.710> going<00:05:23.100> like<00:05:23.460> our<00:05:23.760> team

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
when I start getting going like our team

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.480 
when I start getting going like our team
started<00:05:24.540> giving<00:05:24.780> up<00:05:25.220> should<00:05:26.220> have<00:05:26.340> bounced

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
started giving up should have bounced

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.969 
started giving up should have bounced
back<00:05:26.610> but<00:05:27.060> everyone<00:05:27.750> had<00:05:27.900> their<00:05:28.050> heads<00:05:28.260> below
