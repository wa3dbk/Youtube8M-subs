start your recoil your gun at your first

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.660 
start your recoil your gun at your first
bullet<00:01:55.439> at<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.890> point<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.280> line<00:01:56.520> right

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
bullet at this point this line right

bullet at this point this line right
here<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.689> after<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.770> first<00:01:59.040> two<00:01:59.189> bolts

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
here so after that the first two bolts

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.120 
here so after that the first two bolts
the<00:01:59.640> AK<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.570> recoil<00:02:00.960> skips<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.009> you're

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
the AK and the recoil skips so you're

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.710 
the AK and the recoil skips so you're
going<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.280> shake<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.850> first<00:02:03.119> two<00:02:03.240> shots<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
going to shake your first two shots and

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.149 
going to shake your first two shots and
then<00:02:03.780> you're<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.170> pulling<00:02:04.439> down<00:02:04.829> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
then you're going to be pulling down to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.210 
then you're going to be pulling down to
about<00:02:05.610> right<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:06.020> after<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.070> with<00:02:08.070> other

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
extra skip at the bottom of it to make

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.080 
extra skip at the bottom of it to make
sure<00:02:13.560> your<00:02:13.950> your<00:02:14.459> bullets<00:02:14.700> are<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:14.940> where

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
sure your your bullets are going where

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.780 
sure your your bullets are going where
you<00:02:15.180> want<00:02:15.360> them<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.170> basically<00:02:16.590> start<00:02:17.459> here

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
you want them so basically start here

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.850 
you want them so basically start here
this<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.239> an<00:02:18.360> X<00:02:18.600> perfect<00:02:19.230> spot<00:02:19.440> because<00:02:19.680> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
this is an X perfect spot because you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.770 
this is an X perfect spot because you
most<00:02:20.489> probable<00:02:20.970> for<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> head<00:02:21.330> shot<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.720> you

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
most probable for a head shot so you

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.070 
most probable for a head shot so you
don't<00:02:21.930> go<00:02:22.050> too<00:02:22.500> high<00:02:22.940> just<00:02:23.940> start<00:02:24.209> here<00:02:24.510> after

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
don't go too high just start here after

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.420 
don't go too high just start here after
the<00:02:25.170> first<00:02:25.200> couple<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.650> shots

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
the first couple of shots

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.099 
the first couple of shots
down<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> little<00:02:27.000> bit<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.420> that's<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> best

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
down a little bit and that's the best

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.020 
down a little bit and that's the best
thing<00:02:28.290> for<00:02:28.349> just<00:02:28.950> basically<00:02:29.579> knowing<00:02:29.909> your

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
thing for just basically knowing your

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.699 
thing for just basically knowing your
gun<00:02:30.209> control<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:30.989> easier<00:02:31.319> said<00:02:31.500> than<00:02:31.650> done

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
gun control it's easier said than done

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.199 
gun control it's easier said than done
obviously<00:02:32.040> just<00:02:32.519> saying<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.879> can<00:02:33.030> just

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
obviously just saying you can just

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.149 
obviously just saying you can just
control<00:02:33.480> bolts<00:02:33.840> like<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.140> but<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:34.950> is

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
control bolts like that but this is

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.410 
control bolts like that but this is
something<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.519> you're<00:02:36.120> going<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.269> obviously

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
something that you're going to obviously

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.729 
something that you're going to obviously
have<00:02:36.719> to<00:02:36.810> practice<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.230> your<00:02:37.319> own<00:02:37.379> time<00:02:37.590> you

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
have to practice on your own time you

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.530 
have to practice on your own time you
kind<00:02:37.859> of<00:02:38.010> scale<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.400> out<00:02:38.489> in<00:02:38.609> a<00:02:38.670> server<00:02:38.909> so<00:02:39.480> you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
kind of scale it out in a server so you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.940 
kind of scale it out in a server so you
don't<00:02:39.719> have<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.930> be<00:02:40.049> thinking<00:02:40.200> about<00:02:40.439> it<00:02:40.709> while

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
don't have to be thinking about it while

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.319 
don't have to be thinking about it while
you're<00:02:41.129> in<00:02:41.310> game<00:02:41.579> and<00:02:41.849> while<00:02:41.939> you're<00:02:42.120> actually

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
you're in game and while you're actually

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.890 
you're in game and while you're actually
live<00:02:42.689> in<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.930> match<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.370> final<00:02:45.269> thing<00:02:45.450> street

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
live in a match so final thing street

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.270 
live in a match so final thing street
sweeper<00:02:46.200> technique<00:02:46.560> going<00:02:46.799> into<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> little

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
sweeper technique going into a little

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.160 
sweeper technique going into a little
bit<00:02:47.400> more<00:02:47.579> it's<00:02:48.209> kind<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.629> like<00:02:48.689> I<00:02:48.989> have<00:02:49.139> a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
bit more it's kind of like I have a

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.229 
bit more it's kind of like I have a
quick<00:02:49.349> analogy<00:02:49.739> for<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.069> to<00:02:50.189> kind<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.879> explain

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
quick analogy for you to kind of explain

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.240 
quick analogy for you to kind of explain
what<00:02:51.480> they<00:02:51.599> recoil<00:02:51.959> is<00:02:52.109> like<00:02:52.260> here<00:02:52.530> it's

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
what they recoil is like here it's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.770 
what they recoil is like here it's
basically<00:02:53.609> if<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.909> ever<00:02:54.030> had<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.269> hose<00:02:54.540> or<00:02:54.569> a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
basically if you ever had a hose or a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.319 
basically if you ever had a hose or a
rope<00:02:55.019> in<00:02:55.200> real<00:02:55.349> life<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.980> you're<00:02:56.129> just<00:02:56.939> kind

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
rope in real life and you're just kind

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.349 
rope in real life and you're just kind
of<00:02:57.870> messing<00:02:58.260> with<00:02:58.409> it<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:59.069> could<00:02:59.310> whip<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.180> and

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
of messing with it you could whip it and

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.270 
of messing with it you could whip it and
it<00:03:00.959> kind<00:03:01.109> of<00:03:01.169> makes<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.439> a<00:03:01.530> nice<00:03:01.709> wave<00:03:01.950> and

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
it kind of makes like a nice wave and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.220 
it kind of makes like a nice wave and
when<00:03:02.609> you're<00:03:02.760> at<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:02.909> end<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.450> wave<00:03:03.629> it

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
when you're at the end of the wave it

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.869 
when you're at the end of the wave it
just<00:03:04.439> makes<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.829> a<00:03:04.919> little<00:03:05.040> snap<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.700> that's

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
just makes it a little snap so that's

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.309 
just makes it a little snap so that's
kind<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.120> how<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.269> recoil<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.810> you're<00:03:07.049> pulling

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
kind of how the recoil is you're pulling

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.720 
kind of how the recoil is you're pulling
down<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.769> right<00:03:07.950> you're<00:03:08.459> going<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.639> want

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
down to the right you're going to want

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.890 
down to the right you're going to want
to<00:03:08.819> do<00:03:08.909> that<00:03:09.060> while<00:03:09.239> you're<00:03:09.359> moving<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
to do that while you're moving to the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.089

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
because you're just moving in and out so

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.040 
because you're just moving in and out so
you<00:04:53.879> have<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.060> lot<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.270> things<00:04:54.449> to<00:04:54.659> work<00:04:54.690> with

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
long-range basically the same thing but

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.279
