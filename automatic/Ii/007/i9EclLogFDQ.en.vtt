forum<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.340> guy<00:00:35.550> had<00:00:35.790> 3,000<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.110> won<00:00:37.350> 3,000<00:00:38.010> so

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
forum this guy had 3,000 I won 3,000 so

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.959 
forum this guy had 3,000 I won 3,000 so
what<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.040> kind<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.370> go

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
what we have to do is kind of go

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.240 
what we have to do is kind of go
backwards<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.930> explain<00:00:43.440> where<00:00:44.070> these

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
backwards and explain where these

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.750 
backwards and explain where these
numbers<00:00:44.520> came<00:00:45.000> from<00:00:45.390> 1<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.430> figure

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
numbers came from 1 and then we figure

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.299 
numbers came from 1 and then we figure
out<00:00:47.820> how<00:00:48.570> much<00:00:48.719> hair<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.200> person<00:00:49.590> has<00:00:49.800> what

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
out how much hair the person has what

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.580 
out how much hair the person has what
the<00:00:50.489> donor<00:00:50.969> hair<00:00:51.149> looks<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.989> then<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
the donor hair looks like and then I

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.650 
the donor hair looks like and then I
figure<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.280> what's<00:00:53.579> appropriate<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.300> this

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
figure out what's appropriate and this

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.810 
figure out what's appropriate and this
is<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> way<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.370> don't<00:00:56.489> think

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
is the way we do it so you don't think

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.520 
is the way we do it so you don't think
that<00:00:57.000> all<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.360> need<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:57.899> come<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that all you need we just come in the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.110 
that all you need we just come in the
room<00:00:58.620> saying<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.980> need<00:00:59.160> two<00:00:59.309> thousand<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
room saying you need two thousand you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.029 
room saying you need two thousand you
need<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.480> eight<00:01:00.629> hundred<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.590> need<00:01:01.770> 500

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
need it eight hundred I you need 500

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.820 
need it eight hundred I you need 500
it's<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.149> little<00:01:03.449> bit<00:01:03.629> more<00:01:04.140> scientific<00:01:04.379> than

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
it's a little bit more scientific than

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.929 
it's a little bit more scientific than
that<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.549> way<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.820> goes<00:01:06.590> if<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.860> divide<00:01:08.729> up

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that the way it goes if you divide up

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.109 
that the way it goes if you divide up
the<00:01:09.090> scalp<00:01:09.420> into<00:01:10.260> three<00:01:10.530> regions<00:01:11.119> this

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the scalp into three regions this

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.649 
the scalp into three regions this
frontal<00:01:12.600> region<00:01:12.990> here<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.860> roughly<00:01:14.400> around<00:01:14.909> 70

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
frontal region here is roughly around 70

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.560 
frontal region here is roughly around 70
centimeters<00:01:16.610> 70<00:01:17.610> centimeters<00:01:18.119> squared

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
centimeters 70 centimeters squared

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.109 
centimeters 70 centimeters squared
the<00:01:19.020> middle<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.220> mid<00:01:20.400> scalp<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.880> about

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the middle one or the mid scalp is about

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.530 
the middle one or the mid scalp is about
60<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.200> vertex<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.250> back<00:01:23.549> which<00:01:24.150> people

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
60 the vertex in the back which people

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.390 
60 the vertex in the back which people
always<00:01:24.659> say<00:01:24.960> hey<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> want<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> back<00:01:25.799> field<00:01:26.159> can

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
always say hey I want the back field can

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.120 
always say hey I want the back field can
get<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.640> about<00:01:26.820> 100<00:01:27.360> 100<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.920> big

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
get up to about 100 100 so that's a big

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.569 
get up to about 100 100 so that's a big
number<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.670> usually<00:01:30.450> when<00:01:30.659> people<00:01:31.049> present

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
70 this is about 60 and the back can get

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.550 
70 this is about 60 and the back can get
up<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.490> hundred<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.840> gives<00:01:43.140> us<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
up to a hundred so that gives us the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.130 
up to a hundred so that gives us the

basis for the math calculation when we
plant<00:01:47.040> hair<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.850> want<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.299> good<00:01:48.600> density

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
plant hair you want to have good density

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.160 
plant hair you want to have good density
what's<00:01:49.500> good<00:01:49.710> density<00:01:49.979> good<00:01:50.490> density<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.240> 25

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
what's good density good density is 25

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.480 
what's good density good density is 25
say<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.430> maybe<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.000> 35<00:01:55.009> follicular<00:01:56.009> units

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
say to a maybe up to 35 follicular units

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.789 
say to a maybe up to 35 follicular units
per<00:01:56.909> square<00:01:57.210> centimeters<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.320> that's<00:01:58.530> how<00:01:58.740> we

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
per square centimeters so that's how we

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.679 
per square centimeters so that's how we
kind<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.219> get<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.520> math<00:01:59.759> some<00:02:00.090> doctors<00:02:00.509> do

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
kind of get the math some doctors do

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.289 
kind of get the math some doctors do
higher<00:02:01.079> density<00:02:01.740> meaning<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> 40s<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.180> in

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
higher density meaning in the 40s and in

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.530 
higher density meaning in the 40s and in
the<00:02:03.329> 50s<00:02:03.600> but<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.290> usually<00:02:04.530> plant<00:02:04.979> 25<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:06.030> 35

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the 50s but I usually plant 25 to 35

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.449 
the 50s but I usually plant 25 to 35
follicular<00:02:07.140> units<00:02:07.469> per<00:02:07.649> square<00:02:07.950> centimeters

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
follicular units per square centimeters

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.540 
follicular units per square centimeters
so<00:02:08.970> if<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.629> math<00:02:09.920> if<00:02:10.920> somebody<00:02:11.280> comes

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
so if you do the math if somebody comes

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.790 
so if you do the math if somebody comes
in<00:02:11.790> who's<00:02:12.030> completely<00:02:12.660> bald

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
in who's completely bald

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.490 
in who's completely bald
in<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.100> frontal<00:02:14.580> region<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.930> will<00:02:16.200> take

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
in this frontal region they will take

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.390 
in this frontal region they will take
almost<00:02:17.130> up<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.900> 1700<00:02:18.900> maybe<00:02:19.110> up<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.500> 2000

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
almost up to 1700 maybe up to 2000

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.760 
almost up to 1700 maybe up to 2000
graphs<00:02:20.730> just<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.510> area<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.410> these<00:02:22.560> are

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
graphs just in this area so these are

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.840 
graphs just in this area so these are
the<00:02:22.860> things<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.400> take<00:02:23.640> into

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
the things that we take into

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.270 
the things that we take into
consideration<00:02:24.690> if<00:02:24.960> there's<00:02:25.350> existing<00:02:25.740> hair

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
consideration if there's existing hair

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.640 
consideration if there's existing hair
here<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.970> size<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.570> this<00:02:27.720> area<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.260> we

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
here the size of this area and we

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.860 
here the size of this area and we
actually<00:02:28.860> measure<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:29.760> area<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.840> can

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
actually measure this area so we can

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.260 
actually measure this area so we can
come<00:02:31.170> up<00:02:31.260> with<00:02:31.410> an<00:02:31.530> accurate<00:02:31.950> calculation

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
come up with an accurate calculation

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.970 
come up with an accurate calculation
maybe<00:02:33.270> it's<00:02:33.540> less<00:02:33.840> than<00:02:34.050> 70<00:02:34.530> maybe<00:02:34.740> it's

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
maybe it's less than 70 maybe it's

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.890 
maybe it's less than 70 maybe it's
greater<00:02:35.250> than<00:02:35.370> 70<00:02:35.850> every<00:02:36.210> head<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.690> different

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
greater than 70 every head is different

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.550 
greater than 70 every head is different
so<00:02:37.350> if<00:02:37.710> this<00:02:38.160> person<00:02:38.880> says<00:02:39.090> he<00:02:39.270> needs<00:02:39.420> 3000<00:02:40.290> and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
so if this person says he needs 3000 and

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.230 
so if this person says he needs 3000 and
wants<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.890> work<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.220> here<00:02:41.430> another<00:02:41.760> person

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.810 
wants to work in here another person
might<00:02:42.420> need<00:02:42.660> two<00:02:42.930> thousand<00:02:43.470> or<00:02:43.590> 1500<00:02:44.040> it

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820

eight thousand grafts but you can see if

eight thousand grafts but you can see if
you<00:03:31.050> did<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.440> math<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.130> wanted<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.520> do

you did the math and you wanted to do

you<00:03:44.610> know<00:03:44.700> if<00:03:44.790> grafts<00:03:45.090> so<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:47.070> can<00:03:47.250> see<00:03:47.430> it

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
you know if grafts so you can see it

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.910 
you know if grafts so you can see it
takes<00:03:47.820> a<00:03:48.000> lot<00:03:48.300> of<00:03:48.570> hair<00:03:48.990> to<00:03:49.260> go<00:03:49.590> through<00:03:49.830> all

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
takes a lot of hair to go through all

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.250 
takes a lot of hair to go through all
these<00:03:50.130> areas<00:03:50.580> so<00:03:50.610> when<00:03:51.270> people<00:03:51.600> come<00:03:51.780> in<00:03:51.990> and<00:03:52.020> I

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
these areas so when people come in and I

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.550 
these areas so when people come in and I
suggest<00:03:52.740> let's<00:03:53.550> work<00:03:54.060> through<00:03:54.450> here<00:03:54.900> because

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
suggest let's work through here because

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.110 
suggest let's work through here because
this<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.860> all<00:03:56.010> people<00:03:56.280> can<00:03:56.580> see<00:03:56.790> when<00:03:56.940> they<00:03:57.060> see

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
this is all people can see when they see

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.640 
this is all people can see when they see
you<00:03:57.390> from<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.750> front<00:03:57.959> depending<00:03:58.470> on<00:03:58.560> the

you from the front depending on the
shape<00:03:58.890> of<00:03:59.040> your<00:03:59.100> head<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.520> everybody<00:03:59.880> hit

head<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:00.660> shaped<00:04:00.870> differently<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.560> look<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.430> see

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
head is shaped differently I look to see

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.449 
head is shaped differently I look to see
where<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.930> can't<00:04:04.200> see<00:04:04.470> further<00:04:04.770> any<00:04:05.160> further

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
where you can't see further any further

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.040 
where you can't see further any further
back<00:04:05.730> than<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.540> then<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.720> want<00:04:06.900> to

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
back than that and then I want to

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.320 
back than that and then I want to
concentrate<00:04:07.410> in<00:04:07.740> here<00:04:07.770> not<00:04:08.490> neglecting<00:04:09.180> this

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
concentrate in here not neglecting this

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.760 
concentrate in here not neglecting this
part<00:04:09.600> but<00:04:09.720> first<00:04:09.989> we<00:04:10.170> want<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.410> concentrate

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
part but first we want to concentrate

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.890 
part but first we want to concentrate
here<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.220> frame<00:04:11.459> your<00:04:11.670> face<00:04:11.850> we'll<00:04:12.630> measure

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
here to frame your face we'll measure

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.220 
here to frame your face we'll measure
this<00:04:13.230> see<00:04:14.010> how<00:04:14.100> big<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.550> is<00:04:14.670> see<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.630> existing

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
this see how big it is see the existing

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.039 
this see how big it is see the existing
hair<00:04:16.470> that's<00:04:16.709> left<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.489> donor<00:04:17.820> hair<00:04:18.150> see<00:04:18.870> what

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
hair that's left the donor hair see what

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.110 
hair that's left the donor hair see what
I<00:04:19.080> think<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.590> anticipated<00:04:20.310> loss<00:04:20.580> is<00:04:20.850> going<00:04:21.060> to

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
I think the anticipated loss is going to

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.320 
I think the anticipated loss is going to
be<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.570> then<00:04:22.290> we'll<00:04:22.680> do<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:23.010> math<00:04:23.330> and

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
be and then we'll do the math and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.030 
be and then we'll do the math and
usually<00:04:24.810> this<00:04:24.930> works<00:04:25.200> out<00:04:25.440> well<00:04:25.680> but<00:04:25.890> I<00:04:25.979> think

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
usually this works out well but I think

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.570 
usually this works out well but I think
every

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
every

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.730 
every
body<00:04:26.789> who<00:04:27.389> has<00:04:27.569> a<00:04:27.599> hair<00:04:27.900> transplant<00:04:28.199> if<00:04:28.620> they

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
body who has a hair transplant if they

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.860 
body who has a hair transplant if they
say<00:04:28.949> they<00:04:29.129> need<00:04:29.250> 3,000<00:04:29.909> grafts<00:04:30.120> they<00:04:30.689> should

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
say they need 3,000 grafts they should

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.990 
say they need 3,000 grafts they should
understand<00:04:31.319> why<00:04:31.620> they<00:04:31.919> need<00:04:31.949> 2,000<00:04:32.789> that<00:04:32.879> it

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
understand why they need 2,000 that it

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.320 
understand why they need 2,000 that it
just<00:04:33.180> didn't<00:04:33.449> come<00:04:33.810> from<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.080> sky<00:04:34.289> so

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
just didn't come from the sky so

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.550 
just didn't come from the sky so
hopefully<00:04:36.330> this<00:04:36.840> helps

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
hopefully this helps

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.279
