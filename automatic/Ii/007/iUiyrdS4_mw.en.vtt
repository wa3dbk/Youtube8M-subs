00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
it has a yellow and a blue section and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.870 
it has a yellow and a blue section and
you<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.530> also<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:13.890> these<00:01:14.040> yellow<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.460> blue

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you can also see these yellow and blue

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.810 
you can also see these yellow and blue
swirls<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.020> light<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> environment<00:01:17.280> now

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
swirls of light in the environment now

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.580 
swirls of light in the environment now
there's<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.150> link<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.630> level<00:01:18.960> 1<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.290> level<00:01:19.320> 2

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
there's a link to level 1 and level 2

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.230 
there's a link to level 1 and level 2
flow<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.729> basically<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.720> start<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.170> trick

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
flow so basically if I start a trick

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.910 
flow so basically if I start a trick
then<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.330> start<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.750> build<00:01:24.960> points<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.890> can

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
then I start to build points and you can

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.890 
then I start to build points and you can
see<00:01:26.159> my<00:01:26.310> flow<00:01:26.580> bar<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.000> slowly<00:01:27.210> starting<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
see my flow bar is slowly starting to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.289 
see my flow bar is slowly starting to
increase<00:01:28.619> eventually<00:01:29.009> I'll<00:01:29.490> reach<00:01:29.700> level<00:01:30.119> 1

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
increase eventually I'll reach level 1

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420 
increase eventually I'll reach level 1
flow<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.229> when<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> reached<00:01:31.650> level<00:01:31.740> 1<00:01:32.100> flow

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
flow and when I reached level 1 flow

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.560 
flow and when I reached level 1 flow
then<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.659> can

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
then I can

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.420 
then I can
influence<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.409> yellow<00:01:35.860> part<00:01:36.190> of<00:01:36.340> the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
influence the yellow part of the

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.520 
influence the yellow part of the
environment<00:01:36.700> now<00:01:37.540> this<00:01:37.720> is<00:01:37.870> the<00:01:38.020> shape<00:01:38.260> thing

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
environment now this is the shape thing

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.800 
environment now this is the shape thing
that<00:01:39.040> we<00:01:39.159> showed<00:01:39.370> in<00:01:39.400> III<00:01:39.970> because<00:01:40.570> we<00:01:40.659> were<00:01:40.720> at

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
that we showed in III because we were at

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.170 
that we showed in III because we were at
the<00:01:40.900> start<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.470> game<00:01:41.680> where<00:01:42.250> we<00:01:43.000> have

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
the start of the game where we have

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.540 
the start of the game where we have
what's<00:01:43.390> called<00:01:43.660> simple<00:01:44.380> shaping<00:01:44.830> so<00:01:45.250> I'm<00:01:45.400> not

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
what's called simple shaping so I'm not

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.550 
what's called simple shaping so I'm not
actually<00:01:46.060> physically<00:01:46.600> controlling<00:01:47.350> this

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
actually physically controlling this

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.330 
actually physically controlling this
shaping<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:49.180> controlled<00:01:49.930> by<00:01:50.260> us<00:01:50.740> at<00:01:51.130> this

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
shaping it's controlled by us at this

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.070 
shaping it's controlled by us at this
point<00:01:51.400> because<00:01:51.880> we<00:01:52.000> want<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.300> player<00:01:52.540> to<00:01:52.570> have

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
point because we want the player to have

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.680 
point because we want the player to have
a<00:01:53.190> familiarity<00:01:54.190> with<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:55.000> environment<00:01:55.300> and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
a familiarity with the environment and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.460 
a familiarity with the environment and
understanding<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:58.210> how<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:58.570> skate<00:01:59.170> lines

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
understanding of how the skate lines

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.770 
understanding of how the skate lines
need<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.800> work<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.700> start<00:02:01.060> thinking<00:02:01.360> about

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
need to work and start thinking about

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.300 
need to work and start thinking about
how<00:02:02.080> they<00:02:02.320> want<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.650> manipulate<00:02:02.770> the

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
how they want to manipulate the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.520 
how they want to manipulate the
environment<00:02:03.880> but<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.300> can<00:02:04.479> see<00:02:04.660> my<00:02:04.840> my<00:02:05.229> flow

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
environment but you can see my my flow

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.160 
environment but you can see my my flow
has<00:02:05.710> reached<00:02:05.940> 500<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.090> now<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:07.300> can<00:02:07.600> start<00:02:07.869> to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
has reached 500 so now I can start to

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.169 
has reached 500 so now I can start to
create<00:02:08.770> parts<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.520> environment<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.030> give

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
create parts of the environment and give

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.330 
create parts of the environment and give
me<00:02:10.330> more<00:02:10.570> skating<00:02:11.230> opportunities<00:02:12.010> so<00:02:12.190> for

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
me more skating opportunities so for

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.979 
me more skating opportunities so for
example<00:02:12.700> these<00:02:12.820> bumps<00:02:13.209> Lin<00:02:13.450> able<00:02:13.660> me<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:13.870> get

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
example these bumps Lin able me to get

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:14.760 
example these bumps Lin able me to get
more<00:02:14.170> speed

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
more speed

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.010 
more speed
I<00:02:14.800> can<00:02:15.310> also<00:02:15.459> influence<00:02:15.910> these<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.750> worker

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
I can also influence these this worker

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
I can also influence these this worker
guy

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
guy

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.449 
guy
so<00:02:18.580> they<00:02:18.760> slowly<00:02:19.180> become<00:02:20.310> influenced<00:02:21.310> and

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
so they slowly become influenced and

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.350 
so they slowly become influenced and
free<00:02:22.090> from<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.510> ministry<00:02:23.260> world<00:02:23.670> but<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:25.150> also

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
free from the ministry world but it also

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.630 
free from the ministry world but it also
gets<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.750> level<00:02:26.019> 2<00:02:26.230> flow<00:02:26.500> it's<00:02:26.769> not<00:02:26.980> enough<00:02:27.310> for

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
gets a level 2 flow it's not enough for

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.449 
gets a level 2 flow it's not enough for
me<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.239> just<00:02:28.390> do<00:02:28.840> basic<00:02:29.170> tricking<00:02:29.800> like<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.220> I

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
me to just do basic tricking like that I

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.699 
me to just do basic tricking like that I
need<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:31.150> think<00:02:31.420> about<00:02:31.780> how<00:02:32.170> am<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.410> going<00:02:32.590> to

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
need to think about how am I going to

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.620 
need to think about how am I going to
build<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:33.160> good<00:02:33.310> skate<00:02:33.670> line<00:02:33.880> how<00:02:34.360> am<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.510> going

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
build a good skate line how am I going

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.590 
build a good skate line how am I going
to<00:02:34.720> do<00:02:34.840> opportunities<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:36.220> for<00:02:36.970> me<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.450> best

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
to do opportunities so for me the best

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.350 
to do opportunities so for me the best
way<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.870> do<00:02:38.140> it<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.670> actually<00:02:39.670> go<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:39.910> find<00:02:40.000> a

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
way to do it is actually go and find a

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.650 
way to do it is actually go and find a
vert<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.840> do<00:02:40.930> some<00:02:41.110> ver<00:02:41.320> tricking<00:02:42.510> which<00:02:43.510> I

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
vert and to do some ver tricking which I

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.630 
vert and to do some ver tricking which I
can<00:02:43.810> do<00:02:43.959> by<00:02:44.200> going<00:02:44.709> over<00:02:44.980> here<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.160> going<00:02:45.430> into

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
can do by going over here and going into

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.640 
can do by going over here and going into
this<00:02:45.850> section<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.840> now<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.079> can<00:02:50.260> see<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.440> can

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
this section and now you can see I can

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.720 
this section and now you can see I can
start<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:51.160> do<00:02:51.970> some<00:02:52.180> grabs

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
start to do some grabs

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.360 
start to do some grabs
maybe<00:02:54.270> I'll<00:02:54.390> do<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> transfer<00:02:55.110> with<00:02:55.560> grass<00:02:55.860> I

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
maybe I'll do a transfer with grass I

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.250 
maybe I'll do a transfer with grass I
really<00:02:57.030> start<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.450> get<00:02:57.630> some<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
really start to get some of the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.500 
really start to get some of the
complexities<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.160> control<00:02:59.640> scheme<00:02:59.790> working

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
complexities of a control scheme working

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.820 
complexities of a control scheme working
where<00:03:01.349> I<00:03:01.380> can<00:03:01.560> do<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.830> Eclipse<00:03:03.200> grab<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.530> spin

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
where I can do this Eclipse grab it spin

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.670 
where I can do this Eclipse grab it spin
and<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:05.610> on<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:06.930> see<00:03:07.050> by<00:03:07.200> doing<00:03:07.500> this

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
and so on and you can see by doing this

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.000 
and so on and you can see by doing this
and<00:03:07.980> getting<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.550> good<00:03:09.380> combos<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.650> good<00:03:10.800> lines

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
and getting a good combos and good lines

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.340 
and getting a good combos and good lines
going<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.819> game<00:03:11.940> then<00:03:12.450> I'm<00:03:12.840> building<00:03:13.230> the

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
going in the game then I'm building the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.410 
going in the game then I'm building the
points<00:03:13.650> much<00:03:13.860> quicker<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.459> enabling<00:03:15.239> me<00:03:15.390> to

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
points much quicker and enabling me to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.780 
points much quicker and enabling me to
reach<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.170> level<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.190> flow<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.670> need<00:03:19.790> you

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
reach the level to flow that I need you

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.460 
reach the level to flow that I need you
can<00:03:20.910> see<00:03:21.030> as<00:03:21.150> well<00:03:21.300> as<00:03:21.540> some<00:03:21.720> secrets<00:03:22.170> left<00:03:22.380> in

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
can see as well as some secrets left in

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.800 
can see as well as some secrets left in
the<00:03:22.560> game<00:03:22.709> such<00:03:22.980> as<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.550> can<00:03:24.030> collect<00:03:24.269> this<00:03:24.510> here

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
the game such as I can collect this here

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.360 
the game such as I can collect this here
I<00:03:25.709> mean<00:03:26.700> this<00:03:26.970> enables<00:03:27.510> me<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.800> by<00:03:28.800> finding<00:03:29.220> all
