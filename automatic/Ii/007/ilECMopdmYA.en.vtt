terraspin

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.369 
terraspin
so<00:02:14.459> that's<00:02:14.640> one<00:02:15.030> two<00:02:15.239> three<00:02:15.269> four<00:02:15.569> five<00:02:16.140> six

comparing<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.599> Omnitrix<00:02:22.019> challenge<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
comparing the Omnitrix challenge to the

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.110 
comparing the Omnitrix challenge to the
Omnitrix<00:02:23.190> touch<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.580> can<00:02:23.730> see<00:02:23.849> that<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
Omnitrix touch you can see that the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.750 
Omnitrix touch you can see that the
challenge<00:02:24.629> is<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:25.170> bit<00:02:25.500> smaller<00:02:25.980> on<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.340> face

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
challenge is a bit smaller on the face

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.570 
challenge is a bit smaller on the face
but<00:02:27.629> actually<00:02:28.049> they're<00:02:28.680> both<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:29.040> chunky<00:02:29.459> and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
but actually they're both the chunky and

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.430 
but actually they're both the chunky and
it<00:02:29.700> looks<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.269> Omnitrix<00:02:30.540> challenge<00:02:31.290> is

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
it looks like the Omnitrix challenge is

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.300 
it looks like the Omnitrix challenge is
even<00:02:32.099> chunkier<00:02:32.670> even<00:02:33.000> thicker<00:02:33.360> see<00:02:34.290> then<00:02:35.099> the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
even chunkier even thicker see then the

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.229 
even chunkier even thicker see then the
Omnitrix<00:02:35.760> touch<00:02:36.120> look<00:02:36.870> at<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:39.120> can

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
Omnitrix touch look at that and you can

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.569 
Omnitrix touch look at that and you can
open<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.569> up<00:02:39.690> here<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.019> push<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.709> button<00:02:41.190> and

is fitting good on me but look at how

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.839 
is fitting good on me but look at how
blocky<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:10.379> chunky<00:03:10.769> did<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.159> be<00:03:11.310> careful<00:03:11.760> if

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
blocky and chunky did so be careful if

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.430 
blocky and chunky did so be careful if
you're<00:03:12.000> out<00:03:12.120> in<00:03:12.150> Halloween<00:03:12.690> you're<00:03:13.230> going<00:03:13.379> to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
probably hit this on things like doors

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.300 
probably hit this on things like doors
and<00:03:15.359> stuff<00:03:15.629> or<00:03:15.870> get<00:03:16.349> it<00:03:16.470> snagged<00:03:16.890> on<00:03:17.159> your

costume keep that in mind for a younger

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.920 
costume keep that in mind for a younger
kid<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:22.459> well<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.120> go<00:03:24.269> up<00:03:24.419> here<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.720> lot

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
kid it well you can go up here a lot

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.809 
kid it well you can go up here a lot
tighter<00:03:25.230> see<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.799> see<00:03:26.099> there's<00:03:26.310> more<00:03:26.519> holes

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
tighter see I see there's more holes

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.580 
tighter see I see there's more holes
here<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.359> can't<00:03:27.630> get<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:27.959> pretty<00:03:28.200> tight<00:03:28.440> it

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
here so you can't get it pretty tight it

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.849 
here so you can't get it pretty tight it
looks<00:03:28.650> like<00:03:28.919> you<00:03:29.099> could<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.549> theory<00:03:30.739> get<00:03:31.739> it

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
looks like you could in theory get it

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.580 
looks like you could in theory get it
this<00:03:32.069> tight<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:33.000> yeah<00:03:33.720> that's<00:03:33.989> pretty<00:03:34.079> small

we've got these two guys popped out

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.100 
we've got these two guys popped out
accelerate<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.340> energy<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.240> then<00:04:51.780> you<00:04:51.900> check

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
accelerate and energy and then you check

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.230 
accelerate and energy and then you check
your<00:04:52.230> score<00:04:52.530> sheet<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:52.980> here's<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:53.940> look<00:04:54.120> at

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
your score sheet and here's a look at

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.540 
your score sheet and here's a look at
the<00:04:54.330> score<00:04:54.570> sheet<00:04:54.810> on<00:04:55.020> your<00:04:55.170> screen

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
the score sheet on your screen

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.780 
the score sheet on your screen
accelerate<00:04:56.550> has<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.840> most<00:04:58.080> speed<00:04:58.710> but<00:04:59.670> he's

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
accelerate has the most speed but he's

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.090 
accelerate has the most speed but he's
got<00:04:59.970> low<00:05:00.180> power<00:05:00.450> and<00:05:00.780> low<00:05:00.930> skill<00:05:01.460> energy<00:05:02.570> has

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
got low power and low skill energy has

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.490 
got low power and low skill energy has
most<00:05:05.100> power<00:05:05.370> so<00:05:05.850> he<00:05:06.030> winds<00:05:06.270> up<00:05:06.420> power<00:05:06.660> he's<00:05:07.320> got

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
most power so he winds up power he's got

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.290 
most power so he winds up power he's got
the<00:05:07.590> lowest<00:05:07.770> speed<00:05:08.130> so<00:05:08.340> he<00:05:08.370> loses<00:05:08.700> on<00:05:08.970> speed

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
the lowest speed so he loses on speed

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.680 
the lowest speed so he loses on speed
and<00:05:09.510> his<00:05:10.110> skill<00:05:10.410> is<00:05:10.560> three<00:05:11.010> and<00:05:11.690> accelerate

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
and his skill is three and accelerate

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.810 
and his skill is three and accelerate
skill<00:05:12.990> is<00:05:13.140> two<00:05:13.350> so<00:05:13.650> energy<00:05:14.040> wins<00:05:14.370> this<00:05:14.580> battle

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
skill is two so energy wins this battle

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.540 
skill is two so energy wins this battle
see<00:05:15.390> that's<00:05:16.140> how<00:05:16.260> that<00:05:16.440> works<00:05:16.620> but<00:05:17.310> what<00:05:17.490> I

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
see that's how that works but what I

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.310
