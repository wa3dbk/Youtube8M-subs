around<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> little<00:01:22.170> bit<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.439> some

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
around here just a little bit for some

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.010 
around here just a little bit for some
reason<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.880> go<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> rocky<00:01:24.390> Overlord<00:01:24.900> is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
reason and there go to rocky Overlord is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.690 
reason and there go to rocky Overlord is
here<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.560> he<00:01:25.740> does<00:01:26.070> see<00:01:26.340> everything<00:01:26.640> that's

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
here so he does see everything that's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.880 
here so he does see everything that's
going<00:01:26.820> out<00:01:27.090> here<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:28.470> we'll<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.740> how<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
going out here and so we'll see how I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.190 
going out here and so we'll see how I
could<00:01:29.070> respond<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.970> early<00:01:30.479> cheese<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
could respond to this early cheese as a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.710 
could respond to this early cheese as a
I<00:01:31.619> mean<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> guess<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:32.430> why<00:01:32.520> she's<00:01:32.720> so

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
I mean I guess that's why she's so

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.240 
I mean I guess that's why she's so
anyway<00:01:33.990> spawning<00:01:34.350> pool<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> way<00:01:35.040> for<00:01:35.070> I

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
anyway spawning pool is on the way for I

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.700 
anyway spawning pool is on the way for I

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
getting constructed right at the base of

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.149 
getting constructed right at the base of
the<00:01:42.329> ramp<00:01:42.600> which<00:01:42.810> means<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.409> Joe<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the ramp which means I Joe is going to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.660 
the ramp which means I Joe is going to
be<00:01:44.220> blocked<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.790> right<00:01:45.000> now<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> we'll<00:01:47.549> see

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
be blocked in right now and so we'll see

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.580 
be blocked in right now and so we'll see
how<00:01:47.759> he<00:01:47.790> responds<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.540> early<00:01:49.140> cheese<00:01:49.380> as

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
how he responds to this early cheese as

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.230 
how he responds to this early cheese as
a<00:01:50.040> week<00:01:50.310> /<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:50.549> all<00:01:50.670> learn<00:01:50.880> something<00:01:50.909> from

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
a week / we all learn something from

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.200 
a week / we all learn something from
this<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.470> newest<00:01:52.770> patch<00:01:53.149> so<00:01:54.149> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
this as this is of the newest patch so I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.399 
this as this is of the newest patch so I
guess<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> Chairman<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.049> still<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.380> some

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
guess the Chairman can still do some

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.740 
guess the Chairman can still do some
kind<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.770> early<00:01:55.890> early<00:01:56.630> blocking<00:01:57.630> or

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
kind of early early blocking or

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.660 
kind of early early blocking or
something<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.340> actually<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.640> first

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
something but this is actually the first

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.459 
something but this is actually the first
time<00:01:59.909> I've<00:02:00.090> seen<00:02:00.240> Terrance<00:02:00.960> trying<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.320> plot

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
time I've seen Terrance trying to plot

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.440 
time I've seen Terrance trying to plot
scissor<00:02:01.740> game<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> cup<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.340> roxas<00:02:02.850> so

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
scissor game with a cup of roxas so

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.940 
scissor game with a cup of roxas so
we'll<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.899> what<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.079> do<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.799> do

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
we'll see what I do it's going to do

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.950 
we'll see what I do it's going to do
here<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.460> pool<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.420> about<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.780> be

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
here as the pool is just about to be

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.839 
here as the pool is just about to be
finished<00:02:07.110> right<00:02:07.469> now<00:02:07.619> he<00:02:08.250> does<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> drone

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
finished right now he does have a drone

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.780 
finished right now he does have a drone
here<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.569> Oh<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.979> plus<00:02:11.129> spine<00:02:11.430> crawler

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
here and Oh going to plus spine crawler

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.380 
here and Oh going to plus spine crawler
so<00:02:12.060> that's<00:02:12.270> fine

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
so that's fine

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.000 
so that's fine
do<00:02:13.569> believe<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:13.960> is<00:02:14.110> in<00:02:14.290> your<00:02:14.440> range<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.890> this

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
do believe that is in your range of this

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.220 
do believe that is in your range of this
barracks<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.660> there<00:02:16.660> is<00:02:16.810> going<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.140> be<00:02:17.170> a

see some links coming out as well but I

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.949 
see some links coming out as well but I
don't<00:02:31.030> know<00:02:31.180> what<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.660> do<00:02:31.750> right<00:02:31.780> now

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
don't know what you can do right now

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.360 
don't know what you can do right now
they<00:02:32.530> can't<00:02:32.709> really<00:02:32.800> do<00:02:32.920> much<00:02:32.980> right<00:02:33.280> now

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
they can't really do much right now

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.890 
they can't really do much right now
because<00:02:33.820> of<00:02:33.850> this<00:02:34.090> wall<00:02:34.330> off<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:36.690> spine<00:02:37.690> is

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
because of this wall off the spine is

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.540 
because of this wall off the spine is
almost<00:02:38.170> done<00:02:38.350> so<00:02:38.530> we'll<00:02:38.680> see<00:02:38.860> if<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.220> spine

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
almost done so we'll see if this spine

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.330 
almost done so we'll see if this spine
is<00:02:39.850> able<00:02:40.360> to<00:02:40.480> poke<00:02:41.020> away<00:02:41.140> at<00:02:41.380> this<00:02:41.590> tarp<00:02:42.070> and

is able to poke away at this tarp and
swallow<00:02:43.120> up<00:02:43.209> here<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:44.200> spine<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.560> just

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
swallow up here and the spine is just

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.229 
swallow up here and the spine is just
want<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.100> finish<00:02:45.250> there<00:02:45.550> we<00:02:45.640> go<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:45.940> there<00:02:46.090> is

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
want to finish there we go and there is

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.940 
want to finish there we go and there is
actually<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.630> real<00:02:46.840> turn<00:02:47.020> on<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.230> way<00:02:47.350> by<00:02:47.530> Hydra

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
actually a real turn on the way by Hydra

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.070 
actually a real turn on the way by Hydra
so<00:02:48.550> he's<00:02:48.820> gonna<00:02:49.120> owe<00:02:49.330> their<00:02:49.540> we<00:02:49.660> go<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.870> spy
