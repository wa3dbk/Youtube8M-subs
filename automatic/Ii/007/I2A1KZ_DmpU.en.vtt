bottle feeding from the Piedmont and I
have<00:00:17.670> not<00:00:17.880> used<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.390> bottle<00:00:18.600> for<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.170> child<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.650> 13

have not used a bottle for a child in 13

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.510 
have not used a bottle for a child in 13
years<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> lot<00:00:21.510> has<00:00:21.539> changed<00:00:21.840> since<00:00:22.650> I've

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
years so a lot has changed since I've

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.270 
years so a lot has changed since I've
been<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.030> the<00:00:24.060> bottle<00:00:24.930> feeding<00:00:25.230> game<00:00:25.500> one

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:26.280 
been in the the bottle feeding game one

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.400 
been in the the bottle feeding game one
thing<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.610> has<00:00:26.730> changed<00:00:26.760> was<00:00:27.420> how<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.720> carry

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
thing that has changed was how you carry

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.229 
thing that has changed was how you carry
around<00:00:28.670> formula<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.619> bought<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.820> couple

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
around formula and so I bought a couple

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.439 
around formula and so I bought a couple
different<00:00:33.600> types<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.930> containers<00:00:35.449> for

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
different types of containers for

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.260 
different types of containers for
formula<00:00:36.960> servings<00:00:37.379> and<00:00:37.680> my<00:00:38.610> problem<00:00:39.060> was

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
formula servings and my problem was

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.180 
formula servings and my problem was
fitting<00:00:39.660> them<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:39.960> my<00:00:40.110> diaper<00:00:40.380> bag<00:00:40.590> but<00:00:41.160> not

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
fitting them in my diaper bag but not

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.910 
fitting them in my diaper bag but not
having<00:00:41.820> them<00:00:41.940> take<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.450> ton<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> space<00:00:42.920> this

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
having them take up a ton of space this

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
having them take up a ton of space this
is<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.100> formula<00:00:44.579> container<00:00:44.940> from<00:00:45.180> lunch<00:00:45.450> skin

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
is a formula container from lunch skin

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.180 
is a formula container from lunch skin
and<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.559> has<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.190> comes<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.910> tier<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.600> five

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
and it has it comes with a tier of five

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.700

munchkin<00:03:00.900> thing<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.319> tried<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.099> took

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
munchkin thing that I tried it just took

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.550 
munchkin thing that I tried it just took
up<00:03:02.430> too<00:03:02.580> much<00:03:02.730> room<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:03.989> another<00:03:04.319> one

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
up too much room and this is another one

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.520 
up too much room and this is another one
and<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.489> smaller<00:03:05.910> but<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.750> still<00:03:06.959> takes<00:03:07.290> up

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
and it's smaller but it still takes up

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.130 
and it's smaller but it still takes up
too<00:03:08.010> much<00:03:08.040> room<00:03:08.489> if<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.940> use<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.690> hope<00:03:09.840> of<00:03:09.989> me<00:03:10.110> a

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
too much room if you use a hope of me a

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.110 
too much room if you use a hope of me a
lot<00:03:10.349> and<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.530> guess<00:03:10.680> my<00:03:10.799> hope<00:03:10.980> will<00:03:11.130> be<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.519> lot

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
lot and I guess my hope will be a lot

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.300 
lot and I guess my hope will be a lot
for<00:03:12.450> my<00:03:12.720> newborn<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.470> my<00:03:13.530> toddler<00:03:13.890> when<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.160> go

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
for my newborn and my toddler when we go

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.530 
for my newborn and my toddler when we go
out<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.760> just<00:03:14.790> needed<00:03:15.150> something<00:03:15.359> to

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
out and I just needed something to

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.580 
out and I just needed something to
conserve<00:03:15.989> as<00:03:16.109> much<00:03:16.170> space<00:03:16.470> as<00:03:16.530> possible<00:03:16.940> so

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
conserve as much space as possible so

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.750 
conserve as much space as possible so
this<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:19.739> what<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.010> zip<00:03:20.190> symbol<00:03:20.459> looks<00:03:20.609> like

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
this is what the zip symbol looks like

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.220 
this is what the zip symbol looks like
when<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:20.940> take<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.209> out<00:03:21.299> of<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.480> package<00:03:21.840> it's

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
when you take it out of the package it's

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.059 
when you take it out of the package it's
just<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.680> plastic<00:03:23.400> bag<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.260> it's<00:03:25.260> um<00:03:25.470> it's<00:03:25.950> not

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
just a plastic bag and it's um it's not

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.740 
just a plastic bag and it's um it's not
cheap<00:03:26.430> doesn't<00:03:26.730> feel<00:03:26.940> like<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.120> ziploc<00:03:27.569> it's

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
cheap doesn't feel like a ziploc it's

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.569 
cheap doesn't feel like a ziploc it's
actually<00:03:28.019> about<00:03:28.140> some<00:03:28.350> substance<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.010> and

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
actually about some substance to it and

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.710 
actually about some substance to it and

bit right up it's not in here taking up

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.170 
bit right up it's not in here taking up

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.999 
space at all it takes a no space in this
diaper<00:06:03.419> bag<00:06:03.719> and<00:06:04.050> when<00:06:04.469> we're<00:06:04.589> going<00:06:04.710> out<00:06:04.860> for

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
diaper bag and when we're going out for

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.079 
diaper bag and when we're going out for
a<00:06:05.069> whole<00:06:05.310> day<00:06:06.620> I'll<00:06:07.620> fill<00:06:07.949> up<00:06:07.979> five<00:06:08.699> of<00:06:08.909> these

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:09.089 
a whole day I'll fill up five of these

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:11.659

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
and I put it in there and it still takes

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.929 
and I put it in there and it still takes
up<00:06:11.879> absolutely<00:06:12.169> no<00:06:13.169> space<00:06:13.889> but<00:06:14.550> when<00:06:14.699> we<00:06:14.819> go

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:14.939 
up absolutely no space but when we go

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:17.119 
up absolutely no space but when we go
out<00:06:15.209> every<00:06:15.599> musing<00:06:16.139> I<00:06:16.379> was<00:06:16.770> saying<00:06:16.979> using

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:17.129 
out every musing I was saying using

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:18.920 
out every musing I was saying using
bottles<00:06:17.520> but<00:06:17.699> we've<00:06:17.849> been<00:06:18.029> using<00:06:18.240> the<00:06:18.509> Playtex

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.159 
bottles but we've been using the Playtex
nursers<00:06:19.439> so<00:06:20.219> I'll<00:06:20.490> put<00:06:20.759> a<00:06:21.089> bottle<00:06:21.659> over<00:06:21.839> here

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
nursers so I'll put a bottle over here

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.860 
nursers so I'll put a bottle over here
with<00:06:23.099> one<00:06:23.399> of<00:06:23.520> the<00:06:23.610> liners<00:06:23.999> in<00:06:24.180> and<00:06:24.569> I'll<00:06:24.659> have

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
with one of the liners in and I'll have

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.320 
with one of the liners in and I'll have
some<00:06:25.110> formula<00:06:25.560> already<00:06:25.949> in<00:06:26.129> it<00:06:26.249> you<00:06:27.120> know<00:06:27.240> on

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
some formula already in it you know on

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.389 
some formula already in it you know on
the<00:06:27.419> other<00:06:27.509> side<00:06:27.779> I'll<00:06:27.990> just<00:06:28.169> tape<00:06:28.439> a<00:06:28.709> bottle

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:29.399 
the other side I'll just tape a bottle

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:31.550 
the other side I'll just tape a bottle
of<00:06:29.490> water<00:06:29.639> so<00:06:30.300> these<00:06:30.479> actually<00:06:30.870> can<00:06:31.229> stretch

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
of water so these actually can stretch

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.040 
of water so these actually can stretch
down<00:06:31.830> I<00:06:32.189> just<00:06:32.669> put<00:06:33.029> them<00:06:33.180> in<00:06:33.419> the<00:06:33.569> bottom<00:06:33.839> of<00:06:33.899> my

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
down I just put them in the bottom of my

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.689 
down I just put them in the bottom of my
back<00:06:34.259> blend<00:06:34.589> evenly<00:06:34.740> when<00:06:35.069> I<00:06:35.099> describe<00:06:35.550> it

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
back blend evenly when I describe it

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:39.079 
back blend evenly when I describe it
that<00:06:35.909> way<00:06:36.689> I'm<00:06:37.009> conserving<00:06:38.009> as<00:06:38.279> much<00:06:38.520> space<00:06:38.879> as

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:39.089 
that way I'm conserving as much space as

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:41.029 
that way I'm conserving as much space as
I<00:06:39.209> possibly<00:06:39.659> can<00:06:39.930> in<00:06:39.990> my<00:06:40.229> diaper<00:06:40.469> bag<00:06:40.620> for<00:06:41.009> all
