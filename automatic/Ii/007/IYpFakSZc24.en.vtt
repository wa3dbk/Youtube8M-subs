00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
scissors I can't find my other ones that

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.070 
scissors I can't find my other ones that
I<00:01:27.190> cut<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.520> first<00:01:27.730> question<00:01:28.090> with<00:01:28.210> I<00:01:28.450> just<00:01:28.960> had

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
I cut the first question with I just had

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.110 
I cut the first question with I just had
these<00:01:29.200> Kitty<00:01:29.860> scissors<00:01:30.790> but<00:01:32.760> that<00:01:33.760> I<00:01:33.790> guess

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
these Kitty scissors but that I guess

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.060 
these Kitty scissors but that I guess
that<00:01:34.540> was<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.780> good<00:01:35.020> thing<00:01:35.080> because<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.860> just

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
that was a good thing because I just

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.610 
that was a good thing because I just
kind<00:01:36.250> of<00:01:36.340> took<00:01:36.460> a<00:01:36.520> look<00:01:36.790> you<00:01:37.090> can<00:01:37.270> see<00:01:37.620> the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
kind of took a look you can see the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.340 
kind of took a look you can see the
bottom<00:01:38.890> edge<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:39.910> longer<00:01:40.240> than<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.420> top<00:01:40.780> so

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
bottom edge is longer than the top so

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.320 
bottom edge is longer than the top so
you<00:01:41.380> can<00:01:41.560> guide<00:01:42.040> it<00:01:42.070> with<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.520> bottom<00:01:42.910> and<00:01:43.090> cut

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
you can guide it with the bottom and cut

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.440 
you can guide it with the bottom and cut
the<00:01:43.570> top<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.110> it's<00:01:44.950> dulled<00:01:45.220> at<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.550> bottom

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
the top and it's dulled at the bottom

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.370 
the top and it's dulled at the bottom
and<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:47.410> top<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:49.119> animal<00:01:49.540> is<00:01:49.720> never<00:01:50.050> like

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
and the top so the animal is never like

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.499 
and the top so the animal is never like
in<00:01:50.619> danger<00:01:51.040> unless<00:01:51.220> you<00:01:51.430> really<00:01:51.729> are<00:01:52.000> jiving

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
in danger unless you really are jiving

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.480 
in danger unless you really are jiving
which<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:53.290> shouldn't<00:01:53.500> be<00:01:53.770> cutting<00:01:54.130> eggs<00:01:54.280> if

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
which you shouldn't be cutting eggs if

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.499 
which you shouldn't be cutting eggs if
you're<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:55.660> careless<00:01:56.290> anyway<00:01:56.619> but<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.450> you

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
you're that careless anyway but so you
