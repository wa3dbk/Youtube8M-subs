00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello and welcome tsum with 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.550
 land and greet god in the weather all the way 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.429
 short copy at the beginning only to 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.230
 storm or orkan xaver is much about it 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.330
 I have also written about it 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.580
 reported twitter j underlined 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.609
 tile man facebook tile weather 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.230
 they probably saw it like 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.359
 that was far from expected 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.380
 not from the wind speeds 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.529
 times the strongest storm in 2013 so 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.170
 not even a record for this year 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.570
 The special was the long time a work 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.190
 Duration of the northwest winds on the German 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.930
 book accordingly the storm tide on 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.730
 Friday morning 40 centimeters higher than 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.469
 what happened in 1962 was this bad one 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.969
 storm tide night for hamburg and also 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.860
 large parts of north germany 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.230
 of course at that time the difference 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.420
 heightened and, of course, too 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.890
 So it improves a bit again 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.000
 was amazing and that is actually 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.100
 also the worrying that the big one 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.650
 majority of the media that's what I am 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.900
 then post with the hashtag 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.930
 journalism just describe each one 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.509
 completely unimpressed by the facts 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.330
 then anyway written and sent 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.280
 has and synonymous worked out collectively 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.340
 really that's what I think that's what 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.259
 New is for a few years 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.900
 this willingness to 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.720
 collective disintegration of the media and 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.299
 say no we do not want that 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.640
 that is not a record hurricane we are 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.630
 want to write that now since 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.240
 decades 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.040
 So the strongest is that's that 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.479
 amazing and new for me and where 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.140
 I always ask myself how is it 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.170
 come 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.600
 this collective willingness of the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.060
 large majority of the media germany 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.579
 shit to write though you exactly 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.350
 I know it's not true 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.630
 and this collective disengagement gave that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.670
 it so often when it came to it 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.299
 this performance protection law 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.860
 enforce wulff hoeneÃŸ and so on 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.200
 continue if that then justified 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.530
 is or is not put to the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.310
 Worry is always just a bit 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.180
 do you end this collective austerity 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.530
 gives and this this equal step over 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.790
 not to say even worse words 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.680
 Will that happen someday? 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.780
 if it's not just about it 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.360
 to refuse anyone 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.290
 but then somehow to push 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.970
 again, it's just amazing 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.550
 how to do that and there are none 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.220
 can critical instance so I have it 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.650
 no girl saw it now anyway 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.010
 nee had written that 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.630
 Colleagues write and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.940
 that's nonsense that's in 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.459
 not the strongest hurricane and no 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.160
 Strong storm and all these things 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.170
 but they all have theirs 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.019
 correspondents with the rubber boots 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.209
 and with the cap yes exactly in the 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.040
 sent high north and have there 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.290
 desperate then somehow on a few 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.750
 waves shrugged in the hope that then 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.209
 the self-written and 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.360
 somehow sent disaster brought about 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.359
 so I would not know 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.160
 maybe somebody will tell me that 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.079
 crazy full-length journalism 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.359
 Why do you do that? 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.370
 why his pet shit on purpose 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.420
 although he knows that's not true 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.019
 I would be interested 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.819
 okay is on the back has nothing 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.890
 to do with the orkan but always so 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.549
 behind the back behind the 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.450
 coldfront it is cold and relatively cold 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.769
 according to wintry 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.280
 Road conditions must be careful 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.100
 Switzerland has a joke night on tour 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.630
 because now the sleepy degree below zero 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:52.120
 Of course, I'm now relatively relaxed 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.870
 border road drowsiness and then quite 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.600
 below zero 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.670
 this smooth ice problematic also otherwise 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.680
 partly in germany everywhere where the 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.410
 Roads are wet and there where the wind 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.350
 above all, then the south wears off 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.579
 the danger that just this fair to ice 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.650
 now wind is getting less and less 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.780
 Saturday night then an almost legendary 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.160
 moment there it is in the north 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.250
 germany times temporarily as 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.200
 duck pond so very weak wind that 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.880
 The coarsest ones really do sit through and 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.120
 accordingly then 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.730
 the levels also increase in the future 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.680
 Flooding lower and lower is now 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.600
 reasonably done that now 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.040
 still snowing and snow is raining and also 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.410
 on saturday partly to the flat land 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.630
 when snow starts it will be in the 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.910
 Runs on Saturdays in the flat country always 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.920
 more in rain then pass on sunday 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.690
 everywhere thawing then that will be 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.910
 now white is in the flat country everywhere 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.010
 its middle mountains disappeared again 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.620
 and alps where you usually ski 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.350
 do not worry that will be reasonably 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.000
 stay at least higher up 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.190
 even if it's direction Monday 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.710
 tuesday is up to double digits 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.300
 with the temperatures in the middle and 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.970
 also in the north of germany direction 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.100
 south and also switzerland becomes god 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.050
 so slow without fog high mist lay 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.360
 in that is called super stubenberger 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.630
 beautiful further without and everything 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.310
 and s rum halt fog and low stratus below 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.930
 and the further they get out in the 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.560
 Central Mountains Southern Central Mountains 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.060
 and alps 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.010
 There they are in beautiful 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.800
 sunshine below you have fog 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.670
 and to fight high fog 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.570
 The temperatures will go accordingly 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:30.370
 Also in the course of the week back down so 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.870
 then again direction zero and 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.790
 five degrees that is always when this in 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.770
 version situation comes then cool then 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.410
 downstairs but always on the 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.620
 It remains fantastic at the top 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.200
 Ski weather there is more to say 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.940
 the east of austria have the alm 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.560
 not much noticed happened there anyway 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.990
 really nothing special there now 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.090
 also slowly but surely now in Vienna 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.670
 then warm up at the beginning of the week 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.860
 what else to say is generally for 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.460
 everywhere there is no winter in 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.490
 but that was no different 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.620
 typically expect that, too 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.980
 was also so this collective disengage 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.240
 again because he is the variety many 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.460
 written as a media 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.350
 animal winter we will be all 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.180
 die and Siberian and as I said 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.830
 It still can hardly be there in anybody 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.180
 winter cold or will say everything 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:24.270
 yes we said it but it is 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.250
 now almost the same again 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.830
 as far as you can see in december 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.180
 where december no train age month 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.070
 will be from today's perspective 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.900
 that's a little bit of a prediction 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.419
 to venture now well maybe is still 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.650
 and I would always go over one 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:41.630
 happy animal winter 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.550
 a touch of it is there now but how 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.620
 That's fast in the lowlands, too 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.240
 again away the weekend goodbye 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.240
 and good luck for god
