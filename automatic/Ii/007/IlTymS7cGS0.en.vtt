00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659

mercury vapor yard blaster again it says
what's<00:00:06.690> different<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.200> this<00:00:07.379> time<00:00:07.620> instead<00:00:07.919> of

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
what's different is this time instead of

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.530 
what's different is this time instead of
using<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.340> clear<00:00:08.610> bulb<00:00:08.849> where<00:00:09.210> you're<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.480> to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
using a clear bulb where you're going to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.660 
using a clear bulb where you're going to
use<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> coated<00:00:10.170> bulb<00:00:10.410> see<00:00:11.040> how<00:00:11.280> it's<00:00:11.460> different

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
use a coated bulb see how it's different

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.820 
use a coated bulb see how it's different
I<00:00:12.059> have<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.900> connected<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.469> switched

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
I have it connected to this switched

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.070 
I have it connected to this switched
outlet<00:00:14.070> when<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> hit<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.969> switch<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.929> light

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
outlet when I hit the switch the light

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.970 
outlet when I hit the switch the light
will<00:00:16.230> go<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.430> ready<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.670> fire

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.070 

now<00:00:25.490> when<00:00:25.820> it<00:00:25.910> starts<00:00:26.210> up<00:00:26.300> it's<00:00:26.480> actually<00:00:26.630> pink

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
now when it starts up it's actually pink

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.680 
now when it starts up it's actually pink
this<00:00:28.010> is<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.220> result<00:00:28.610> of<00:00:28.730> red<00:00:28.940> fox<00:00:29.240> furs<00:00:29.480> to

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
this is the result of red fox furs to

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.840 
this is the result of red fox furs to
convert<00:00:30.020> some<00:00:30.260> of<00:00:30.350> that<00:00:30.470> blue<00:00:31.340> green<00:00:31.610> light

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
convert some of that blue green light

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.570 
convert some of that blue green light
into<00:00:32.360> red<00:00:33.020> to<00:00:33.230> add<00:00:33.350> red<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:33.830> spectrum<00:00:34.309> you

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
into red to add red to the spectrum you

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.910 
into red to add red to the spectrum you
know<00:00:35.510> that<00:00:35.660> says<00:00:35.840> it<00:00:35.989> warms<00:00:36.260> up<00:00:36.380> it'll<00:00:36.650> be<00:00:36.739> more

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
know that says it warms up it'll be more

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.200 
know that says it warms up it'll be more
of<00:00:36.950> a<00:00:37.130> cool<00:00:37.340> white<00:00:37.580> and<00:00:37.760> color

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.819 

you<00:00:44.840> can<00:00:44.960> see<00:00:45.110> it's<00:00:45.260> already<00:00:45.379> starting<00:00:45.500> to

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
you can see it's already starting to

00:00:45.829 --> 00:01:09.990 
you can see it's already starting to
change<00:00:46.040> color<00:00:46.160> even<00:00:46.670> now

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.539 

getting<00:01:10.660> pretty<00:01:10.810> close<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.080> its<00:01:11.380> final<00:01:11.590> color

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.490 

the<00:01:22.000> other<00:01:22.150> thing<00:01:22.390> about<00:01:22.420> coded<00:01:23.080> bulbs<00:01:23.380> that

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
the other thing about coded bulbs that

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.340 
the other thing about coded bulbs that
makes<00:01:23.650> them<00:01:23.830> better<00:01:24.040> than<00:01:24.250> clear<00:01:24.640> bulbs<00:01:25.350> well

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
makes them better than clear bulbs well

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.990 
makes them better than clear bulbs well
actually<00:01:26.799> they're<00:01:27.220> not<00:01:27.250> really<00:01:27.369> better<00:01:27.760> which

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
actually they're not really better which

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.609 
actually they're not really better which
is<00:01:28.119> different<00:01:28.540> but<00:01:28.720> one<00:01:29.140> thing<00:01:29.290> that's<00:01:29.440> better

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
is different but one thing that's better

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.649 
is different but one thing that's better
about<00:01:29.860> them<00:01:30.040> is<00:01:30.159> that<00:01:30.280> instead<00:01:31.210> of<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.420> glass

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
about them is that instead of the glass

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.380 
about them is that instead of the glass
converting<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.530> UV<00:01:32.740> into<00:01:33.190> heat<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:34.090> just

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
converting it the UV into heat it just

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.969 
converting it the UV into heat it just
converts<00:01:34.720> it<00:01:34.840> into<00:01:34.900> light<00:01:35.229> so<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.560> can<00:01:35.770> touch

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
converts it into light so you can touch

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.560 
converts it into light so you can touch
it<00:01:36.040> you<00:01:37.030> can<00:01:37.210> touch<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.650> it's<00:01:39.570> it's

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
it you can touch it and it's it's

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.850 
it you can touch it and it's it's
admittedly<00:01:41.050> hot<00:01:41.380> but<00:01:41.590> it's<00:01:41.710> not

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
admittedly hot but it's not

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.940 
admittedly hot but it's not
overpoweringly<00:01:42.520> hot

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
overpoweringly hot

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.389 
overpoweringly hot
yes<00:01:44.950> it's<00:01:45.100> now<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.340> cool<00:01:46.149> white<00:01:46.390> color

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
yes it's now that cool white color

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.290 
yes it's now that cool white color
that's<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.670> final<00:01:48.970> color<00:01:50.970> once<00:01:51.970> is<00:01:52.090> what's

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
that's the final color once is what's

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.669 
that's the final color once is what's
this<00:01:52.450> go<00:01:52.659> until<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:53.050> camera<00:01:53.350> runs<00:01:53.530> out<00:01:53.649> of

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
this go until the camera runs out of

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.970 
this go until the camera runs out of
juice<00:01:53.920> which<00:01:54.130> will<00:01:54.250> be<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.399> few<00:01:54.610> seconds
