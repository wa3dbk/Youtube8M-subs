00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.560 
same like a bit this game like
everything<00:04:49.880> I<00:04:50.030> don't<00:04:50.240> know<00:04:50.300> what<00:04:50.450> they've

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
everything I don't know what they've

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:51.610 
everything I don't know what they've
done<00:04:50.720> bit<00:04:50.930> like<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.230> just<00:04:51.380> feels<00:04:51.500> like

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
done bit like it just feels like

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.290 
done bit like it just feels like
everything's<00:04:52.130> blown<00:04:52.340> up<00:04:52.490> in<00:04:52.610> your<00:04:52.640> face<00:04:52.760> like

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
everything's blown up in your face like

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.960 
everything's blown up in your face like
there's<00:04:53.540> a<00:04:53.600> lot<00:04:53.810> of<00:04:53.870> destruction<00:04:54.560> I<00:04:54.970> think

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
there's a lot of destruction I think

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.280 
there's a lot of destruction I think
that's<00:04:56.120> maybe<00:04:56.240> because<00:04:56.480> they've<00:04:56.660> packed<00:04:57.050> in

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
that's maybe because they've packed in

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.960 
that's maybe because they've packed in
more<00:04:57.530> vehicles<00:04:57.800> there's<00:04:58.220> so<00:04:58.460> many<00:04:58.610> vehicles

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
more vehicles there's so many vehicles

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.550 
more vehicles there's so many vehicles
so<00:04:59.270> there's<00:04:59.450> always<00:04:59.570> like<00:04:59.870> helicopters

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
so there's always like helicopters

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.220 
so there's always like helicopters
crashing<00:05:01.130> into<00:05:01.310> walls<00:05:01.700> and<00:05:02.090> you<00:05:02.660> know<00:05:02.780> trucks

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
crashing into walls and you know trucks

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.840 
crashing into walls and you know trucks
flipping<00:05:03.710> off<00:05:03.830> of<00:05:03.980> things<00:05:04.220> and<00:05:04.460> stuff<00:05:04.640> it's

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
flipping off of things and stuff it's

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.420 
flipping off of things and stuff it's
really<00:05:04.880> quite<00:05:05.270> cool<00:05:05.510> in<00:05:05.630> that<00:05:05.720> regard<00:05:06.050> and

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
really quite cool in that regard and

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.770 
really quite cool in that regard and
although<00:05:07.430> this<00:05:07.490> is<00:05:07.670> quite<00:05:07.820> a<00:05:07.880> dense<00:05:08.150> map<00:05:08.510> like

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
although this is quite a dense map like

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.810 
although this is quite a dense map like
it's<00:05:09.290> not<00:05:09.440> a<00:05:09.500> big<00:05:09.560> map<00:05:09.980> but<00:05:10.190> it's<00:05:10.310> dense<00:05:10.580> you

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
it's not a big map but it's dense you

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.510 
it's not a big map but it's dense you
know<00:05:11.290> you're<00:05:12.290> never<00:05:12.500> too<00:05:12.650> far<00:05:12.680> from<00:05:13.100> a<00:05:13.250> little
