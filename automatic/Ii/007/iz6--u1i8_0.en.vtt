move<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.619> success<00:01:56.040> rate<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> little

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
move the success rate on it is a little

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
random sometimes they just don't get hit

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.030 
random sometimes they just don't get hit
by<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.939> or<00:02:00.689> their<00:02:00.869> invincibility<00:02:01.110> frames<00:02:01.530> kick

in<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.579> don't<00:02:02.759> get<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:02.909> much<00:02:03.119> damage

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
but if it does hit it will hit pretty

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.780

but<00:02:15.950> uh<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.520> what<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.730> beat<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.090> game<00:02:17.240> with

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
but uh this is what I beat the game with

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.780 
but uh this is what I beat the game with
barring<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.050> extra<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.160> know<00:02:19.250> level<00:02:19.640> or<00:02:19.760> two

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
barring the extra you know level or two

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.150 
barring the extra you know level or two
that<00:02:20.060> i<00:02:20.120> got<00:02:20.300> from<00:02:20.480> finishing<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.230> game<00:02:21.410> as

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
that i got from finishing the game as

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.040 
that i got from finishing the game as
you<00:02:22.280> can<00:02:22.370> see<00:02:22.490> i<00:02:22.520> specialized<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.360> basic

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
you can see i specialized in basic

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.500 
you can see i specialized in basic
attacks<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.530> strike<00:02:24.800> supers<00:02:25.220> this<00:02:26.120> makes<00:02:26.390> it

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
attacks and strike supers this makes it

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.830 
attacks and strike supers this makes it
so<00:02:26.750> your<00:02:27.350> melee<00:02:27.650> combos<00:02:28.040> do<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> lot<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.460> damage

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
so your melee combos do a lot of damage

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.540 
so your melee combos do a lot of damage
also<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.080> blue<00:02:30.410> hurricane<00:02:30.890> will<00:02:31.160> do<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.310> lot

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
also the blue hurricane will do a lot

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.480 
also the blue hurricane will do a lot
too<00:02:31.820> if<00:02:32.270> you<00:02:32.420> get<00:02:32.570> lucky<00:02:33.040> stamina<00:02:34.040> you

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
too if you get lucky stamina you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.010 
too if you get lucky stamina you
definitely<00:02:34.700> want<00:02:35.090> some<00:02:35.270> stamina<00:02:35.540> just

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
definitely want some stamina just

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.200 
definitely want some stamina just
because<00:02:36.550> you're<00:02:37.550> going<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.760> want<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.000> have

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
because you're going to want to have

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.810 
because you're going to want to have
teleports<00:02:39.020> available<00:02:39.500> tell<00:02:40.340> both<00:02:40.610> for

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
teleports available tell both for

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.910 
teleports available tell both for
cancelling<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.450> for<00:02:41.630> defending<00:02:41.990> yourself<00:02:42.380> I

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
cancelling and for defending yourself I

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.280 
cancelling and for defending yourself I
found<00:02:43.490> five<00:02:44.180> blocks<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.720> be<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.870> pretty<00:02:45.110> good

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
found five blocks to be a pretty good

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.199 
found five blocks to be a pretty good
speed<00:02:45.590> spot<00:02:45.860> I'm<00:02:46.430> probably<00:02:46.580> going<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.970> try<00:02:47.150> to

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
speed spot I'm probably going to try to

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.660 
speed spot I'm probably going to try to
get<00:02:47.330> at<00:02:47.480> least<00:02:47.510> one<00:02:47.930> more<00:02:48.170> block<00:02:48.440> as<00:02:49.130> I

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
get at least one more block as I

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.030 
get at least one more block as I
approach<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.150> post<00:02:50.360> game<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:50.810> did<00:02:51.560> not<00:02:51.709> put<00:02:51.890> any

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
approach the post game I did not put any

points<00:02:52.370> in<00:02:52.490> key<00:02:52.640> blast<00:02:52.910> supers<00:02:53.300> it's

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
points in key blast supers it's

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.180 
points in key blast supers it's
definitely<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.260> easier<00:02:54.590> way<00:02:54.740> to<00:02:54.770> play<00:02:55.040> this

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
definitely the easier way to play this

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.670 
definitely the easier way to play this
game<00:02:55.400> but<00:02:55.760> I<00:02:56.330> managed<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.170> make<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.410> work

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
game but I managed to make it work

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.410 
game but I managed to make it work
pretty<00:02:57.920> well<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.640> was<00:02:58.820> a<00:02:58.850> bit<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.209> struggle

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
pretty well it was a bit of a struggle

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.310 
pretty well it was a bit of a struggle
until<00:02:59.810> I<00:02:59.870> got<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:01.060> Z<00:03:02.060> soul<00:03:02.330> but<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.959> mean<00:03:03.200> it

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
until I got that Z soul but I mean it

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.680 
until I got that Z soul but I mean it
worked<00:03:03.500> out<00:03:03.650> pretty<00:03:03.830> well<00:03:04.000> ki<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.030> didn't<00:03:05.540> use

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
worked out pretty well ki I didn't use

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.100 
worked out pretty well ki I didn't use
much<00:03:06.910> what's<00:03:07.910> actually<00:03:08.060> ended<00:03:08.480> up<00:03:08.540> working<00:03:08.750> in

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
much what's actually ended up working in

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.640 
much what's actually ended up working in
my<00:03:09.350> favor<00:03:09.590> because<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:11.239> want<00:03:11.480> max<00:03:11.750> key<00:03:12.050> for

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
my favor because you want max key for

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.650 
my favor because you want max key for
the<00:03:12.769> regeneration<00:03:13.239> since<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.450> can<00:03:14.570> only

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
the regeneration since you can only

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.170 
the regeneration since you can only
carry<00:03:14.959> four<00:03:15.350> items<00:03:15.530> with<00:03:15.830> you<00:03:16.040> some<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.030> the

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
carry four items with you some of the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.550 
carry four items with you some of the
missions<00:03:17.330> are<00:03:17.600> pretty<00:03:17.810> long<00:03:18.019> towards<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.530> end

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
missions are pretty long towards the end

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.190 
missions are pretty long towards the end
and<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.070> can<00:03:19.190> run<00:03:19.340> out<00:03:19.489> pretty<00:03:19.700> fast<00:03:20.019> raz<00:03:21.019> with

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
and you can run out pretty fast raz with

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.110 
and you can run out pretty fast raz with
this<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.800> will<00:03:21.920> only<00:03:22.010> take<00:03:22.190> like<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.880> couple

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
this it will only take like a couple

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.539 
this it will only take like a couple
short<00:03:23.480> combos<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.080> fill<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.320> up<00:03:24.410> then<00:03:25.310> at<00:03:25.430> that

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
short combos to fill it up then at that

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.400 
short combos to fill it up then at that
point<00:03:25.610> you<00:03:26.180> have<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.510> bit<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.810> a<00:03:26.900> little<00:03:27.200> meta

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
point you have a bit of a little meta

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.530

a little more sloppy you still have to

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.910 
a little more sloppy you still have to
know<00:05:21.060> what<00:05:21.180> you're<00:05:21.210> doing<00:05:21.630> but<00:05:21.870> you're<00:05:22.800> still
