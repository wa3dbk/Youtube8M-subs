 You're doing all the Dárcy configuration. 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.890
 first step how to do 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.100
 clicks and for what is not 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.490
 I have is what I do the top scorer 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.860
 on my computer 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.470
 the wood ingress

 he has a johnny the standard barbie 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
 the lantern allowing rowing 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.490
 let's accept no children 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.590
 We do not want 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.560

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.189
 so I only have one option of creating a new comic so I have external and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.540
 internal and dvi 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.500
 this year 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.799
 is that your hard battery you will be able to be using win it 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.000
 I realize that I was single then 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 This has a sharper world of images. 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.510
 few games given in this caxiense 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.450
 I'll name her 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.290
 physics 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.610
 and pt 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.500
 your long name blowing 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 jannis movement 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.460
 teacher exam portal 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.230
 another interesting thing 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.280
 it is super important that you attribute enables each server 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.519
 is what Microsoft recommends best practices 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.919
 it's no use you're putting 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.170
 two three four five six 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.070
 madrid plastic a report work from the new newspaper there for her 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.399
 OK 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:24.629
 Best Practices in Servicing a Network Card 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.589
 for each server 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.259
 I put it here, enabling 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.429
 usually his whole life is working on it. 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.249
 applied 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.699
 ask yourself my pacaembu will be created 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.790
 question is saying that the ferrari is being used 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.089
 disconnect from christmas again rock 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:48.159
 fuck this option informed but did not look again 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.029
 I ticked on indonesia 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:55.049
 it was thanks to the team 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.699
 Do you have a body today? 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.919
 using this same possibility is my case 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:01.929
 so he could give in 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.209
 this is to use the virtual machine with my 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.379
 of this same luggage he will not give 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.319
 state incompatibility then it is as if it were a new buyer another 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.309
 network card too 

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:15.459
 because it was created on the video card 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.319
 it's interesting too 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.109
 because of this sport 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.109
 the fust is threatened the internet was created 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.019
 I realized that the internal network 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.019
 a bolão 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:37.189
 the minister 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:38.949
 the background is flashing 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.739
 What matters is this. 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.809
 Do you need the internal network? 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:46.719
 it gives you the right to also use only if it is necessary 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.709
 so it's a lot of use for you to isolate your network like I said a badge 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:51.909
 network 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.499
 as we saw here in the Senate 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.439
 if you vote in the same network as last 7 days 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.849
 she goes 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.189
 to seek this part of this amount attributed to it 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:05.559
 we started to use the internet portal is the one in which only later came to be 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:06.709
 communicate with her 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.949
 You can also make the coalition 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.240
 or goojje 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.270
 the segment 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.580
 as the brand has and gave another is any zone 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.529
 but the interesting thing is that you use this rule 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.370
 tombini then highlighted study 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.440
 already deprived of the right to communicate with buyers outside the 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.830
 little screen 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.099
 Aeronautics Paves The Way To The Problem 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.120
 perhaps 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.120
 Thank you for mentioning too. 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.559
 to the human being 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:41.699
 are all the fingers cut and yielded create another vain private example 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:42.819
 create 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.819
 private network private 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.930
 which has led to a new account is 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.930
 if it happened 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:59.839
 and here in the physical realm that the external and internal private without moving defeated to 

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:02.839
 teach to grow old and die 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.169
 removing 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.599
 done that I can apply 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.199
 I have focused every time a great event has been created, almost all the two 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:12.870
 options 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.039
 live physical rehabilitation 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.879
 about changes 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.599
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:19.409
 see you next time
