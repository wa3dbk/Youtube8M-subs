going like nine years I guess what's the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.390 
going like nine years I guess what's the
thing<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.930> most<00:01:10.320> people<00:01:10.439> don't<00:01:10.619> understand

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
thing that most people don't understand

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.350 
thing that most people don't understand
about<00:01:11.460> fashion<00:01:12.000> shows<00:01:13.700> then<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> doesn't<00:01:15.060> make

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
about fashion shows then it doesn't make

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.720 
about fashion shows then it doesn't make
a<00:01:15.420> business<00:01:15.980> that<00:01:16.980> you<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
a business that you have to have a

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.190 
a business that you have to have a
business<00:01:18.000> before<00:01:18.300> you<00:01:18.570> put<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> fashion

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
business before you put on a fashion

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.260 
business before you put on a fashion
show<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.920> feel<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:20.730> in<00:01:20.850> business<00:01:20.970> for

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
show I feel like I was in business for

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.510 
show I feel like I was in business for
10<00:01:21.450> years<00:01:21.660> before<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.050> did<00:01:22.230> a<00:01:22.260> show<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.800> I<00:01:23.220> felt

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
10 years before I did a show and I felt

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.480 
10 years before I did a show and I felt
like<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:24.570> then<00:01:25.260> when<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.680> spend<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> money

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
like it then when you spend the money

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.180 
like it then when you spend the money
the<00:01:26.940> expenditure<00:01:27.570> isn't<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.170> crazy<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.920> you

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
the expenditure isn't so crazy and you

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.370 
the expenditure isn't so crazy and you
kind<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.550> it<00:01:30.120> makes<00:01:30.360> sense<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:31.050> when<00:01:31.260> you

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
kind of it makes sense but when you

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.330 
kind of it makes sense but when you
think<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.740> you're<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:31.980> to<00:01:32.070> build<00:01:32.190> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
think that you're going to build a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.040 
think that you're going to build a
business<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> fashion<00:01:33.090> show<00:01:33.300> that's<00:01:33.900> a

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
business on a fashion show that's a

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.350 
business on a fashion show that's a
misconception<00:01:34.460> we<00:01:35.460> look<00:01:35.700> at<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.910> clothes<00:01:36.150> out

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
misconception we look at the clothes out

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
misconception we look at the clothes out
there<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.080> walk<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> runway<00:01:37.740> I

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
there that that walk down the runway I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.200 
there that that walk down the runway I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.480 
a lot more fabric it's not less fabric
it's<00:01:53.400> more<00:01:53.760> so<00:01:54.270> what<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.540> do<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:56.070> endl<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it's more so what we do is we do endl it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.310 
it's more so what we do is we do endl it
down<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:57.060> where<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.300> woman<00:01:57.659> feels<00:01:57.870> comfortable

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
down to where a woman feels comfortable

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.690 
down to where a woman feels comfortable
in<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.740> because<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.190> don't<00:01:59.280> want<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.520> close

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
in it because you don't want the close

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700 
in it because you don't want the close
to<00:01:59.880> where<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.840> basically<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.560> more

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
to where you so basically it's more

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.410 
to where you so basically it's more
about<00:02:01.800> paring<00:02:02.250> down<00:02:02.280> keeping<00:02:02.970> them<00:02:03.150> pretty

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
about paring down keeping them pretty

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.149 
about paring down keeping them pretty
elements<00:02:04.020> I'll<00:02:04.170> keep<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.770> fluttering

elements I'll keep the fluttering

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.010 
elements I'll keep the fluttering
fluttering<00:02:05.430> skirts<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.450> i'll<00:02:06.600> probably<00:02:06.780> take

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
fluttering skirts but i'll probably take

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.080 
fluttering skirts but i'll probably take
