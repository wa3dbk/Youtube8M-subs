00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
and a g-shock graphite rod i didn't show

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.980 
and a g-shock graphite rod i didn't show
you<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.920> before<00:01:29.340> these<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.610> called<00:01:30.509> bubbles

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you this before these are called bubbles

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.710 
you this before these are called bubbles
bubble<00:01:31.770> floats<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.820> they're<00:01:33.030> slider<00:01:33.329> floats

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
bubble floats and they're slider floats

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.789 
bubble floats and they're slider floats
they<00:01:33.930> allow<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:35.040> float<00:01:35.390> watch<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.799> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
they allow the the float watch this the
