care<00:02:40.770> lying<00:02:41.130> about<00:02:41.220> then<00:02:41.730> why<00:02:41.820> not<00:02:41.880> pick<00:02:42.120> him

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
care lying about then why not pick him

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.030 
care lying about then why not pick him
up<00:02:42.360> although<00:02:42.720> you've<00:02:43.260> got<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.560> remember<00:02:43.650> here

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
up although you've got to remember here

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.440 
up although you've got to remember here
are<00:02:44.310> updating<00:02:44.670> price<00:02:44.850> range<00:02:45.060> it's<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.270> lot<00:02:45.420> more

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
are updating price range it's a lot more

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.210 
are updating price range it's a lot more
frequently<00:02:45.960> now<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.590> probably<00:02:46.800> will<00:02:46.950> drop

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
frequently now so it probably will drop

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.530 
frequently now so it probably will drop
a<00:02:47.250> bit<00:02:47.520> more<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.790> price<00:02:48.000> which<00:02:48.210> is<00:02:48.300> even<00:02:48.510> better

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
a bit more in price which is even better

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.330 
a bit more in price which is even better
because<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:49.140> it's<00:02:49.440> cheaper<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:49.920> definitely

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
because if it's cheaper is definitely

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.980 
because if it's cheaper is definitely
worth<00:02:50.460> picking<00:02:50.490> up<00:02:50.820> in<00:02:50.970> my<00:02:51.360> opinion<00:02:51.720> anyway

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
worth picking up in my opinion anyway

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.720 
worth picking up in my opinion anyway
