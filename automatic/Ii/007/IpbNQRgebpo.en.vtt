forward this a bit just take note that I
eventually<00:00:45.360> reach<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:45.989> Eastern<00:00:46.590> island

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.480 

after<00:01:05.780> I<00:01:05.810> landed<00:01:06.320> I<00:01:06.530> went<00:01:06.830> back<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.310> tower

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
after I landed I went back to the tower

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.700 
after I landed I went back to the tower
I<00:01:07.610> just<00:01:07.940> jumped<00:01:08.270> off<00:01:08.330> of<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.840> upgraded<00:01:09.560> to

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
I just jumped off of and upgraded to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.280 
I just jumped off of and upgraded to
glide<00:01:09.920> distance<00:01:10.370> too<00:01:10.610> and<00:01:10.850> jumped<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:11.810> glided

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
glide distance too and jumped and glided

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.830 
glide distance too and jumped and glided
in<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.590> same<00:01:12.770> direction<00:01:12.979> I<00:01:13.370> did<00:01:13.550> last<00:01:13.790> time<00:01:13.940> my

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
in the same direction I did last time my

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.840 
in the same direction I did last time my
jaw<00:01:15.080> dropped<00:01:15.530> I<00:01:15.860> almost<00:01:16.160> felt<00:01:16.460> like<00:01:16.520> I<00:01:16.700> was

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
jaw dropped I almost felt like I was

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.190 
jaw dropped I almost felt like I was
gaining<00:01:17.150> altitude<00:01:17.450> instead<00:01:18.260> of<00:01:18.350> losing<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:18.890> I

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
gaining altitude instead of losing it I

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.900 
gaining altitude instead of losing it I
easily<00:01:21.200> made<00:01:21.619> it<00:01:21.740> over<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.190> spot<00:01:22.430> I<00:01:22.460> landed

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
easily made it over to the spot I landed

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.760 
easily made it over to the spot I landed
without<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.330> modded<00:01:23.630> upgrade<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.200> even<00:01:24.650> had

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
without the modded upgrade and even had

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.440 
without the modded upgrade and even had
enough<00:01:25.009> air<00:01:25.250> to<00:01:25.490> make<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.759> back<00:01:25.910> to<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.240> tower

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
enough air to make it back to the tower

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.780 
enough air to make it back to the tower
I<00:01:26.570> just<00:01:26.900> jumped<00:01:27.170> off<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.320> still<00:01:28.310> high<00:01:28.520> above

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
I just jumped off of still high above

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.320 
I just jumped off of still high above
the<00:01:28.940> ground

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
the ground

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.719 
the ground
this<00:01:29.869> upgrade<00:01:30.170> practically<00:01:31.009> makes<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:31.460> so

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
this upgrade practically makes it so

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.910 
this upgrade practically makes it so
that<00:01:31.910> you<00:01:32.060> are<00:01:32.090> able<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.479> fly<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:33.110> feel<00:01:33.710> like<00:01:33.830> I

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
that you are able to fly I feel like I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.350 
that you are able to fly I feel like I
could<00:01:34.130> have<00:01:34.160> made<00:01:34.369> another<00:01:34.610> trip<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.000> the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
could have made another trip to the

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.240 
could have made another trip to the
Eastern<00:01:35.660> island<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.110> back<00:01:36.289> but<00:01:36.800> I<00:01:36.830> ran<00:01:37.039> into

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
Eastern island and back but I ran into
