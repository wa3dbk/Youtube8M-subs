00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.949

 He told me we'll be three 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.479

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.030

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:34.680
 I did not know that with the art of people 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.670
 this could happen you could play 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.340
 an audience of 1 and acts as an audience 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.930

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.180
 sweeping 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.859
 Wow, I'm discovering a creature. 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.079
 new the clown 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.750
 the most enterprising artist who has 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.599
 My sister called me and she said her father had 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.920
 a stroke and he is very badly medicated 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.370

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.010
 last 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.940
 and when I got to uti I expected 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.730
 that my father was dying but my father was 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.739
 completely euphoric my son 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.659
 centered his clown things 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:19.019
 while I was traveling my father was 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:20.370
 touting me of incor of uti for 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.799
 pediatrics 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.139
 I looked up and I spoke as follows 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.060
 I do not have the slightest desire is here 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.609
 but I will, I'll do my best 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.090
 I work if I have any credit for 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.239
 that 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.760
 play on my father's account combined and 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.500
 going out for a day's work when I 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.629
 I arrive on my father's bed. 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.739
 he is sitting on the bed with a can of 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:47.299
 soda in hand have the stings in the other 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.790
 talking and how did it go? 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:54.419
 I never thought to see you there. 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.160
 express service on that side and I 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:59.519
 I said only one way to thank the 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.709
 life for this opportunity and the way it is 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.730
 setting up a similar program here in the 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.129
 Brazil 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.440
 at that time when one thought of 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.239
 social work what I heard 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.980
 I'd rather give a sack of food for a 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.889
 family that is hungry than this 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.690
 story of joy and I was keeping myself 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.669
 of all forms with small 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.370
 partnerships and everything else did not arrive 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.190
 with three years of work that the 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.870
 people had questions to answer 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.389
 I remember at the meeting that people 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.249
 did the business I came in 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.770
 the wonderful dismay not so much that I 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:33.409
 I had already said that there is no 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.770
 Just did not see who just wants to know. 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:38.779
 then we already knew that I was going to take another 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.879
 He said no, nothing, I just wanted 

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:43.669
 to know if I can take my soon after 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.599
 six months if I see that you took 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.550
 just right 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:50.150
 I said no, it's okay, I can take your 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.460
 So the advantage then to do is just have 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.580
 sure, it's ok, let's try it 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.189
 it's not anything we talk 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.669
 that's us for five years together and today 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:04.159
 Here 's what I have to wish for. 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:08.259
 You are all of you in your 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:14.509
 trajectory one do not be afraid to dare 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:16.639
 to fall prey to miss mainly 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.250
 all of you can have a moment in the 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:23.719
 life where you know that you are a 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:27.560
 of 180 million that you are the virus that 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:30.469
 You're the guy and because of the face. 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.860
 and your willingness to give 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:37.250
 face to face a good thing is going to happen 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:41.680
 and I wanted to do a little of my 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:44.680
 past of musical theater for you to 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.680
 understand
