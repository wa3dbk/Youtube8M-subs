 today we start a series of tests 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.949
 with our game studios 750 computers 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.529
 in a ball show that we have in the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.539
 our personal website has really liked it 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.640
 the staff has been asking for a lot of tests in 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.800
 games with him then setup it 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.560
 for those who do not know our fx site 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.810
 4.300 4gb ram memory processor 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.380
 ddr3 1066 guedes 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.180
 a fountain tile source x 400 watts is 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.270
 ideal for this computer does not need 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.480
 more than this is for the mother of gbd to 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.800
 78 l mts2 cool motherboard too 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.350
 then print the incoming third party and 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.039
 that shines the computer at 750 ctx 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.960
 of 1 gig of nvidia that plaquinha 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.370
 show of ball in the same that the people 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.280
 is testing the model of envy 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.899
 Supercop cool plaque same 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.100
 so this is it folks let's get the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.420
 four games tests will do also 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.760
 it's almost 3 lippi dogs tomb raider no 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.500
 have and test the games and will 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.439
 showing you guys we'll show you 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.830
 on real computer performance 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.850
 so come on, good personal folks 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:29.180
 the tests of this machine continue to be 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:37.200
 People are going to test now on a video ray. 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:40.619
 1080p how to zoom and was better and 80 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.290
 up to 5 agent delegates and I 'm already 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:54.420
 here there is quality in the other 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:58.320
 It sure is so connected and then because I 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.840
 I put it in my mind in the end I'll 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.280
 stand still camera 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.440
 you will see that you will know the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.440
 because I left 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.850
 Come on, I'm going to be quiet here . 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.850
 video back to talk guys come on 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.450
 Good folks now arriving at the end of 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.400
 test how to zoom again here 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.290
 to to get better to see 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.520
 looks at the static statistics of 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:38.520
 benchmark stood at 37.7 of me 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:42.150
 the minimum you want to hit 58.3 fps 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:46.440
 average of 47.3 or 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.620
 nvidia gtx 750 input card 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.820
 get man spin radio is a game already 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.970
 It's gone a while, but he 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.670
 continued with heavy graphics in the stretch 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.680
 So consider yourself so you're watching. 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.870
 that the warrior board will lower some 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.330
 little thing or other area rises to almost 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.460
 there from average 60 fps 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.830
 then because in the other it will show the 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.660
 so much that it is that the strong and 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.540
 the temperature again 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.290
 99% of unep is not running on the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.049
 background well is 52 degrees aquino temperature 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.530
 mounted cooler 40 connected here at 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.530
 time 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.780
 for those who thought of ball even with 47 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.610
 fp sd the average radio tone the average high 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.740
 for a sport card in this 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.370
 Tuesday the new model has one more 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.110
 turn 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.070
 so if we run now 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.410
 setting a little lower 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.180
 but still another but changed in the line 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.450
 something of such shadow is still going 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:49.350
 talk about 60 tse then approve highlight 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.960
 on the top personal radio and now the staff 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:58.620
 Just to show you how to look better. 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:05:00.680
 we rolled in the high wheel there in the background 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.680
 good 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:12.710
 automatically it was no longer 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:15.570
 fresh is and was already 50 maximum 81 average 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.360
 65,4 as he had said he would stay 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.750
 lowered dodo own another high ie 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.229
 you rest quietly between the top 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.030
 the tall one and the other there but with some 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.229
 Little thing is going to be with the game. 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.229
 coming back really cool 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:37.820
 which does not have either connector the third pre- 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:39.920
 lequinha six pins right of entry 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.880
 even from nvidia with the performance of 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.580
 Yes and with her new proposal, which is a 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.430
 minimum energy expenditure to be disregarded 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.000
 so why did you approve aquino radio? 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.360
 folks 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.360
 thanks
