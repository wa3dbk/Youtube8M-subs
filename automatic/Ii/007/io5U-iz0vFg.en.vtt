00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.199
 Well, everyone knows that we 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.230
 Deco is found for video 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.829
 minecraft is so we will start with 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.640
 the first episodes of the room 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:34.480
 bath so let's start so yes I already 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.500
 does the platform with the lights and 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:42.070
 the nuts and the places where I I 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:46.000
 will put the objects so we will start 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.039
 by doing the toilets not very 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.750
 special so for that you will need 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:55.500
 blocks to make a distributor or in 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.449
 10 pence off as you say a lever 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.180
 a bucket of water in trap 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.089
 so here you are obliged to so easy to 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.869
 have in servers so or mutated 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:13.000
 distinguishes them on like that 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:15.670
 the block of doing your breasts had to be the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.250
 hatch here like that and the bucket of water 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.550
 interiors and so as an example that you 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.550
 will give 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:36.390
 here we are 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:42.459
 after we will go down to the shower 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:46.539
 so for that you will need windows of 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:49.460
 gates or Swiss cantons 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:53.090
 and after this is the same system the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.969
 leads right now and a bucket of water by 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:05.049
 against I want to measure her here you 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:09.799
 so here and there 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:14.569
 and yes so I'm creative so 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:17.930
 you put arrived like that here's 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.930
 those of at least one word the windows I the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.000
 place like that but it's like rolling 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:35.150
 but for me a sweet us that 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:40.160
 looks like that and so after that you 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.650
 give it so you go solo day mode 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.650
 here it is forty years you will need a 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:53.109
 good shower today there you do 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.109
 that's you so here's the shower 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.650
 now we will take care of the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.910
 bath 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:07.970
 so for that you will need this 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:10.239
 folder us being survival if slab of 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.239
 quad 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:19.549
 after you will need a bed and 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:32.630
 that's all so you place the slabs 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:35.600
 like that where the cbi to do that good here 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:41.150
 So you can ask from you 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.670
 tell him like that and the water here so 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.360
 what you can do that too 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.750
 good it's hiding the light but hey 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.240
 it's a reading like this and after 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.190
 that's it, and you're in the 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:04:03.980
 bath 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:08.480
 So here we go and finish with my 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:11.720
 little ones my little ones how to say but 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.870
 small sink we who are very simple 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.120
 to realize I do not do things a little bit 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:28.130
 too hard because after that it's a little 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:35.060
 boring for others here you are 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:38.960
 can you do it like that? 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.830
 enlighten a little admit to finding table that 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.700
 is the kind of way I like 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:51.790
 alone in front of me I think it means 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.790
 hop that we'll do it serves 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.980
 so one I like it is a little 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.410
 blue and white I think yeah that 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.780
 so yes it's my tea pack on I do not 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:13.740

 do this and that or so here you do 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:51.180
 that's a risk to think about it now 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:52.710
 it's that handle of the ice and that's it 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:58.740
