fashion this autumn winter

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.000 
fashion this autumn winter
I<00:02:33.910> think<00:02:34.570> this<00:02:34.810> knitted<00:02:35.170> pleated<00:02:35.560> skirt<00:02:35.860> is

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
I think this knitted pleated skirt is

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:45.540 
I think this knitted pleated skirt is
the<00:02:36.160> perfect<00:02:36.610> thing<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:36.910> pair<00:02:37.300> them<00:02:37.450> with<00:02:44.550> I

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
the perfect thing to pair them with I

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.340 
the perfect thing to pair them with I
think<00:02:47.400> since<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.489> Asus<00:02:48.970> rib<00:02:49.269> jumper<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:49.959> gray

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
think since the Asus rib jumper in gray

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.320 
think since the Asus rib jumper in gray
and<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.100> perfect<00:02:51.700> because<00:02:51.970> it's<00:02:52.180> very

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
and it's so perfect because it's very

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.910 
and it's so perfect because it's very
lightweight<00:02:52.690> which<00:02:52.930> means<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.530> can<00:02:53.680> still

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
lightweight which means you can still

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.610 
lightweight which means you can still
layer<00:02:54.190> up<00:02:54.459> when<00:02:54.820> it's<00:02:54.940> cold<00:02:55.209> so<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.750> kind<00:02:56.380> of

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
layer up when it's cold so I kind of

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.650 
layer up when it's cold so I kind of
when<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:56.980> was<00:02:57.310> planning<00:02:57.970> my<00:02:58.000> looks
