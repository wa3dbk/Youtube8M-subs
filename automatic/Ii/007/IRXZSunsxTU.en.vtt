so<00:00:19.830> there<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> little<00:00:21.050> thing<00:00:22.050> all<00:00:22.230> pulled

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
so there is the little thing all pulled

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.749 
so there is the little thing all pulled
apart<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.279> little<00:00:23.580> screw<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:25.400> goes<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
apart one little screw that goes in the

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:32.030 
apart one little screw that goes in the
back<00:00:26.939> here<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.560> little<00:00:31.800> simple

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
back here and just a little simple

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.910 
back here and just a little simple
circuit<00:00:32.910> board<00:00:33.150> for<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.539> battery<00:00:33.930> there's<00:00:34.800> an

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
circuit board for the battery there's an

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.799 
circuit board for the battery there's an
antenna<00:00:35.280> loop<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.270> not<00:00:36.390> sure<00:00:36.660> if

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
antenna loop on this one I'm not sure if

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.450 
antenna loop on this one I'm not sure if
there<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.320> other<00:00:37.680> ones<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.010> people<00:00:38.340> with

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
there is on other ones of people with

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.750 
there is on other ones of people with
modded<00:00:38.820> then<00:00:41.629> we're<00:00:42.629> probably<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.760> try

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
modded then we're probably going to try

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.250 
modded then we're probably going to try
going<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.570> those<00:00:45.629> holes<00:00:47.690> so<00:00:48.690> I've<00:00:48.960> cut

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
going in one of those holes so I've cut

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.810 
going in one of those holes so I've cut
a<00:00:49.289> piece<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.570> black<00:00:51.570> wire<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.320> at<00:00:53.250> five

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
a piece of the black wire here at five

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
a piece of the black wire here at five
point<00:00:54.390> eight<00:00:55.489> inches<00:00:56.489> roughly<00:00:56.910> I've<00:00:57.600> heard

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
point eight inches roughly I've heard

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.900 
point eight inches roughly I've heard
stories<00:00:58.230> five<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> three<00:00:59.219> quarters<00:00:59.640> too

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
stories five and three quarters too

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.389 
stories five and three quarters too
which<00:01:00.660> was<00:01:00.870> considered<00:01:01.350> shorts<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.859> five<00:01:02.039> point

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
which was considered shorts a five point

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.040 
which was considered shorts a five point
eight<00:01:02.519> to<00:01:02.789> six<00:01:03.030> point<00:01:03.269> one<00:01:03.449> was<00:01:03.629> considered

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
eight to six point one was considered

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.520 
eight to six point one was considered
normal

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
normal

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.090 
normal
this<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.190> just<00:01:05.400> barely<00:01:05.640> under<00:01:05.970> six<00:01:06.210> inches

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
this is just barely under six inches

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:23.620 
this is just barely under six inches
we'll<00:01:08.509> see<00:01:09.509> how<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.810> works

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.770 

so<00:01:24.630> what's<00:01:24.810> been<00:01:25.020> done<00:01:25.230> here<00:01:25.790> is<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:27.630> was<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
so what's been done here is there was a

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.140 
so what's been done here is there was a
little<00:01:28.070> there<00:01:29.070> was<00:01:29.160> a<00:01:29.190> whole<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.730> this<00:01:29.880> side

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
little there was a whole just this side

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.840 
little there was a whole just this side
of<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.420> antenna<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:31.580> stock<00:01:32.580> antenna

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
of the antenna this is the stock antenna

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
of the antenna this is the stock antenna
that<00:01:33.210> came<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.660> it

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
that came with it

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.930 
that came with it
just<00:01:34.260> wrapped<00:01:34.530> around<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.670> little

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
just wrapped around there was a little

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.270 
just wrapped around there was a little
hole<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.390> side<00:01:36.690> that<00:01:37.910> apparently<00:01:40.160> what's<00:01:41.160> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
hole this side that apparently what's a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.380 
hole this side that apparently what's a
call<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> trace<00:01:42.110> trace<00:01:43.190> goes<00:01:44.190> from<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.150> to<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
call a trace trace goes from one to the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.250 
call a trace trace goes from one to the
other<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:46.320> comes<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.980> dead<00:01:47.220> end<00:01:47.250> there<00:01:47.670> so

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
other and comes to a dead end there so

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.640 
other and comes to a dead end there so
that<00:01:49.260> tops<00:01:49.890> them<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:51.000> soldering<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.690> done<00:01:51.930> on

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
that tops them the soldering was done on

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.350 
that tops them the soldering was done on
the<00:01:52.770> back<00:01:52.980> here<00:01:53.370> to<00:01:53.520> join<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.880> into<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.270> other

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the back here to join it into the other

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.250 
the back here to join it into the other
antenna<00:01:55.160> it's<00:01:56.160> been<00:01:56.310> brought<00:01:56.520> through<00:01:57.260> the

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
antenna it's been brought through the

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260 
antenna it's been brought through the
front<00:01:58.680> there's<00:01:59.190> a<00:01:59.250> little<00:01:59.490> kink<00:01:59.820> there<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
front there's a little kink there the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.830 
front there's a little kink there the
decision<00:02:00.750> was<00:02:00.900> made<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:02.360> drill<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> small<00:02:03.660> hole

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
decision was made to drill a small hole

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.680 
decision was made to drill a small hole
I<00:02:04.410> think<00:02:04.830> that's<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.160> one<00:02:05.310> right<00:02:05.460> there<00:02:05.690> nice

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
I think that's the one right there nice

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.220 
I think that's the one right there nice
clean<00:02:07.110> hole<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:08.660> for<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> wire<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.929> go

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
clean hole and for the wire to go

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.650 
clean hole and for the wire to go
through<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:11.610> was<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> pretty<00:02:12.000> simple<00:02:12.420> process

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
through that was a pretty simple process

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.070 
through that was a pretty simple process
the<00:02:13.290> plastic<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.550> was<00:02:15.270> worried<00:02:15.750> about<00:02:15.840> it

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
the plastic I was worried about it

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.530 
the plastic I was worried about it
breaking<00:02:16.410> or<00:02:16.740> cracking<00:02:16.770> but<00:02:17.460> it<00:02:17.580> seemed<00:02:18.420> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
breaking or cracking but it seemed to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.870 
breaking or cracking but it seemed to
drill<00:02:18.750> through<00:02:18.960> fine<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.310> use<00:02:20.730> this

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
drill through fine so just use this

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.850 
drill through fine so just use this
plain<00:02:21.300> black<00:02:21.660> wire<00:02:21.960> which<00:02:22.260> doesn't<00:02:22.560> look<00:02:22.680> too

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
plain black wire which doesn't look too

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.180 
plain black wire which doesn't look too
bad<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.920> hole<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.400> exact<00:02:26.790> fit<00:02:27.300> there<00:02:28.190> see

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
bad and the hole is exact fit there see

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.420 
bad and the hole is exact fit there see
if<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.610> get<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.880> thing<00:02:30.120> back<00:02:30.360> together

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
if I can get this thing back together

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.720 
if I can get this thing back together
it's<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.520> little<00:02:32.640> clip<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.390> back<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:35.190> has

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
it's a little clip on the back that has

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.260 
it's a little clip on the back that has
to<00:02:35.880> go<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.150> first<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.850> then<00:02:38.850> it's<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.090> a

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
to go in first and then it's just a

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.900 
to go in first and then it's just a
matter<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.540> getting<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.050> wire<00:02:40.260> tucked<00:02:40.680> in

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
matter of getting that wire tucked in

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.070 
matter of getting that wire tucked in
properly

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.600 

okay<00:02:48.080> man

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
okay man

00:02:48.610 --> 00:03:02.449 
okay man
hopefully<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.790> screw<00:02:50.510> doesn't<00:02:51.790> strip<00:02:52.790> out

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.119 

okay<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:04.030> there's<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.540> whole<00:03:04.569> unit<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.920> wire

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
okay so there's the whole unit the wire

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.390 
okay so there's the whole unit the wire
on<00:03:06.340> top<00:03:06.750> what<00:03:07.750> I've<00:03:07.900> seen<00:03:08.140> some<00:03:08.530> do<00:03:08.739> we'll<00:03:09.250> give

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
on top what I've seen some do we'll give
