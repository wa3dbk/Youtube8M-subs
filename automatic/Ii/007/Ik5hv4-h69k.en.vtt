00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
slabs for a specific radius then

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.740 
slabs for a specific radius then
everything<00:00:40.980> out<00:00:41.100> from<00:00:41.309> there<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.660> all

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.709 
everything out from there is this is all
18<00:00:43.079> blocks<00:00:44.329> actually<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.539> about<00:00:45.719> 18

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
will spawn in here and come bowl up the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
will spawn in here and come bowl up the
cannon<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.390> there's<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.449> mob<00:00:54.600> spawner<00:00:54.750> right

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
cannon and there's a mob spawner right

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.689 
cannon and there's a mob spawner right
there<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.829> we're<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> place<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
there and we're going to place a

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.029 
there and we're going to place a
pressure<00:00:56.940> plate<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.300> top<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.230> are

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
pressure plate on top of it and then are

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.619 
pressure plate on top of it and then are
not<00:00:59.280> probably<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.789> pressure<00:01:00.000> plate<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.329> top<00:01:00.449> of

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
not probably so pressure plate on top of

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.849 
not probably so pressure plate on top of
it<00:01:00.660> because<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.870> will<00:01:01.079> activate<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> tnt

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
it because that will activate the tnt

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.149 
it because that will activate the tnt
and<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.280> do<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.579> tnt<00:01:02.969> overall<00:01:03.650> alright<00:01:04.650> so

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and then do the tnt overall alright so

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.190 
and then do the tnt overall alright so
this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> setup<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.659> works<00:01:06.900> pretty<00:01:07.080> well

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
this is the setup it works pretty well

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.179 
this is the setup it works pretty well
