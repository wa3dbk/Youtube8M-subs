00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.360
 firefighters so that's really the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.060
 base that's what you need to learn 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.410
 first to say to enter 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.269
 firefighters but the job at all 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.520
 for to be really firefighters 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.399
 what to call your superiors by 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.960
 example so here's start all over 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.500
 following by the first category among 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.600
 firefighters so men rank 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.579
 so sappers 2nd class and as soon as you 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.850
 arrive as a firefighter 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.329
 volunteer what proulx often they 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.340
 do a little further away so its part 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.829
 2nd class so no black background all or 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.070
 less even down you have nothing not so 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.960

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.359
 then the five categories the 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.349
 NCOs then when we hear 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.049
 a little more 

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:21.409
 so first we find the sergeant 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.779
 white account or red background 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.840
