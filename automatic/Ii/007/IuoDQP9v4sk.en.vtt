00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.599
 3 where are the others let's analyze the game today 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.050
 star wars 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.820
 loaf front 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.929
 let's start 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.929
 with video of the Varyag game 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.710
 I do not play such actions in spring 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.650
 all that we do not see did not see the bet 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.810
 it seems not only then have a game of communication 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.090
 from the third row 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.460
 when i look at these pictures 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.800
 who feels cheated 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.200
 I see that these are ordinary pictures that 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.600
 minimal developers are moving 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.170
 thereby creating 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.429
 and movement people 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:57.569
 but guys okay judge for yourself 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:58.749
 move 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:00:59.649
 normal 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.380
 costs 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.989
 sometimes bringing light into them 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.720
 on this area 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.850
 but it only makes me sad 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.520
 birds 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.520
 So 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.100
 it's nice that you can play 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.740
 create your character 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.760
 so how do we play as an ordinary fighter 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.070
 Turks can be any to the police 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.160
 no matter what the election cubes again 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.720
 more than 400 more alien 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.410
 monsters including the human race 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.790
 I managed to create guys like 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.790
 chubak 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.520
 now all capture base drop 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.280
 for this you need to put in red 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.160
 circles 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.940
 until it turns blue 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.100
 who knows, maybe in the future everything will be 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 exactly 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.020
 if someone is killed first thing 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.330
 corners tell me about it 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.950
 even call the name of the deceased to this 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.030
 loss left from sad sediment on 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.640
 soul 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.859
 thereby passing each county 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.859
 besides personality 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.889
 aiming about this idea no developers need 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.520
 everything is done for us 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.859
 the price will watch a game of such a button as 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.089
 aims and our hero will shoot at 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:30.989
 anyone who doesn't like him 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.179
 usually it's a completely different enemy 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:34.939
 not at all the one you wanted 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:35.959
 to kill 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.180
 it is very annoying when you need to 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.810
 shoot the most powerful 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.709
 computers 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.519
 and your character shoot at live 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.799
 to people 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.799
 where is humanism 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.189
 really love the cosmic level 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.199
 so how not to come them just 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.629
 is impossible 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.799
 here for example here we were given 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.939
 the task to blow up four of something there 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.769
 they put us on a flying 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.969
 awkward bucket 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.319
 it's impossible to die here 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.219
 as well, and in the ground level at that 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:10.699
 same 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.069
 we revive spheres unlimited 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.539
 number of times 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.389
 the lives of the enemies are not restored 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.709
 meanwhile we are not limited 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.339
 you can even have your own body 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:22.829
 bomb the hospital 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.799
 unless of course you have such 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.799
 suicidal tendencies 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.159
 the whole game is clearly sharpened by the network 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.809
 reminds game will be installed 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:38.359
 third person 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.609
 demkov and 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.190
 as fun as mario 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.560
 get away death except his death if he 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.059
 does not fit during 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:49.230
 got up with 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.590
 then the front can be played only in 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.670
 those cases where tasks are 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.549
 time limited 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.139
 or where it is necessary to protect some 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.139
 loser 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:04.819
 sometimes choose very well studied 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.419
 let's hear how 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.109
 shoot astara this 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.489
 summer star 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.489
 this post 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.109
 if i would be an enemy 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.579
 I would have died god 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.430
 because it is very scary when 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.250
 always shoot overvalued for 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.900
 baptism class is very scary 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.030
 quack quack quack quack quack 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.240
 very active very scary guys 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.240
 very scary 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.270
 riddles number one in this game 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.129
 for me this tank 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.129
 it would seem but this is such a power 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.509
 can't figure out how jim is just 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.729
 shoot him nothing works 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.400
 but as soon as the gate appears 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.569
 who shoots 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.219
 how I did it I did not understand 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.469
 and only then did I realize that he 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:06.849
 shoots automatic 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.029
 sanctions back 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.029
 I want to 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.870
 and 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.050
 then one of the worst 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.169
 artillery 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.080
 someone suddenly stopped shooting 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.879
 but can not score 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:26.379
 since he cannot be a soldier like this 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:27.759
 there 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.759
 these are friends 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.580
 this is my favorite mission 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.860
 just went into this tower the time 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.580
 fresh 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.930
 three shots of the plane of this shake 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.949
 meanwhile help 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.400
 where else would the duke of Beijing be instead of 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.539
 write based on barkov and roads i want 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:48.479
 stop 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:49.599
 food and water 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.629
 no one goes 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:53.259
 tired of waiting 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:56.080
 going back to your character 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.759
 on Tuesday convinced something worthy 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.219
 worth 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.080
 in this little 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.439
 I did not wait for myself 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:07.439
 sychev 

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:10.389
 but he killed me 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.819
 but it's not scary, I know what time 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:13.909
 sunday 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:15.360
 he would go again 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.689
 fight in Darfur for nothing 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:18.869
 I can at least 

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:21.389
 discuss exactly one bullet each time 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.129
 all over the world he has the same time 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:26.129
 are set and I am resurrected 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.969
 also another 18 months running three games 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:33.679
 there is such a button magically 

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:35.300
 which is responsible 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.040
 the race 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.539
 drawn by 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:39.740
 that is, if I want to run and two of her 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.710
 to push 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.740
 pros but go ahead the authorities want 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.740
 procedures are already bad and go ahead 

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:50.309
 probably the creators were sure that 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.009
 management problems will not be right 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.369
 surely there will be no such cases of this 

00:06:57.369 --> 00:07:00.369
 will want to run with fast then jump 

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:04.969
 and minor troubles such 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:07.110
 yes i want invited on commitments 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.740
 it's done 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.370
 In this game, the date given out can not 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.069
 fly families a 

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:15.309
 but does he have 

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:18.309
 between worlds 

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.500
 I want to remind you that the game is me 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.500
 all the same for the usual infantrymen 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:27.289
 how did you kill the gift your gifts 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:28.580
 in the middle of the game 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.069
 I first thought that at all at the beginning of the game 

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:34.469
 but questions I did not expect that the game can go 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:35.449
 in two hours 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:37.259
 where will the last place be 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:39.009
 grab 3 points 

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:41.110
 I mean, stand on the red carpet 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.229
 stony reading 

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:46.550
 and then the final credits will immediately pass. 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:47.559
 Moreover 

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:49.799
 the playing never ended
