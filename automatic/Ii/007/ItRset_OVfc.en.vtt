00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.230
You're getting to be a big boy.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.980
I'm just a kid who's four.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.820
Each day I grow some more.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.570
I like exploring.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.200
I'm Caillou.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.200
So many things to do.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.990
Each day is something new.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.620
I'll share them with you.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.410
I'm Caillou.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.370
My world is turning,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.920
changing each day,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.880
with mommy and daddy

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.300
I'm finding my way!

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.340
Growing up is not so tough,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.180
except when I've had enough.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.010
But there's lots of fun stuff.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.720
I'm Caillou,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.850
Caillou, Caillou, I'm Caillou.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.350
Eh heh heh heh heh...

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.560
That's me

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.860
Storytime, kids.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.400
Now, what did Caillou do today?

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.950
Today's story is called

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.160
"Caillou makes Cookies,"

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.910
It all happened when Caillou was just three years old.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.800
La-la-la...la-la-la.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.960
Caillou. You have to play quietly now.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.220
Rosie is going to take her nap.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.050
Shhh.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.310
Caillou.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.560
But...I want to play.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.190
You can still play--

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.480
just do it quietly.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.530
Caillou felt that being quiet

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.570
wasn't as much fun as being noisy.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.120
Caillou...

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.660
I asked you to play quietly.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.080
Cookies. I want cookies.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.500
I'm hungry.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.300
So Caillou went to the kitchen...

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.270
Honeeeeeey.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.450
Whoooooaaah.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.130
Caillou decided to make some honey cookies.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.640
And so, Caillou got to workâ€”

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.100
making a whole bunch of honey cookies:

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.930
fat ones, skinny ones,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.270
flat ones, and round ones.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.900
Oh Caillou. What are you doing?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.110
I'm making cookies.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.150
Look at the mess you made.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.820
Do you want to help Mommy clean it up?

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.120
Yes, Mommy--me and you.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.460
We have to make sure the kitchen is nice and clean. (Beat)

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.710
Now where's that dustpan?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.250
I found it.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.430
That's the way,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.390
my favourite helper.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.540
Caillou.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.140
Caillou was very proud.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.350
He was helping Mommy make cookies.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.270
Mommy--

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.360
you made a mess.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.620
You're right, Mommy makes messes too.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.080
Daddy. Daddy.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.160
Try the cookies. Try the cookies.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.010
Mmmmm. Who made these good cookies?

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.500
I did--and Mommy helped.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.300
Mommy. Daddy. Look.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.020
What are you making, Caillou?

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.060
A big mess.
