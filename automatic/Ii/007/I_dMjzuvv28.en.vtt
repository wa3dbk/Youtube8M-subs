is he talking about so then he gives me
like<00:01:18.450> his<00:01:18.630> mr.<00:01:19.050> wizard<00:01:19.530> formula<00:01:20.160> how<00:01:20.520> about<00:01:20.730> a

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
like his mr. wizard formula how about a

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.700 
like his mr. wizard formula how about a
few<00:01:21.120> stand<00:01:21.510> on<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.990> scale<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.350> weigh

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
few stand on the scale and weigh

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.220 
few stand on the scale and weigh
yourself<00:01:22.980> get<00:01:23.670> off<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.060> scale<00:01:24.420> pick<00:01:24.900> up<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
yourself get off the scale pick up the

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.080 
yourself get off the scale pick up the
box<00:01:25.410> get<00:01:25.740> back<00:01:25.980> on<00:01:26.190> when<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> hit<00:01:26.730> the<00:01:26.850> box

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
box get back on when you hit the box

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.790 
box get back on when you hit the box
together<00:01:27.300> and<00:01:27.720> subtract<00:01:28.260> your<00:01:28.410> own<00:01:28.590> weight

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
together and subtract your own weight

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:38.290 
together and subtract your own weight
I'm<00:01:28.980> going<00:01:29.250> slow<00:01:29.610> down<00:01:32.540> hold<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.750> professor<00:01:34.560> I

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.970 

know<00:01:39.300> this<00:01:39.420> guy's<00:01:39.600> never<00:01:39.870> try<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.170> cuz<00:01:40.830> I

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
know this guy's never try this cuz I

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.650 
know this guy's never try this cuz I
tried<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.580> you<00:01:41.760> still<00:01:42.030> can't<00:01:42.210> see<00:01:42.510> the

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
tried it and you still can't see the

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:54.500 
tried it and you still can't see the
numbers<00:01:45.560> what<00:01:46.560> am<00:01:46.650> i<00:01:46.740> mr.<00:01:47.010> Olympia

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:04.730 

three<00:01:55.510> pounds

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.679 

then<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.549> had<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.880> hang<00:02:06.060> up<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.450> middle<00:02:06.630> of

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
then I had to hang up in the middle of

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.190 
then I had to hang up in the middle of
his<00:02:06.840> girth<00:02:07.110> formula<00:02:08.239> he<00:02:09.239> kept<00:02:09.479> assuring<00:02:09.599> me<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
his girth formula he kept assuring me it

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.410 
his girth formula he kept assuring me it
was<00:02:10.349> easy<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:11.340> know<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.670> girth<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.150> very

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
was easy you know the girth is very

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.660 
was easy you know the girth is very
simple<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.989> figure<00:02:13.260> out<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:14.010> take<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.430> length

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
simple to figure out you take the length

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.309 
simple to figure out you take the length
than<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:15.000> double<00:02:15.420> back<00:02:15.540> by<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.780> smaller<00:02:16.230> of

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
than you double back by the smaller of

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.809 
than you double back by the smaller of
the<00:02:16.470> height<00:02:16.680> after<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.099> triangulate<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
the height after you triangulate the

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.000 
the height after you triangulate the
hypotenuse<00:02:18.510> from<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> third<00:02:19.050> side<00:02:19.349> okay<00:02:19.980> I

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
hypotenuse from the third side okay I

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.350 
hypotenuse from the third side okay I
got<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:22.200> get<00:02:22.349> another<00:02:22.590> call<00:02:23.269> yeah<00:02:24.269> I'm

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
got to go and get another call yeah I'm

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.199 
got to go and get another call yeah I'm
too<00:02:24.540> stupid<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.080> talk<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.680> just<00:02:26.120> want<00:02:27.120> to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
true i figured i would call back and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.039 
true i figured i would call back and
just<00:02:34.560> make<00:02:34.800> up<00:02:34.980> some<00:02:35.190> numbers<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.670> know<00:02:36.049> let

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
just make up some numbers you know let

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.410 
just make up some numbers you know let
them<00:02:37.170> come<00:02:37.200> out<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.650> pick<00:02:37.799> them<00:02:37.950> up<00:02:38.420> it's

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
them come out and pick them up it's

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.559 
them come out and pick them up it's
wrong<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.900> pay<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.260> difference<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:41.569> dispatch

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
wrong I pay the difference just dispatch
