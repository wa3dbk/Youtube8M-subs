I<00:01:08.470> honestly<00:01:09.189> was<00:01:10.119> I<00:01:10.869> thought<00:01:11.110> Philly<00:01:11.350> was

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
I honestly was I thought Philly was

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.139 
I honestly was I thought Philly was
gonna<00:01:11.770> win<00:01:11.979> and<00:01:12.130> I<00:01:12.189> thought<00:01:12.399> that<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.759> Ravens

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
gonna win and I thought that the Ravens

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.520 
gonna win and I thought that the Ravens
would<00:01:13.350> beat<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.500> Steelers<00:01:14.710> so<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:15.520> was<00:01:15.789> all

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.789 
would beat the Steelers so I was all

and now they're lacking on defense

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:22.709
