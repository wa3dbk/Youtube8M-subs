evidence<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.970> injury<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:50.410> mean<00:02:51.570> traumatic

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
evidence of injury I mean traumatic

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.300 
evidence of injury I mean traumatic
injury<00:02:52.840> besides<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.560> bit<00:02:53.830> around<00:02:54.040> his<00:02:54.190> eye

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310

injury besides that bit around his eye
but<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.910> looks<00:02:55.090> like<00:02:55.360> it's<00:02:55.600> probably

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
but that looks like it's probably

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.370 
but that looks like it's probably
happened<00:02:56.320> postmortem<00:02:57.150> yeah

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
could get hit by a boat except that's

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.640

yeah<00:03:54.240> well<00:03:55.230> if<00:03:55.350> but<00:03:55.740> if<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:56.010> skin<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:56.670> kind<00:03:57.060> of

yeah well if but if the skin is kind of

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.960 
yeah well if but if the skin is kind of
wearing<00:03:57.450> off<00:03:57.630> though<00:03:57.950> so<00:03:58.950> I'm<00:03:59.580> thinking<00:03:59.940> like

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
wearing off though so I'm thinking like

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.390 
wearing off though so I'm thinking like
what<00:04:00.480> happens<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:00.900> believe<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.320> said<00:04:01.470> after<00:04:02.160> see

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
what happens I believe it said after see

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.030 
what happens I believe it said after see
ours<00:04:02.550> they<00:04:02.880> go<00:04:03.030> rig<00:04:03.270> into<00:04:03.510> rigor<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.380> then

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
ours they go rig into rigor and then

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.880 
ours they go rig into rigor and then
they<00:04:05.640> come<00:04:05.820> out<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.060> rigor<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:07.350> I<00:04:07.470> think<00:04:07.710> he's

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
they come out of rigor and I think he's

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.190 
they come out of rigor and I think he's
probably<00:04:08.070> recently<00:04:08.700> come<00:04:08.910> out<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.210> rigor<00:04:09.390> and

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
probably recently come out of rigor and

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.740 
probably recently come out of rigor and
that's<00:04:10.410> where<00:04:10.650> it's<00:04:10.770> starting<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.570> bleed<00:04:12.570> up

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
that's where it's starting to bleed up

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.910 
that's where it's starting to bleed up
again<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:13.350> bubble<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.250> bit<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:15.560> but<00:04:16.560> that's

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
again and bubble a bit and but that's

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.290 
again and bubble a bit and but that's
just<00:04:17.070> uh

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.050
