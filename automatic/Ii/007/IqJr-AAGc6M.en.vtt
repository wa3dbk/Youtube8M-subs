so<00:01:06.329> much<00:01:06.479> bigger<00:01:06.719> than<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.049> if<00:01:07.880> it's<00:01:08.880> another

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
so much bigger than that if it's another

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.310 
so much bigger than that if it's another
one<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.299> those<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.780> all<00:01:09.869> sort<00:01:10.079> of<00:01:10.110> step

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
one of those if we can all sort of step

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.069 
one of those if we can all sort of step
