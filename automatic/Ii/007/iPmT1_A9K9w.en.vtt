 Welcome to an exhibition for researchers and technicians that is here 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.219
 a replica of the lab where I developed the first robots 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.389

 Hanno BÃ¤stlein autographs 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.550
 Of course so led what is her name because she is called more like she is deaf and dumb 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.929
 but as the sign language on campgrounds depended I am glad 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.970
 to get to know me very well BZ if we can comply 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.460
 After beautiful it was a long day before said our brain is next

 Beethoven had heard of a limited one 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.610

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.310
 yes she can not sing 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.130

 the lawsuit against him 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.290
 after the game 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.170
 v 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.170
 that's funny but what you do not 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.220

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.579
 But what is going on with these boxes after approx 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.969
 the necessary socket here is not right 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.520
 I have to talk to the band a few bars 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.610
 China must be huge lark 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.369
 as I conclude 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.549
 the smart was 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.779
 in court 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:41.479

 It's my turn of a scrap heap now 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.110
 I think it's time for us to leave 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.470

 Something is the Rubber Faro years and the guys on target have something 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.459

 to become one 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.309
 There are a lot of people here but because of that 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:02.059

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.370
 the old days 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.370
 both prefer cash flows 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.270
 I know it will be interesting when it comes first 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.809
 there we already have the problem 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.960

 they do not hurt the baby by a little bit 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.740
 so go make yourself clear 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.930
