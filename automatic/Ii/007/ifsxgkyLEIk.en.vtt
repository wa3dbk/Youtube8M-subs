00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:12.519
 Pinto speaks my dear students of mine. 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.230
 dear students of the project and line are 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.090
 I'm a teacher, everything that's born. 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.800
 responsible for working 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.230
 biology with you 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.140
 remembering that professor paulo valim do 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.770
 chemistry in action professor ives urquiza 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.880
 the total physics Professor Gustavo 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.080
 of mathematics are 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.240
 responsible for working too hard 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.529
 content in and out of voice channels. 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.989
 You can also find classes 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.339
 amazing that will leave you to fia dinho 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.749
 for enem at the end of the year 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.210
 today we are going to solve an issue of 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:41.589
 enem 2013 quite interesting that you 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.239
 will be able to see the slide that I put 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.219
 morning 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.359
 good how you should already be tired of 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.010
 live speak 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.799
 The issues of enem usually brings in 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.690
 a text and a question about that text 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:55.780
 we go there then first question 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.949
 to know what we're going to look for in the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.789
 text the text of the question then says 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.399
 considering the result of the experiment 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.290
 with the contribution of this doctor to the 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.110
 human health then we will have a 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.050
 doctor there in that text that made a 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.900
 experiment and this experiment brought 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.100
 contribution to human health . 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.590
 We'll have to read the text then. 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.820
 trying to identify which was this 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.070
 contribution 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.590
 Let's have a look, let's see the text. 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.390
 says the thousands of people were 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.400
 dying of smallpox at the end of 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.960
 18th century in 1796 the doctor edward jenner 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.460
 inoculated an 8-year-old boy with the pulse 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.920
 extracted from cow sores 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.070
 contaminated with virus in bovine pox 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.830
 which causes a mild disease in humans 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.530
 the boy contracted a benign infection and 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.080
 ten days later I was recovered 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.870
 months later he did not stick to the same 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.740
 boy hoppus valuable hand that caused 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.030
 many mothers 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.950
 The boy did not get sick and he did 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.700
 a very important experiment despite 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.650
 very inconsistent and would violate 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.340
 all the rules of bioethics that people 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.890
 have today 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.649
 so what did he get the virus from 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.739
 bovine smallpox that is very similar to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.610
 human pox virus but humans 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.950
 does not cause great 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.600
 we inoculate this boy until then 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.590
 well the boy stayed a little there 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.620
 sick 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.380
 then improved after not seeing in one act 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.150
 he got the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.660
 smallpox virus and colon 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.690
 Boy, what happened? Nothing. 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.380
 the boy did not get sick of course 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.090
 to have died 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.459
 could but he discovered then that he 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:42.010
 does not get sick and he found that 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.720
 when people then contaminated with 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.300
 something our immune system 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.770
 Of course he did not know 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.750
 thing being at the cellular level that people 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.070
 knows but he knew that the organism 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.980
 reacting against this contaminating agent and 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.650
 then acquire a capacity of 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.780
 respond to this agent better 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.280
 contaminant in close contacts today. 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.470
 people call it that then from memory 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.230
 immunology and baby was the face that 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.150
 discovered the vaccine he discovered 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.790
 that if we catch a virus 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.680
 weakened and put it in a person 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.670
 that person becomes capable of 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.310
 to respond to contamination by the virus 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.980
 weakened then basically and 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.060
 nor was he responsible for the discovery of 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.500
 vaccine 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.510
 now we will look and see which of the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.610
 alternatives then it has to do with it 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.390
 that we discussed here is okay, let's go 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.459
 take a look 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.560
 then alternative look said he 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.230
 found that the contribution of this 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.000
 The experiment was to prevent 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.600
 contagious diseases worldwide 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.820
 world 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.100
 the vaccine was just that then 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.380
 alternative ' is already our alternative 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.720
 correct but let's take a look at the 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.430
 others look there alternative b says that 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.019
 he began to understand that the 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.019
 virus can multiply in terms of 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.290
 organic nothing to see he discovered is a 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.690
 means of prevention in fact, then it 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.890
 not having native and it says treatment 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.299
 for many diseases that affect 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.250
 millions of people 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.799
 And when we talk about vaccination, the people 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.209
 It's not talking about treatment. 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.269
 We are talking about something that you 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.970
 not take the disease and not to 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.599
 if it is the disease then it is not 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.970
 treatment is alternative prevention of 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.870
 says that the experiment allows the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.240
 establishment 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.160
 ethics in the use of children in 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.720
 experimental models 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.250
 we can not say that what he did was 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.320
 very ethical indeed and the alternative 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.840
 tell us the explanation that some 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.000
 animal viruses can be transmitted 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.330
 for humans and this is not the 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.240
 discovery is the vaccine 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.210
 disease prevention is good. 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.590
 remembering then access the other videos 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.690
 of our channel if you have not 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.460
 understood that we discussed the case 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.800
 you want to go deeper 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.960
 if you want to study other subjects 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.850
 then sign up here on our channel and 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.800
 Give a young man here in the video you help 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.590
 enough is good people 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.690
 remembering also that teacher 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.270
 our partner channels have great lessons 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.210
 for you in physical and mathematical chemistry 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.190
 that we will then work together 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.139
 for you to succeed later in the year and 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.990
 I hope to see you celebrating the approval 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.169
 We'll see each other in the hug and even see 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.169
 over there 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.530
 just one more little message if you've come to 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.180
 here is why you probably liked it 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.800
 of my class so I wanted to ask for 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.599
 You give a little strength to 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.789
 People, if you come here, I'll be right there. 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:40.150
 I left you the link to our page 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:42.820
 on facebook and our twitter account 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.710
 then like it our page follows the 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.479
 people on twitter and if you enter 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.099
 our site has a lot of content 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.450
 Nice, we have text, we have people. 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.770
 more videos 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.539
 If you have any questions, we have 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.919
 a very cool forum here gives you 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.389
 take your doubts 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.280
 So this force we share 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.660
 with your friends that our work and 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.620
 Let's make this project grow every 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.620
 one more hug
