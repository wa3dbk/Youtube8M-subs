 Hey, guys, beauty plus a video here. 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.670
 Today I'm going to show you a tweet here. 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:18.529
 interesting thing that changes here our 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:21.990
 launch bar multitasking here 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:25.109
 changes our multitasking here leaves 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.019
 many tasks much more well more beautiful 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.679
 the original iphone multi tas 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.800
 this shows the Sesi IAC icon 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.360
 application that is in the background and the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.730
 background here too 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.559
 now it has a fund for the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.460
 people close these personal applications 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.230
 enough people carry them down 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.810
 our people with finger down here that 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.030
 applications 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.750
 another interesting thing also personal 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.510
 we we spend here aside 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.610
 the controls change those controls. 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.420
 sound that we had original here they 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.370
 they change 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.950
 I get these controls here much more 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.570
 nice too 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.330
 if we pass here again the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.370
 people have another shortcut bar here 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.720
 including the brightness control here 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.270
 in this shortcut bar here that people 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.840
 you can configure a shortcut that it creates 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.479
 in the Settings menu when you're there is 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.520
 a wiki that I found very beautiful and just not 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:35.390
 it's so functional but adds a touch more 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.380
 in our device where the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.380
 clear break it folks work in 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.009
 at 5 secs 6 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.040
 it works on iphone on ipod i dont 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.100
 I tested it on the ipad but I think it works 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.930
 I also do not know that it's only when people 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.149
 is there he 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.560
 it creates this shortcut here in the menu 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:03.130
 adjustments is the hauksson the aid to whom 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.130
 want to 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.000
 here we have some settings 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:15.090
 I've shown that shortcut bar there 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.770
 You and it's basically this, guys. 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.260
 I liked him a lot 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.610
 it costs $ 2 in the big repository 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.070
 boss 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.500
 but we have a free alternative 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.160
 and that I will leave you in the description of the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.730
 video here the only people you go there 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.730
 in syria 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:44.510
 expect them to finish loading as 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:47.060
 It always takes time to delay but this 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.310
 also depends on internet speed 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.260
 of each one also those with whom he has 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.600
 faster internet here goes more 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.330
 fast 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.160
 Hey guys, when you finish uploading 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.240
 Everything here speaks for itself 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.400
 sasha and we'll start typing the 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:09.050
 his name, which is in the north that 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.540
 considered that before just starting to 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:17.570
 typing his name here will appear 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:21.290
 there the staff here in the woods repository 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.030
 plant here costs 2 US dollars but that of 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.220
 I teach here that I'm going to leave on the streets. 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.430
 in the video description here 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.100
 it is free is repositioning the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.470
 other ring and repository diseases or 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.600
 dropping 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.750
