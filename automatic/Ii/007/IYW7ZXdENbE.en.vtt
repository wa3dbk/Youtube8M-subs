games<00:02:32.410> II<00:02:32.950> um<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:34.110> think<00:02:35.110> thematically<00:02:35.830> the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
games II um I think thematically the

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.890 
games II um I think thematically the
selection<00:02:36.459> kind<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.150> resembles<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.630> Hunger

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
selection kind of resembles the Hunger

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.550 
selection kind of resembles the Hunger
Games<00:02:37.930> um<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:39.130> does<00:02:39.400> discuss<00:02:39.970> beauty<00:02:40.570> a<00:02:40.810> lot

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
Games um it does discuss beauty a lot

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.260 
Games um it does discuss beauty a lot
but<00:02:42.070> I<00:02:42.130> think<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.430> discusses<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:43.090> a

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
but I think it discusses it in a

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.199 
but I think it discusses it in a
different<00:02:43.480> way<00:02:43.660> than<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.290> hunger<00:02:44.560> games<00:02:45.209> the

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
different way than the hunger games the

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.430 
different way than the hunger games the
hunger<00:02:46.300> games<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.750> kind<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.020> focused<00:02:47.260> on<00:02:47.320> the

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.729 
is going to be happiness I think Kiera
Cass<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.750> trying<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:46.989> get<00:03:47.079> us<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.230> think<00:03:47.530> that

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
Cass is trying to get us to think that

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.220 
Cass is trying to get us to think that
true<00:03:48.400> happiness<00:03:48.730> is<00:03:48.970> not<00:03:49.000> about<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:50.019> surface

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
true happiness is not about the surface

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.530 
true happiness is not about the surface
it's<00:03:50.650> about<00:03:50.769> what's<00:03:51.040> underneath<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.730> it's

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
it's about what's underneath and it's

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.780 
it's about what's underneath and it's
about<00:03:52.690> meaningful<00:03:53.440> relationships<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:54.610> yeah

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
about meaningful relationships so yeah

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.470 
about meaningful relationships so yeah
that's<00:03:54.970> where<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.239> would<00:03:55.540> say<00:03:55.750> that<00:03:56.019> this

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
that's where I would say that this

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.759 
that's where I would say that this
is<00:03:56.659> definitely<00:03:57.050> different<00:03:57.170> than<00:03:57.409> the<00:03:57.530> Hunger

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
is definitely different than the Hunger

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.420 
is definitely different than the Hunger
Games<00:03:57.800> it's<00:03:58.310> also<00:03:58.519> different<00:03:58.790> in<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.090> it<00:03:59.840> um

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
Games it's also different in that it um

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.399 
Games it's also different in that it um
once<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.580> get<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.090> castle<00:04:02.420> of<00:04:02.810> Prince

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
once you get to the castle of Prince

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.339 
once you get to the castle of Prince
Maxon<00:04:03.920> um<00:04:04.190> it's<00:04:05.030> just<00:04:05.299> it's<00:04:05.569> caddy<00:04:05.900> it's<00:04:06.110> girl

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
Maxon um it's just it's caddy it's girl

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.300 
Maxon um it's just it's caddy it's girl
games<00:04:06.849> there's<00:04:07.849> no<00:04:08.060> like<00:04:08.450> real<00:04:09.129> fighting<00:04:10.129> or

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
games there's no like real fighting or

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.589 
games there's no like real fighting or
anything<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.730> kind<00:04:10.879> of<00:04:10.970> lacks<00:04:11.180> that<00:04:11.330> like

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
anything it kind of lacks that like

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.990 
anything it kind of lacks that like
punch<00:04:11.989> you<00:04:12.409> know<00:04:12.530> that<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.340> Hunger<00:04:13.549> Games<00:04:13.730> had

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
punch you know that the Hunger Games had

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.970 
punch you know that the Hunger Games had
so<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.510> definitely<00:04:15.019> think<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:15.349> selection<00:04:15.739> is

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
so I definitely think that selection is

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.520 
so I definitely think that selection is
a<00:04:16.010> different<00:04:16.579> kind<00:04:16.820> of<00:04:16.940> animal<00:04:17.630> entirely<00:04:18.169> than

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
a different kind of animal entirely than

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.289 
a different kind of animal entirely than
the<00:04:18.620> Hunger<00:04:18.889> Games<00:04:18.919> it's<00:04:19.250> not<00:04:19.430> even<00:04:19.699> trying<00:04:20.000> to

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
the Hunger Games it's not even trying to

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.900 
the Hunger Games it's not even trying to
be<00:04:20.449> the<00:04:20.570> hunger<00:04:20.840> games<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:21.199> don't<00:04:21.229> think<00:04:21.440> um<00:04:21.910> so

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
be the hunger games I don't think um so

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.330 
be the hunger games I don't think um so
there's<00:04:23.090> people<00:04:23.330> that<00:04:23.360> have<00:04:23.600> that<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:24.500> idea

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
there's people that have that that idea

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.420 
there's people that have that that idea

not a pair would the come to exit ii but
it<00:05:10.520> does<00:05:10.760> serve<00:05:10.940> its<00:05:11.120> purpose<00:05:11.450> in<00:05:11.570> terms<00:05:11.780> of

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
it does serve its purpose in terms of
