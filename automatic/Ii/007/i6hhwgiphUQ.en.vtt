00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
 'hello to all' visitors welcome this small but emotional talk about 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.920
 something 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.180
 something that is very essential and always will be as the necessary pillar for 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.200
 to be happy in life to get what we want and be successful in life 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.879
 I mean self-esteem 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.449
 is self-esteem 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.210
 Self-esteem is a set of perceptions 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.210
 thoughts evaluations feelings and tendencies of behavior directed 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.230
 towards ourselves towards our way of being and behaving ones and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.349
 towards the features of our body and our character 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.850
 In short, it is evaluative perception of himself 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.870
 and what is it for? 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.090
 in certain circumstances of life 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.690
 our sense of personal value and confidence in our own abilities 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.670
 can be affected and make us believe that we live at the mercy of 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.040
 contingencies 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.250
 in those moments confusion impotence and frustration produced 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.890
 for him it failed to lead us to doubt our capacity-building power 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.430
 natural to restore us and that is when we choose to create and sometimes 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.809
 sustain self-destructive behaviors far from the well-being generated by 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.720
 self-esteem is to say unconditional love and confidence in consciousness 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 oneself 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.720
 Could you explain me in more entertaining words 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.010
 that is, self-esteem is the way we see ourselves 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.350
 we feel and value ourselves in the circumstances of life is to see ourselves 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.950
 as we are and accept to respect us and not let anyone trample us 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.070
 brave and not be defeated 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.120
 now I understand a little more 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.950
 but like having a high self-esteem 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.800
 that should not be so difficult 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.900
 but it is not so simple especially when that person has lived a hard 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.370
 past is to say that it happened circumstances that forced that person to have a 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.550
 low self-esteem a poor or distorted perception of self 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.659
 I understand but you have not answered my question 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.440
 how could self-esteem increase 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.650
 if you want to increase your self-esteem 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.360
 as I said it is easy but at the same time 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.440
 what you have to do is accept that what you are is to say that you do not 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.150
 matter if you are ugly 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.069
 chaparro 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.170
 oo hairy and so on but you should not judge others either. 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.339
 we have flaws nobody is perfect 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:20.039
 another thing is to eliminate from your mind those negative thoughts of you which 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:24.659
 they create a distorted image of you that is to say you think you are like that when in 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.269
 reality is not true and that same guardianship image is creating positive and 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.969
 stop self-criticism 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.269
 interesting 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.089
 but where can I get more information 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.219
 I recommend these audiobooks 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.339
 they will make you increase your self-esteem one is called how to increase your self-esteem 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:44.549
 forever from omar villalobos 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.329
 and the other one is called self esteem and safety of Dr. Estela DurÃ¡n 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.139
 I hope they are helpful 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.000

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.659
