00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.240
 Gates Tomaschko sets go or not how many debts has the BVB actually 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.400
 really these are just two of many questions that are currently mostly the fans 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.320
 the Borussia had wanted to have answered yesterday evening invited the BVB 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.760
 Board fan-club representatives from all over Germany ask to «all 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.570
 Briefing the press baptized me this might be that 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.759
 good reason because the fans should put on yellow line 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.790
 the weather it fit somehow to the situation at BVB really 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.539
 was uncomfortable outside 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.839
 as the BVB board tried the fans in the borussia park of Westfalenstadion 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.629
 to convince to convince that the situation is serious but not serious 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.139
 is hopeless and that many publications of the 

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:51.609
 my campaign of parts of the press would act and past days 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.410
 some fans could obviously convince the BVB board 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.240
 Until the 15th 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.500
 for the estimate 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.840
 this effort ComCom and recovery 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.580
 Gold costs to profit 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.980
 all the more so 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.570
 the decision feels it from the board if it should happen 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.370
 fronts 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.390
 and she lets it be info and work 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.210
 Steckborn replacement 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.120
 Citroen to stand 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.210
 Percent otherwise should now or wormwood 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.280
 so avoid them there to me 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.670
 existing ones fall 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.880
 again subordinated 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.690
 happiness for all Busemann situations and should 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.600
 Of course, the board will like that but there are also fans 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.510
 to deal more critically with their club 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.820
 even if these fans were not ready to talk in front of the camera yesterday 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.110
 yesterday no fan wanted to talk to us and even today does not change all 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.000
 appointment 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.130
 it should not penetrate outside the briefing 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.020
 Albert Beck from Fanclub black-yellow is now our guest but they will 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.550
 Do not talk about yesterday's conversation that's a very clear one 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.469
 meeting 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.410
 So let's talk about what they currently think 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.530
 BVB are satisfied with the policy that the club has 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.650
 you can not be satisfied with the situation that's percent 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.650
 financially a debacle with what is going on 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.519
 When it comes to wine, feelings for elections can penetrate the message outside 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.179
 always contradictory 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.329
 she informs the club tie 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.430
 So I guess I can answer these questions to me where doctor 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.189
 become the bore and Michael Meier on 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.429
 Percent euros and cents exactly and fear Kagawa 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.729
 We've both called for even more light in this story too now 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.379
 The trainer Matthias Jahn Meyer said let us now land over first 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.090
 Finance talking about playful performances 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.389
 and yet what do they think of this financial mess they homemade 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.449
 surely the home-made one must see that at the moment in between as well 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:47.139
 the 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.529
 the church group he went broke as a minister so Münster is but then 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:55.139
 the sporting experience Profiles success to adventure hike is a 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.769
 Visitors are a bit too 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.190
 all they have a lot of understanding court so quieter out 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.849
 What are you saying about the planned sales of the shock? 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.739
 I think it's a thing you pump 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.519
 even as we are still ranked so sometimes he at least knows that some money 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.849
 missing around her, the players on the market on freight train Thomas Rositzki 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:16.639
 example 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.289
 um and percent I think AZV always announces itself without further living 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:22.919
 Man percent grandmothers want to sell good money also can see them 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.599
 nevertheless refrain 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.679
 yes there is already so difficult percent 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:31.069
 Of course, there are also players SPD floats so even Olin in this 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.069
 Discussion but of course the idea is also a crowd pleaser 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.379
 It is currently still attractive to say bvb fans 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.840
 absolutely so for me it is completely uninteresting yes I would also to the 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.539
 top leagues in Europe plays here 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.539
 well that's a clear statement thank you for thinking about it 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:49.569
 Ties for 15 clubs
