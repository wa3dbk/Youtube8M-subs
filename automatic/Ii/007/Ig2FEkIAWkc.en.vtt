00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.900
 hi everyone today but 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.610
 as you see it we find ourselves for 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.440
 a special video for the 4000 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.970
 subscribers so that will also serve as a 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.800
 little special video for the 3000 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.960
 subscribers what we had done nothing so 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.220
 that's between 52 3000 and 4000 was 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.410
 mounted at a speed we will say 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.730
 far-fetched that 's what took a 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.590
 month and a half end it goes up it goes up 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.730
 really a speed not possible so 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.990
 here we are really still like 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.090
 usually thank you greatly 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.379
 for all the comments we have on 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.330
 all our videos always 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.100
 nice comments comments 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.500
 constructive 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.730
 finally here I really do not know 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.360
 what to tell you what frankly there 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.550
 it's really huge 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.719
 we think and I tell you every time 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.579
 we really thought not since the beginning 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.440
 that it would work here is the first 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.030
 video it was what it was in May of 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.590
 last year where I had set to 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.760
 base actually a little video so 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.460
 it was on the gbei screen that I had 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.870
 filmed with my phone I had it done 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.579
 a little support like that on the rock 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.649
 I'm already going, it's a bit like 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.960
 that I had told myself good we never know and 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.899
 here is today here is ready not even a 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.670
 year after we already 4000 subscribers more than 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.300
 300000 strong view there it's just it's 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.039
 Just huge 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.780
 it looks to the take the right 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.220
 way to continue finally here we go 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.590
 always try to make videos 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.570
 quality videos to teach you 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.680
 everything we know and even sometimes 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.119
 this is you who taught us 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.590
 stuff as we always say we have 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.060
 always we do not always have science 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.140
 infuse we do not know everything and that's 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.250
 that's actually what's good 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 in fishing and we always learn 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.520
 with fishing and so that's why 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.740
 it has always fascinated us since 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.540
 the beginning so here is really a big 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.490
 big big big big thank you for everything 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.930
 that's it we honestly it's really 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.210
 a nice little adventure invited with the 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.409
 dead from the beginning I hope it's 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.420
 really not finished I hope we can 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.950
 continue but here you always do 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.750
 videos we'll be able to move a 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.040
 little more even make you discover 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.229
 corners of the techniques strong there I 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.820
 really thank you so 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.350
 so as you doubt it's going to be a 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.729
 little contest for 4000 subscribers 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.350
 so with the dead we did a little 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.240
 order on the internet to make you 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.770

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.509
 a lot we are going to try to do 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.280
 two separate lots so a small 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.439
 command that we have renens will kill we will have 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.399
 a soft lure so hard so a 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.540
 small order that we bought on a 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.100
 website has recently 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.479
 so that's really not for you 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.259
 thank you to thank us 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.759

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.060
 say lay there we see it when you 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.069
 not like we said is what is 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.840
 all the interactions you have with 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.790

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.049
 fafe in fact that you thank us so 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.400
 So here you are through these little ones 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.500
 contest games and our videos will try 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.519
 to thank you too 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.409

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.879
 enough blablater so we go directly to 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.989
 to go on the subject so as I 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.549
 tell you will be a contest with water 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.620
 No, I'm just going to 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.900
 enumerate the rules and then you 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.040

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.840
 the rules so it's as usual 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.310
 so the first rule simply 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.450
 you subscribe to the channel 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.709
 youtube so I know there are some 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.670

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.409

 subscriber or who do not have an account for 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.010
 subscribe so here it is really the 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.299
 best way to support us 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.250
 this subscribe to our channel if 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.329

 google it's really super fast and 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.489
 this is it will be really a proof 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.900
 of your support towards us so the 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.620
 second condition so that's if you 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.079

 everything we can not necessarily 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.810

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.790
 simple for us to make the draw at 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.349
 sort is the fourth condition 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.819

 thank you very much I hope that 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.760

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.140
 we in any case we will all really 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.580
 for that goes on as long as we 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.990
 can but that's what have clearly 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.850
 we like it we are less there all the 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.750
 interactions we have with you here is end 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.500
 it's clear it's clearly something 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.630
 something we like 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.460
 so here we hope it will continue 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.900
 so now finds himself directly 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.630
 to show you the famous lots to 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.500
 win for this little contest 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.910
 so I'm going to introduce you now 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.930
 so the two lots that binds to win for 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.550
 this famous little contest I was 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.290
 also she tell you about the date 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.420
 limit to participate so the date 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.410
 limit will be set on Tuesday 14 April so 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.030
 until midnight you'll have to 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.410
 participate and so I will do you the 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.930
 results the next day in video so the 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.130
 Wednesday, April 15, 2015 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.080
 so the video will not come out as 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.190
 usually around 5 pm so when I 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.300
 go directly you present lots 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.890
 so as you know how to say a lot when 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.060
 from rhin to soft lure so we go 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.380
 start with the garbage so he 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.690
 this is a little stupid beast of the brand 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.650
 maria so there is a color really 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.570
 rather natural that works very well 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.120
 for clear waters so it's 5.2 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.290
 cm for 9.1 g and so will swim to a 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.660
 meter fifty deep 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.500
 then there is a small micro spinnaker 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.340
 north bay so there that goes clearly 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.500
 go to the pole 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.669
 so it's 5 g langolen mark bouya 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.070
 so here they are still rather 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.080
 known for their little north bay spinnaker 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.970
 then we have a djerba and some 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.740
 sakura brand so in a very 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.330
 natural therefore live series to series in 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.580
 so acura really colors very 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.280
 limiting so that's the 6 q railroaders 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.930
 it is 7.5 cm for 7.8 g and is going to swim 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.850
 also a 57 meter while he suspends 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.490
 ding and then in the soft lures 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.810
 So here the classic rock of the wave 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.310
 of sherene in a color that I like 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.710
