00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
move your way out towards the edge you

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.149 
move your way out towards the edge you
get<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:01.730> choose<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.600> shape<00:01:03.589> of<00:01:03.800> your<00:01:03.829> bezel

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
get to choose the shape of your bezel

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.670 
get to choose the shape of your bezel
because<00:01:05.059> you<00:01:05.210> you're<00:01:05.509> not<00:01:05.659> stuck<00:01:06.110> leaving<00:01:06.530> at

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
because you you're not stuck leaving at

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.420 
because you you're not stuck leaving at
the<00:01:06.830> full<00:01:07.070> size<00:01:08.800> now<00:01:09.800> you<00:01:09.860> could<00:01:10.190> leave<00:01:10.399> it

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
the full size now you could leave it

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.550 
the full size now you could leave it
like<00:01:10.700> this<00:01:10.940> because<00:01:11.210> these<00:01:11.509> molds<00:01:11.960> also<00:01:12.320> will

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
like this because these molds also will

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.450 
like this because these molds also will
lend<00:01:12.740> themselves<00:01:13.250> nicely<00:01:13.790> to<00:01:13.940> tiles<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:15.460> all

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
lend themselves nicely to tiles and all

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.190 
lend themselves nicely to tiles and all
of<00:01:16.610> them<00:01:16.759> are<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:16.970> same<00:01:17.180> size<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:17.869> they'll<00:01:18.080> fit

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
of them are the same size so they'll fit

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.940 
of them are the same size so they'll fit
nicely<00:01:18.440> together<00:01:20.320> I'm<00:01:21.320> going<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.590> lift<00:01:21.770> the

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
nicely together I'm going to lift the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.740 
nicely together I'm going to lift the
corner<00:01:24.670> now<00:01:25.670> my<00:01:25.850> Gilders<00:01:26.210> paste<00:01:26.240> could<00:01:26.660> have

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
corner now my Gilders paste could have

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.980 
corner now my Gilders paste could have
dried<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.020> little<00:01:27.200> bit<00:01:27.560> more<00:01:28.479> you<00:01:29.479> can<00:01:29.630> see<00:01:29.810> that

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
dried a little bit more you can see that

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.219 
dried a little bit more you can see that
the<00:01:30.110> edges<00:01:30.289> are<00:01:30.590> nice<00:01:30.800> and<00:01:31.039> rounded<00:01:31.520> here<00:01:32.229> and

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
the edges are nice and rounded here and

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.260 
the edges are nice and rounded here and
you<00:01:33.320> have<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.530> space<00:01:33.979> between<00:01:34.009> your<00:01:34.670> cabochon

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
you have a space between your cabochon

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.350 
you have a space between your cabochon
and<00:01:35.509> your<00:01:35.780> bezel<00:01:36.490> you'll<00:01:37.490> probably<00:01:37.729> also<00:01:38.179> see

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
and your bezel you'll probably also see

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.749 
and your bezel you'll probably also see
that<00:01:38.509> it's<00:01:38.659> all<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.500> same<00:01:39.770> level<00:01:40.069> but<00:01:40.610> we're

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
that it's all the same level but we're

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.149 
that it's all the same level but we're
going<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:41.000> change<00:01:41.210> that<00:01:41.679> so<00:01:42.679> for<00:01:42.890> now<00:01:43.039> I'm

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
going to change that so for now I'm

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.859 
going to change that so for now I'm
going<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.369> cut<00:01:43.550> around<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.940> outside<00:01:44.479> of<00:01:44.509> the

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
going to cut around the outside of the

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.100 
going to cut around the outside of the
bezel<00:01:46.330> make<00:01:47.330> sure<00:01:47.539> your<00:01:47.690> blade<00:01:47.899> is<00:01:48.080> going

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
bezel make sure your blade is going

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.910 
bezel make sure your blade is going
straight<00:01:48.649> up<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:48.950> down<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:51.380> there<00:01:51.619> you<00:01:51.770> go

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
straight up and down so there you go

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.690 
straight up and down so there you go
that<00:01:52.159> was<00:01:52.340> pretty<00:01:52.369> easy<00:01:54.130> when<00:01:55.130> this<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.430> baked

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
that was pretty easy when this is baked

this<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.360> decide<00:02:52.830> what<00:02:53.830> shape<00:02:54.130> I<00:02:54.310> want

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
this I have to decide what shape I want

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.539 
this I have to decide what shape I want
my<00:02:54.670> bezel<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.330> be<00:02:55.799> certainly<00:02:56.799> I<00:02:56.920> can<00:02:57.190> leave<00:02:57.400> it

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
my bezel to be certainly I can leave it

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.530 
my bezel to be certainly I can leave it
like<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:57.760> that's<00:02:58.690> how<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:58.959> did<00:02:59.110> my<00:02:59.380> first<00:02:59.620> one

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
like this that's how I did my first one

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.570 
like this that's how I did my first one
but<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.599> can<00:03:01.810> also<00:03:02.049> decide<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.860> change<00:03:03.099> it<00:03:03.430> and

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
but I can also decide to change it and

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.949 
but I can also decide to change it and
this<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.819> where<00:03:04.060> it's<00:03:04.180> kind<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.569> fun<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:04.870> this

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
this is where it's kind of fun and this

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.319 
this is where it's kind of fun and this
is<00:03:05.019> where<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.950> come<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:06.579> get<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:07.000> use

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
is where you come in and you get to use

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.660 
is where you come in and you get to use
some<00:03:07.540> artistic<00:03:08.109> license<00:03:08.620> because<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.190> get<00:03:09.549> to

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
design the bezel each and every time if

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.240 
design the bezel each and every time if
I<00:03:12.910> wanted<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.480> could<00:03:13.840> take<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.350> round<00:03:14.920> cookie

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
I wanted to I could take a round cookie

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.349 
I wanted to I could take a round cookie
cutter<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:18.130> could<00:03:18.340> place<00:03:18.609> that<00:03:18.910> on<00:03:19.090> there

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
cutter and I could place that on there

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.590 
cutter and I could place that on there
and<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.840> could<00:03:20.190> cut<00:03:21.190> my<00:03:21.340> bezel<00:03:21.730> into<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.120> circle

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
and I could cut my bezel into a circle

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.960 
and I could cut my bezel into a circle
shape<00:03:23.160> or<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.430> could<00:03:24.579> just<00:03:24.609> use<00:03:24.940> your

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
shape or you could just use your

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.830 
shape or you could just use your
straight<00:03:25.420> blade<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.049> I<00:03:26.829> could<00:03:27.209> make<00:03:28.209> my<00:03:28.390> bezel

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
straight blade and I could make my bezel

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.960 
straight blade and I could make my bezel
is<00:03:29.049> narrow<00:03:29.799> or<00:03:30.160> as<00:03:30.940> wide<00:03:31.150> as<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.630> want<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:32.970> can

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
is narrow or as wide as I want to I can

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.680 
is narrow or as wide as I want to I can
also<00:03:34.180> take<00:03:34.600> my<00:03:34.780> bendable<00:03:35.350> blade<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:37.480> can

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
also take my bendable blade and I can

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:49.290 
also take my bendable blade and I can
round<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.350> edges<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:43.120> easy<00:03:43.420> enough<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.840> do

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.990 

now<00:03:50.170> we're<00:03:50.980> going<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.130> fill<00:03:51.430> in<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.700> grooves

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
now we're going to fill in the grooves

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.850 
now we're going to fill in the grooves
and<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:53.800> do<00:03:53.950> that<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.870> can<00:03:56.050> use<00:03:56.200> acrylic<00:03:56.620> paint

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
and to do that you can use acrylic paint

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.200 
and to do that you can use acrylic paint
with<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.130> nice<00:03:57.370> rounded<00:03:57.850> brush<00:03:59.490> or<00:04:00.490> you<00:04:00.790> can<00:04:00.820> use

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
with a nice rounded brush or you can use

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.230 
with a nice rounded brush or you can use
some<00:04:01.420> alcohol<00:04:01.570> inks<00:04:05.700> now<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:06.790> doesn't<00:04:07.090> matter

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
some alcohol inks now it doesn't matter

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.440 
some alcohol inks now it doesn't matter
if<00:04:07.420> you<00:04:07.570> get<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:07.810> on<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.110> cabochon<00:04:08.980> part<00:04:09.450> but

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
if you get it on the cabochon part but

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.020 
if you get it on the cabochon part but
you<00:04:10.600> don't<00:04:10.780> want<00:04:10.960> to<00:04:11.050> get<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:11.290> on<00:04:11.350> your<00:04:11.410> bezel

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
you don't want to get it on your bezel

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.810 
you don't want to get it on your bezel
like<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:13.150> did<00:04:13.330> right<00:04:13.660> there<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:15.460> can<00:04:15.640> take<00:04:15.670> a

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
like I did right there so you can take a

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.960 
like I did right there so you can take a
q-tip<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.660> get<00:04:17.080> that<00:04:17.260> off<00:04:17.459> just<00:04:18.459> lay<00:04:18.640> it<00:04:18.760> flat

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
q-tip and get that off just lay it flat

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.140 
q-tip and get that off just lay it flat
to<00:04:19.090> dry<00:04:19.330> and<00:04:19.870> don't<00:04:20.230> don't<00:04:21.010> mess<00:04:21.640> around<00:04:21.820> with

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
to dry and don't don't mess around with

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.150 
to dry and don't don't mess around with
it<00:04:22.300> until<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.660> ink<00:04:22.840> is<00:04:23.020> dry<00:04:23.050> because<00:04:23.680> if<00:04:23.950> you

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
it until the ink is dry because if you

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.610 
it until the ink is dry because if you
start<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.760> seems<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.810> get<00:04:25.900> attracted<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.530> your

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
start it seems to get attracted to your

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.200 
start it seems to get attracted to your
finger<00:04:26.980> somehow<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.670> will<00:04:27.760> come<00:04:27.940> up<00:04:28.060> on

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
finger somehow and it will come up on

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.380 
finger somehow and it will come up on
your<00:04:28.390> bezel<00:04:28.890> this<00:04:29.890> cabochon<00:04:30.400> started<00:04:31.270> out

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
your bezel this cabochon started out

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.690 
your bezel this cabochon started out
just<00:04:31.690> like<00:04:31.870> this<00:04:32.080> one<00:04:32.350> okay<00:04:33.190> just<00:04:33.520> to

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
just like this one okay just to

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.000 
just like this one okay just to
translucent<00:04:34.480> clay<00:04:34.630> now<00:04:35.200> what<00:04:35.410> I<00:04:35.440> did<00:04:35.710> was<00:04:35.740> I

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
translucent clay now what I did was I

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.430 
translucent clay now what I did was I
rubbed<00:04:39.010> some<00:04:39.520> Gilders<00:04:39.940> paste<00:04:40.150> on<00:04:40.570> there<00:04:40.810> and<00:04:40.990> I

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
rubbed some Gilders paste on there and I

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.720 
rubbed some Gilders paste on there and I
can<00:04:41.650> do<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:41.950> when<00:04:42.130> it's<00:04:42.280> not<00:04:42.370> attached<00:04:44.730> so

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
can do that when it's not attached so

I'm<00:05:13.210> going<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:13.390> put<00:05:13.600> it<00:05:13.720> on<00:05:13.840> there<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.260> bake<00:05:14.500> it

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
I'm going to put it on there and bake it

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.600

but I'm also going to add a layer of

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.360 
but I'm also going to add a layer of
liquid<00:05:19.000> clay<00:05:19.450> to<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:19.780> top<00:05:19.990> so<00:05:20.410> I'll<00:05:20.680> wait<00:05:21.100> for

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
liquid clay to the top so I'll wait for

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.940 
liquid clay to the top so I'll wait for
that<00:05:21.400> to<00:05:21.700> dry<00:05:21.730> and<00:05:22.120> then<00:05:22.240> I'll<00:05:22.330> come<00:05:22.540> back<00:05:22.950> okay

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
I went ahead and I applied a layer of

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.100 
I went ahead and I applied a layer of
liquid<00:05:26.020> clay<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.620> this<00:05:27.010> after<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:28.110> Gilders

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
liquid clay to this after the Gilders

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.420 
liquid clay to this after the Gilders
paste<00:05:29.140> had<00:05:29.650> dried<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.310> then<00:05:31.030> I<00:05:31.090> baked<00:05:31.480> it<00:05:31.720> and

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
paste had dried and then I baked it and

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.240 
paste had dried and then I baked it and
it's<00:05:33.430> starting<00:05:33.820> to<00:05:33.970> show<00:05:34.180> some<00:05:34.419> depth<00:05:34.780> I<00:05:35.250> just

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
it's starting to show some depth I just

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.250 
it's starting to show some depth I just
added<00:05:36.460> another<00:05:36.820> layer<00:05:37.090> of<00:05:37.360> Gilders<00:05:37.780> paste<00:05:37.810> and

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.380 
added another layer of Gilders paste and
I'm<00:05:38.350> letting<00:05:38.530> it<00:05:38.800> dry<00:05:39.130> but<00:05:39.490> maybe<00:05:39.730> you<00:05:39.910> can<00:05:40.090> see

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
I'm letting it dry but maybe you can see

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.650 
I'm letting it dry but maybe you can see
in<00:05:40.570> this<00:05:40.780> one<00:05:41.250> because<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:42.490> added<00:05:42.970> a<00:05:43.210> layer<00:05:43.510> of

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
in this one because I added a layer of

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.330 
in this one because I added a layer of
liquid<00:05:43.840> clay<00:05:44.230> to<00:05:44.290> this<00:05:44.560> one<00:05:44.770> as<00:05:44.890> well<00:05:45.100> at<00:05:45.250> the

liquid clay to this one as well at the

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.240 
liquid clay to this one as well at the
same<00:05:45.550> time<00:05:45.880> and<00:05:46.470> hopefully<00:05:47.470> you<00:05:47.620> can<00:05:47.650> see<00:05:47.860> the

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
same time and hopefully you can see the

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.190 
same time and hopefully you can see the
different<00:05:49.169> layers<00:05:50.169> and<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:50.740> depth<00:05:52.020> so<00:05:53.020> now

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
different layers and the depth so now

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.480 
different layers and the depth so now
I'm<00:05:53.290> going<00:05:53.470> to<00:05:53.530> add<00:05:53.650> some<00:05:53.919> more<00:05:54.040> Gilders<00:05:54.460> paste

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.109 
layer of liquid clay you don't want to

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
to wait a few minutes give that a chance

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.059 
to wait a few minutes give that a chance
to<00:06:27.489> level<00:06:27.849> a<00:06:27.939> bit<00:06:28.179> and<00:06:28.449> then<00:06:29.259> I<00:06:29.289> will<00:06:29.499> put<00:06:29.889> it<00:06:29.979> in

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:30.069 
to level a bit and then I will put it in

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.569 
to level a bit and then I will put it in
my<00:06:30.099> preheated<00:06:30.549> oven<00:06:31.029> and<00:06:31.529> bake<00:06:32.529> it<00:06:32.559> one<00:06:33.399> last

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:33.579 
my preheated oven and bake it one last

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:37.529 
my preheated oven and bake it one last
time<00:06:34.059> okay<00:06:35.399> so<00:06:36.399> here<00:06:36.849> they<00:06:36.969> are<00:06:37.119> all<00:06:37.269> finished

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:37.539 
time okay so here they are all finished

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:39.959 
time okay so here they are all finished
not<00:06:38.379> sure<00:06:38.649> if<00:06:38.739> you<00:06:38.860> can<00:06:39.009> pick<00:06:39.279> up<00:06:39.429> on<00:06:39.610> the<00:06:39.729> depth

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969 
not sure if you can pick up on the depth

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:43.229 
not sure if you can pick up on the depth
or<00:06:40.179> not<00:06:40.829> now<00:06:41.829> the<00:06:41.889> Gilders<00:06:42.279> paste<00:06:42.369> tends<00:06:42.849> to

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:43.239 
or not now the Gilders paste tends to

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:45.509 
or not now the Gilders paste tends to
fade<00:06:43.569> when<00:06:43.869> you<00:06:44.050> bake<00:06:44.319> it<00:06:44.589> ideally<00:06:45.159> you<00:06:45.399> know

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:45.519 
fade when you bake it ideally you know

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:46.919 
fade when you bake it ideally you know
you<00:06:45.610> could<00:06:45.849> put<00:06:45.999> it<00:06:46.149> on<00:06:46.269> when<00:06:46.599> you're<00:06:46.749> all

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:46.929 
you could put it on when you're all

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:49.199 
you could put it on when you're all
finished<00:06:47.199> but<00:06:47.529> I<00:06:47.769> just<00:06:48.039> can't<00:06:48.279> wait<00:06:48.459> that<00:06:48.669> long

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:49.209 
finished but I just can't wait that long

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:51.569 
finished but I just can't wait that long
so<00:06:49.449> I<00:06:49.779> like<00:06:50.499> to<00:06:50.649> apply<00:06:50.919> it<00:06:50.949> see<00:06:51.339> what<00:06:51.459> it's

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:51.579 
so I like to apply it see what it's

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:52.949 
so I like to apply it see what it's
going<00:06:51.669> to<00:06:51.729> look<00:06:51.819> like<00:06:51.939> and<00:06:52.269> if<00:06:52.360> it<00:06:52.479> fades<00:06:52.749> I

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:52.959 
going to look like and if it fades I

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:55.409 
going to look like and if it fades I
just<00:06:53.169> reapply<00:06:53.439> it<00:06:53.709> now<00:06:54.610> remember<00:06:55.149> when<00:06:55.300> it

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
just reapply it now remember when it

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:57.239 
just reapply it now remember when it
dries<00:06:55.659> you<00:06:55.689> can<00:06:55.899> buff<00:06:56.229> it<00:06:56.379> with<00:06:56.409> a<00:06:56.559> soft<00:06:56.919> cloth

00:06:57.239 --> 00:06:57.249 
dries you can buff it with a soft cloth

00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:00.569 
dries you can buff it with a soft cloth
and<00:06:57.549> then<00:06:58.269> you<00:06:58.809> can<00:06:59.229> put<00:06:59.619> a<00:06:59.649> coating<00:07:00.069> a<00:07:00.279> clear

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:00.579 
and then you can put a coating a clear
