this<00:00:12.660> crazy<00:00:12.960> track<00:00:13.349> on<00:00:13.590> base<00:00:13.799> mechanics<00:00:14.370> and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
this crazy track on base mechanics and

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.870 
this crazy track on base mechanics and
it<00:00:14.969> makes<00:00:15.150> my<00:00:15.330> gauge<00:00:16.039> literally<00:00:17.039> save<00:00:17.609> check

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
gauges every time it hits its phony hold
