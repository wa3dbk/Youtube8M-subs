sick and yeah I guess I think that if
the<00:06:16.149> ant<00:06:16.330> Lord<00:06:16.539> was<00:06:16.689> really<00:06:16.990> lucky<00:06:17.199> he

the ant Lord was really lucky he

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:18.719 
the ant Lord was really lucky he
probably<00:06:17.740> could<00:06:17.979> kill<00:06:18.129> three<00:06:18.370> at<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.550> same

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
probably could kill three at the same

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.610 
probably could kill three at the same

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.500 
that move I love it so much as you guys
could<00:07:28.220> probably<00:07:28.400> tell<00:07:28.610> this<00:07:28.850> point<00:07:29.210> when<00:07:29.389> the

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.510 
could probably tell this point when the

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.750 
could probably tell this point when the
Naga<00:07:29.690> takes<00:07:29.960> damage<00:07:30.229> he<00:07:30.889> like<00:07:31.039> loses<00:07:31.430> blocks

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:31.760 
Naga takes damage he like loses blocks

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.680 
Naga takes damage he like loses blocks
off<00:07:32.000> his<00:07:32.270> body

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.690 
off his body

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.690 
off his body
and<00:07:33.289> then<00:07:33.470> he<00:07:33.560> actually<00:07:33.710> gets<00:07:33.979> faster<00:07:34.490> too

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:34.700 
and then he actually gets faster too

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.860 
and then he actually gets faster too
though<00:07:34.910> so<00:07:35.150> it<00:07:35.210> gives<00:07:35.360> him<00:07:35.419> a<00:07:35.570> slight

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.870 
though so it gives him a slight

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.200 
though so it gives him a slight
advantage<00:07:36.220> but<00:07:37.220> of<00:07:37.310> course<00:07:37.550> he<00:07:37.850> can't<00:07:38.060> do<00:07:38.120> as

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.210 
advantage but of course he can't do as

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.580 
advantage but of course he can't do as
much<00:07:38.389> damage<00:07:38.419> with<00:07:38.900> his<00:07:39.020> body<00:07:39.260> because

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:39.590 
much damage with his body because

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.990 
much damage with his body because
there's<00:07:39.770> like<00:07:39.860> less<00:07:40.100> of<00:07:40.160> it<00:07:40.400> to<00:07:40.430> like<00:07:40.669> hit<00:07:40.850> them

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.000 
there's like less of it to like hit them

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.360 
there's like less of it to like hit them
