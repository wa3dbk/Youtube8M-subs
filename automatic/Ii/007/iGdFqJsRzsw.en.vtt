is a viewer indicated that I may have
done<00:00:56.960> that<00:00:57.140> incorrectly<00:00:57.940> you're<00:00:58.940> supposed<00:00:59.239> to

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
done that incorrectly you're supposed to

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.549 
done that incorrectly you're supposed to
count<00:00:59.660> out<00:00:59.960> 15<00:01:00.649> cards<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.840> then<00:01:02.840> discard

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
count out 15 cards and then discard

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.859 
count out 15 cards and then discard
those<00:01:04.040> cards<00:01:04.580> actually<00:01:04.850> making<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.540> deck

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
those cards actually making the deck

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.480 
those cards actually making the deck
thinner<00:01:06.229> so<00:01:07.220> I<00:01:07.250> did<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:08.680> these<00:01:09.680> are<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.040> 15

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
thinner so I did that these are the 15

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.300 
thinner so I did that these are the 15
cards<00:01:10.790> that<00:01:11.090> I<00:01:11.119> had<00:01:11.360> counted<00:01:11.720> out<00:01:12.130> last<00:01:13.130> time

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
cards that I had counted out last time

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.139 
cards that I had counted out last time
and<00:01:13.810> put<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.740> incarnation<00:01:16.399> card<00:01:16.640> on<00:01:16.759> top<00:01:16.790> of

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
and put the incarnation card on top of

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.719 
and put the incarnation card on top of
these<00:01:17.300> so<00:01:17.540> I<00:01:17.570> just<00:01:17.869> simply<00:01:18.310> took<00:01:19.310> these<00:01:19.550> out

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
these so I just simply took these out

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.090 
these so I just simply took these out
these<00:01:20.030> are<00:01:20.180> going<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.330> be<00:01:20.390> discarded<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:21.259> then

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
these are going to be discarded and then

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.279 
these are going to be discarded and then
I<00:01:22.130> counted<00:01:22.789> down<00:01:23.360> another<00:01:23.899> 10<00:01:24.289> cards<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.240> put

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
I counted down another 10 cards and put

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.650 
I counted down another 10 cards and put
roofings<00:01:27.289> incarnation<00:01:28.280> there<00:01:28.610> this<00:01:29.330> is<00:01:29.509> the

the<00:02:39.870> neutral<00:02:40.290> boards<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.760> case<00:02:42.030> are<00:02:42.500> also

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
the neutral boards in this case are also

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.100 
the neutral boards in this case are also
going<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.069> start<00:02:44.430> with<00:02:44.629> four<00:02:45.629> cheat<00:02:45.930> tokens

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
going to start with four cheat tokens

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.300 
going to start with four cheat tokens
that<00:02:48.230> wasn't<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.319> clearest<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.099> rule

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
that wasn't the clearest in the rule

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.240 
that wasn't the clearest in the rule
book<00:02:50.690> but<00:02:51.690> i<00:02:51.720> actually<00:02:52.049> managed<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.860> watch<00:02:53.099> a

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
book but i actually managed to watch a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.280 
book but i actually managed to watch a
video<00:02:53.519> on<00:02:53.910> board<00:02:54.750> game<00:02:54.959> boardgamegeek<00:02:55.830> about

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
video on board game boardgamegeek about

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.470 
video on board game boardgamegeek about
strategies<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.620> playing<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.010> solo<00:02:59.250> game<00:02:59.480> they

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
strategies and playing a solo game they

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.449 
strategies and playing a solo game they
were<00:03:00.540> using<00:03:00.840> an<00:03:01.080> iPad<00:03:01.590> version<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.280> game

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
were using an iPad version of the game

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.210 
were using an iPad version of the game
and<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:03.510> noticed<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.019> not<00:03:04.260> only<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.799> starting

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
and I noticed that not only the starting

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.670 
and I noticed that not only the starting
player<00:03:05.489> had<00:03:05.849> 40<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:06.810> all<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> neutral

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
player had 40 but all of the neutral

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.289 
player had 40 but all of the neutral
boards<00:03:08.099> also<00:03:08.390> had<00:03:09.530> 40<00:03:10.530> as<00:03:10.739> well<00:03:11.099> so<00:03:11.910> that's<00:03:12.090> why

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
boards also had 40 as well so that's why

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.660 
boards also had 40 as well so that's why
I've<00:03:12.540> set<00:03:12.810> up<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.049> board<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.530> way<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.040> I

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
I've set up the board that way and I

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.420 
I've set up the board that way and I
believe<00:03:14.730> that's<00:03:15.180> correct<00:03:15.569> for<00:03:16.440> playing<00:03:17.160> at

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
believe that's correct for playing at

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.449 
believe that's correct for playing at
the<00:03:17.610> easiest<00:03:18.209> level<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.660> difficulty<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:20.340> we're

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
the easiest level of difficulty so we're

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.309 
the easiest level of difficulty so we're
going<00:03:20.549> to<00:03:20.670> get<00:03:20.790> started<00:03:21.209> now<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.390> begin<00:03:21.810> turn

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
going to get started now and begin turn

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.150 
going to get started now and begin turn
to<00:03:23.360> since<00:03:24.360> we<00:03:24.450> currently<00:03:25.110> have<00:03:25.290> no<00:03:25.530> ghosts<00:03:26.040> on

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
to since we currently have no ghosts on

to since we currently have no ghosts on
the<00:03:26.190> board<00:03:26.579> we<00:03:27.180> drop<00:03:27.420> down<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.049> very<00:03:28.200> end

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
the board we drop down to the very end

the board we drop down to the very end
of<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:30.769> yen<00:03:31.769> phase<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:32.489> we<00:03:33.260> allow<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.290> ghost<00:03:34.709> or

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
of the yen phase and we allow a ghost or

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.960 
of the yen phase and we allow a ghost or
we<00:03:35.549> have<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> ghost<00:03:36.030> arrive<00:03:36.989> it's<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.970> power

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
we have a ghost arrive it's a power

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.420 
we have a ghost arrive it's a power
level<00:03:39.450> two<00:03:39.690> ghost<00:03:39.859> that<00:03:40.859> means<00:03:41.100> we're<00:03:41.310> going

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
level two ghost that means we're going

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.910 
level two ghost that means we're going
to<00:03:41.489> need<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.819> read<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.600> get<00:03:42.780> rid<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:42.959> it<00:03:43.139> and<00:03:43.709> the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
to need to read to get rid of it and the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.860 
to need to read to get rid of it and the
ghost<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.400> called<00:03:44.639> bleeding<00:03:45.299> eyes<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:48.720> is

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
ghost is called bleeding eyes and it is

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.490 
ghost is called bleeding eyes and it is
a<00:03:48.900> Haunter<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.190> i<00:03:50.630> think<00:03:51.630> i'm<00:03:51.959> going<00:03:52.139> to<00:03:52.290> place

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
a Haunter so i think i'm going to place

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.920 
a Haunter so i think i'm going to place
this<00:03:52.739> ghost<00:03:53.069> in<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.400> same<00:03:53.670> position<00:03:54.359> as<00:03:54.599> the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
this ghost in the same position as the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.740 
this ghost in the same position as the
one<00:03:55.139> from<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.500> previous<00:03:56.130> turn<00:03:56.579> so<00:03:57.450> i'm<00:03:57.540> going

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
one from the previous turn so i'm going

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.319 
one from the previous turn so i'm going
to<00:03:57.840> put<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.109> right<00:03:58.290> here<00:03:58.880> since<00:03:59.880> i'm<00:04:00.060> already

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
to put it right here since i'm already

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.559 
to put it right here since i'm already
right<00:04:00.780> here<00:04:01.169> and<00:04:01.639> then<00:04:02.639> I<00:04:02.760> believe<00:04:03.060> we<00:04:03.209> put<00:04:03.419> the

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
right here and then I believe we put the

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.180 
right here and then I believe we put the
Haunter<00:04:04.109> figure<00:04:04.819> on<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:05.880> end<00:04:06.329> and<00:04:07.040> if<00:04:08.040> we

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
Haunter figure on the end and if we

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.830 
Haunter figure on the end and if we
don't<00:04:08.340> get<00:04:08.549> rid<00:04:08.730> of<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:09.000> Ghost<00:04:09.239> it's<00:04:09.540> going

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
don't get rid of that Ghost it's going

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.229 
don't get rid of that Ghost it's going
to<00:04:09.959> start<00:04:10.230> moving<00:04:10.470> forward<00:04:11.310> which<00:04:11.819> will<00:04:12.090> be

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
to start moving forward which will be

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.819 
to start moving forward which will be
