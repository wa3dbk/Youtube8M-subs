an inspiration that we took from

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.580 
an inspiration that we took from
single-player<00:02:59.030> where<00:02:59.840> you<00:02:59.930> have<00:03:00.050> cinematic

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
single-player where you have cinematic

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.809 
single-player where you have cinematic
events<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:00.980> are<00:03:01.040> kind<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.250> like<00:03:01.340> whoa<00:03:01.519> what
