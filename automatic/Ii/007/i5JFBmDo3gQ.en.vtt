almost<00:00:56.379> full<00:00:57.000> critic<00:00:58.000> creature<00:00:58.269> even<00:00:58.989> more

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
almost full critic creature even more

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.710 
almost full critic creature even more
than<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.440> Metroid<00:00:59.739> queen<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.430> she<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:01.570> no

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
than the Metroid queen and she is no

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.920 
than the Metroid queen and she is no
walk<00:01:01.960> in<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.140> park<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:03.280> two<00:01:03.460> stages<00:01:03.729> but<00:01:04.299> his

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
walk in the park in two stages but his

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.580 
walk in the park in two stages but his
mama<00:01:05.229> was<00:01:05.500> even<00:01:05.710> harder<00:01:06.070> I<00:01:07.260> kept<00:01:08.260> trying<00:01:08.410> to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
mama was even harder I kept trying to

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.320 
mama was even harder I kept trying to
you<00:01:08.830> know<00:01:08.860> bending<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.610> make<00:01:09.760> it<00:01:09.880> look<00:01:10.060> just

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
you know bending to make it look just

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you know bending to make it look just
like<00:01:10.390> it<00:01:10.540> doesn't<00:01:10.720> like<00:01:10.930> picture<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.900> could<00:01:14.170> fit

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
like it doesn't like picture I could fit

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.860 
like it doesn't like picture I could fit
yeah<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.760> I<00:01:15.790> think<00:01:15.940> for<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.240> most<00:01:16.390> part<00:01:16.540> my

around and max out my complexity meter I
just<00:01:44.610> chose<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> isn't
