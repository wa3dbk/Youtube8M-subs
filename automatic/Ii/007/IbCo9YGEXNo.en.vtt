stay back and we just saw that a minute
ago<00:00:29.429> when<00:00:29.699> he<00:00:29.760> was<00:00:29.880> shooting<00:00:29.970> those<00:00:30.179> lasers<00:00:30.650> he

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
ago when he was shooting those lasers he

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.770 
ago when he was shooting those lasers he
plays<00:00:31.859> patient<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.940> we'll<00:00:33.030> see<00:00:33.239> if<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.540> can

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
plays patient so we'll see if this can

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.389 
plays patient so we'll see if this can
work<00:00:33.809> around<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.440> yeah<00:00:36.950> using<00:00:37.950> those<00:00:38.010> lasers

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
work around that yeah using those lasers

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.819 
work around that yeah using those lasers
the<00:00:38.520> edge<00:00:38.640> guard<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.290> great<00:00:40.290> way<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> mess<00:00:40.680> up

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the edge guard a great way to mess up

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.369 
the edge guard a great way to mess up
Luigi's<00:00:41.219> recovery<00:00:41.899> it's<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.050> good<00:00:43.170> job<00:00:43.350> of

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
Luigi's recovery it's in a good job of

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.770 
Luigi's recovery it's in a good job of
using<00:00:43.649> jabs<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.340> kind<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.670> stuff<00:00:44.940> this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
using jabs to kind of stuff this

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.959 
using jabs to kind of stuff this
pressure<00:00:46.190> when<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.309> close<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.489> us<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.850> get

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
pressure when it's close to us to get

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.330 
pressure when it's close to us to get
some<00:00:48.090> space<00:00:48.350> yeah<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> mean<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:49.950> that's

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
some space yeah I mean it and that's

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.450 
some space yeah I mean it and that's
what<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:51.260> feel<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.350> Falco<00:00:52.680> needs<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.129> put<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
what I feel like Falco needs to put the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.580 
what I feel like Falco needs to put the
pressure<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.629> Ouija<00:00:54.930> doesn't<00:00:55.469> have

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
pressure on so the Ouija doesn't have

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.010 
pressure on so the Ouija doesn't have
much<00:00:55.770> chance<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.250> move<00:00:56.430> yeah<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.719> great<00:00:57.870> day

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
much chance to move yeah it's great day

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.450 
much chance to move yeah it's great day
to<00:00:58.079> reflect<00:00:58.260> during<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.859> those<00:00:59.010> lasers

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
to reflect during some of those lasers

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.450 
to reflect during some of those lasers
but<00:00:59.730> he's<00:01:00.329> got<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> little<00:01:00.840> bit<00:01:00.989> more

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
I'll see what he can get guys the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.609 
I'll see what he can get guys the
technique<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> down<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:47.929> working<00:01:48.929> went<00:01:49.440> for<00:01:49.560> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
technique the down be working went for a

uh did you figure like some of them
would<00:02:30.400> hit<00:02:30.609> and<00:02:31.269> indeed<00:02:31.599> some<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.900> them<00:02:31.989> did

I do yo so mathematically timewise you

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.440 
I do yo so mathematically timewise you
keep<00:02:38.290> putting<00:02:38.439> out<00:02:38.620> for<00:02:38.889> damage<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.939> way<00:02:40.090> and

that's 10 luigi's weaknesses this is
recovery<00:07:16.870> it<00:07:17.020> seems<00:07:17.260> like<00:07:17.350> he's<00:07:17.530> got<00:07:17.680> a<00:07:17.710> lot<00:07:17.860> of

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:17.889 
recovery it seems like he's got a lot of

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:23.040 
recovery it seems like he's got a lot of
option<00:07:18.340> but<00:07:18.729> it<00:07:19.360> is<00:07:19.810> really<00:07:20.080> limited<00:07:21.930> so<00:07:22.930> that

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.050 
option but it is really limited so that

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.689 
option but it is really limited so that
you<00:07:23.139> got<00:07:23.290> to<00:07:23.320> take<00:07:23.620> advantage<00:07:23.650> of<00:07:24.100> these<00:07:24.250> yeah

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:24.699 
you got to take advantage of these yeah

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:27.740 
you got to take advantage of these yeah
yeah<00:07:25.180> just<00:07:25.570> winced<00:07:25.930> at<00:07:26.020> pretty<00:07:26.229> solidly

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:27.750 
yeah just winced at pretty solidly

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.879 
yeah just winced at pretty solidly
that's<00:07:28.750> what<00:07:28.870> you<00:07:28.930> gotta<00:07:29.080> do<00:07:29.199> you<00:07:29.470> got<00:07:29.620> to<00:07:29.710> take

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:29.889 
that's what you gotta do you got to take

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:32.969 
that's what you gotta do you got to take
these<00:07:30.190> not<00:07:30.970> high<00:07:31.900> tier<00:07:32.260> top<00:07:32.650> to<00:07:32.889> your

these not high tier top to your

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:34.860 
these not high tier top to your

characters and you have to exploit them

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.529

like<00:07:52.660> language<00:07:53.050> and<00:07:53.260> he<00:07:54.100> says<00:07:54.340> he's<00:07:54.610> really

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:54.850 
like language and he says he's really

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.939 
like language and he says he's really
good<00:07:55.030> punishes<00:07:55.510> against<00:07:55.930> both<00:07:56.169> fast<00:07:56.590> powers

00:07:56.939 --> 00:07:56.949 
good punishes against both fast powers

00:07:56.949 --> 00:07:58.980 
good punishes against both fast powers
and<00:07:57.160> floaties<00:07:57.520> and<00:07:57.820> that's<00:07:58.000> what<00:07:58.090> we<00:07:58.240> see<00:07:58.419> will

00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:58.990 
and floaties and that's what we see will

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.330 
and floaties and that's what we see will
we<00:07:59.110> see<00:07:59.260> a<00:07:59.289> lot<00:07:59.410> of<00:07:59.470> fastball<00:07:59.889> i<00:07:59.950> guess<00:08:00.160> there's

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:00.340 
we see a lot of fastball i guess there's

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.990 
we see a lot of fastball i guess there's
only<00:08:00.430> two<00:08:00.639> options<00:08:00.789> but<00:08:01.210> look
