00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.040
 let's go something more cheerful in two weeks 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.470
 almost seven hundred thousand people have seen 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.819
 the movie iron man 3 is a true 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.860
 international phenomenon that charms 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.420
 big and small and such is the deduction 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.700
 that even in Chile we have our 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.700
 own version of this superhero looks 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.140
 spectacular is very good and very good 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.050
 yes 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.420
 just as you lower it in the Basque 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.540
 my name is rubén martínez in this 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.269
 Minute Tony Stark and work as Ironman 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.060
 these days one of the most 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.550
 adored all over the world the phenomenon 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.650
 Ironman has hit more than strength between 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.140
 the thousands of fans who have replenished 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.660
 theaters to see the third part of 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.369
 the good action saga besides 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.190
 the action is and as there is already action laughs 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.320
 new charm that one would be very much this 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.880
 that like all the time impacted with the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.270
 movie and also that a lot of technology 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.270
 as well 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.189
 really great 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.470
 i 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.490
 they ask me for things 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.700
 and more 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.110
 only in a few minutes with the self-styled 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.330
 something bad Chilean to understand the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.540
 devotion that some have to the 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.090
 34-year-old ruben comic superhero 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.820
 He proudly wears his suit brought from 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.660
 USA and that today gives you enough 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.660
 dividends 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.040
 do not leave me more easily 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.620
 in electronic such as it should be 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.620
 It works just like the movie 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:33.409
 It's a card 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.230
 the program an engineer 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.720
 yes 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.740
 and I'm going to start to understand at the beginning 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.740
 to try your luck 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.569
 I had already taken the taste of 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:57.520
 results and how it came in several months 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.780
 and there we started to find out with the 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.780
 ironman's body 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.610
 no reaction to the people well very well what 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.520
 what happens is that it is in the DNA of 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.470
 adults of young adults up to 40 or 45 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.599
 I read in the comic book when I was little and 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.580
 the children of course that later came 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:26.400
 cinema and two sociologists who 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:29.690
 found on the street I love it and I 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.690
 like you have a game over 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.620
 I love work 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.650
 because since it looks like really the 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.590
 experts talk about a phenomenon 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.600
 international between the figures speak 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.480
 alone has already been in two weeks 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.250
 exhibition almost 700 thousand people which 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.710
 it's a very, very large number for 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.760
 have a reference was the ice and this 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.020
 de jan versus kramer which are both 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.520
 biggest movies in history that 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.620
 they have sold they sold two million 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.030
 people so they were more going very well 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.070
 routed spent a movie totally 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.530
 record for this year that's why 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.990
 our ironman has more economic downside 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.840
 you almost can not see the street because the 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.269
 events have come out to him was greater is the 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.019
 Chilean version of a beloved character 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.019
 by all
