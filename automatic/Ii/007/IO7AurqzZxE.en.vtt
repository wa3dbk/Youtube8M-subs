00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.660

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.660 
dig in the others I'm gonna feel fuller
now<00:02:31.000> note<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.510> any<00:02:31.810> fuel<00:02:32.019> filter<00:02:35.550> let's<00:02:36.550> take

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
now note that any fuel filter let's take

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.050 
now note that any fuel filter let's take
a<00:02:36.700> little<00:02:36.849> cranky<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.300> get<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> count<00:02:39.060> that's

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
a little cranky to get a count that's

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.770 
a little cranky to get a count that's
good<00:02:40.269> though<00:02:40.420> no<00:02:40.660> critters<00:02:40.930> living<00:02:41.260> in<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:42.780> and

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
good though no critters living in it and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.449 
good though no critters living in it and
so<00:02:43.959> I'm<00:02:44.049> going<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.230> try<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.500> squeezing<00:02:45.129> up<00:02:45.250> there

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
so I'm going to try a squeezing up there

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.170 
so I'm going to try a squeezing up there
and<00:02:46.049> turning<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.290> key<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.610> passenger

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
and turning the key on the passenger

00:02:49.180 --> 00:03:21.420 
and turning the key on the passenger
side<00:03:07.620> there's<00:03:08.620> no<00:03:08.860> way<00:03:19.890> this<00:03:20.890> is<00:03:20.950> not<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.250> good

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
side there's no way this is not a good

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:32.390 
side there's no way this is not a good
idea

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400
