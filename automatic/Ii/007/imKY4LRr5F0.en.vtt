a<00:01:02.550> lot<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.699> sag<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.510> X<00:01:04.049> direction<00:01:05.150> which

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
a lot of sag in the X direction which

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.940 
a lot of sag in the X direction which
doesn't<00:01:06.750> surprise<00:01:06.810> me<00:01:07.020> at<00:01:07.200> all<00:01:07.320> being<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.770> only

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
doesn't surprise me at all being it only

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.219 
doesn't surprise me at all being it only
supported<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.640> side<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.600> will<00:01:09.750> get<00:01:09.960> some

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
supported on one side you will get some

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.350 
supported on one side you will get some
wobble<00:01:10.619> I'm<00:01:10.920> hoping<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:11.909> still<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
wobble I'm hoping that I can still get a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.950 
wobble I'm hoping that I can still get a
decent<00:01:12.450> printer<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.200> this

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.430 

but<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.640> made<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.090> melamine<00:01:18.990> colored

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
but it's made out of melamine colored

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.820 
but it's made out of melamine colored
would<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:20.520> necessarily<00:01:21.270> badness<00:01:22.200> per<00:01:22.470> se<00:01:22.650> it

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
would not necessarily badness per se it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.290 
would not necessarily badness per se it
certainly<00:01:23.070> won't<00:01:23.220> crack<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> acrylic

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
certainly won't crack like the acrylic

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.020 
certainly won't crack like the acrylic
that<00:01:24.510> I<00:01:24.930> slightly<00:01:25.650> ran<00:01:25.890> into<00:01:26.190> with<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.640> folder

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that I slightly ran into with the folder

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.310 
that I slightly ran into with the folder
tech<00:01:27.210> but<00:01:28.400> it<00:01:29.400> separated<00:01:29.990> splinters<00:01:30.990> really

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
tech but it separated splinters really

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.080 
tech but it separated splinters really
easy<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.799> can't<00:01:32.040> really<00:01:32.220> take<00:01:32.400> much<00:01:32.580> torque<00:01:32.940> in

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
easy it can't really take much torque in

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.219 
easy it can't really take much torque in
any<00:01:33.210> way<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.110> lot<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.619> design<00:01:35.060> was<00:01:36.229> some

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
any way and a lot of the design was some

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.070 
any way and a lot of the design was some
of<00:01:37.290> these<00:01:37.380> larger<00:01:38.009> bolts<00:01:38.670> being<00:01:39.509> threaded

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
of these larger bolts being threaded

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.870 
of these larger bolts being threaded
right<00:01:40.290> into<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.800> wood<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.399> was<00:01:41.640> those

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
right into the wood and that was those

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.710 
right into the wood and that was those
it<00:01:43.460> maybe<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.729> me<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.270> usually<00:01:45.450> like

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
it maybe it's just me but I usually like

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.990 
it maybe it's just me but I usually like
to<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:45.960> nuts<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.560> bolts<00:01:46.800> go<00:01:47.520> together<00:01:47.700> I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
to have nuts and bolts go together I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.440 
to have nuts and bolts go together I
don't<00:01:48.300> trust<00:01:48.660> the<00:01:48.929> thread<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.649> would

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
don't trust the thread of just would

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.669 
don't trust the thread of just would
that<00:01:51.450> being<00:01:51.690> said<00:01:51.929> there<00:01:52.200> are<00:01:52.320> some<00:01:52.530> things

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
that being said there are some things

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:53.930 
that being said there are some things
that<00:01:52.800> are<00:01:52.950> threaded<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:53.340> into<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> plastic

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
that are threaded right into the plastic

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.139 
that are threaded right into the plastic
but<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:54.960> bit<00:01:55.110> better<00:01:56.149> it's

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
but that's a little bit better it's

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.359 
but that's a little bit better it's
better<00:01:57.330> grip<00:01:57.660> won't<00:01:58.530> wear<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.830> easy<00:01:59.039> as<00:01:59.220> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
better grip won't wear as easy as the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.150 
better grip won't wear as easy as the
wood<00:01:59.539> so<00:02:00.539> I<00:02:00.990> got<00:02:01.289> this<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.800> tore<00:02:02.039> it<00:02:02.130> down

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
wood so I got this and I tore it down

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.029 
wood so I got this and I tore it down
last<00:02:02.580> night<00:02:02.789> for<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.690> most<00:02:03.869> part<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.830> had

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
printed out a whole bagful upgrade parts

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.430

upgrade prayer that upgrade I will say
probably<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.600> two<00:02:15.780> best<00:02:15.959> upgrades<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.709> print

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
probably the two best upgrades to print

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.220 
probably the two best upgrades to print
at<00:02:17.670> least<00:02:18.030> as<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.330> have<00:02:18.420> come<00:02:18.569> across<00:02:18.600> them<00:02:19.019> so

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
at least as I have come across them so

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.180 
at least as I have come across them so
far<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:21.380> x<00:02:22.380> axis<00:02:23.160> kantri<00:02:24.739> reprint<00:02:25.739> these

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
far is the x axis kantri reprint these

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.670 
far is the x axis kantri reprint these
two<00:02:26.519> parts<00:02:26.940> there's<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.600> clip<00:02:28.110> on

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.979

hot end or extruder holder that's a

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.949 
hot end or extruder holder that's a
pretty<00:02:33.170> nice<00:02:33.349> part<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.769> like<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.099> design<00:02:34.959> and

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
pretty nice part I like that design and

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.539 
pretty nice part I like that design and
they<00:02:36.319> also<00:02:36.530> said<00:02:36.829> you<00:02:36.950> certainly<00:02:37.280> need<00:02:37.430> to

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
they also said you certainly need to

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.640 
they also said you certainly need to
upgrade<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.510> bearing<00:02:38.959> holder<00:02:39.290> for<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
upgrade the bearing holder for the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.940 
upgrade the bearing holder for the
y-axis<00:02:40.689> I'm<00:02:41.689> a<00:02:41.750> little<00:02:42.019> concerned<00:02:42.200> already<00:02:42.769> at

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
y-axis I'm a little concerned already at

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.170 
y-axis I'm a little concerned already at
this<00:02:43.069> point<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.549> even<00:02:43.700> after<00:02:43.969> these

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
this point that even after these

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.170 
this point that even after these
upgrades<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:45.409> isn't<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:46.000> not<00:02:47.000> the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
upgrades this isn't the not the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.949 
upgrades this isn't the not the
smoothest<00:02:47.540> it's<00:02:48.469> got<00:02:48.920> some<00:02:49.129> wobble<00:02:49.959> certainly

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
smoothest it's got some wobble certainly

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.030 
smoothest it's got some wobble certainly
a<00:02:50.989> little<00:02:51.230> wiggle<00:02:51.409> and<00:02:51.680> if<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:51.859> look

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
a little wiggle and if you look

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.300 
a little wiggle and if you look
underneath<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:53.650> suppose<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.739> can<00:02:54.859> flip<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.129> up

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
underneath I suppose I can flip this up

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.170 
underneath I suppose I can flip this up
for<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:55.639> if<00:02:56.569> you<00:02:56.689> look<00:02:56.870> underneath<00:02:58.180> you'll

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
for you if you look underneath you'll

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.929 
for you if you look underneath you'll
see<00:02:59.420> that<00:02:59.569> it's<00:03:00.040> these<00:03:01.040> are<00:03:01.189> the<00:03:01.280> cutouts<00:03:01.670> and

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
see that it's these are the cutouts and

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.339 
see that it's these are the cutouts and
see<00:03:02.239> all<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.359> burnt<00:03:02.659> wood<00:03:02.870> from<00:03:03.049> the<00:03:03.109> laser

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
see all the burnt wood from the laser

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.500 
see all the burnt wood from the laser
cutting<00:03:03.680> wood<00:03:03.980> these<00:03:04.939> are<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.120> cutouts<00:03:05.419> for

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
cutting wood these are the cutouts for

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.000 
cutting wood these are the cutouts for
two<00:03:05.780> linear<00:03:06.109> bearings<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.680> that's<00:03:06.799> really

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
two linear bearings and that's really

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.629 
two linear bearings and that's really
the<00:03:07.220> only<00:03:07.250> thing<00:03:07.879> holding<00:03:08.470> your<00:03:09.489> your<00:03:10.489> y

this portion so I don't know it's kinda

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.659

interesting but for 200 bucks plus some
printing<00:03:41.000> apart<00:03:41.500> I'm<00:03:42.500> probably<00:03:42.769> doing<00:03:43.040> okay

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430

and<00:03:43.639> I<00:03:43.729> intend<00:03:44.329> to<00:03:44.479> upgrade<00:03:44.870> this<00:03:44.989> so<00:03:45.169> it's<00:03:45.290> at

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
and I intend to upgrade this so it's at

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.469 
and I intend to upgrade this so it's at
least<00:03:45.699> acceptable<00:03:47.109> no<00:03:48.109> heated<00:03:48.439> bed<00:03:49.090> all<00:03:50.090> just

white plastic pieces you see that's all

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.050 
white plastic pieces you see that's all
what<00:03:55.669> I<00:03:55.699> printed<00:03:56.180> off<00:03:56.359> on<00:03:56.659> the<00:03:57.370> cruise<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.549> three

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
what I printed off on the cruise I three

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.490 
what I printed off on the cruise I three
I<00:04:00.120> do<00:04:00.599> kind<00:04:00.870> of<00:04:00.930> like<00:04:01.050> this<00:04:03.500> screw<00:04:04.500> Acme<00:04:05.370> screw

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
I do kind of like this screw Acme screw

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.390 
I do kind of like this screw Acme screw
apparatus<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.590> kind<00:04:07.770> of<00:04:07.800> wish<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.040> would<00:04:08.160> see<00:04:08.370> you

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
apparatus I kind of wish I would see you

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.830 
apparatus I kind of wish I would see you
another<00:04:08.640> one<00:04:08.760> on<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:08.910> other<00:04:09.000> side<00:04:09.330> but<00:04:09.630> then

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
another one on the other side but then

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.540 
another one on the other side but then
where<00:04:10.110> would<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.380> have<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.650> motor<00:04:10.860> for<00:04:11.280> your

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
where would you have the motor for your

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.180 
where would you have the motor for your
ex<00:04:11.910> acti<00:04:12.360> so<00:04:13.110> I<00:04:13.470> think<00:04:13.680> they<00:04:13.770> really<00:04:14.010> try<00:04:14.130> to

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
ex acti so I think they really try to

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.710 
ex acti so I think they really try to
condense<00:04:14.580> this<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.120> it's<00:04:15.360> certainly<00:04:15.630> a

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
condense this and it's certainly a

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.539 
condense this and it's certainly a
little<00:04:15.930> desktop<00:04:16.440> printer<00:04:17.130> if<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.340> think

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
little desktop printer if you think

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.300 
little desktop printer if you think
about<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:17.790> but<00:04:18.690> there's<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.109> lot<00:04:19.380> of<00:04:19.410> flaws<00:04:20.070> and

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
about it but there's a lot of flaws and

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.250 
about it but there's a lot of flaws and
the<00:04:20.400> design<00:04:20.730> at<00:04:20.880> least<00:04:21.030> as<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.480> shipped<00:04:21.989> I

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
the design at least as it shipped I

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.420 
the design at least as it shipped I
think<00:04:23.160> new<00:04:23.460> these<00:04:23.490> retailed<00:04:24.210> for<00:04:24.950> 279<00:04:25.950> dollars

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
think new these retailed for 279 dollars

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.770 
think new these retailed for 279 dollars
that<00:04:26.700> was<00:04:26.820> what<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:26.970> price<00:04:27.240> was<00:04:27.389> during<00:04:27.660> their

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
that was what the price was during their

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.370 
that was what the price was during their
Kickstarter<00:04:28.290> campaign<00:04:29.480> lots<00:04:30.480> of<00:04:30.660> delays<00:04:30.930> lots

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
Kickstarter campaign lots of delays lots

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.680 
Kickstarter campaign lots of delays lots
of<00:04:31.500> angry<00:04:31.650> people<00:04:31.950> that<00:04:32.760> didn't<00:04:33.030> get<00:04:33.150> them<00:04:33.419> and

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
of angry people that didn't get them and

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.540 
of angry people that didn't get them and
I<00:04:33.780> can<00:04:33.930> understand<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.680> if<00:04:35.070> I<00:04:35.190> got<00:04:35.370> this

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
I can understand it and if I got this

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.980 
I can understand it and if I got this
kid<00:04:35.820> after<00:04:36.000> paying<00:04:36.270> close<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.720> three<00:04:36.870> hundred

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
kid after paying close to three hundred

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.170 
kid after paying close to three hundred
dollars<00:04:37.410> so<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.280> assemble<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.669> myself<00:04:39.030> even

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
dollars so to assemble it myself even

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
dollars so to assemble it myself even
though<00:04:39.270> it's<00:04:39.450> almost<00:04:39.600> like<00:04:39.780> a<00:04:39.810> puzzle<00:04:40.020> with

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
though it's almost like a puzzle with

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.650 
though it's almost like a puzzle with
these<00:04:40.440> cutouts<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:41.330> don't<00:04:42.330> think<00:04:42.360> I'd<00:04:42.540> be

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
these cutouts I don't think I'd be

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.969 
these cutouts I don't think I'd be
really<00:04:42.870> really<00:04:43.320> thrilled<00:04:43.620> about<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:43.860> either

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
really really thrilled about it either

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.100 
really really thrilled about it either
at<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.490> 200<00:04:45.090> price<00:04:45.419> point<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:45.750> think<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:45.930> can

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
at the 200 price point I think I can

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.100 
at the 200 price point I think I can
work<00:04:46.200> with<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:46.729> but<00:04:47.729> i<00:04:47.760> know<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:48.120> for<00:04:48.540> 350

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
work with it but i know that for 350

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.330 
work with it but i know that for 350
there's<00:04:49.290> kits<00:04:49.560> out<00:04:49.680> there<00:04:49.889> because<00:04:49.979> i<00:04:50.130> built

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
there's kits out there because i built

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.830 
there's kits out there because i built
ones<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.910> are<00:04:51.120> of<00:04:51.389> much<00:04:51.540> higher<00:04:51.720> quality

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
ones that are of much higher quality

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.340 
ones that are of much higher quality
with<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.500> lot<00:04:52.740> of<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.919> bells<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:53.220> whistles<00:04:54.350> so

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
with a lot of the bells and whistles so

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.770 
with a lot of the bells and whistles so
again<00:04:55.590> this<00:04:55.650> is<00:04:55.800> just<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:55.979> play<00:04:56.130> with<00:04:56.340> but

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
again this is just to play with but

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.000 
again this is just to play with but
giving<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.840> guys<00:04:57.990> a<00:04:58.020> heads<00:04:58.320> up<00:04:58.500> as<00:04:58.710> to<00:04:58.770> what

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
giving you guys a heads up as to what

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.850 
giving you guys a heads up as to what
you'd<00:04:59.130> be<00:04:59.280> up<00:04:59.370> against<00:05:00.350> print<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.440> upgrades

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
you'd be up against print the upgrades

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.260 
you'd be up against print the upgrades
if<00:05:02.130> you<00:05:02.250> haven't<00:05:02.550> already<00:05:02.580> if<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:02.910> got<00:05:03.060> one<00:05:03.240> of

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
if you haven't already if you got one of

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.330 
if you haven't already if you got one of
these<00:05:03.389> know<00:05:03.630> it's<00:05:03.780> coming<00:05:03.960> print<00:05:04.860> them<00:05:05.010> find<00:05:05.280> a

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
these know it's coming print them find a

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.659 
these know it's coming print them find a
buddy<00:05:05.520> whatever<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:07.800> far<00:05:08.010> so<00:05:08.190> good<00:05:09.050> quite<00:05:10.050> I

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
buddy whatever so far so good quite I

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.340 
buddy whatever so far so good quite I
mean<00:05:11.669> I<00:05:11.700> think<00:05:11.729> it's<00:05:11.940> due<00:05:12.300> to<00:05:12.419> shrinkage<00:05:12.570> in<00:05:13.110> my

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
mean I think it's due to shrinkage in my

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.020 
mean I think it's due to shrinkage in my
PLA<00:05:13.890> and<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.250> made<00:05:14.430> some<00:05:14.640> of<00:05:14.700> these<00:05:14.760> out<00:05:14.910> of

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
PLA and I made some of these out of

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.100 
PLA and I made some of these out of
quite<00:05:15.930> tight<00:05:16.229> tolerances<00:05:17.840> things<00:05:18.840> really

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
quite tight tolerances things really

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.590 
quite tight tolerances things really
have<00:05:19.380> to<00:05:19.530> slightly<00:05:20.220> be<00:05:20.460> forced<00:05:20.820> in<00:05:21.000> but<00:05:21.360> they

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
have to slightly be forced in but they

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.370 
have to slightly be forced in but they
fit<00:05:21.930> nice<00:05:22.140> and<00:05:22.169> tight<00:05:22.410> and<00:05:22.880> it's<00:05:23.880> pretty

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
fit nice and tight and it's pretty

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.430 
fit nice and tight and it's pretty
pretty<00:05:25.380> good<00:05:25.590> i<00:05:25.830> will<00:05:26.610> say<00:05:26.940> also<00:05:27.150> that<00:05:27.440> during

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
pretty good i will say also that during

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.110 
pretty good i will say also that during
the<00:05:28.919> original<00:05:29.100> build<00:05:29.520> if<00:05:29.700> you<00:05:29.760> look<00:05:29.880> at<00:05:30.000> the

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
the original build if you look at the

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.430 
the original build if you look at the
original<00:05:30.360> instructions<00:05:30.840> for<00:05:31.139> this<00:05:31.200> thing<00:05:31.410> and

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
original instructions for this thing and

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.550 
original instructions for this thing and

build<00:05:36.090> a<00:05:36.210> printer<00:05:36.570> i<00:05:36.750> don't<00:05:37.139> care<00:05:37.260> if<00:05:37.320> it's

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
build a printer i don't care if it's

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.180 
build a printer i don't care if it's
wood<00:05:37.680> or<00:05:37.800> otherwise<00:05:38.100> i<00:05:38.400> know<00:05:38.729> the

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
wood or otherwise i know the

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.040 
wood or otherwise i know the
we<00:05:39.340> screw<00:05:39.610> is<00:05:39.790> super<00:05:40.150> glued<00:05:40.330> to<00:05:40.600> the<00:05:40.810> motor

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
we screw is super glued to the motor

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.080 
we screw is super glued to the motor
that<00:05:41.380> could<00:05:42.160> be<00:05:42.250> problematic<00:05:42.400> should<00:05:43.000> the

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
that could be problematic should the

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.780 
that could be problematic should the
motor<00:05:43.630> burn<00:05:43.870> up<00:05:44.050> I<00:05:44.350> probably<00:05:45.100> can<00:05:45.370> separate

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
motor burn up I probably can separate

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.850 
motor burn up I probably can separate
that<00:05:45.820> and<00:05:46.210> they<00:05:46.300> do<00:05:46.360> make<00:05:46.720> some<00:05:46.960> extensions

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
that and they do make some extensions

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.120 
that and they do make some extensions
than<00:05:48.340> also<00:05:49.000> allow<00:05:49.240> for<00:05:49.480> a<00:05:49.510> support<00:05:50.080> up<00:05:50.320> top<00:05:50.590> so

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
than also allow for a support up top so

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.100 
than also allow for a support up top so
that<00:05:51.160> there's<00:05:51.550> less<00:05:51.820> wiggle<00:05:52.660> even<00:05:53.020> though

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
that there's less wiggle even though

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.690 
that there's less wiggle even though
it's<00:05:53.200> really<00:05:53.380> not<00:05:53.470> much<00:05:53.620> wiggle<00:05:53.860> on<00:05:54.040> this<00:05:54.520> one

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
it's really not much wiggle on this one

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.570 
it's really not much wiggle on this one
but<00:05:55.600> you<00:05:56.080> know<00:05:56.170> rigidity<00:05:56.740> you're<00:05:56.980> trying<00:05:57.280> to

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
but you know rigidity you're trying to

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.580 
but you know rigidity you're trying to
avoid<00:05:58.920> this<00:06:01.170> printers<00:06:02.170> aren't<00:06:02.320> supposed<00:06:02.530> to

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
avoid this printers aren't supposed to

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.570 
avoid this printers aren't supposed to
do<00:06:02.710> that<00:06:02.740> if<00:06:02.980> they're<00:06:03.130> supposed<00:06:03.370> to<00:06:03.430> be

do that if they're supposed to be

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.760 
do that if they're supposed to be
accurate<00:06:04.300> so<00:06:04.990> this<00:06:05.110> might<00:06:05.290> be<00:06:05.320> one<00:06:05.590> that

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
accurate so this might be one that

accurate so this might be one that
