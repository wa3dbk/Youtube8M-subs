00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:06.240
 daniela has already adopted several animal victims 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.760
 of abandonment but says that he had never 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.219
 seen such cruelty I found 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.070
 this cat on the uespi campus was 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.199
 giving a can stuck in the tar was a 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.699
 scene of despair when everyone saw 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.380
 will die because no one can take away 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.140
 from within he is not trapped and the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.000
 image was really shocking when it was 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.640
 found on the campus of 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.460
 teresina only the head of the kitten does not 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.800
 was submerged in the asphalt sludge being 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.910
 impossible to rescue it without the help of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.250
 professionals 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.380
 the animal was taken to a clinic and the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.570
 fire department was fired 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.660
 the lada had to be carefully 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.559
 cut and the animal could finally be 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.480
 rescued 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.629
 professionals have already been able to withdraw 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.469
 about 70% of the body substance of the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.120
 cat 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.489
 the veterinarian said that it is 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.920
 practically impossible for the animal to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.440
 has entered the can because cats do not 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.230
 smells are strong and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.930
 would not have fallen without reaching the head 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.600
 the situation of the kitten is still delicate and 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.549
 he is at risk of life still because this 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.380
 substance can be absorbed through the skin 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.720
 the skin is very sensitive in addition is a 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.549
 puppy must have become intoxicated then 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.049
 is doing the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.240
 detoxification 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.119
 from the moment he was rescued was 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.490
 made of asphalt mixture withdrawn 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.920
 given a bath in him the cruelty against 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.750
 domestic animals and wild animals 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.869
 repeats in different Brazilian states 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.950
 and there are still no strict laws to 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.750
 protect the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.270
 impunity in cases of ill-treatment 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.759
