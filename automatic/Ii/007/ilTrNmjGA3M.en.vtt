bigger beast 70 litres and you can
imagine<00:00:35.620> it<00:00:35.739> may<00:00:35.920> be<00:00:35.980> too<00:00:36.160> big<00:00:36.340> for<00:00:36.520> some<00:00:36.850> of

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
imagine it may be too big for some of

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.440 
imagine it may be too big for some of
the<00:00:37.000> backpackers<00:00:37.540> and<00:00:38.340> however<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:40.270> really

the backpackers and however the really

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.270 
the backpackers and however the really

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
interesting thing about this bag is that

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.510 
interesting thing about this bag is that
it<00:00:42.700> uses<00:00:43.180> outdrive<00:00:43.810> technology<00:00:44.470> now<00:00:45.040> outdoor

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
it uses outdrive technology now outdoor

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.590 
it uses outdrive technology now outdoor
something<00:00:45.850> that<00:00:45.970> we've<00:00:46.090> been<00:00:46.210> following<00:00:46.480> for

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
something that we've been following for

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.260 
something that we've been following for
a<00:00:46.810> while<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.320> works<00:00:47.530> really<00:00:47.890> well<00:00:48.040> on<00:00:48.489> gloves

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
a while it works really well on gloves

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.930 
a while it works really well on gloves
and<00:00:49.570> shoes<00:00:50.350> and<00:00:50.649> it's<00:00:51.340> a<00:00:51.399> watch<00:00:51.550> bridging

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
and shoes and it's a watch bridging

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.330 
and shoes and it's a watch bridging
technology<00:00:52.090> it's<00:00:52.930> not<00:00:53.020> a<00:00:53.320> membrane<00:00:53.890> but<00:00:54.190> it's

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
technology it's not a membrane but it's

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.790 
technology it's not a membrane but it's
the<00:00:54.430> way<00:00:54.520> that<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.730> membrane<00:00:55.120> is<00:00:55.300> attached<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
the way that a membrane is attached to

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.310 
the way that a membrane is attached to
the<00:00:57.190> outer<00:00:57.399> material<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.719> it's<00:00:58.870> a<00:00:58.899> lamination

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
the outer material so it's a lamination

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.470 
the outer material so it's a lamination
process<00:00:59.700> what<00:01:00.700> that<00:01:00.820> means<00:01:01.030> in<00:01:01.210> shoes<00:01:01.450> and

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
process what that means in shoes and

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.630 
process what that means in shoes and
gloves<00:01:01.809> is<00:01:02.050> that<00:01:02.230> you<00:01:02.379> don't<00:01:02.559> need<00:01:02.770> waterproof

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
gloves is that you don't need waterproof

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.359 
gloves is that you don't need waterproof
boots<00:01:04.149> on<00:01:04.509> the<00:01:04.659> inside<00:01:04.989> you<00:01:05.619> can<00:01:05.799> laminate<00:01:06.219> the

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
boots on the inside you can laminate the

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.449 
boots on the inside you can laminate the
waterproof<00:01:07.109> membranes<00:01:08.109> are<00:01:08.350> regular<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.369> the

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:09.459 
waterproof membranes are regular to the

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:11.999 
waterproof membranes are regular to the
material<00:01:10.109> now<00:01:11.109> we've<00:01:11.380> been<00:01:11.499> waiting<00:01:11.770> for<00:01:11.950> this

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
material now we've been waiting for this

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.059 
material now we've been waiting for this
year<00:01:12.219> in<00:01:12.399> backpacks<00:01:12.729> and<00:01:13.950> obviously<00:01:14.950> if

year in backpacks and obviously if
you're<00:01:15.219> going<00:01:15.369> to<00:01:15.490> do<00:01:15.579> is<00:01:15.700> about<00:01:15.880> regulating

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:16.209 
you're going to do is about regulating

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:19.469 
you're going to do is about regulating
kind<00:01:16.600> of<00:01:16.659> an<00:01:16.749> inner<00:01:17.109> as<00:01:18.009> well<00:01:18.340> now<00:01:18.969> what<00:01:19.299> out

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
kind of an inner as well now what out

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.239 
kind of an inner as well now what out
dry<00:01:19.689> allows<00:01:19.929> you<00:01:20.109> to<00:01:20.259> do<00:01:20.409> is<00:01:20.560> eliminate<00:01:20.829> the

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
dry allows you to do is eliminate the

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:23.249 
dry allows you to do is eliminate the
possibilities<00:01:21.880> of<00:01:21.999> that<00:01:22.149> not<00:01:22.929> being<00:01:23.079> done

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
possibilities of that not being done

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.480 
possibilities of that not being done
before<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.859> and<00:01:24.429> make<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.659> true<00:01:26.499> nylon<00:01:27.340> or

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
before and and make a true nylon or

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.959 
before and and make a true nylon or
polyester<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:28.920> out<00:01:29.920> of<00:01:30.249> it<00:01:30.399> is<00:01:30.520> completely

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
polyester and out of it is completely

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.399 
polyester and out of it is completely
waterproof<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:35.049> big<00:01:35.200> thing<00:01:35.229> about

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
waterproof and so the big thing about

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.429 
waterproof and so the big thing about
this<00:01:35.649> is<00:01:35.859> it<00:01:36.099> waterproof

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
this is it waterproof

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.929 
this is it waterproof
it<00:01:38.439> also<00:01:38.590> doesn't<00:01:38.889> add<00:01:39.009> any<00:01:39.159> weight<00:01:39.369> it's<00:01:39.789> the

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
it also doesn't add any weight it's the

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:40.739 
it also doesn't add any weight it's the
way<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.090> at<00:01:40.389> all

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:40.749 
way to at all

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:43.949 
way to at all

opening<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.680> also<00:02:29.950> pretty<00:02:30.160> good<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:31.090> uses<00:02:31.450> a

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
opening is also pretty good it uses a

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.000 
opening is also pretty good it uses a
very<00:02:31.720> simple<00:02:32.140> system<00:02:33.569> open<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.660> up<00:02:34.780> close<00:02:35.739> it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
very simple system open it up close it

up<00:02:36.160> incredibly<00:02:36.910> music<00:02:38.400> it's<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.430> big<00:02:39.549> old<00:02:39.700> space

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
up incredibly music it's a big old space

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.199 
up incredibly music it's a big old space
in<00:02:40.150> there<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:41.350> probably<00:02:41.709> could<00:02:41.860> have<00:02:41.890> done<00:02:42.209> the

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
in there it probably could have done the

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.110 
in there it probably could have done the
benefits<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.200> side<00:02:45.099> zip<00:02:45.400> or<00:02:45.670> something<00:02:46.030> like

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
benefits of side zip or something like

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.460 
benefits of side zip or something like
that<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.540> get<00:02:46.720> down<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.110> bottom<00:02:47.260> and

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
that just to get down to the bottom and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.170 
that just to get down to the bottom and
given<00:02:47.709> that<00:02:47.830> it<00:02:47.950> 70<00:02:48.370> later<00:02:48.549> in<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.000> do

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
given that it 70 later in this to do

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.240 
given that it 70 later in this to do
with<00:02:49.299> it<00:02:49.480> just<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.900> extra<00:02:50.250> accessibility

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
with it just that extra accessibility

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.089 
with it just that extra accessibility
and<00:02:51.580> but<00:02:52.180> that's<00:02:52.269> really<00:02:52.630> just<00:02:53.049> a<00:02:53.560> minor<00:02:53.950> flaw

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
and but that's really just a minor flaw

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.780 
and but that's really just a minor flaw
so<00:02:57.099> we'll<00:02:57.280> do<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.459> up<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:59.349> leash<00:02:59.530> is<00:03:00.130> easily

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
so we'll do it up the leash is easily

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.060

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
to go there's none of this playing

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.059
