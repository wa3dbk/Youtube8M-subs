anything else in game you can also just
leave<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.960> be<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.350> they<00:01:00.530> will<00:01:00.710> gradually

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
leave it be and they will gradually

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.720 
leave it be and they will gradually

determined by the quality of the plant
when<00:01:17.930> it<00:01:18.049> first<00:01:18.409> appears<00:01:18.860> in<00:01:19.040> game<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.729> doesn't

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
when it first appears in game it doesn't

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.440 
when it first appears in game it doesn't
scale<00:01:20.750> up<00:01:20.990> with<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.409> plant<00:01:21.680> evolution

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.740 

leveling<00:01:27.409> plants<00:01:27.830> up<00:01:27.950> takes<00:01:28.610> a<00:01:28.759> long<00:01:29.060> time<00:01:29.090> and

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
leveling plants up takes a long time and

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.539 
leveling plants up takes a long time and
there<00:01:30.049> are<00:01:30.170> ways<00:01:30.350> of<00:01:30.530> cutting<00:01:30.740> this<00:01:30.979> time<00:01:31.280> down

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
there are ways of cutting this time down

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.090 
there are ways of cutting this time down
if<00:01:31.880> you're<00:01:32.030> starting<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.420> new<00:01:32.600> plant<00:01:32.960> if<00:01:33.409> you

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
if you're starting a new plant if you

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.710 
if you're starting a new plant if you
start<00:01:34.369> off<00:01:34.490> with<00:01:34.549> normal<00:01:34.939> level<00:01:35.390> seeds

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
start off with normal level seeds

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.899 
start off with normal level seeds
straight<00:01:36.259> out<00:01:36.409> of<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:36.590> packet<00:01:37.040> plant<00:01:37.700> them

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
straight out of the packet plant them

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.570 
straight out of the packet plant them
take<00:01:38.240> care<00:01:38.509> of<00:01:38.689> them<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.220> eventually<00:01:40.220> evolve

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
take care of them and eventually evolve

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.120 
take care of them and eventually evolve
it<00:01:40.759> finally<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:41.869> will<00:01:41.960> reach<00:01:42.020> level<00:01:42.500> five<00:01:42.799> or

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
it finally it will reach level five or

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.999 
it finally it will reach level five or
become<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.399> great<00:01:43.759> plant<00:01:44.149> for<00:01:44.299> example<00:01:45.009> the

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
become a great plant for example the

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.520 
become a great plant for example the
harvest<00:01:46.460> from<00:01:46.610> this<00:01:46.880> plant<00:01:47.210> is<00:01:47.450> also<00:01:47.869> great<00:01:48.229> if

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
harvest from this plant is also great if

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.570 
harvest from this plant is also great if
you<00:01:49.220> then<00:01:49.399> decide<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:50.030> plant<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.930> crop<00:01:51.289> of

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
you then decide to plant the crop of

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.330 
you then decide to plant the crop of
this<00:01:52.580> plant<00:01:52.970> it<00:01:53.479> too<00:01:53.539> will<00:01:54.320> be<00:01:54.439> great<00:01:54.680> not

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
this plant it too will be great not

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.450 
this plant it too will be great not
normal<00:01:56.170> so<00:01:57.170> in<00:01:57.320> essence<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:58.070> can<00:01:58.280> utilize

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
normal so in essence you can utilize

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.940 
normal so in essence you can utilize
grafting<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.750> assist<00:02:00.110> with<00:02:00.319> leveling<00:02:00.770> and

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
grafting to assist with leveling and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.059 
grafting to assist with leveling and
maintain<00:02:01.700> your<00:02:01.850> gardens<00:02:02.270> level<00:02:02.679> so<00:02:03.679> you<00:02:03.800> can

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
maintain your gardens level so you can

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.109 
maintain your gardens level so you can
use<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.460> level<00:02:04.759> five<00:02:05.330> carrot<00:02:06.640> with<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.670> normal

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
use a level five carrot with a normal

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.350 
use a level five carrot with a normal
level<00:02:08.299> graft<00:02:09.259> on<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.830> lemon<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:10.789> you've<00:02:11.060> just

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
level graft on a lemon that you've just

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.259 
level graft on a lemon that you've just
found<00:02:11.739> harvest<00:02:12.739> and<00:02:12.980> you'll<00:02:13.130> have<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.580> level

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
found harvest and you'll have to level
