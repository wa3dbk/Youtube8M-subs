Spectre<00:02:17.099> figure<00:02:18.680> she's<00:02:19.680> pretty<00:02:20.099> hard<00:02:20.310> to

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
Spectre figure she's pretty hard to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.410 
Spectre figure she's pretty hard to
stand<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.950> material<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.030> she's<00:02:24.150> made<00:02:24.300> it

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
stand the material that she's made it

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.960 
stand the material that she's made it
was<00:02:24.510> hard<00:02:24.720> plastic<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.380> well<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.489> kind<00:02:26.940> of

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
was hard plastic as well so as I kind of

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.750 
was hard plastic as well so as I kind of
was<00:02:27.390> surprised<00:02:27.780> by<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:29.190> thought<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.700> was

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
was surprised by that I thought I was

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.580 
was surprised by that I thought I was
going<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.209> be<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> softer<00:02:30.840> more<00:02:31.260> pliable

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
going to be a softer more pliable

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.510 
going to be a softer more pliable
plastic<00:02:34.970> but<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.720> know<00:02:36.870> she<00:02:37.230> makes<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.470> good

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
plastic but you know she makes a good

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.580 
plastic but you know she makes a good
display<00:02:38.520> piece<00:02:38.819> as<00:02:39.030> well<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:40.940> there<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.590> toy

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
display piece as well so there is a toy

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.400 
display piece as well so there is a toy
coming<00:02:44.040> out<00:02:44.190> from<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.599> think<00:02:46.050> Sideshow

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
coming out from I think Sideshow

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.050 
coming out from I think Sideshow

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
Collectibles is importing it a 12 inch

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
Collectibles is importing it a 12 inch
figure<00:02:51.360> where<00:02:51.870> she's<00:02:52.230> got<00:02:52.640> articulation<00:02:53.640> and

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
figure where she's got articulation and

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.290 
figure where she's got articulation and
the<00:02:55.080> hair<00:02:55.379> is<00:02:55.620> like<00:02:55.830> made<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.430> actual<00:02:56.640> fibers

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
the hair is like made of actual fibers

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.560 
the hair is like made of actual fibers
so<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.959> resembled<00:02:58.560> real<00:02:58.709> hair<00:02:59.390> of<00:03:00.390> course
