00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.070
 Dr.. James Grimm: We made a video 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.850
 You've done it some time ago about the initial Mersenne numbers 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.220
 And improvising, off the cuff, I said 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.040
 That 1 is not an initial number 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.500
 Now, to be frank, we are not saying that 1 is an initial number 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.920
 There is a special reason for that 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.520
 We noticed that some people in the comments said 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.050
 Well, I think I heard of this before, but why it? 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.580
 Why not 1 initial number? 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.610
 So what are the prime numbers? 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.970
 Let's think about the definition 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.530
 You may know the definition 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.430
 The initial number is the number which can only be divided by 1 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.550
 And on himself 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.480
 So the prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.890
 You know these numbers 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.690
 So it seems that 1 must be an initial number, right? 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.070
 It corresponds to the definition of the initial number 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.930
 You can divide by 1, and you can divide by 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.440
 On the same is 1. 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.420
 Historically, it was considered an initial number 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.750
 So if you're thinking, hmmm, it sounds like it should be 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.390
 Well, that's what they used to think about 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.490
 This is what mathematicians used to think as well. 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.260
 But in the end, they had to rule it out 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.590
 Of prime numbers 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.580
 Oh something unfortunate 1, 1 is the most unit number 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.390
 The number is the most unit at all 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.420
 It is therefore excluded for a particular reason 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.950
 There is a really important theory in mathematics 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.450
 It is called the basic theory of arithmetic 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.320
 Now, there is a view that says every positive number can be 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.780
 Written as a product by multiplying the initial numbers. 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.550
 Even here 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.800
 I did not want to write it out, so here it is 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.120
 Each positive integer, or integer, if you like, 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.510
 Can be written as a unique product of primes 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.530
 Where you can say this important theory because it 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.610
 Contains a name 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.150
 And you can say it's a very important theory because it is 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.330
 Contains a flamboyant name 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.670
 What this means is that the prime numbers are our atoms, like 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.050
 Atoms in chemistry. 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.600
 It can be used to make other numbers hit arithmetically 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.100
 These initial numbers together 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.116
 For example, 15 is 3 times 5 

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:10.850
 5 and 3 are preliminary numbers 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.970
 You can make 15 of the multiplication numbers together. 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.720
 But there is a very important word here in this theory 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.440
 Look at this word, unique 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.020
 Now this is not just for decoration 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.490
 Each word is important, unique 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.830
 It must be a unique product 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.670
 There is only one way to do this. 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.050
 Now we know, of course, that 15 is also 5 times 3. 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.610
 We do not keep in mind that this is permitted 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.760
 We do not mind it 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.980
 What we do not like is that 15 is 1 times 3 times 5 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.600
 Not only that, it is also 1 times 1 times 3 times 5. 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.860
 And it's 1 times 1 times 1 times 3 times 5 and so on. 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.280
 If the initial one, then we will not have a unique way 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.290
 To write 15 as a product of prime numbers 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.950
 So this meant, when they thought it was 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.490
 Primarily, they had to keep 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.130
 To exclude 1 of your theories. 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.750
 You'll have to keep your say, take all the initial numbers, 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.420
 Except 1. 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.560
 We have been tired of doing so 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.200
 So we decided to just exclude 1 of our definition of prime numbers 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.840
 Initially 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.060
 So 1 is not an initial number 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.510
 It is not considered a composite number, where you can 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.100
 Make other numbers of prime numbers 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.490
 No, they class everyone on their own, where they sit, 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.940
 Alone in everything by himself. 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.720
 Brady Haran: But why does that mean that 1 is not an initial number? 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.460
 Maybe it's just a stupid theory 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.540
 Perhaps not a good theory. 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.500
 Why did the theory overcome figure 1? 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.160
 Dr.. James Grimm: We have a choice 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.470
 For inclusion in this category 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.990
 If we want to. 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.220
 Primaries are just a word, it's just a class 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.150
 And it's more useful for us to say, take this list, 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.660
 Which is the list of all prime numbers 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.050
 And it does not have 1 on it 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.470
 More useful to say it, take this list. 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.020
 The list is 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, chat. 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.930
 Brady Haran: Given that theory, it does not mean that 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.543
 That 1 is not a whole number because 1, definitely 1 can not be 

00:04:19.543 --> 00:04:21.209
 As a unique composition of primes? 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.140
 Dr.. James Grimm: OK. Well, let's take a look. 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.225
 Let's take-- 

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:27.080
 I will start with 16 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.610
 16 is the product of prime numbers because it is 2 times 2 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.270
 Times 2 times. 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.500
 It's four primes 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.980
 8 is the product of prime numbers 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.200
 It's 2 times 2 times 2 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.190
 So I've only divided by 2 there 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.160
 4 is the product of two primes 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.060
 Figure 2, initial number 2, is the product number 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.710
 Only one primer 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.830
 Then if you divide by 2 again, I get 1, which is 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.770
 The result of zero primary figures 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.360
 It's called an empty product 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.840
 So we have a product of 4 primary, 3 primary, 2 primary, 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.970
 Continue the pattern, initial 1, and 0 initial 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.550
 It's 1, and it's not 0 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.390
 It's 1, it's called an empty product 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.730
 Oh, this will not be for number 1 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.800
 We will hear from figure 1 again soon, I'm sure. 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.050
