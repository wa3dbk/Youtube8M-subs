00:00:16.100 --> 00:01:01.170
 ok thanks she is insanely beautiful and 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.229
 kindness and love 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.540
 Well, she probably just we are very different 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.150
 but I think it's okay because everything is in it 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.490
 the world is different all nationalities are not 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.520
 unique in 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.439
 one price but oddly enough for all 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.570
 human history we have shown little 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.399
 humanity 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.229
 cruel war colossal loss 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.000
 to nature 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.759
 slavery and indeed I think people 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.680
 have ceased to develop we stuff 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.130
 unnecessary information on TV 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.020
 advertising creates the illusion of positive 85 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.539
 percent of the global network a couple of many 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.429
 Now it feels like to 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.649
 girl specifically waiting for positive 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.159
 pregnancy outcome to go out 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.009
 get married 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.670
 and generally who do not know now 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.770
 the team is important that you have a job 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.119
 apartment car well and apparently a little bit 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.500
 now every man has his 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.170
 wardrobe different mask all policies in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.600
 first of all in their eyes we just 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.039
 mortal to some extent they are probably 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.410
 considers himself to be masons 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.940
 who are allowed to manage global 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:19.549
 problems come up and between people now 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.549
 sleep and I try to wake them 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.169
 overview 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.909
 this is my favorite place in the city exactly 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.400
 here people put themselves under such 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.919
 what they are not even 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:03.370
 show they just in a hurry forget 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.370
 pretend to be beautiful here especially the ball 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.570
 so strange 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.830
 just recently it seems was a day shook 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.830
 you look already night 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:20.010
 if I have the same system 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.270
 A friend of our relationship comes marriage and I 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:26.880
 I can't even say what I love and can 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:31.170
 make fun of her dimples or 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.680
 just say how beautiful she is today I 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.680
 see myself 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:12.020
 I think the main thing in this world should be 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.750
 a man who loves you sincerely i 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.720
 born with a speech defect 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.910
 but thanks to street art 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.150
 I can bring my thought to each of 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.150
 you 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:56.389
 and we just shoot a movie
