00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.480
 how are they I told you that 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.820
 a jeans shirt can serve them 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.860
 for many different looks we can 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.019
 use it and reuse it during the morning 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.029
 during the afternoon and until the night 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.650
 Today I made four ideal looks for 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.170
 combine in many different ways 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.170
 his same jeans shirt let's see them 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.950
 throughout this program they will see 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.990
 many styles of blues and you're the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.880
 joke is that you have any of 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.230
 these and adopt it with 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.200
 different looks we will see from 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.810
 strong claritas that are tied cortitas 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.640
 All the looks can be done 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.620
 with which you have this is a very 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.250
 simple is the first ideal for the 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.199
 warmth you put on the new to blue 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.720
 quote the rings of jeans with ones 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.430
 jeans or colored jeans can 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.550
 be of any color can be blue 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.110
 green orange I wanted them to be red 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.369
 I really like a red and 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.060
 contrast that makes blue with red 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.009
 also the shoes let them in red are 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.830
 the plastic shoes have a bow tie 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.020
 they are pretty flirty ideal for 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.300
 heat to walk a lot to show off 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.490
 during the afternoon or during the morning 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.910
 It could also be a good option as 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.860
 Accessories I have some bracelets I have 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.680
 three bracelets in different color that go 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.360
 very well with each other we want to put a 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.640
 little more glamor to this look since 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.259
 It is very simple also a ring the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.150
 rings can be huge as well 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.050
 we talked about the huge necklaces the 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.990
 rings also look for 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.760
 that are rough that are finally noticeable 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.160
 the bag the bag I wanted it to be in a 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.140
 sober color no longer so striking very 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.040
 casual that I fit many things for 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.040
 use during the afternoon 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.240
 this is the most father option to use 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.150
 your shirt jeans because because 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.700
 let's mix two shades of jeans your 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.729
 Favorite jeans can be I do not know clearly 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.750
 dark, broken, washed, very, very strong 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.120
 with an equal shirt this can be 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.040
 dark light I wanted to make a contrast 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.780
 these are not too dark and the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.610
 shirt is too light then it looks 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.320
 very very father could also opt for 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.880
 very dark at the bottom and 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.130
 pretty clear on top or 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.690
 they may even seem to look like 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.030
 even the same and it will look amazing 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.040
 I wanted to make it very casual I'm going to walk 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.480
 during the whole afternoon surely with 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.550
 this look and I'll walk up and down 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.860
 I want to feel comfortable relaxed but 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.840
 is still looking very chic then I picked 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.530
 boots with animal print 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.750
 prints are already where the 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.480
 attention the eyes are going to go towards my 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.610
 boots also picked a necklace a 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.290
 Gold-tone necklace is a long necklace 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.540
 the long necklaces then in see us 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.090
 as much more stylized a trunk 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.580
 much longer then you have to opt 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.620
 also for long necklaces and finally 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.540
 The bag is a small bag 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.510
 but in this bag it's kind of about 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.879
 then I can get a lot of things I 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.640
 to be able to put and do not know wallets 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:14.260
 make-up of a whole little bit and be 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.260
 comfortable and comfortable all day 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.500
 this look is super cool ideal if you're 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.600
 somewhere where there is a lot of heat or 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.450
 if it's hot you could use this option 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.380
 with your favorite jeans blouse is this 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.560
 love because he has shoulders 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.790
 discovered we're going to see this kind of 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.340
 openings in different parts of 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.100
 shirts up to pants dare you 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.080
 use it they look very good shorts 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.940
 they could also be denim could 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.100
 be of any color I wanted that 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.230
 it was a striking color like this coral 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.630
 I've also seen them all broken 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.430
 very parents those who have their 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.850
 legs with short shorts and 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.580
 cute sandals are very comfortable 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.710
 sounded for the warm weather that we're 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.030
 looking for there are a little detail in 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.930
 golden that makes them a little more 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.210
 glamorous ideals to walk around 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.240
 very very casual as accessories only 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:11.000
 I'm using this collar in a neon tone 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.120
 long necklace a very very discreet necklace 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.830
 at the same time very cool contrasts the color of 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.900
 the shorts with the necklace that are 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.239
 different but they do as a harmony 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.329
 very very pretty and a big bag during 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.460
 the iii during the 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.879
 we opted for this type of large bags 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.000
 because we like to put the ipod on the ipad 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:32.400
 of all our makeup notebooks 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.810
 I here I bring everything a little then 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.729
 this type of bags will serve us 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.729
 very much for these looks 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.650
 We can also use denim 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.230
 during the night you have to put a 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.390
 sober color for example this shirt 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.340
 I'm using is very flirtatious 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.410
 you can use it at the height of 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.110
 waist I do not recommend that you teach 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.850
 much my stomach would I choose 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.500
 a cut at the waist that makes us 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.780
 always much better body like this 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.440
 skirt this skirt has transparencies 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.330
 it has flown it is vaporous gauze is 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.340
 very very rich to go out at night in 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.020
 any type of weather may be 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.030
 doing a little bit more cold or until 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.710
 heat also has some shorts 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.630
 integrated because it's transparent 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.800
 then it 's perfect we're not going to have 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.050
 no problem 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.870
 the shoes I wanted to put another touch of 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.610
 denim in shoes a color almost 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.930
 equal to the denim I'm wearing in 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.880
 the top part and if it was a little 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.190
 different these shoes would not happen 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.950
 they are very characteristic because they have 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.750
 this but they have rhinestones they have 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.420
 many very striking things that make 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.420
 this look very very ideal father like 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.490
 we talked for the night and finally 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.440
 a bag this bag is small is 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.790
 discrete has glimpses we platicÃ¡bamos 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.289
 that during the night 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.529
 you have to use shine you have to 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.689
 bright colors and as an accessory only 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.610
 a necklace a large necklace a necklace that 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:56.199
 call attention and make this 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.199
 look something a little more glamorous 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.700

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.010
