00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
however I won't really be playing for

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.170

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.650 
wins I'll be playing for sure Matt goals
so<00:00:45.420> expect<00:00:46.230> quite<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.500> few<00:00:46.710> losses<00:00:47.329> anyway<00:00:48.329> but

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
so expect quite a few losses anyway but

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.180 
so expect quite a few losses anyway but
like<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.440> get<00:00:49.559> some<00:00:49.620> wins<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.070> would

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
like if we can get some wins that would

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.100 
like if we can get some wins that would
of<00:00:50.280> course<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.579> nice<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.690> very<00:00:51.870> first

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
this isn't going to be easy because he

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.279 
this isn't going to be easy because he
has<00:00:59.430> got<00:00:59.609> terrible<00:01:00.030> stats<00:01:00.329> are<00:01:00.510> basically<00:01:00.840> my

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
has got terrible stats are basically my

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.900 
has got terrible stats are basically my
only<00:01:01.440> hope<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.100> cross<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.550> which<00:01:02.730> was

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
only hope is to cross it in which was

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.880 
only hope is to cross it in which was
why<00:01:03.090> i<00:01:03.120> played<00:01:03.420> four<00:01:03.660> three<00:01:03.870> two<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.080> would

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
why i played four three two one would

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.200 
why i played four three two one would
have<00:01:04.979> gone<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.250> four<00:01:05.400> free<00:01:05.580> free<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.030> was

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
have gone for four free free but it was

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.910 
have gone for four free free but it was
more<00:01:06.420> expensive<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.470> i'm<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.830> be

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
more expensive so i'm going to be

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.679 
more expensive so i'm going to be
putting<00:01:08.070> him<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.369> every<00:01:08.729> free<00:01:09.000> kick<00:01:09.240> every

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
putting him on every free kick every

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.420 
putting him on every free kick every
penalty<00:01:10.200> everything<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> try<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.310> get

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
penalty everything just to try and get

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.520 
penalty everything just to try and get
goes<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:12.090> quick<00:01:12.390> as<00:01:12.540> i<00:01:12.600> possibly<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.409> him

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
goes as quick as i possibly can with him

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.260 
goes as quick as i possibly can with him
now<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> did<00:01:14.100> previously<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.880> series

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
now I did previously have this series

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.910 
now I did previously have this series
planned<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> different<00:01:16.380> player<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:16.830> I

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
planned to do a different player but I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
planned to do a different player but I
think<00:01:17.130> when<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> terrible<00:01:18.210> player<00:01:18.570> or

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
think when you have a terrible player or

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.840 
think when you have a terrible player or
a<00:01:18.840> player<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.140> isn't<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.680> good<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.220> makes<00:01:20.490> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
a player that isn't so good it makes it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.399 
a player that isn't so good it makes it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
point so it was going to be a little bit

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.389 
point so it was going to be a little bit
easier<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.350> went<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> second<00:02:02.070> game<00:02:02.189> and

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
an SPL team there and it isn't too great

the
or<00:02:14.010> time<00:02:14.460> up<00:02:14.700> until<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.300> really<00:02:15.780> close<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140

or time up until like really close to
the<00:02:16.230> end<00:02:16.350> but<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.980> managed<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.370> take<00:02:17.580> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
the end but you managed to take the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.640 
the end but you managed to take the
one-nil<00:02:18.150> lead<00:02:18.180> with<00:02:18.540> gary<00:02:18.780> hooper<00:02:18.960> just<00:02:19.290> 14

minutes in i did then equalize from a
corner<00:02:22.500> which<00:02:22.710> was<00:02:22.830> very<00:02:23.040> very<00:02:23.160> nice<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.700> you

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
corner which was very very nice and you

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.060

his players oblivious and our dough

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.290 
his players oblivious and our dough

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
that's it and he managed to make it 2-1

that's it and he managed to make it 2-1
for<00:02:42.600> them<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.200> was<00:02:43.620> determined<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:44.280> wanted

eight on the 45th minute and I was
starting<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.710> get<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.920> feeling<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.280> was<00:03:53.310> gonna

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
starting to get the feeling it was gonna

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.250 
starting to get the feeling it was gonna
be<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.670> same<00:03:53.910> as<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.120> previous<00:03:54.390> game<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:55.050> I

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
be the same as the previous game like I

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.020 
be the same as the previous game like I
think<00:03:55.680> I've<00:03:55.770> only<00:03:55.920> had<00:03:56.010> four<00:03:56.310> losses<00:03:56.550> on<00:03:56.850> this

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
think I've only had four losses on this

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.750 
think I've only had four losses on this
now<00:03:57.240> and<00:03:57.830> it<00:03:58.830> seemed<00:03:59.070> to<00:03:59.130> mainly<00:03:59.400> be<00:03:59.550> when<00:03:59.730> i

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
now and it seemed to mainly be when i

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.000 
now and it seemed to mainly be when i
