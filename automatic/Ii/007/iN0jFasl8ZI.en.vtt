identity series acoustic now this may
look<00:00:17.340> sort<00:00:18.340> of<00:00:18.400> like<00:00:18.460> a<00:00:18.580> graphite<00:00:19.090> looking

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
look sort of like a graphite looking

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.710 
look sort of like a graphite looking
acoustic<00:00:19.869> but<00:00:20.050> it's<00:00:20.170> not<00:00:20.320> it's<00:00:20.529> all<00:00:20.740> wood<00:00:20.980> and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
acoustic but it's not it's all wood and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.960 
acoustic but it's not it's all wood and
of<00:00:22.720> course<00:00:22.990> it's<00:00:23.500> got<00:00:23.770> a<00:00:23.980> great<00:00:24.400> innovative

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
of course it's got a great innovative

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.060 
of course it's got a great innovative
design<00:00:25.480> and<00:00:25.869> there's<00:00:26.230> a<00:00:26.290> lot<00:00:26.500> of<00:00:26.650> thought<00:00:26.829> went

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
design and there's a lot of thought went

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.979 
design and there's a lot of thought went
into<00:00:27.130> this<00:00:27.400> guitar<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:27.970> it<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.419> me<00:00:28.630> this<00:00:28.840> is

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
into this guitar and it to me this is

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.290 
into this guitar and it to me this is
just<00:00:29.020> a<00:00:29.320> great<00:00:29.680> guitar<00:00:30.550> to<00:00:30.640> play<00:00:30.820> out<00:00:31.000> live

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
just a great guitar to play out live

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.550 
just a great guitar to play out live
with<00:00:32.700> let's<00:00:33.700> start<00:00:34.030> with<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:35.020> look<00:00:35.320> of<00:00:35.440> the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
with let's start with the look of the

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.549 
with let's start with the look of the
guitar<00:00:35.649> the<00:00:36.070> first<00:00:36.340> thing<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.610> may<00:00:36.730> notice<00:00:36.880> is

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
guitar the first thing you may notice is

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.200 
guitar the first thing you may notice is
the<00:00:38.559> way<00:00:38.710> of<00:00:38.859> the<00:00:39.010> strings<00:00:39.430> are<00:00:39.609> spaced<00:00:39.910> here

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
the way of the strings are spaced here

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.599 
the way of the strings are spaced here
across<00:00:40.660> the<00:00:40.870> bridge<00:00:41.109> and<00:00:41.620> what<00:00:42.250> babbitt's

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
across the bridge and what babbitt's

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.669 
across the bridge and what babbitt's
calls<00:00:42.850> us<00:00:43.000> it's<00:00:43.179> a<00:00:43.300> lateral<00:00:43.750> compression

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:44.679 
calls us it's a lateral compression

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.549 
calls us it's a lateral compression
soundboard<00:00:45.640> so<00:00:46.449> basically<00:00:46.899> the<00:00:47.079> idea<00:00:47.109> is

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
soundboard so basically the idea is

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.459 
soundboard so basically the idea is
normally<00:00:48.129> an<00:00:48.250> acoustic<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:49.269> your<00:00:50.140> strings

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
normally an acoustic the your strings

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.619 
normally an acoustic the your strings
are<00:00:50.859> held<00:00:51.160> by<00:00:51.339> the<00:00:51.399> bridge<00:00:51.910> pins<00:00:52.210> over<00:00:52.449> here

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
are held by the bridge pins over here

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.889 
are held by the bridge pins over here
and<00:00:52.780> they<00:00:52.870> come<00:00:53.109> up<00:00:53.320> from<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.890> bridge

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
and they come up from the bridge

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.349 
and they come up from the bridge
Babbitt's<00:00:55.899> idea<00:00:56.230> here<00:00:56.499> is<00:00:56.649> to<00:00:56.920> have<00:00:57.359> the

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
Babbitt's idea here is to have the

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.630 
Babbitt's idea here is to have the
strings<00:00:59.109> spread<00:00:59.589> out<00:00:59.710> across<00:00:59.859> the<00:01:00.219> soundboard

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
strings spread out across the soundboard

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.299 
strings spread out across the soundboard
so<00:01:00.820> basically<00:01:01.120> you<00:01:01.269> get<00:01:01.359> a<00:01:01.420> lateral<00:01:02.100> sound<00:01:03.100> so

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
so basically you get a lateral sound so

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.740 
so basically you get a lateral sound so
basically<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.789> way<00:01:04.120> the<00:01:04.360> strings<00:01:04.600> are

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
basically the way the strings are

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.480 
basically the way the strings are
vibrating<00:01:05.110> they're<00:01:05.350> vibrating<00:01:05.830> across<00:01:06.220> the

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
vibrating they're vibrating across the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.420 
vibrating they're vibrating across the
grain<00:01:06.700> of<00:01:06.909> the<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:08.050> top<00:01:08.290> of<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.620> guitar<00:01:08.890> so<00:01:09.190> it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
grain of the the top of the guitar so it

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.400 
grain of the the top of the guitar so it
gives<00:01:09.970> you<00:01:10.090> an<00:01:10.240> even<00:01:10.600> sound<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.230> it's

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
gives you an even sound and it's

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.560 
gives you an even sound and it's
actually<00:01:12.040> it's<00:01:12.550> kind<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:12.880> cool<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.300> way<00:01:13.420> it's

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
actually it's kind of cool the way it's

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.360 
actually it's kind of cool the way it's
set<00:01:13.750> up<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:14.080> way<00:01:14.170> this<00:01:14.320> way<00:01:14.500> looking<00:01:15.130> at<00:01:15.220> the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
set up the way this way looking at the

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.330 
set up the way this way looking at the
bridge<00:01:15.660> Babbitt's<00:01:16.660> calls<00:01:16.900> this<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:17.830> torque

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
bridge Babbitt's calls this a torque

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.080 
bridge Babbitt's calls this a torque
reducing<00:01:18.850> split<00:01:19.180> bridge<00:01:19.510> and<00:01:20.850> unlike<00:01:21.850> a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
reducing split bridge and unlike a

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.940 
reducing split bridge and unlike a
regular<00:01:22.630> acoustic<00:01:23.260> guitars<00:01:23.530> where<00:01:23.740> the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
regular acoustic guitars where the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.730 
regular acoustic guitars where the
bridge<00:01:24.220> is<00:01:24.250> glued<00:01:24.910> to<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.540> soundboard<00:01:26.050> this

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
bridge is glued to the soundboard this

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.560 
bridge is glued to the soundboard this
is<00:01:26.950> not<00:01:27.130> it's<00:01:27.400> held<00:01:27.670> together<00:01:27.820> by<00:01:28.030> allen

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
is not it's held together by allen

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.230 
is not it's held together by allen
screws<00:01:28.900> so<00:01:29.320> in<00:01:29.620> effect<00:01:30.340> what<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.820> get<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.060> do
