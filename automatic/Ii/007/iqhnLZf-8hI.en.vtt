 contacts that have already been assigned in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.539
 this case phone does not have any 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.640
 contact assigned so simply 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.920
 I can choose any number from 12 to 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.870
 9 on 1 does not give me the option of what 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.190
 it has always been defined with a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.989
 dialing for mail 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.659
 in most phones we are going to 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.880
 three sign to a contact if I give him the 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.560
 3 remove the contact list 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.850

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.440
 contact we already have a contact in 347 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.270
 for example 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.950
 and here we already have two contacts in the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.110
 speed dial if we leave by 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.790
 example we can also from the next 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.070
 way we know we have in 3 and the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.230
 7 and a contact we left sunk on 5 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.240
 for example here it tells me that there is no 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.650
 no contact there does ask me what 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.780
 if you want to assign someone now I'm going to 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.800
 accept and we will look for any 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:44.780
