results after two months

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.510 
results after two months
I'm<00:00:16.720> just<00:00:16.870> going<00:00:17.050> to<00:00:17.080> scratch<00:00:17.380> our<00:00:17.650> nose<00:00:18.070> which

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
I'm just going to scratch our nose which

00:00:18.520 --> 00:01:45.590 
I'm just going to scratch our nose which
is<00:00:18.550> a<00:00:18.730> lot<00:00:19.000> more<00:00:19.180> water<00:00:19.390> than

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.230 

okay<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:46.830> a<00:01:46.860> pretty<00:01:47.670> good<00:01:47.880> amount<00:01:48.090> of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
okay so that was a pretty good amount of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.760 
okay so that was a pretty good amount of
water<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:50.479> before<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.750> was<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:52.020> even<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
water and before it was like even just a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.680 
water and before it was like even just a
drop<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.280> drops<00:01:53.610> going<00:01:53.910> to<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> trunk<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
drop that drops going to the trunk and

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.540 
drop that drops going to the trunk and
now<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:55.050> do<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.410> so<00:01:56.100> let<00:01:56.220> me<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.400> ahead<00:01:56.460> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
show you the inside of the trunk and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.410 
show you the inside of the trunk and

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:03.820 

perfectly<00:02:56.150> dry<00:02:56.800> not<00:02:57.800> a<00:02:57.830> single<00:02:58.340> drop<00:02:58.520> of<00:02:58.640> water

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.820 

there<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:04.580> go<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:06.020> you've<00:03:06.200> been<00:03:06.320> wasting<00:03:06.500> your

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
there you go so you've been wasting your

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.200 
there you go so you've been wasting your
time<00:03:06.980> taking<00:03:07.460> your<00:03:07.580> car<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.940> dealer

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
time taking your car to the dealer

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.330 
time taking your car to the dealer
trying<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.510> get<00:03:08.600> it<00:03:08.720> fixed<00:03:08.950> just<00:03:09.950> follow<00:03:10.160> the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
trying to get it fixed just follow the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.010 
trying to get it fixed just follow the
steps<00:03:10.640> I<00:03:10.790> showed<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.300> that<00:03:11.420> video<00:03:11.600> and

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
steps I showed you in that video and

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.580 
steps I showed you in that video and
that's<00:03:12.080> how<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.350> actually<00:03:12.620> fix<00:03:13.070> it<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:15.350> don't

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
that's how you actually fix it and don't

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.470 
that's how you actually fix it and don't
try<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:15.770> skip<00:03:16.100> anything<00:03:16.310> like<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.820> sealant<00:03:17.270> or

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
try to skip anything like the sealant or

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.290 
try to skip anything like the sealant or
the<00:03:17.720> tape<00:03:17.960> and<00:03:18.290> if<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.370> got<00:03:19.520> rest<00:03:19.820> go<00:03:20.090> ahead

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
the tape and if you got rest go ahead

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.260 
the tape and if you got rest go ahead
and<00:03:20.420> paint<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:21.160> all<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.580> steps<00:03:22.880> are<00:03:23.090> required

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
and paint it all the steps are required

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.810 
and paint it all the steps are required
I<00:03:23.900> think<00:03:24.350> a<00:03:24.590> lot<00:03:24.710> of<00:03:24.740> the<00:03:24.860> dealerships<00:03:25.340> skip

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
I think a lot of the dealerships skip

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.210 
I think a lot of the dealerships skip
the<00:03:26.030> tape<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:27.230> double-sided<00:03:27.680> tape<00:03:27.830> that

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
the tape the double-sided tape that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.300 
the tape the double-sided tape that
comes<00:03:28.430> from<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.700> factory<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.300> that's<00:03:29.450> why

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
comes from the factory and that's why

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.560 
comes from the factory and that's why
that's<00:03:31.310> why<00:03:31.550> it<00:03:31.610> still<00:03:31.940> leaks<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.330> they<00:03:32.390> just

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
that's why it still leaks and they just

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.470 
that's why it still leaks and they just
do<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.720> over<00:03:32.990> and<00:03:33.080> over<00:03:33.850> so<00:03:34.850> yeah<00:03:35.000> all<00:03:35.270> the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
do it over and over so yeah all the

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.680 
do it over and over so yeah all the
steps<00:03:35.800> and<00:03:36.800> it<00:03:36.890> will<00:03:37.010> cure<00:03:37.820> your<00:03:38.060> trunk<00:03:38.480> leak

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
steps and it will cure your trunk leak

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.970 
steps and it will cure your trunk leak
for<00:03:38.960> good<00:03:39.520> thanks<00:03:40.520> for<00:03:40.640> watching
