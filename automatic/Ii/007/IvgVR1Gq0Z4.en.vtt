the buggy which has got a twin machine

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.249 
the buggy which has got a twin machine
gun<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.850> roof<00:02:08.970> that's<00:02:09.540> incredibly<00:02:09.990> agile

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
gun on the roof that's incredibly agile

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.860 
gun on the roof that's incredibly agile
that<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.680> flip<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.190> roll<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.390> inci

supercar<00:02:13.350> which<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.680> insanely<00:02:14.550> quick<00:02:14.790> so

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
supercar which is insanely quick so

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.340 
supercar which is insanely quick so
faster<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.420> cut<00:02:15.570> an<00:02:15.720> entire<00:02:15.840> game

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
faster to cut an entire game

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.230 
faster to cut an entire game
and<00:02:16.470> then<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.400> got<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> agency<00:02:18.000> tank

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
and then you got to the agency tank

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.540 
and then you got to the agency tank
which<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.260> hardest<00:02:19.590> vehicle<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.340> then

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
which is the hardest vehicle and then

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.130 
which is the hardest vehicle and then
time<00:02:20.700> again<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.540> drive<00:02:21.660> over<00:02:21.840> cars

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
time again you can just drive over cars

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.020 
time again you can just drive over cars
at<00:02:22.350> high<00:02:22.590> speed<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.160> that's<00:02:23.460> not<00:02:23.700> really<00:02:23.940> what

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
at high speed and that's not really what
