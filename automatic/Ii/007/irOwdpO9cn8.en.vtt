00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.233
 Hello everyone, bye: 

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:06.433
 I'm Dario Tranchitella, product manager of 3Digital LAB. 

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:12.466
 I decided to make this short chapter that introduces the new features of 3ds Max 2013. 

00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:15.566
 This new release does not present very big news: 

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.332
 the most striking is certainly the interface. 

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:22.199
 For those of you using this software from the 2010/2011 version 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.966
 will surely have found that this has remained almost identical: 

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.332
 undoubtedly we have improvements 

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:33.933
 but apparently the core of 3ds Max, except for some minor improvements, 

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.466
 remains almost identical, 

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.399
 both at the level of tools and functionality. 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.766
 Without a shadow of a doubt over the years 

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.932
 3ds Max presented innovations and innovations: 

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:48.666
 just think of the Graphite modeling tools bar (introduced in the 2011 version) 

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.866
 or new display modes 

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.699
 available thanks to the Nitrous graphics driver, 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.600
 still present and presented in the 2012 version. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.000
 The first thing that catches your eye is the Perspective view: 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.366
 we no longer have a solid color but a gradient. 

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:09.299
 This is a visually pleasing but heavy feature for real-time viewing. 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.500
 especially when working with scenes composed of millions of polygons 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.166
 To return to the classic setting just follow this simple procedure: 

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:24.332
 Right click on view mode&gt; Viewport background&gt; Solid color. 

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:27.766
 The 3ds Max interface has always been considered tricky 

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.666
 or little inclined to change by the user: 

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:35.866
 this myth has been debunked in the latest versions and 2013 is no less. 

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:40.032
 From this version we have the Viewport layout toolbar available, 

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.133
 positioned here on the left: 

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:50.766
 by clicking on this arrow we have the possibility to choose various predefined arrangements. 

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:53.699
 All these templates are placed side by side 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.133
 to be called up quickly during work. 

00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:00.899
 As you can see, as you move from one layout to another, 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.866
 there is a slight slowdown in performance and it is more than normal: 

00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:10.132
 we are working exclusively on the graphics processor of our workstation. 

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:13.099
 This bar works as a sort of favorite: 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:21.466
 to delete the preset just used just right click&gt; Delete tab. 

00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:23.899
 Personally I find this layout management 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.866
 not particularly useful: 

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:29.699
 this sidebar takes up useful space for the interface, 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.766
 despite the possibility of being able to move it. 

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:36.766
 But in doing so we have a small problem: 

00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:39.599
 this turns into a flying window 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.766
 (hindering our work space not a little) 

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:46.866
 and above all it cannot be integrated into any compartment, 

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.132
 except the left one. 

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:51.733
 You are free to use it how to hide it: 

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:54.199
 this procedure is also very simple 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.500
 because just right-click on this bar and disable Viewport layout tabs. 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.700
 Unfortunately it is not even possible to assign them a keyboard shortcut 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.433
 to recall it in case of need: 

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:11.866
 therefore I prefer to use the classic 4-Quads layout, 

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:14.199
 that is four boxes. 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.333
 Nevertheless it can come in handy in case we work with complex scenes: 

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:26.566
 let's see a practical example. 

00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:29.766
 Wishing we could use this layout: 

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:34.366
 at the bottom right we can insert the camera so as to keep the scene under control 

00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:37.599
 from the point of view from which the render will be carried out; 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.733
 in this other we could insert the right view which (in this case) 

00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:45.533
 it allows me to easily find the elements present on stage; 

00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:47.633
 in this other view from above. 

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:50.266
 In the larger one I can choose Perspective 

00:03:50.266 --> 00:03:57.566
 so as to navigate easily within our scene. 

00:03:57.566 --> 00:04:01.666
 3ds Max 2013 has introduced a new display mode: 

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:03.499
 I'm talking about Clay who, 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.500
 as its name suggests, it simulates a plasticine effect. 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.466
 In the case of architectural visualization it is not a winning choice: 

00:04:11.466 --> 00:04:15.032
 without a doubt it is more suited to organic modeling, 

00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:18.033
 especially of High-Poly character. 

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:23.466
 I think this choice made by Autodesk is to wink to the users of ZBrush, 

00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:26.032
 especially in combination with the gradient background, 

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:28.633
 very similar to that of Maya. 

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:31.433
 Clearly the colors of the spot color as of the gradient 

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:33.866
 can be set from the software preferences, 

00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:37.166
 procedure that will be explained in subsequent lessons. 

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:40.799
 To return to the standard view, just a few clicks are needed: 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.966
 I choose the 4-Quads layout and then enter the room 

00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:46.766
 by pressing the C key on the keyboard. 

00:04:46.766 --> 00:04:52.366
 Except for these small changes, the interface remains almost identical to that of 3ds Max 2012, 

00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:56.932
 except certain advanced tools that will not be explained in this video course: 

00:04:56.933 --> 00:05:01.066
 for this reason the video course can also be attended by students 

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:04.999
 which feature later software versions than 2010.
