00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.889
 hello our recipe for today will be 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.100
 breaded banana 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.320
 We'll be needing banana. 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.930
 I'll be doing with water bananas. 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.630
 even though it's so much better because it's more 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:29.760
 nice too, and shall we be? 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:36.180
 needing an entire egg, right? 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.710
 the genus wheat flour and flour 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.559
 screw thread 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.200
 the bananas you use the amount you 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.210
 you want and the other ingredients 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.050
 will also depend on the amount of 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.629
 banana 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.260
 the first thing we'll do us 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:01:06.720
 Let's pour the egg into a container and 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:08.700
 Let's hit it well until it's okay today. 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.060
 remembering that I put a pinch of 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.060
 salt 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:24.450
 the second step 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:30.240
 We're going to be opening the bullets. 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:35.150
 removing all the bark and will also be 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.150
 taking these lines that are in the hand 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.610
 there you will be cutting as you 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.610
 do you want 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:14.790
 I 'll want that size anyway 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.350
 here you will make you go picking up the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:27.510
 banana will first pass through the 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:34.520
 wheat flour and will beat for what 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.520
 quit the excess 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.800
 until after that with help 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:51.660
 of a fork 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.660
 You're going to be passing an egg. 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.709
 will let it drain a little 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:24.880
 and will put in wheat flour the 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.880
 thread flour sorry 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:38.000
 will enter the top right on the sides 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.340
 until it is so put in a 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.500
 container and do the same procedure 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.500
 with all other bananas 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.470
 good right now all the bananas already 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.750
 are past 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.940
 remembering that first it has to 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.340
 pass on wheat flour 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.550
 then new step and then in the flour of 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:04.550
 thread and it will look like this now 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.510
 she's frying the fire in oil 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.700
 hot 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.150
 so let's go people I've already left the year 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.480
 warming up in the pan in the money that 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.900
 You have to conquer bananas and I 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.799
 I put paper towels so I can 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:26.210
 absorb the oil after frying 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.470
 So we'll get the banana very quickly. 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.050
 caution 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.050
 do not let's get complete 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:47.970

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.380
 carlinhos the sequinhas torment can 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.420
 your preference 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.710
 I was a little cinnamon with sugar and 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.160
 I like a lot 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.640
 Then you can be sprinkling too. 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.640

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.229
 the crusty crust was left and 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.810

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.520
