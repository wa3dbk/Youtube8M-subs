so<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.029> first<00:00:06.240> step<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.750> prepping<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.620> install

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
so the first step in prepping to install

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.180 
so the first step in prepping to install
the<00:00:08.490> epic<00:00:08.820> t1000<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.110> clean<00:00:10.469> your<00:00:10.980> old

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
the epic t1000 is to clean your old

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.999 
the epic t1000 is to clean your old
processor<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.110> case<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.769> my

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
processor and so in this case I have my

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.970 
processor and so in this case I have my
i7<00:00:14.630> 2700<00:00:15.630> k<00:00:15.809> here<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.230> can<00:00:16.350> see<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.500> thermal

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980

and have it flow reason you do this is

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.800 
and have it flow reason you do this is
it<00:01:17.110> any<00:01:17.350> grease<00:01:17.710> or<00:01:17.740> oil<00:01:18.580> zor<00:01:19.240> anything<00:01:19.630> else

any residual Tim that's on the on the

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.530 
any residual Tim that's on the on the
chip<00:01:23.710> will<00:01:23.979> could<00:01:24.729> cause<00:01:24.940> it<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.180> have<00:01:25.420> an

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
chip will could cause it to have an

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.990 
chip will could cause it to have an
uneven<00:01:25.870> flow<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.500> will<00:01:27.040> minimize<00:01:27.640> the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
uneven flow and will minimize the

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.060 
uneven flow and will minimize the
amazing<00:01:28.570> performance<00:01:29.140> of<00:01:29.350> this<00:01:29.740> product

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.530 

again<00:01:36.070> I'm<00:01:36.340> going<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.520> just<00:01:36.670> go<00:01:36.820> ahead<00:01:36.940> clean

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
again I'm going to just go ahead clean

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.499 
again I'm going to just go ahead clean
all<00:01:37.660> this<00:01:37.810> off<00:01:38.050> and<00:01:38.490> you'll<00:01:39.490> see<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.729> nice<00:01:40.030> clean

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
all this off and you'll see a nice clean

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.480 
all this off and you'll see a nice clean
ship<00:01:41.200> there<00:01:41.470> now<00:01:42.070> that<00:01:42.130> we<00:01:42.310> have<00:01:42.340> our

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
ship there now that we have our

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.690 
ship there now that we have our
processor<00:01:43.180> all<00:01:43.300> nice<00:01:43.570> and<00:01:43.900> cleaned<00:01:44.229> up<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
processor all nice and cleaned up the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.310 
processor all nice and cleaned up the
next<00:01:45.940> part<00:01:46.240> is<00:01:46.390> going<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.630> be<00:01:46.690> cleaning<00:01:47.050> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
next part is going to be cleaning the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.440 
next part is going to be cleaning the
water<00:01:47.470> block<00:01:47.830> making<00:01:48.700> sure<00:01:48.880> there's<00:01:49.060> no<00:01:49.180> Tim

it<00:02:18.280> up<00:02:18.459> on<00:02:18.670> top<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.120> chip<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.680> then<00:02:20.680> you

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
it up on top of the chip and then you

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.040 
it up on top of the chip and then you
peel<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.190> top<00:02:21.370> off<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:22.090> black<00:02:22.450> piece<00:02:22.750> is

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
peel the top off this black piece is

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.890 
peel the top off this black piece is
very<00:02:23.319> thin<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.920> just<00:02:24.130> stays<00:02:24.730> there<00:02:24.810> that's<00:02:25.810> a

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
very thin it just stays there that's a

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.750 
very thin it just stays there that's a
permanent<00:02:26.350> piece<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.010> until<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.400> want

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
permanent piece of this until you want

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.900 
permanent piece of this until you want
to<00:02:27.850> remove<00:02:28.090> this<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.569> but<00:02:29.440> then<00:02:29.590> you<00:02:30.010> ruin<00:02:30.580> the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
to remove this and but then you ruin the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.120 
to remove this and but then you ruin the
the<00:02:31.450> Tim<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.810> have<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.050> its<00:02:32.230> own<00:02:32.380> single<00:02:32.950> use

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
the Tim you have to its own single use

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.610 
the Tim you have to its own single use
Tim<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:34.240> you<00:02:34.300> leave<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.660> on<00:02:34.870> top<00:02:35.080> then<00:02:35.530> you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
Tim so you leave this on top then you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.949 
Tim so you leave this on top then you
place<00:02:35.830> your<00:02:35.920> water<00:02:36.160> block<00:02:36.459> or<00:02:36.700> your<00:02:36.850> your<00:02:37.750> air

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
place your water block or your your air

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.930 
place your water block or your your air
cooler<00:02:38.230> on<00:02:38.440> top<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.860> this<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.459> clamp<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:39.880> down

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
cooler on top of this you clamp it down

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.460 
cooler on top of this you clamp it down
and<00:02:40.360> then<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.690> next<00:02:40.720> step<00:02:40.990> will<00:02:41.230> be<00:02:41.260> the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
and then the next step will be the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.140 
and then the next step will be the
reflow<00:02:41.980> which<00:02:42.280> will<00:02:42.490> show<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.730> here<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:43.090> the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
reflow which will show you here in the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.780 
reflow which will show you here in the
video<00:02:43.360> in<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.540> second<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:45.280> this<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.610> the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
video in a second but this is the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.300 
video in a second but this is the
installation<00:02:46.660> process<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.980> little<00:02:48.130> more

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
installation process it is a little more

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.460 
installation process it is a little more
involved<00:02:48.610> than<00:02:48.849> a<00:02:48.970> normal<00:02:49.260> thermal<00:02:50.260> interface

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
compound it's not just a drop and then

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.180 
compound it's not just a drop and then
you<00:02:52.660> clamp<00:02:53.020> down<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.500> do<00:02:53.620> have<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:53.920> do<00:02:54.040> this

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
you clamp down you do have to do this
