00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.410
 do a little tutorial to find out how 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.110
 install mode as a tale 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.240
 heart generator h is so how 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.240
 able to play on versions of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.439
 newer windows so that can be 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.579
 windows vista windows 7 or windows 8 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:34.950
 I am under windows 8 64 bits so 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.790
 who manages a little more memory so 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.040
 to start so that your games 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.950
 work properly 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.450
 you must have version 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.240
 of the game in one point 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.650
 1.204 so who is available on this 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.230
 site 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.760
 so the link you can see him coming 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.190
 here and you have to download the version 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.330
 which matches the game mode so the 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.860
 French by French Spanish 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.440
 takes weeks English to 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.780
 English German for German 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.140
 so far so simple you 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.150
 Then you install download 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:19.180
 now for to do it 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.920
 to work wen got into play then and 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.640
 we have where you have installed you 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.830
 insert the cd for those who have the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.270
 version cd so I have the version cd 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.460
 so right click on you 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.160
 make property compatibility you 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.960
 do you check the box executed this 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.470
 program in compatibility mode for 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.619
 you select windows xp from where xp 3 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.830
 but me I prefer selected xp2 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.490
 then you have the box ticked 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.649
 executed this program as 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.069
 that administrator you are enforcing 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.229
 and then fucking slap hockey 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.800
 I come back to a small house 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.800
 ellipses 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.360
 yes so I'm here again so I know everything 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.570
 hearing 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.060
 so you select so colas dont 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.980
 you do what I told you and 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.630
 then down you start the game 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.790
 so I'm not going to do it but I 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.790
 can show you that it does not block 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.470
 yeah I'm throwing you so normally 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.420
 you have a window like that makes you 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.870
 Yes 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.560
 so you have the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.840
 the name screen it should work 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.950
 so 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.930
 so that's it that was the part 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.140
 to make it work on the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.400
 windows versions 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.630
 recent so from vista up to windows 8 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.510
 so then for the installation of a 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.220
 fashion it's very simple my taste you 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.650
 select the mode you want 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.450
 so it can be 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:05.050
 like on my videos so the mode 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:11.270
 general x or raptor project mode so 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:13.280
 some modes that will be applications 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.950
 advanced or sometimes it will be 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.870
 files to move the files to 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.290
 move it's simple do you do 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:26.720
 select everything done next 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.830
 you go no do you go in fashion you 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.110
 create one by cons must create a 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.180
 folder to avoid getting lost in 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.240
 the modes and then you copy the 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.000
 gauge is original in your file 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.660
 way to avoid for example everything 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.550
 reinstall so you copy paste and 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.670
 then normally you have something 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.720
 who should have more files 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:55.700
 big point style so for contract 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.130
 it is this form here so here 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.740
 then for project raptor it's a 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.320
 so application of the shot 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:07.070
 you just put the folder where you 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:10.310
 have copied your game to accommodate the 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.760
 mode and then normally you there you 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.350
 find 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.940
 if you renamed records like me
