armor with other characters which is
kind<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.640> neat<00:03:45.260> I<00:03:46.260> love<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.280> they<00:03:47.400> did<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.730> I

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
kind of neat I love that they did that I

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.100 
kind of neat I love that they did that I
think<00:03:48.000> that's<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.180> really<00:03:48.300> neat<00:03:48.510> idea<00:03:48.660> and

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
think that's a really neat idea and

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.630 
think that's a really neat idea and
something<00:03:49.740> kind<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.190> know<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.370> guess

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
something kind of you know I guess

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.000 
something kind of you know I guess
technically<00:03:51.540> any<00:03:51.780> pieces<00:03:52.200> are<00:03:52.320> swappable

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
technically any pieces are swappable

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.580 
technically any pieces are swappable
between<00:03:53.459> building<00:03:53.880> sets<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.630> just<00:03:55.380> think<00:03:55.500> it's

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
between building sets I just think it's

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.440 
between building sets I just think it's
neat<00:03:55.709> they<00:03:55.920> made<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.160> armor<00:03:56.430> do<00:03:56.550> that<00:03:56.730> he<00:03:57.270> does

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
neat they made the armor do that he does

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.570 
neat they made the armor do that he does
have<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.720> little<00:03:57.990> uh<00:03:58.320> pulled<00:03:59.190> out<00:03:59.280> his<00:03:59.400> whole
