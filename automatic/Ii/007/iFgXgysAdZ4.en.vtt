00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.060 

okay<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.260> video<00:00:10.440> we're<00:00:10.770> going<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.950> look

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
okay in this video we're going to look

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.180 
okay in this video we're going to look
at<00:00:11.220> the<00:00:11.370> basics<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.330> doing<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.809> recovery<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
at the basics of doing a recovery the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.090 
at the basics of doing a recovery the
first<00:00:14.460> step<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:14.969> process

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
first step in the process

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.790 
first step in the process
just<00:00:16.779> imaging<00:00:17.779> the<00:00:17.900> driver<00:00:18.140> creating<00:00:18.710> a

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
just imaging the driver creating a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.859 
just imaging the driver creating a
cloned<00:00:19.070> copy<00:00:19.400> of<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:19.610> drive<00:00:19.850> there's<00:00:20.750> really

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
cloned copy of the drive there's really

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.240 
cloned copy of the drive there's really
a<00:00:20.990> couple<00:00:21.140> ways<00:00:21.410> you<00:00:21.439> can<00:00:21.680> go<00:00:21.800> about<00:00:21.830> doing

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
a couple ways you can go about doing

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.490 
a couple ways you can go about doing
this<00:00:22.599> there's<00:00:23.599> certain<00:00:23.840> applications<00:00:24.410> you

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
this there's certain applications you

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.080 
this there's certain applications you
can<00:00:24.650> utilize<00:00:24.770> that<00:00:25.310> will<00:00:25.460> actually<00:00:25.789> create<00:00:26.000> a

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
can utilize that will actually create a

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.460 
can utilize that will actually create a
file<00:00:26.800> that<00:00:27.800> is<00:00:28.130> essentially<00:00:28.820> just<00:00:29.470> the

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
file that is essentially just the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.130 
file that is essentially just the
contents<00:00:30.980> of<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.130> hard<00:00:31.310> drive<00:00:31.689> in<00:00:32.689> an<00:00:32.870> image

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
contents of the hard drive in an image

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.320 
contents of the hard drive in an image
file<00:00:33.410> then<00:00:34.400> you<00:00:34.519> would<00:00:34.640> load<00:00:34.850> into<00:00:35.350> whatever

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
file then you would load into whatever

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.810 
file then you would load into whatever
type<00:00:38.330> of<00:00:38.360> software<00:00:39.140> or<00:00:39.290> you<00:00:40.100> know<00:00:40.190> utility<00:00:40.760> you

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
type of software or you know utility you

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.520 
type of software or you know utility you
might<00:00:41.030> use<00:00:41.269> for<00:00:41.540> doing<00:00:41.750> a<00:00:41.839> logical<00:00:42.320> type

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
might use for doing a logical type

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.079 
might use for doing a logical type
recovery<00:00:43.839> but<00:00:44.839> the<00:00:45.250> first<00:00:46.250> step<00:00:46.489> is<00:00:46.670> always

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
recovery but the first step is always

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.760 
recovery but the first step is always
going<00:00:47.210> to<00:00:47.269> be<00:00:47.330> with<00:00:47.570> any<00:00:47.750> reputable<00:00:48.320> company

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
going to be with any reputable company

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.920 
going to be with any reputable company
that<00:00:48.800> does<00:00:49.190> that<00:00:49.370> recovery<00:00:50.000> is<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.420> create<00:00:50.899> a

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
that does that recovery is to create a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.590 
that does that recovery is to create a
cloned<00:00:51.320> a<00:00:51.440> copy<00:00:51.649> of<00:00:52.010> that<00:00:52.129> original<00:00:52.370> drive<00:00:52.789> be

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
cloned a copy of that original drive be

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.950 
cloned a copy of that original drive be
it<00:00:53.690> on<00:00:53.899> a<00:00:54.520> another<00:00:55.520> physical<00:00:56.270> hard<00:00:56.449> drive<00:00:56.690> or

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
it on a another physical hard drive or

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.950

creating an image file in most cases we

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.360 
creating an image file in most cases we
prefer<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.350> go<00:01:00.469> through<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:00.920> just<00:01:01.070> create<00:01:01.309> a

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
prefer to go through and just create a

cloned copy the drive a couple reasons
for<00:01:03.800> this<00:01:03.949> primarily<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:05.119> want<00:01:05.149> to<00:01:05.420> do

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
for this primarily you want to do

from the customers drive there's certain
things<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:13.610> might<00:01:13.789> do<00:01:14.000> or<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:14.899> might<00:01:15.520> end<00:01:16.520> up

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
things you might do or you might end up

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.719 
things you might do or you might end up
making<00:01:17.720> this<00:01:17.899> situation<00:01:18.140> worse<00:01:18.500> by<00:01:19.009> operating

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
making this situation worse by operating

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.600 
making this situation worse by operating
the<00:01:19.880> drive<00:01:20.119> anymore<00:01:20.540> than<00:01:20.689> it<00:01:20.780> needs<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.170> be<00:01:21.610> so

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
the drive anymore than it needs to be so

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.880 
the drive anymore than it needs to be so
we<00:01:22.640> prefer<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.390> work<00:01:23.630> for<00:01:24.200> my<00:01:24.290> drive<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:24.799> we

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
we prefer to work for my drive that we

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.080 
we prefer to work for my drive that we
know<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:25.280> mechanically<00:01:26.119> sound<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:26.840> also

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
know is mechanically sound and also

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.550 
know is mechanically sound and also
whatever<00:01:29.090> we<00:01:29.360> do<00:01:29.570> is<00:01:29.780> not<00:01:29.900> going<00:01:30.049> to<00:01:30.140> alter<00:01:30.439> the

original integrity of the data that was

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.080 
original integrity of the data that was
there<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.280> customer<00:01:34.640> needs<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:34.909> get

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
there that the customer needs to get

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.710 
there that the customer needs to get
back<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.170> on<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.470> Left<00:01:36.680> we<00:01:36.860> have<00:01:36.890> our<00:01:37.720> our

it's 120 gigabyte stay to hard drive and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.219 
it's 120 gigabyte stay to hard drive and
we're<00:01:43.909> going<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.060> be<00:01:44.180> cloning<00:01:44.509> that<00:01:44.600> on<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:45.020> the

kind of what at all what also it tells

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.889 
kind of what at all what also it tells
us<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.020> why<00:02:00.710> this<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:01.070> a<00:02:01.100> lot<00:02:01.340> easier<00:02:01.790> than<00:02:02.000> for

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
us and why this is a lot easier than for

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.109 
us and why this is a lot easier than for
a<00:02:02.930> data<00:02:03.320> recovery<00:02:03.619> company<00:02:03.829> to<00:02:04.310> utilize<00:02:04.759> and

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
a data recovery company to utilize and

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.680 
a data recovery company to utilize and
let's<00:02:05.390> say<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:07.100> know<00:02:07.189> ghost<00:02:07.759> or<00:02:08.269> any<00:02:08.540> other

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
let's say you know ghost or any other

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.389 
let's say you know ghost or any other
the<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.290> programs<00:02:09.679> that<00:02:09.799> are<00:02:09.950> out<00:02:09.979> there<00:02:10.040> that

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
the the programs that are out there that

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.819 
the the programs that are out there that
you<00:02:10.670> know<00:02:10.989> essentially<00:02:11.989> just<00:02:12.290> create<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.650> clone

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
you know essentially just create a clone

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.470 
you know essentially just create a clone
copy<00:02:13.100> of<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.340> drive<00:02:13.549> but<00:02:13.850> do<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.239> much

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
copy of the drive but do it in a much

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.850 
copy of the drive but do it in a much
different<00:02:14.720> manner

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.230 

okay<00:02:18.860> this<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.190> display<00:02:19.580> that<00:02:19.670> we<00:02:19.910> have<00:02:20.090> in

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
okay this is a display that we have in

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.200 
okay this is a display that we have in
our<00:02:20.300> imaging<00:02:20.660> station<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.850> good<00:02:23.000> thing<00:02:23.180> about

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
our imaging station the good thing about

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.730 
our imaging station the good thing about
this<00:02:23.630> is<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:23.960> actually<00:02:24.140> we<00:02:24.410> can<00:02:24.530> have<00:02:24.650> it

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
this is is actually we can have it

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.250 
this is is actually we can have it
powered<00:02:24.890> up<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.690> don't<00:02:26.870> have<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.170> have

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
powered up and and we don't have to have

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.600 
powered up and and we don't have to have
the<00:02:27.350> drive<00:02:27.560> actually<00:02:27.830> powered<00:02:28.280> up<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.490> this

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
the drive actually powered up to this

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.760 
the drive actually powered up to this
point<00:02:28.910> if<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.090> drive<00:02:29.330> is<00:02:29.510> right<00:02:30.380> on<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.620> verge

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
point if the drive is right on the verge

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.090 
point if the drive is right on the verge
of<00:02:31.360> mechanically<00:02:32.360> failing<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:33.140> lot<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:33.920> times

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
of mechanically failing a lot of times

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.530 
of mechanically failing a lot of times
we<00:02:34.280> can<00:02:34.430> avoid<00:02:34.850> having<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.180> go<00:02:35.300> into<00:02:35.420> a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
we can avoid having to go into a

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.650 
we can avoid having to go into a
cleanroom<00:02:35.870> with<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.440> by<00:02:37.100> utilizing<00:02:37.940> this<00:02:38.390> type

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
cleanroom with it by utilizing this type

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.480 
cleanroom with it by utilizing this type
of<00:02:38.690> imaging<00:02:39.170> process<00:02:39.740> because<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.070> puts<00:02:40.220> very

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
of imaging process because it puts very

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.430 
of imaging process because it puts very
little<00:02:40.790> load<00:02:40.940> on<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.210> drive<00:02:41.480> right<00:02:42.200> now<00:02:42.380> the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
little load on the drive right now the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.110 
little load on the drive right now the
drive<00:02:42.740> is<00:02:42.920> not<00:02:43.040> even<00:02:43.250> powered<00:02:43.520> up<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:43.910> I'll<00:02:44.000> go

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
drive is not even powered up so I'll go

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.970 
drive is not even powered up so I'll go
ahead<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.360> power<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.720> up<00:02:44.900> up<00:02:45.500> here<00:02:45.680> tells

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
ahead and power that up up here tells

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.850 
ahead and power that up up here tells
the<00:02:46.280> drive<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.730> busy<00:02:47.120> as<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.870> goes<00:02:48.320> through<00:02:48.590> and

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
the drive is busy as it goes through and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.440 
the drive is busy as it goes through and
calibrates<00:02:49.520> itself<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:50.150> becomes<00:02:50.390> ready<00:02:50.660> and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
calibrates itself and becomes ready and

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.730 
calibrates itself and becomes ready and
now<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.600> shows<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:53.990> ready<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.500> we'll<00:02:54.620> go

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
now it shows it's ready so we'll go

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.020 
now it shows it's ready so we'll go
through<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:56.110> rescan<00:02:57.580> which<00:02:58.580> should<00:02:58.820> load

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
through and rescan which should load

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.790 
through and rescan which should load
that<00:02:59.240> drive<00:02:59.570> information<00:03:00.320> here<00:03:00.470> which<00:03:00.500> it

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
that drive information here which it

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.290 
that drive information here which it
does<00:03:00.980> so<00:03:01.190> that's<00:03:01.370> gonna<00:03:01.490> be<00:03:01.640> our<00:03:01.730> source<00:03:01.970> drive

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
does so that's gonna be our source drive

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.490 
does so that's gonna be our source drive
and<00:03:02.600> this<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.900> our<00:03:03.050> destination<00:03:03.470> drive

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
and this is our destination drive

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.880 
and this is our destination drive
there's<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.560> few<00:03:06.800> configuration<00:03:08.890> processes

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
there's a few configuration processes

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.940 
there's a few configuration processes
that<00:03:10.010> we<00:03:10.100> need<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.310> go<00:03:10.430> through<00:03:10.820> in<00:03:11.330> order<00:03:11.630> to

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
that we need to go through in order to

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.790 
that we need to go through in order to
get<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.070> drive<00:03:13.280> ready<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:15.230> be<00:03:15.380> able<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.560> be

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
get the drive ready to be able to be

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.300 
get the drive ready to be able to be
imaged<00:03:16.430> one<00:03:17.330> thing<00:03:17.510> we<00:03:17.600> want<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:17.900> do<00:03:18.020> is<00:03:18.320> turn

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
imaged one thing we want to do is turn

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.390 
imaged one thing we want to do is turn
off<00:03:19.370> any<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:20.330> know<00:03:20.420> bad<00:03:21.290> sector<00:03:21.830> issues<00:03:22.010> that

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
off any you know bad sector issues that

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.830 
off any you know bad sector issues that
it<00:03:22.490> might<00:03:22.670> have<00:03:22.880> if<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:23.150> comes<00:03:23.300> across<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.570> bad

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
it might have if it comes across a bad

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.230 
it might have if it comes across a bad
sector<00:03:24.370> we<00:03:25.370> don't<00:03:25.580> want<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.000> try<00:03:26.180> to

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
sector we don't want it to try to

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.750 
sector we don't want it to try to
rewrite<00:03:26.720> reread<00:03:27.500> those<00:03:27.710> bad<00:03:27.950> sectors<00:03:28.490> we<00:03:28.610> want

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
rewrite reread those bad sectors we want

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.370 
rewrite reread those bad sectors we want
to<00:03:28.910> be<00:03:29.030> able<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.390> skip<00:03:30.050> those<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:32.140> we<00:03:33.140> will<00:03:33.170> go

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
to be able to skip those and we will go

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.490 
to be able to skip those and we will go
through<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.800> start<00:03:34.720> imaging<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:36.290> first

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
through and start imaging the first

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.260 
through and start imaging the first
thing<00:03:36.620> it's<00:03:36.740> going<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:36.950> do<00:03:37.100> is<00:03:37.310> load<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.610> map<00:03:37.970> of

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
thing it's going to do is load a map of

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.910 
thing it's going to do is load a map of
that<00:03:38.660> original<00:03:38.900> drive<00:03:39.380> on<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.830> our

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
that original drive on to our

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.820 
that original drive on to our
destination<00:03:39.950> drive<00:03:40.960> so<00:03:41.960> that<00:03:42.110> I<00:03:42.410> keep<00:03:42.620> track

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
destination drive so that I keep track

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.020 
destination drive so that I keep track
of<00:03:42.980> everything<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.460> at<00:03:43.520> this<00:03:43.670> point<00:03:43.910> right

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
of everything and at this point right

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.330 
of everything and at this point right
now<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.240> imaging<00:03:44.780> process<00:03:44.930> is<00:03:45.320> started<00:03:45.709> over

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
now the imaging process is started over

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.790 
now the imaging process is started over
here<00:03:46.490> is<00:03:46.610> basically<00:03:46.940> just<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.240> raw<00:03:47.420> x<00:03:47.750> over<00:03:48.680> to

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
here is basically just the raw x over to

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.670 
here is basically just the raw x over to
the<00:03:48.890> right<00:03:49.100> that<00:03:49.400> shows<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.450> know<00:03:50.680> that

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
the right that shows you you know that

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.660 
the right that shows you you know that
is<00:03:52.540> basically<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.780> data<00:03:53.930> right<00:03:54.230> there<00:03:54.670> and

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
is basically the data right there and

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.520 
is basically the data right there and
then<00:03:55.970> everything<00:03:56.420> else<00:03:56.660> included<00:03:57.200> within<00:03:57.350> the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
then everything else included within the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.180 
then everything else included within the
hex<00:03:57.740> as<00:03:57.980> well<00:03:59.350> down<00:04:00.350> here<00:04:00.410> we<00:04:00.740> start<00:04:01.010> getting

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
hex as well down here we start getting

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.710 
hex as well down here we start getting
an<00:04:01.280> idea<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.670> what<00:04:01.880> we're<00:04:02.030> looking<00:04:02.300> at<00:04:02.360> at<00:04:02.510> data

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
an idea of what we're looking at at data

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.470 
an idea of what we're looking at at data
we've<00:04:03.620> got<00:04:03.860> Microsoft<00:04:04.610> Office<00:04:04.970> files<00:04:05.209> here

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
we've got Microsoft Office files here

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.390 
we've got Microsoft Office files here
we've<00:04:05.630> got<00:04:05.780> about<00:04:05.900> 520<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.709> them<00:04:06.800> so<00:04:07.010> far<00:04:07.220> we're

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
we've got about 520 of them so far we're

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.370 
we've got about 520 of them so far we're
only<00:04:07.430> one<00:04:07.730> percent<00:04:08.090> into<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.570> we've<00:04:09.170> already

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
only one percent into it we've already

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.940 
only one percent into it we've already
got<00:04:09.650> over<00:04:09.950> six<00:04:10.610> thousand<00:04:11.060> seven<00:04:11.480> thousand

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
got over six thousand seven thousand

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.949 
got over six thousand seven thousand
picture<00:04:12.950> files<00:04:13.220> right<00:04:13.520> now<00:04:13.550> and<00:04:14.030> like<00:04:14.750> I<00:04:14.780> said

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
picture files right now and like I said

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.680 
picture files right now and like I said
we're<00:04:15.110> only<00:04:15.200> one<00:04:15.410> percent<00:04:15.740> into<00:04:16.390> know<00:04:17.390> what

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
we're only one percent into know what

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.789 
we're only one percent into know what
this<00:04:18.070> what's<00:04:19.070> good<00:04:19.310> about<00:04:19.549> imaging<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.450> drive

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
this what's good about imaging a drive

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.890 
this what's good about imaging a drive
utilizing<00:04:21.799> this<00:04:21.980> type<00:04:22.220> of<00:04:22.250> process<00:04:22.880> is<00:04:23.150> the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
utilizing this type of process is the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.830 
utilizing this type of process is the
fact<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:24.290> when<00:04:24.470> we<00:04:24.500> hit<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.800> bad<00:04:25.040> sector<00:04:25.840> it's

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
fact that when we hit a bad sector it's

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.570 
fact that when we hit a bad sector it's
not<00:04:27.050> going<00:04:27.169> to<00:04:27.229> try<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.440> reread<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:27.919> it's

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
not going to try to reread that it's

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.820 
not going to try to reread that it's
going

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
going

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.640 
going
go<00:04:28.920> through<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.400> skip<00:04:29.790> right<00:04:30.240> past<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:30.930> it's

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
go through and skip right past that it's

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.560 
go through and skip right past that it's
gonna<00:04:31.920> hit<00:04:32.130> that<00:04:32.160> area<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.210> gonna<00:04:33.360> say

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
gonna hit that area and it's gonna say

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.690 
gonna hit that area and it's gonna say
oh<00:04:33.810> I<00:04:34.080> can't<00:04:34.380> read<00:04:34.560> that<00:04:34.590> within<00:04:34.980> whatever<00:04:35.520> a

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
oh I can't read that within whatever a

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.130 
oh I can't read that within whatever a
lot<00:04:35.910> of<00:04:36.030> time<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.360> we<00:04:36.480> have<00:04:36.660> it<00:04:36.810> set<00:04:37.020> up<00:04:37.050> for

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
lot of time that we have it set up for

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.590 
lot of time that we have it set up for
typically<00:04:37.890> it's<00:04:38.070> about<00:04:38.130> 700<00:04:38.820> milliseconds<00:04:39.450> or

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
typically it's about 700 milliseconds or

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.590 
typically it's about 700 milliseconds or
so<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:41.010> it'll<00:04:41.370> make<00:04:41.490> one<00:04:41.850> sweep<00:04:42.240> through<00:04:42.510> the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
so and it'll make one sweep through the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.960 
so and it'll make one sweep through the
drive<00:04:42.870> just<00:04:43.230> like<00:04:43.980> this<00:04:44.250> like<00:04:44.580> it's<00:04:44.730> going

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
drive just like this like it's going

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:45.530 
drive just like this like it's going
right<00:04:45.150> now

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
right now

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.280 
right now
any<00:04:46.530> bad<00:04:46.740> sectors<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.430> runs<00:04:47.550> into<00:04:48.290> it's

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
any bad sectors that it runs into it's

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.140 
any bad sectors that it runs into it's
going<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.710> ignore<00:04:49.980> those<00:04:50.220> at<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:50.550> point<00:04:50.880> and

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
going to ignore those at this point and

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.350 
going to ignore those at this point and
it's<00:04:51.420> gonna<00:04:51.600> skip<00:04:51.900> about<00:04:52.140> 120<00:04:52.770> sectors<00:04:53.360> so

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
it's gonna skip about 120 sectors so

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.610 
it's gonna skip about 120 sectors so
what<00:04:54.540> we'll<00:04:54.660> do<00:04:54.780> is<00:04:54.810> if<00:04:54.990> we<00:04:55.020> runs<00:04:55.260> into<00:04:55.440> a<00:04:55.470> bad

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
what we'll do is if we runs into a bad

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.070 
what we'll do is if we runs into a bad
sector<00:04:56.100> it's<00:04:56.700> gonna<00:04:56.940> skip<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.390> next<00:04:57.510> 120

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
sector it's gonna skip the next 120

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.470 
sector it's gonna skip the next 120
sectors<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:58.860> just<00:04:59.700> in<00:04:59.790> case<00:04:59.970> that<00:05:00.180> there's<00:05:00.360> an

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
sectors and just in case that there's an

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.170 
sectors and just in case that there's an
area<00:05:00.810> there<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.200> drive<00:05:01.380> that's<00:05:01.590> bad<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.250> from

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
area there the drive that's bad and from

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.930 
area there the drive that's bad and from
there<00:05:03.410> what<00:05:04.410> we'll<00:05:04.560> do<00:05:04.740> is<00:05:04.980> it'll<00:05:05.430> actually<00:05:05.610> go

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
there what we'll do is it'll actually go

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.300 
there what we'll do is it'll actually go
through<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.540> complete<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.230> imaging<00:05:07.740> process

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
through and complete the imaging process

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.660 
through and complete the imaging process
and<00:05:08.610> then<00:05:09.420> it'll<00:05:10.050> go<00:05:10.260> back<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.890> start<00:05:11.340> again

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
and then it'll go back and start again

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.180 
and then it'll go back and start again
and<00:05:11.910> then<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.360> will<00:05:12.450> only<00:05:12.600> focus<00:05:13.200> on<00:05:13.380> those

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
and then it will only focus on those

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.920 
and then it will only focus on those
sectors<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:14.670> were<00:05:15.000> unread<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.720> first

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
sectors that were unread the first

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.100 
sectors that were unread the first
during<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.650> first<00:05:16.890> pass<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.960> what<00:05:18.960> that

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
during the first pass and what that

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.840 
during the first pass and what that
allows<00:05:19.350> us<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:19.680> do<00:05:19.830> is<00:05:20.040> to<00:05:20.250> be<00:05:20.370> able<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.670> get

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
allows us to do is to be able to get

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.540 
allows us to do is to be able to get
figure<00:05:21.090> how<00:05:21.930> it<00:05:22.140> reads<00:05:22.410> those<00:05:22.770> sectors<00:05:23.100> on

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
figure how it reads those sectors on

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.170 
figure how it reads those sectors on
that<00:05:24.300> secondary<00:05:24.780> pass<00:05:25.140> so<00:05:26.070> if<00:05:26.610> we<00:05:26.880> want<00:05:27.120> to

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
that secondary pass so if we want to

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.970 
that secondary pass so if we want to
have<00:05:27.330> certain<00:05:27.690> parameters<00:05:27.930> set<00:05:28.530> up<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.800> where

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
have certain parameters set up to where

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.980 
have certain parameters set up to where
let's<00:05:29.820> say<00:05:30.000> it<00:05:30.090> spends<00:05:30.390> a<00:05:30.420> little<00:05:30.600> more<00:05:30.750> time

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
let's say it spends a little more time

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.470 
let's say it spends a little more time
on<00:05:31.020> those<00:05:31.350> sectors<00:05:31.790> we<00:05:32.790> can<00:05:32.910> have<00:05:33.090> it<00:05:33.180> ignore

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
on those sectors we can have it ignore

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.460 
on those sectors we can have it ignore
any<00:05:34.230> ECC<00:05:34.950> errors<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:35.520> come<00:05:35.700> up<00:05:36.410> there's<00:05:37.410> a

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
any ECC errors that come up there's a

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.930 
any ECC errors that come up there's a
lot<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:37.950> different<00:05:38.250> things<00:05:38.340> that<00:05:38.520> we<00:05:38.610> can<00:05:38.790> do

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
lot of different things that we can do

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.440 
lot of different things that we can do
and<00:05:39.330> all<00:05:39.570> of<00:05:39.810> it<00:05:39.930> is<00:05:39.960> with<00:05:40.350> the<00:05:40.470> goal<00:05:40.650> of

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
and all of it is with the goal of

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.480 
and all of it is with the goal of
imaging<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.480> drive<00:05:42.840> by<00:05:43.740> putting<00:05:44.040> the<00:05:44.130> least

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
imaging the drive by putting the least

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.730 
imaging the drive by putting the least
amount<00:05:45.090> of<00:05:45.300> load<00:05:45.570> on<00:05:45.750> the<00:05:45.840> drive<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:46.410> we<00:05:46.500> can

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
amount of load on the drive that we can

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.550 
amount of load on the drive that we can
because<00:05:47.700> right<00:05:47.910> now<00:05:48.120> this<00:05:48.840> is<00:05:49.020> a<00:05:49.050> hard<00:05:49.260> drive

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
because right now this is a hard drive

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.380 
because right now this is a hard drive
that<00:05:49.590> when<00:05:50.040> you<00:05:50.130> go<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:50.400> this<00:05:51.060> particular

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
that when you go to this particular

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.450 
that when you go to this particular
drive<00:05:51.690> that<00:05:51.840> we're<00:05:51.960> imaging<00:05:52.410> right<00:05:52.590> now

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
drive that we're imaging right now

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.350 
drive that we're imaging right now
when<00:05:53.850> you<00:05:54.000> connect<00:05:54.810> this<00:05:54.930> drive<00:05:55.260> to<00:05:55.290> a<00:05:55.560> system

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
when you connect this drive to a system

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.850 
when you connect this drive to a system
it<00:05:57.360> won't<00:05:57.600> even<00:05:57.840> allow<00:05:57.900> the<00:05:58.020> system<00:05:58.500> to<00:05:58.560> load

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
it won't even allow the system to load

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.520 
it won't even allow the system to load
right<00:05:59.160> now<00:05:59.510> it'll<00:06:00.510> get<00:06:00.660> to<00:06:00.780> a<00:06:00.810> point<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:01.350> hit

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
right now it'll get to a point and hit

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.880 
right now it'll get to a point and hit
some<00:06:01.740> bad<00:06:01.890> sectors<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:02.810> it<00:06:03.810> just<00:06:04.230> it'll<00:06:04.710> sit

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
some bad sectors and it just it'll sit

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.950 
some bad sectors and it just it'll sit
there<00:06:05.040> and<00:06:05.130> steadily<00:06:05.490> click<00:06:06.030> steadily<00:06:06.660> click

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
there and steadily click steadily click

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.480 
there and steadily click steadily click
and<00:06:07.230> a<00:06:07.350> lot<00:06:07.530> of<00:06:07.620> people<00:06:07.860> assume<00:06:08.130> even<00:06:08.340> the

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
and a lot of people assume even the

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.010 
and a lot of people assume even the
customer<00:06:08.850> isn't<00:06:09.030> the<00:06:09.180> same<00:06:09.360> assume<00:06:09.720> that<00:06:09.930> the

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
customer isn't the same assume that the

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.480 
customer isn't the same assume that the
drive<00:06:10.230> that<00:06:10.440> has<00:06:10.650> a<00:06:10.710> mechanical<00:06:11.310> problem

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
drive that has a mechanical problem

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.710 
drive that has a mechanical problem
because<00:06:11.850> that's<00:06:12.000> what<00:06:12.150> it<00:06:12.240> sounds<00:06:12.510> like<00:06:12.630> it

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
because that's what it sounds like it

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.660 
because that's what it sounds like it
sounds<00:06:12.960> like<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.170> heads<00:06:13.350> are<00:06:13.500> bad<00:06:13.650> but<00:06:14.430> as<00:06:14.550> you

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.670 
sounds like the heads are bad but as you

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.210 
sounds like the heads are bad but as you
can<00:06:14.790> see<00:06:14.940> right<00:06:15.120> now<00:06:15.440> we're<00:06:16.440> getting<00:06:16.710> a<00:06:16.950> lot<00:06:17.160> of

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
can see right now we're getting a lot of

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.490 
can see right now we're getting a lot of
data<00:06:17.430> off<00:06:17.670> of<00:06:17.700> here<00:06:18.150> we're<00:06:18.360> about<00:06:18.450> 6%<00:06:18.990> into<00:06:19.410> it

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
data off of here we're about 6% into it

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.560 
data off of here we're about 6% into it
right<00:06:19.650> now<00:06:19.710> we've<00:06:20.040> already<00:06:20.190> got<00:06:20.370> 17,000<00:06:21.330> image

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
right now we've already got 17,000 image

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.770 
right now we've already got 17,000 image
files<00:06:21.840> off<00:06:22.080> of<00:06:22.110> here<00:06:22.440> and<00:06:22.620> over<00:06:22.830> a<00:06:22.860> thousand

Microsoft Office type files and we're

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.010 
Microsoft Office type files and we're
only<00:06:27.360> 7%<00:06:27.750> into<00:06:28.290> it<00:06:29.000> but<00:06:30.000> we<00:06:30.390> haven't<00:06:30.690> had<00:06:30.930> to

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
only 7% into it but we haven't had to

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.300 
only 7% into it but we haven't had to
take<00:06:31.170> this<00:06:31.290> drive<00:06:31.500> into<00:06:31.710> a<00:06:31.800> cleanroom<00:06:32.040> we

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
take this drive into a cleanroom we

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.590 
take this drive into a cleanroom we
haven't<00:06:32.580> had<00:06:32.670> to<00:06:32.760> go<00:06:32.880> through<00:06:33.150> and<00:06:33.270> make<00:06:33.390> any

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
haven't had to go through and make any

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.830 
haven't had to go through and make any
necessary<00:06:33.750> repairs<00:06:34.140> to<00:06:34.890> it<00:06:35.010> because<00:06:35.840> even

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
necessary repairs to it because even

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.299 
necessary repairs to it because even
though<00:06:37.200> this<00:06:37.380> drive<00:06:37.680> is<00:06:37.710> right<00:06:38.370> on<00:06:38.520> the<00:06:38.640> verge

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:39.309 
though this drive is right on the verge

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:42.029 
though this drive is right on the verge
possibly<00:06:39.969> having<00:06:40.119> a<00:06:40.239> mechanical<00:06:40.749> failure<00:06:41.039> we

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 
possibly having a mechanical failure we

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:43.319 
possibly having a mechanical failure we
were<00:06:42.099> able<00:06:42.279> to<00:06:42.429> go<00:06:42.579> through<00:06:42.849> and<00:06:42.999> save<00:06:43.179> our

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:43.329 
were able to go through and save our

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:45.449 
were able to go through and save our
customer<00:06:43.689> quite<00:06:44.019> a<00:06:44.049> bit<00:06:44.229> of<00:06:44.319> money<00:06:44.499> without

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:45.459 
customer quite a bit of money without

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:48.599 
customer quite a bit of money without
having<00:06:45.939> to<00:06:46.059> go<00:06:46.569> that<00:06:46.749> route<00:06:47.279> simply<00:06:48.279> because

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:48.609 
having to go that route simply because

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:50.189 
having to go that route simply because
of<00:06:48.639> the<00:06:48.789> utilities<00:06:49.299> that<00:06:49.329> we<00:06:49.569> use<00:06:49.779> the<00:06:49.989> tools

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 
of the utilities that we use the tools

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:54.119 
of the utilities that we use the tools
that<00:06:50.319> we<00:06:50.469> have<00:06:50.649> here<00:06:51.009> so<00:06:52.619> basically<00:06:53.619> this<00:06:53.859> will

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:54.129 
that we have here so basically this will

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:56.309 
that we have here so basically this will
go<00:06:54.459> through<00:06:54.489> and<00:06:54.879> run<00:06:55.119> and<00:06:55.449> complete<00:06:56.199> the

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 
go through and run and complete the

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.799 
go through and run and complete the
imaging<00:06:56.679> process<00:06:56.859> and<00:06:57.429> once<00:06:57.609> that's<00:06:57.819> done<00:06:58.029> we

00:06:58.799 --> 00:06:58.809 
imaging process and once that's done we

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:00.689 
imaging process and once that's done we
will<00:06:58.989> go<00:06:59.319> through<00:06:59.589> from<00:06:59.859> there<00:07:00.069> and<00:07:00.339> actually

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
will go through from there and actually

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.229 
will go through from there and actually
do<00:07:00.879> the<00:07:00.909> recovery<00:07:01.689> from<00:07:02.559> that<00:07:03.519> clone<00:07:03.849> to<00:07:03.999> copy

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:04.239 
do the recovery from that clone to copy

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:06.089 
do the recovery from that clone to copy
that<00:07:04.479> we<00:07:04.629> have<00:07:04.869> and<00:07:05.169> we<00:07:05.349> know<00:07:05.499> that<00:07:05.709> that<00:07:05.799> drive

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099 
that we have and we know that that drive

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.549 
that we have and we know that that drive
is<00:07:06.279> perfectly<00:07:06.939> fine<00:07:07.779> there's<00:07:08.139> nothing

00:07:08.549 --> 00:07:08.559 
is perfectly fine there's nothing

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:10.909 
is perfectly fine there's nothing
mechanically<00:07:09.129> wrong<00:07:09.279> with<00:07:09.459> it<00:07:09.579> at<00:07:09.699> all<00:07:09.879> so

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 
mechanically wrong with it at all so

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:13.679 
mechanically wrong with it at all so
that's<00:07:11.919> how<00:07:12.219> this<00:07:12.369> works<00:07:12.669> that's<00:07:13.209> the<00:07:13.419> first

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:13.689 
that's how this works that's the first

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:16.409 
that's how this works that's the first
step<00:07:13.899> typically<00:07:14.379> in<00:07:14.499> the<00:07:14.589> process<00:07:15.099> and<00:07:15.419> just

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419 
step typically in the process and just

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:18.239 
step typically in the process and just
wanted<00:07:16.959> to<00:07:17.019> show<00:07:17.169> you<00:07:17.229> a<00:07:17.289> little<00:07:17.559> bit<00:07:17.709> of<00:07:17.739> how

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:18.249 
wanted to show you a little bit of how

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:20.129 
wanted to show you a little bit of how
we<00:07:18.309> go<00:07:19.059> about<00:07:19.089> doing<00:07:19.569> these<00:07:19.719> some<00:07:19.989> of<00:07:20.019> these

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:20.139 
we go about doing these some of these

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.899 
we go about doing these some of these
recoveries<00:07:20.529> we<00:07:20.919> have<00:07:21.039> a<00:07:21.069> couple<00:07:21.309> other<00:07:21.459> videos

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:21.909 
recoveries we have a couple other videos

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:23.850 
recoveries we have a couple other videos
out<00:07:22.149> showing<00:07:22.599> us<00:07:22.809> doing<00:07:23.469> some<00:07:23.679> of<00:07:23.769> the
