stuff<00:00:19.410> on<00:00:19.590> clearance<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.250> they<00:00:20.820> don't<00:00:21.000> really

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
stuff on clearance and they don't really

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.050

have<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.330> link<00:00:21.539> subsection<00:00:22.140> anymore<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
have a link subsection anymore so I

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.550 
have a link subsection anymore so I
think<00:00:24.269> they<00:00:24.689> might<00:00:24.900> still<00:00:25.109> have<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.350> online

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560

been<00:01:48.450> more<00:01:48.630> interesting<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:50.060> probably

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
been more interesting but I probably

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.870 
been more interesting but I probably
wouldn't<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.509> got<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.070> stores<00:01:53.070> because

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
wouldn't have got it in stores because

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.850 
wouldn't have got it in stores because
these<00:01:54.090> were<00:01:54.270> kind<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.540> expensive<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
these were kind of expensive and I

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.560 
these were kind of expensive and I
wasn't<00:01:56.490> really<00:01:56.579> interested<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.299> pack

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
wasn't really interested in this pack

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.219 
wasn't really interested in this pack
but<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.590> zoomix<00:01:59.250> collection<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.719> all<00:02:00.899> six

making<00:06:31.499> minifigures<00:06:32.129> since<00:06:32.430> the<00:06:32.610> tricks<00:06:32.879> and

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
making minifigures since the tricks and

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.420 
making minifigures since the tricks and
Harmonix<00:06:33.659> ones<00:06:33.900> that<00:06:34.050> came<00:06:34.199> out<00:06:34.379> and<00:06:34.680> that's

Harmonix ones that came out and that's

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.909 
Harmonix ones that came out and that's
probably<00:06:35.789> because<00:06:36.240> the<00:06:36.960> minifigures<00:06:37.590> didn't

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
probably because the minifigures didn't

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.769 
probably because the minifigures didn't
sell<00:06:38.129> that<00:06:38.159> well<00:06:38.520> and<00:06:38.999> I<00:06:39.389> thought<00:06:39.509> they<00:06:39.689> were
