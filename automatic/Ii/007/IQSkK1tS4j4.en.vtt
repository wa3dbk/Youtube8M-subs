this<00:00:00.240> film<00:00:00.480> goes<00:00:00.690> a<00:00:00.719> lot<00:00:00.960> further<00:00:01.260> than<00:00:01.500> the

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
this film goes a lot further than the

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.610 
this film goes a lot further than the
2009<00:00:02.370> one<00:00:02.580> doesn't<00:00:02.909> it<00:00:02.970> character-wise<00:00:03.689> just

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
2009 one doesn't it character-wise just

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.249 
2009 one doesn't it character-wise just
seems<00:00:04.830> bigger<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.640> sort<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.299> Boulder<00:00:06.839> if<00:00:07.080> I

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
seems bigger and sort of Boulder if I

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.750 
seems bigger and sort of Boulder if I
can<00:00:07.470> boy<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.649> think<00:00:07.830> its<00:00:08.099> border<00:00:08.370> because<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
can boy I think its border because the

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.430 
can boy I think its border because the
these<00:00:09.030> characters<00:00:09.510> are<00:00:09.540> faced<00:00:09.870> with<00:00:09.900> kind<00:00:10.320> of

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
these characters are faced with kind of

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.200 
these characters are faced with kind of
the<00:00:10.559> absolute<00:00:11.160> opposites<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.849> what<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.120> would

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
the absolute opposites of what you would

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.999 
the absolute opposites of what you would
expect<00:00:12.570> from<00:00:12.809> them<00:00:13.049> for<00:00:13.259> someone<00:00:13.590> like<00:00:13.679> Kirk

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
expect from them for someone like Kirk

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.829 
expect from them for someone like Kirk
who's<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.429> self-assured<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.389> first<00:00:15.630> film

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
who's so self-assured in the first film

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.779 
who's so self-assured in the first film
I<00:00:15.990> think<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.440> second<00:00:16.830> he's<00:00:16.920> met<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
I think in the second he's met with the

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.080 
I think in the second he's met with the
incredible<00:00:18.119> amount<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.600> self-doubt<00:00:19.109> and

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
incredible amount of self-doubt and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.460 
incredible amount of self-doubt and
that's<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.180> scary<00:00:21.390> place<00:00:21.600> for<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.930> guy<00:00:22.260> like<00:00:22.289> that

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
that's a scary place for a guy like that

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.099 
that's a scary place for a guy like that
to<00:00:22.769> be<00:00:22.890> inserting<00:00:23.400> for<00:00:23.580> Spock<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.300> man<00:00:24.720> who's<00:00:24.900> so

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
to be inserting for Spock a man who's so

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.970 
to be inserting for Spock a man who's so
kind<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.410> close<00:00:25.710> lidded<00:00:26.180> close<00:00:27.180> lidded<00:00:27.800> you<00:00:28.800> do

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
kind of close lidded close lidded you do

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.709 
kind of close lidded close lidded you do
have<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.279> mic<00:00:29.460> night<00:00:29.699> yeah<00:00:30.179> um<00:00:30.920> close<00:00:31.920> would<00:00:32.130> uh

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719

talk<00:00:33.719> about<00:00:33.960> Spock<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.559> mean<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.489> think<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
talk about Spock I mean I think the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.729 
talk about Spock I mean I think the
first<00:00:35.910> movie<00:00:36.270> was<00:00:36.390> about<00:00:36.540> spa<00:00:36.960> grappling<00:00:37.590> with

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
first movie was about spa grappling with

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.229 
first movie was about spa grappling with
his<00:00:37.860> humanity<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.610> movies<00:00:38.910> about<00:00:38.969> him

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
his humanity and this movies about him

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.590 
his humanity and this movies about him
embracing<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:41.030> that<00:00:42.030> allows<00:00:42.300> him<00:00:42.570> to

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
embracing it and and that allows him to

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.330 
embracing it and and that allows him to
be<00:00:42.930> more<00:00:43.079> vulnerable<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.770> allows<00:00:43.950> him<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> be

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
be more vulnerable and allows him to be

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.920 
be more vulnerable and allows him to be
witnessed<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.850> his<00:00:44.969> vulnerability<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.780> way

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
witnessed in his vulnerability in a way

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.770 
witnessed in his vulnerability in a way
that<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.879> uncharacteristic<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.390> history

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that is uncharacteristic for the history

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.160 
that is uncharacteristic for the history
of<00:00:49.070> of<00:00:50.070> his<00:00:50.340> journey<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.300> important<00:00:51.960> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
of of his journey but it's important I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
of of his journey but it's important I
think<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.680> he<00:00:53.399> evolved<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
think that he evolved and that the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.670 
think that he evolved and that the
relationship<00:00:54.840> between<00:00:55.050> Kirk<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.649> Spock

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
relationship between Kirk and Spock

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.700 
relationship between Kirk and Spock
evolved<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.510> that's<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.320> big<00:00:58.500> part

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
evolved and and that's a really big part

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
evolved and and that's a really big part
of<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.399> movie<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> would<00:00:59.879> say<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.180> really<00:01:00.449> at

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
of this movie I would say it's really at

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.660

that<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:41.009> mayhem<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.939> Benedict<00:01:42.420> is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
that the mayhem that the Benedict is

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.740 
that the mayhem that the Benedict is
wielding<00:01:43.790> without<00:01:44.790> doing<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.360> much<00:01:45.600> i

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
wielding without doing all that much i

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.149 
wielding without doing all that much i
think<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.079> quite<00:01:46.200> something<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.950> wherever

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
think is quite something and wherever

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.520 
think is quite something and wherever
star<00:01:47.490> trek<00:01:47.700> goes<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.329> followed<00:01:48.930> by<00:01:49.020> hardcore

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
star trek goes it's followed by hardcore
