 Hello dear friends with you drive 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.759

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.760

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.269
 I am glad and would not like to talk 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.000
 banal words because on many 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.199
 channels all do this in principle you 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 many times probably heard it but 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.860
 this is probably saying banality now 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.500
 that i am very grateful to you oh actually 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.950

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.610
 no other way 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.520

 roughly speaking and now let's move on 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.040
 already ok precisely to the importance of the importance of everything 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.550
 vidos here I reached 100,000 subscribers I 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.220
 planned here 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.750
 do so to say you know when the plane 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.640
 takes off he has a point of no return 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.410
 when he can't brake and stay 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.840
 on the runway u only him fly up 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.760
 it is possible and all of you now I thought that 5000 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.619
 for me just for me not speaking there 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.050
 about all for me this is the point of no return and 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.300
 then I have already started youtube means to me 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.660
 we need them to deal with us 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.820
 plan as i wanted and so i reached 5000 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.360
 subscribers and I planned besides gta 5 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.880
 thousand wants can no longer speak a word 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.370

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.380
 megaton and in this I want to attract you 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.860
 what games would you like to see because 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.480
 that the main thing for me is that I could 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.570
 please my audience that is not 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.160
 only due to gt5 and maybe another 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.680
 another little content there is sometimes 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.300
 there will be other videos on different 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.210
 games, for example, I would like to ask 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.140
 anyone love the game fifa because 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.020
 we have a motto with my friend and and bought and 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.000
 playing together on the net is very fun and 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.470
 what else brightened the blockage and I would like 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.989
 sometimes for example once a week 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.330
 some resurrection battle was cry 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.800
 Sunday's battles and I can not 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.780
 speak sunday battle 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.080
 YouTube do when we will in this 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.400
 FIFA on the net 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.050
 for example, yes, the same weekly 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.790
 sunday is quite me what will it be 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.980
 fun we will have what some 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.690
 competitive some championship will 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.610
 daisy com with yes and why ours and therefore 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.670
 so write a comment I certainly 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.730
 I always read everything I think about 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.350
 so that you write I read to 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.739
 write this video which would have won 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.410
 wanted to see yes very interesting to me 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:42.550
 would also like to ask about 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.709
 ideas like making top 5 or top 10 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.800
 most likely the top 5 is more familiar 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.420
 rich 5 for example you will send 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.790
 I have a cool moment to try on 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.310
 ultra kill thread when you are on the server 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.680
 just beast all hell to kill or 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.630
 for example, some kind of stunt on the plane 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.370
 which you performed an example fly by 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.800
 I donâ€™t know the bridge by driving one 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.930
 finger I do not know 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.540
 just kidding roughly do the trick there on 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.780
 a motorcycle on a plane or do a series 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.490
 kills and you will if naturally 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.120
 want to send me this whole thing 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.680
 I got a wheel and I will do 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.820
 top 5 ie choose a winner 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.590
 put on 5 4 3 2 1 place 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.750
 well of course it is optional it 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.980
 everything depends on you if you will 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.990
 send if you want guys i 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.990
 leave my mail in the description 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.920
 where you can throw a video either 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.710
 links from yu tuba on your video I them 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.020
 download youtube and either for example you can 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.480
 I also write VKontakte in the group you 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.800
 can find my page gta she 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.810
 so was my page 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.330
 VKontakte there I can throw off 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.010
 leads and mail it to the post office here 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.990
 You can give direct videos which you 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.850
 recorded this can attach files 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.150
 as well as VKontakte can be attached 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.660
 files from your computer and if 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.300
 typed so to say a lot of videos will be 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.610
 such series will come out 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.060
 I'm already 2 wheels pierced afraid of me 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.970
 soon they must be killed before we go over them 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.160
 fall they lost me let's 2 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.669
 now there are no new weapons 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.830
 want 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.650
 relatively be 5w and take and where is the whole 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.729
 all the police, okay, and I also wanted 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.639
 ask you about 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.969
 webcam video that is when you will 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.800
 see me my lively reaction to 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:39.159
 what is happening here is by the way my finger again 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.669
 from the elevator which one but i think it is not 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.270
 and so 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:45.189
 such an important topic in the pca but still on 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.039
 wish if you have such desire 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:50.589
 or or do you like to watch just 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:54.219
 the same for example racing the same gameplay not 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:55.809
 distracted by the grandmother then please for those 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.819
 I want to decorate this jeep 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:06:01.300
 if they don't kill me right now 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:04.749

 supplements again everything depends on you but 

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:21.370
 for me the main idea is other games 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.589
 who would you like to see because 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.539
 need to somehow dilute gta or 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.550
 on the contrary, you only want gta 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.919
