defenders will post up on this side and
block<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:37.200> hoop<00:00:37.380> from<00:00:37.530> scoring<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.219> that's

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
block the hoop from scoring if that's

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.240 
block the hoop from scoring if that's
the<00:00:39.239> case<00:00:39.500> number<00:00:40.500> four<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.010> come

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the case number four is going to come

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.150 
the case number four is going to come
through<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.690> set<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> pick<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.559> guys<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
through here set a pick on the guys and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.860 
through here set a pick on the guys and
number<00:00:44.789> five<00:00:45.059> will<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.329> able<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.570> come<00:00:45.750> in

number five will be able to come in
right<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.500> accept<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> pass<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.629> try

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
right here and accept the pass and try

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.470 
right here and accept the pass and try
and<00:00:48.780> go<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.379> shot<00:00:49.940> just<00:00:50.940> turn<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.239> shoot

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and go in for a shot just turn and shoot

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.990 
and go in for a shot just turn and shoot
now

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
now

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.580 
now
the<00:00:54.000> other<00:00:54.149> scenario<00:00:54.570> or<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.199> rest<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.500> that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the other scenario or the rest of that

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.619 
the other scenario or the rest of that
play<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.699> player<00:00:56.969> number<00:00:57.210> one<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
play is then that player number one is

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.880 
play is then that player number one is
going<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.870> shoot<00:00:58.079> off<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.440> way

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
going to shoot off this way

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.250 
going to shoot off this way
and<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.699> also<00:00:59.850> be<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> pass<00:01:00.539> option<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
and that can also be a pass option and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.410 
and that can also be a pass option and
number<00:01:01.920> two<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.789> run<00:01:03.000> around<00:01:03.120> on

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
number two is going to run around on

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.219 
number two is going to run around on
this<00:01:03.629> side<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.350> also<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.680> an<00:01:05.070> outlet

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
this side and that can also be an outlet

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.130 
this side and that can also be an outlet
solution<00:01:07.490> then<00:01:08.490> after<00:01:08.850> number<00:01:09.000> four<00:01:09.420> has<00:01:09.780> set

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
solution then after number four has set

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.280 
solution then after number four has set
the<00:01:10.680> pick<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.189> his<00:01:11.670> two<00:01:11.880> players<00:01:12.180> he<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.080> come

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the pick on his two players he can come

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.340 
the pick on his two players he can come
up<00:01:13.320> here<00:01:13.830> or<00:01:14.010> he<00:01:14.340> can<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:14.670> over<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.540> also

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
up here or he can go over here and also

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.380 
up here or he can go over here and also
come<00:01:16.770> out<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.580> another<00:01:17.850> option<00:01:18.240> as

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
come out here and be another option as

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.570 
come out here and be another option as
well<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:19.350> since<00:01:19.619> these<00:01:19.799> defenders<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.549> going

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
well so since these defenders are going

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.370 
well so since these defenders are going
to<00:01:20.820> kind<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.630> know<00:01:21.720> scrambling<00:01:22.259> around

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
to kind of be you know scrambling around

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.429 
to kind of be you know scrambling around
trying<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.220> back<00:01:23.400> onto<00:01:23.580> their<00:01:23.729> players

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
trying to get back onto their players

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.870 
trying to get back onto their players
number<00:01:25.439> four<00:01:25.770> has<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> lot<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> options<00:01:26.729> of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
number four has a lot of options of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.460 
number four has a lot of options of
where<00:01:27.030> he<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.299> be<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.689> order<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:27.990> be<00:01:28.080> visible

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
where he can be in order to be visible

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.990 
where he can be in order to be visible
for<00:01:28.740> number<00:01:28.950> three<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> solution<00:01:29.640> there

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
for number three to be a solution there

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.530 
for number three to be a solution there
as<00:01:30.090> well

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
as well

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.219 
as well
if<00:01:31.280> for<00:01:32.280> some<00:01:32.310> reason<00:01:33.030> let's<00:01:33.689> let<00:01:33.869> these<00:01:34.020> guys

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
if for some reason let's let these guys

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.950 
if for some reason let's let these guys
back<00:01:34.439> up<00:01:34.619> again<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.850> some<00:01:36.060> reason<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
back up again and for some reason the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.490 
back up again and for some reason the
defenders<00:01:37.470> are<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> other<00:01:37.979> side<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:40.350> maybe

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
defenders are on the other side so maybe

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.580 
defenders are on the other side so maybe
we<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.680> some<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.049> then<00:01:43.049> maybe<00:01:43.259> one<00:01:43.500> of

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
we have some here and then maybe one of

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.560 
we have some here and then maybe one of
these<00:01:43.710> guys<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.979> stuck<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.520> over<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
these guys that stuck out over here and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.109 
these guys that stuck out over here and
if<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.500> defender<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.640> player<00:01:47.820> number

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
if this defender is for player number

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.179 
if this defender is for player number
four<00:01:48.420> he's<00:01:48.810> gonna<00:01:48.930> go<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.380> them<00:01:49.590> hopefully

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
four he's gonna go with them hopefully

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.460 
four he's gonna go with them hopefully
right<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.700> then<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.390> case<00:01:51.450> number<00:01:52.259> four

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
right and then in this case number four

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.710 
right and then in this case number four
would<00:01:52.560> set<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> block<00:01:53.100> here<00:01:53.549> or<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> pick<00:01:54.450> here

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
would set a block here or a pick here

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.030 
would set a block here or a pick here
and<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:54.990> number<00:01:55.200> five<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.530> come<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
and then number five can come in and

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.660 
and then number five can come in and
shoot<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:58.130> know<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.310> number<00:01:59.520> want

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
shoot but you know and the number want

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.100 
shoot but you know and the number want
to<00:01:59.759> go<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.000> way<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.329> number<00:02:00.509> two<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> go<00:02:00.930> this

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
to go this way and number two a go this

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.990 
to go this way and number two a go this
way<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:02.070> number<00:02:02.219> four<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:02.670> come<00:02:02.850> up

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
way and then number four can come up

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060 
way and then number four can come up
here<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.210> also<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> solution<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.680> most

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
here and also be a solution but most

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.649 
here and also be a solution but most
cases<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.670> scenario<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.149> going<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.390> be<00:02:06.479> where

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
cases the scenario is going to be where

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.029 
cases the scenario is going to be where
your<00:02:06.810> defenders<00:02:07.229> are<00:02:07.350> all<00:02:07.530> over<00:02:07.860> here<00:02:10.039> block

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
your defenders are all over here block

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.460 
your defenders are all over here block
in<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.310> hoop

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.410 

so<00:02:15.470> again<00:02:15.709> you're<00:02:15.860> gonna<00:02:15.950> have<00:02:16.310> he's<00:02:17.299> gonna

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
so again you're gonna have he's gonna

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.670 
so again you're gonna have he's gonna
say<00:02:17.720> go

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
say go

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.920 
say go
number<00:02:19.280> four<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:19.610> gonna<00:02:19.760> come<00:02:19.970> over<00:02:20.000> here<00:02:20.360> set

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
number four is gonna come over here set

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.470 
number four is gonna come over here set
the<00:02:20.959> pick<00:02:21.700> number<00:02:22.700> five<00:02:22.909> is<00:02:23.060> gonna<00:02:23.239> roll
