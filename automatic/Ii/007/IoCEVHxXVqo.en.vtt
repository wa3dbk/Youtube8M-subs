me this axe what does it look like looks
like<00:02:29.290> it's<00:02:29.410> upside<00:02:29.709> down<00:02:29.920> but<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.560> amount

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
like it's upside down but to the amount

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.280 
like it's upside down but to the amount
on<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.640> picture<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:35.230> has<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.530> blade<00:02:36.069> down<00:02:37.290> but

on the picture it has the blade down but

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.550 
on the picture it has the blade down but
here<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.650> blade<00:02:38.830> is<00:02:38.980> up<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:40.260> what<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.380> heck

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
here the blade is up so what the heck

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.250 
here the blade is up so what the heck
hasbro<00:02:42.099> i<00:02:42.790> don't<00:02:43.420> know<00:02:43.540> what<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.140> heck

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
hasbro i don't know what the heck

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.690 
hasbro i don't know what the heck
happened<00:02:44.470> there<00:02:44.769> why<00:02:45.069> it's<00:02:45.280> like<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.489> i

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
happened there why it's like that i

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.979 
happened there why it's like that i
tried<00:02:46.000> taking<00:02:46.269> apart<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:46.599> flipping<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:46.900> over

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
tried taking apart and flipping it over

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.110 
tried taking apart and flipping it over
and<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.230> wouldn't<00:02:47.470> work<00:02:47.620> as<00:02:48.250> far<00:02:48.489> as<00:02:48.670> actually

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
and it wouldn't work as far as actually

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.970 
and it wouldn't work as far as actually
making<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.510> accurate<00:02:50.019> so<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.739> way<00:02:50.860> it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
making it accurate so this is the way it

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.500 
making it accurate so this is the way it
is<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.550> upside<00:02:51.849> down<00:02:51.880> but<00:02:52.209> either<00:02:52.300> way

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
is so it's upside down but either way

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.930 
is so it's upside down but either way
you<00:02:52.900> can<00:02:53.050> still<00:02:53.230> pretend<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.489> bottom<00:02:54.819> is

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
you can still pretend that the bottom is

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.490 
you can still pretend that the bottom is
the<00:02:55.090> axe<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.630> adds<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.870> blade<00:02:56.050> on<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.230> top

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
the axe and that adds a blade on the top

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.050 
the axe and that adds a blade on the top
so<00:02:56.620> it's<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:56.769> double<00:02:56.950> sided<00:02:57.310> acts<00:02:57.580> you<00:02:57.790> know<00:02:57.819> see

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
so it's a double sided acts you know see

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.390 
so it's a double sided acts you know see
your<00:02:58.150> hack<00:02:58.330> up<00:02:58.540> some<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.769> last<00:02:59.980> thing<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.220> is

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
your hack up some the last thing that is

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400 
your hack up some the last thing that is
really<00:03:00.610> cool<00:03:00.730> about<00:03:00.940> this<00:03:01.150> guy<00:03:01.330> is<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:02.200> his

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
really cool about this guy is that his

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.440 
really cool about this guy is that his
faceplate<00:03:02.709> actually<00:03:03.610> moves<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:04.000> just<00:03:04.180> pull

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
faceplate actually moves you just pull

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.630 
faceplate actually moves you just pull
it<00:03:04.569> up<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.350> slide<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:05.799> down<00:03:05.950> pop<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.580> in

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
it up and you slide it down pop it in

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.850 
it up and you slide it down pop it in
front<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.850> his<00:03:06.940> face<00:03:07.090> broom<00:03:07.600> battle<00:03:08.110> mask<00:03:08.290> no

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
front of his face broom battle mask no

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.990 
front of his face broom battle mask no
more<00:03:09.130> of<00:03:09.190> having<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.459> get<00:03:09.580> a<00:03:09.610> figure<00:03:09.880> that

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
more of having to get a figure that

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.940 
more of having to get a figure that
either<00:03:10.150> has<00:03:10.330> one<00:03:10.630> or<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.840> other<00:03:10.870> he<00:03:11.319> has<00:03:11.530> both

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
either has one or the other he has both

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.009 
either has one or the other he has both
now<00:03:12.280> his<00:03:12.849> weapons<00:03:13.239> are<00:03:13.420> transformable

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
now his weapons are transformable

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.780 
now his weapons are transformable
foldable<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:14.739> they're<00:03:14.860> out<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.160> way<00:03:15.310> this

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
foldable so they're out of the way this

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.580
