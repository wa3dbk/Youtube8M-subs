00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.690 

so<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.439> video<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:08.130> going<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.309> teach<00:00:08.490> us<00:00:08.549> how

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
so this video is going to teach us how

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.470 
so this video is going to teach us how
to<00:00:08.880> constrain<00:00:09.660> or<00:00:09.930> to<00:00:10.080> assemble<00:00:11.480> some

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
to constrain or to assemble some

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.839 
to constrain or to assemble some
cylindrical<00:00:13.080> objects<00:00:13.559> inside<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.580> part

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
cylindrical objects inside of a part

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.970 
cylindrical objects inside of a part
inside<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.480> model<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.290> if<00:00:16.379> we<00:00:16.529> kind<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.770> look

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
inside of a model so if we kind of look

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.249 
inside of a model so if we kind of look
at<00:00:17.130> what's<00:00:17.310> going<00:00:17.520> on<00:00:17.790> what<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.509> we<00:00:19.140> have

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:19.259 
at what's going on what we have we have

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.050 
at what's going on what we have we have
a<00:00:19.290> chassis<00:00:19.800> which<00:00:19.950> is<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.490> bottom<00:00:20.820> piece

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
a chassis which is just a bottom piece

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.250 
a chassis which is just a bottom piece
we<00:00:22.050> have<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> rear<00:00:22.590> hood<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.279> front<00:00:23.670> hood<00:00:24.260> two

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
we have a rear hood a front hood two

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.120 
we have a rear hood a front hood two
axles<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.980> four<00:00:26.789> wheels<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.920> I'm<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:29.070> to

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
axles and four wheels so I'm going to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.099 
axles and four wheels so I'm going to
teach<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.369> how<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.760> put<00:00:30.269> these<00:00:30.449> together<00:00:30.660> and

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
teach you how to put these together and

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.920 
teach you how to put these together and
three<00:00:31.679> different<00:00:31.859> types<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.430> ways<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.600> before

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
three different types of ways but before

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.450 
three different types of ways but before
we<00:00:34.019> do<00:00:34.230> kind<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.620> look<00:00:34.830> we<00:00:35.129> have<00:00:35.339> our<00:00:35.910> wheel<00:00:36.660> has

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
we do kind of look we have our wheel has

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.340 
we do kind of look we have our wheel has
two<00:00:38.460> circles<00:00:39.059> our<00:00:39.780> axis<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.680> one<00:00:41.100> big<00:00:41.370> circle

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
two circles our axis is one big circle

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.619 
two circles our axis is one big circle
and<00:00:43.350> those<00:00:43.649> are<00:00:43.860> both<00:00:43.980> cylinders<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.969> then

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
and those are both cylinders and then

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.340 
and those are both cylinders and then
our<00:00:45.899> back<00:00:46.410> hood<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.300> look<00:00:48.300> at<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> side

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
our back hood is look at it on the side

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
our back hood is look at it on the side
it<00:00:50.100> has<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.879> semicircle<00:00:51.949> and<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> flat<00:00:53.910> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
it has a semicircle and then a flat and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.229 
it has a semicircle and then a flat and
then<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.780> front<00:00:55.280> it's<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.489> square<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:59.239> going

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
then on the front it's a square so going

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.680 
then on the front it's a square so going
to<00:01:00.390> show<00:01:01.020> us<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.620> how<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.879> actually<00:01:03.090> will<00:01:03.480> put

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
to show us so how we actually will put

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.900 
to show us so how we actually will put
this<00:01:03.870> thing<00:01:04.110> together<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> first<00:01:06.600> step<00:01:06.869> is

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
this thing together so the first step is

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.249 
this thing together so the first step is
constrained<00:01:08.910> so<00:01:09.750> we're<00:01:09.929> gonna<00:01:10.020> click

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
constrained so we're gonna click

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.160 
constrained so we're gonna click
constrain<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.420> we're<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.660> to<00:01:12.840> actually

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
constrain and we're going to actually

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.040 
constrain and we're going to actually
start<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.920> an<00:01:14.039> insert<00:01:14.599> if<00:01:15.599> you<00:01:15.780> look<00:01:15.929> at

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
start with an insert if you look at

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.570 
start with an insert if you look at
insert<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:17.009> two<00:01:17.190> different<00:01:17.340> options

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
insert you have two different options

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.469 
insert you have two different options
opposed<00:01:18.509> which<00:01:19.440> if<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.910> this<00:01:21.179> surface

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
opposed which if you have this surface

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.839 
opposed which if you have this surface
and<00:01:21.929> this<00:01:22.200> surface<00:01:22.259> opposed<00:01:23.220> means<00:01:23.580> they

00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:23.849 
and this surface opposed means they

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.699 
and this surface opposed means they
would<00:01:24.060> face<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.050> same<00:01:25.259> opposite

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:25.709 
would face in the same opposite

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:28.580 
would face in the same opposite
direction<00:01:26.039> and<00:01:26.429> then<00:01:26.729> aligned<00:01:27.539> would<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
direction and then aligned would be that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440 
direction and then aligned would be that
it<00:01:28.709> would<00:01:28.770> face<00:01:29.069> in<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> same<00:01:29.520> direction<00:01:29.700> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it would face in the same direction so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.150 
it would face in the same direction so
we're<00:01:30.539> gonna<00:01:30.660> click<00:01:30.869> aligned<00:01:31.229> we're<00:01:32.069> gonna

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
we're gonna click aligned we're gonna

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.419 
we're gonna click aligned we're gonna
have<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.640> circle<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.300> this<00:01:33.619> axis<00:01:34.619> they're

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
have this circle and this axis they're

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.309 
have this circle and this axis they're
going<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.880> centerline<00:01:36.569> but<00:01:36.989> they're<00:01:37.140> also

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
going to be centerline but they're also

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.930 
going to be centerline but they're also
going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.649> be<00:01:37.709> facing<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> same<00:01:38.759> direction

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
going to be facing in the same direction

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.270 
going to be facing in the same direction
so<00:01:39.509> I'm<00:01:39.569> going<00:01:39.690> to<00:01:39.750> click<00:01:39.929> those<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.410> if<00:01:41.160> you

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
so I'm going to click those and if you

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.580 
so I'm going to click those and if you
see<00:01:41.520> they're<00:01:41.910> both<00:01:42.090> facing<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.560> same

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
see they're both facing in the same

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.680 
see they're both facing in the same
direction<00:01:43.770> arrows<00:01:44.429> pointing<00:01:44.819> out<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.630> I'm

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
direction arrows pointing out so I'm

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.040 
direction arrows pointing out so I'm
gonna<00:01:45.780> say<00:01:45.929> ok<00:01:46.550> so<00:01:47.550> if<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:47.789> notice<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.720> those

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
gonna say ok so if we notice that those

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.449 
gonna say ok so if we notice that those
two<00:01:49.259> things<00:01:49.289> they'll<00:01:49.800> always<00:01:50.130> stay<00:01:50.310> together

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
two things they'll always stay together

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.880 
two things they'll always stay together
because<00:01:51.170> that's<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.380> way<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.649> constrained<00:01:53.160> it

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
because that's the way we constrained it

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.669 
because that's the way we constrained it
the<00:01:55.890> next<00:01:56.160> constraint<00:01:56.550> I<00:01:56.670> went<00:01:56.910> to<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.679> what's

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
the next constraint I went to is what's

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.460 
the next constraint I went to is what's
called<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.250> mated<00:01:59.759> constrain<00:02:00.300> of<00:02:00.539> ciner<00:02:00.959> axes

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
called a mated constrain of ciner axes

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.249 
called a mated constrain of ciner axes
so<00:02:02.190> if<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.459> drag<00:02:02.759> your<00:02:02.970> mouse<00:02:03.000> over<00:02:03.539> this<00:02:03.989> if

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
so if you drag your mouse over this if

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.380 
so if you drag your mouse over this if
you<00:02:04.379> notice<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.550> is<00:02:05.610> highlighting<00:02:06.270> its

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
you notice that that is highlighting its

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.139 
you notice that that is highlighting its
inner<00:02:06.629> axis<00:02:07.050> I'm<00:02:07.229> going<00:02:07.349> to<00:02:07.410> click<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:08.149> I'm

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
inner axis I'm going to click that I'm

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.369 
inner axis I'm going to click that I'm
going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.330> come<00:02:09.479> down<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.929> I'm<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
going to come down here I'm going to

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.120 
going to come down here I'm going to
click<00:02:10.670> on<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.090> rounded<00:02:12.599> area<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:13.770> if<00:02:14.010> you

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
click on the rounded area then if you

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.070 
click on the rounded area then if you
notice<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.820> axis<00:02:15.270> lights<00:02:15.540> up<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:15.900> I'm<00:02:15.990> gonna

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
notice that axis lights up so I'm gonna

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.630 
notice that axis lights up so I'm gonna
click<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.460> and

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
click that and

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.260 
click that and
say<00:02:17.819> okay<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.740> what<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.040> did<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
say okay so what that did is the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.740 
say okay so what that did is the
constraint<00:02:21.780> allows<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.190> stay<00:02:24.000> access<00:02:24.600> to

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
constraint allows it to stay access to

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.130 
constraint allows it to stay access to
axis<00:02:25.819> on<00:02:26.819> there<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.740> going<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:28.950> rotate<00:02:29.280> around

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
axis on there so going to rotate around

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.360 
axis on there so going to rotate around
I'm<00:02:31.140> gonna<00:02:31.290> have<00:02:31.410> another<00:02:31.620> constraint<00:02:31.980> and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
I'm gonna have another constraint and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.300 
I'm gonna have another constraint and
I'm<00:02:32.490> actually<00:02:33.709> going<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.130> another<00:02:35.340> insert

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
I'm actually going to do another insert

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.490 
I'm actually going to do another insert
and<00:02:38.310> again<00:02:38.730> aligned<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.800> this<00:02:40.800> axis<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.550> that

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
and again aligned of this axis and that

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.570 
and again aligned of this axis and that
circle<00:02:43.500> edge<00:02:43.910> with<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.450> one<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:45.750> well<00:02:46.580> say

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
circle edge with this one as well say

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.979 
circle edge with this one as well say
okay<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:49.470> if<00:02:49.709> we<00:02:49.890> look<00:02:49.920> at<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.280> part<00:02:50.580> do<00:02:51.360> is<00:02:51.630> it

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
okay so if we look at this part do is it

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.770 
okay so if we look at this part do is it
fully<00:02:52.230> constrained<00:02:52.800> where<00:02:53.130> we<00:02:53.280> want<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:53.780> if

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
fully constrained where we want it if

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.759 
fully constrained where we want it if
you<00:02:54.900> look<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:57.030> allowed<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.780> move<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.620> out

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
you look it's allowed to move in and out

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.090 
you look it's allowed to move in and out
which<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.550> mated<00:03:00.269> constraint<00:03:00.860> but<00:03:01.860> your

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
which is the mated constraint but your

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.160 
which is the mated constraint but your
wheels<00:03:02.370> will<00:03:02.700> stay<00:03:02.880> on<00:03:03.030> your<00:03:03.180> axis<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.959> if<00:03:04.019> I'm

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
wheels will stay on your axis so if I'm

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.920 
wheels will stay on your axis so if I'm
just<00:03:04.350> gonna<00:03:04.530> click<00:03:04.860> left<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.690> show<00:03:06.870> you

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
just gonna click left and I can show you

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.460 
just gonna click left and I can show you
something<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:07.980> have<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.700> gap<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:10.080> we<00:03:10.290> could

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
something we have a gap so we could

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.160 
something we have a gap so we could
flush<00:03:10.830> this<00:03:11.760> side<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.480> side<00:03:12.540> together

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
flush this side and this side together

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.910 
flush this side and this side together
but<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.280> would<00:03:14.430> leave<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.640> large<00:03:15.000> gap<00:03:15.269> over<00:03:15.570> here

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
but it would leave a large gap over here

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.520 
but it would leave a large gap over here
if<00:03:16.920> we<00:03:17.100> do<00:03:17.250> our<00:03:17.370> math<00:03:17.580> we<00:03:18.060> can<00:03:18.750> calculate<00:03:19.320> that

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
if we do our math we can calculate that

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.289 
if we do our math we can calculate that
gap<00:03:20.010> based<00:03:20.580> off<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.060> length<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:22.100> your<00:03:23.299> axle

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
gap based off of the length of your axle

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.080 
gap based off of the length of your axle
the<00:03:24.660> length<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:25.170> your<00:03:25.320> wheels<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.850> length

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
the length of your wheels and the length

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.140 
the length of your wheels and the length
of<00:03:27.390> your<00:03:27.780> view<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.829> width<00:03:29.070> of<00:03:29.190> your<00:03:29.340> body<00:03:29.579> so

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
of your view the width of your body so

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.039 
of your view the width of your body so
if<00:03:30.390> we<00:03:30.540> do<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.690> constraint<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:32.660> I'm<00:03:33.660> going<00:03:34.019> to

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
if we do a constraint and I'm going to

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.360 
if we do a constraint and I'm going to
choose<00:03:34.530> mate<00:03:35.690> mate<00:03:36.690> which<00:03:37.350> means<00:03:37.680> those<00:03:38.100> two

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
choose mate mate which means those two

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.949 
choose mate mate which means those two
surfaces<00:03:39.000> are<00:03:39.239> facing<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.870> same

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
surfaces are facing in the same

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.470 
surfaces are facing in the same
direction<00:03:40.340> I'm<00:03:41.340> going<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.579> click<00:03:41.820> this

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
direction I'm going to click this

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.840 
direction I'm going to click this
surface<00:03:43.079> which<00:03:43.860> is<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.100> inside<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.670> wheel

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
surface which is the inside of the wheel

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.220 
surface which is the inside of the wheel
and<00:03:45.620> I'm<00:03:46.620> going<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:46.950> pick<00:03:47.570> this<00:03:48.570> surface<00:03:49.019> which

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
and I'm going to pick this surface which

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.470 
and I'm going to pick this surface which
is<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.500> outside<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:51.329> rear<00:03:52.019> hood<00:03:52.290> and

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
is the outside of the rear hood and

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.199 
is the outside of the rear hood and
notice<00:03:54.480> initially<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:56.220> again

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
notice initially that again

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.630 
notice initially that again
they're<00:03:57.540> butted<00:03:57.959> up<00:03:58.049> next<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.470> each<00:03:58.530> other<00:03:58.799> but

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
they're butted up next to each other but

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.960 
they're butted up next to each other but
if<00:04:00.030> we<00:04:00.269> do<00:04:00.390> an<00:04:00.480> offset<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:04.489> know<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.700> that

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
if we do an offset and know that that

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.110 
if we do an offset and know that that
gap<00:04:06.209> is<00:04:06.570> point<00:04:06.930> one<00:04:07.640> based<00:04:08.640> off<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
gap is point one based off of the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.680 
gap is point one based off of the
calculations<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:09.989> if<00:04:10.079> I<00:04:10.200> do<00:04:10.260> point<00:04:10.650> O<00:04:10.769> five

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
calculations and if I do point O five

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.539 
calculations and if I do point O five
okay<00:04:12.690> then<00:04:13.350> that's<00:04:13.590> going<00:04:13.799> to<00:04:13.859> give<00:04:14.010> me<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.280> gap

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
okay then that's going to give me a gap

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.460 
okay then that's going to give me a gap
where<00:04:14.790> if<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.480> click<00:04:15.780> this<00:04:15.930> thing<00:04:16.140> it's<00:04:16.320> not

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
where if I click this thing it's not

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.840 
where if I click this thing it's not
moving<00:04:17.450> so<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:18.780> rear<00:04:19.560> axle<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.340> rear<00:04:20.579> wheels

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
moving so that rear axle and rear wheels

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.510 
moving so that rear axle and rear wheels
are<00:04:21.239> now<00:04:21.539> constrained<00:04:22.289> and<00:04:22.560> they'll<00:04:23.250> rotate

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
are now constrained and they'll rotate

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.029 
are now constrained and they'll rotate
they'll<00:04:24.000> spin<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:25.620> can<00:04:25.800> see<00:04:26.039> what's<00:04:26.460> going<00:04:26.760> on

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
they'll spin you can see what's going on

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.800 
they'll spin you can see what's going on
but<00:04:29.039> that<00:04:29.220> won't<00:04:29.340> move<00:04:29.610> in<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.270> out<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.690> the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
but that won't move in and out and the

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.070 
but that won't move in and out and the
wheel

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
wheel

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.920 
wheel
we'll<00:04:31.289> stay<00:04:31.500> on<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.919> axle<00:04:32.340> stay<00:04:32.610> on<00:04:32.930> alright

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
we'll stay on the axle stay on alright

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.580 
we'll stay on the axle stay on alright
so<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:35.310> next<00:04:35.340> thing<00:04:35.729> we're<00:04:35.849> going<00:04:35.939> to<00:04:36.000> do<00:04:36.240> is

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
so the next thing we're going to do is

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.159 
so the next thing we're going to do is
constrain<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:38.610> front<00:04:38.909> wheels<00:04:39.150> on<00:04:39.569> the<00:04:39.719> axis

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
constrain the front wheels on the axis

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.640 
constrain the front wheels on the axis
so<00:04:41.129> if<00:04:41.219> I<00:04:41.310> do<00:04:41.370> constrain<00:04:41.969> and<00:04:42.409> I<00:04:43.409> do<00:04:43.620> insert<00:04:45.650> and

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
so if I do constrain and I do insert and

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.559 
so if I do constrain and I do insert and
again<00:04:47.009> I'm<00:04:47.460> going<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.669> pick<00:04:47.819> a<00:04:47.849> line<00:04:48.150> I'm<00:04:48.419> gonna

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
again I'm going to pick a line I'm gonna

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:58.969 
again I'm going to pick a line I'm gonna
pick<00:04:48.780> this<00:04:49.379> one<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:51.180> one<00:04:51.240> I<00:04:57.770> need<00:04:58.770> to

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
pick this one and this one I need to

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.980 
pick this one and this one I need to
move<00:04:59.430> this<00:04:59.729> so<00:05:00.030> I<00:05:00.060> can<00:05:00.300> get<00:05:00.419> away<00:05:00.539> so<00:05:00.659> I'm<00:05:00.870> going

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
move this so I can get away so I'm going

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.219 
move this so I can get away so I'm going
to<00:05:01.020> cancel<00:05:01.580> now<00:05:02.580> pull<00:05:02.819> this<00:05:02.939> out<00:05:03.680> again<00:05:04.879> insert

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
to cancel now pull this out again insert

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.339 
to cancel now pull this out again insert
aligned<00:05:07.669> pick<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:08.789> outside<00:05:09.210> and<00:05:09.539> the<00:05:10.050> outside

aligned pick the outside and the outside

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:17.020 
aligned pick the outside and the outside
of<00:05:11.340> this<00:05:11.580> one<00:05:12.409> say<00:05:13.409> okay<00:05:14.629> so<00:05:15.629> now<00:05:15.900> if<00:05:16.379> we<00:05:16.500> look

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
of this one say okay so now if we look

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.730 
of this one say okay so now if we look
this<00:05:18.030> piece<00:05:18.389> all<00:05:18.870> those<00:05:19.229> are<00:05:19.469> staying

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
this piece all those are staying

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.110 
this piece all those are staying
together<00:05:19.860> now<00:05:20.849> I<00:05:21.180> want<00:05:21.539> to<00:05:21.599> put<00:05:21.810> this<00:05:23.120> inside

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
together now I want to put this inside

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.649 
together now I want to put this inside
of<00:05:24.479> here<00:05:25.020> in<00:05:25.289> order<00:05:26.219> to<00:05:26.370> do<00:05:26.639> that<00:05:26.849> and<00:05:27.090> again

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
of here in order to do that and again

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.019 
of here in order to do that and again
it's<00:05:27.840> a<00:05:27.930> square<00:05:28.259> you<00:05:28.889> can't<00:05:29.189> do<00:05:29.370> Center<00:05:29.669> axes

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
it's a square you can't do Center axes

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.909 
it's a square you can't do Center axes
because<00:05:30.389> there's<00:05:30.569> no<00:05:30.719> access<00:05:31.199> inside<00:05:31.590> of<00:05:31.740> here

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
because there's no access inside of here

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.709 
because there's no access inside of here
if<00:05:32.430> I<00:05:32.550> do<00:05:32.610> a<00:05:32.699> constraint<00:05:35.090> move<00:05:36.090> this<00:05:36.479> thing

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
if I do a constraint move this thing

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.969 
if I do a constraint move this thing
down<00:05:38.539> sorry<00:05:39.539> I'm<00:05:39.810> gonna<00:05:39.900> do<00:05:40.110> a<00:05:40.139> constraint<00:05:40.680> I

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
down sorry I'm gonna do a constraint I

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:47.360 
down sorry I'm gonna do a constraint I
move<00:05:41.940> this<00:05:42.169> first<00:05:43.190> major<00:05:44.190> constraint<00:05:46.370> I'm

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
move this first major constraint I'm

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.140 
move this first major constraint I'm
gonna<00:05:47.520> do<00:05:47.729> is<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.330> tangent<00:05:49.229> so<00:05:50.069> a<00:05:50.099> tangent<00:05:50.729> takes

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
gonna do is a tangent so a tangent takes

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.980 
gonna do is a tangent so a tangent takes
the<00:05:51.569> outside<00:05:52.199> cylinder<00:05:52.830> and<00:05:53.270> then<00:05:54.270> points<00:05:54.839> it

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
the outside cylinder and then points it

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.950 
the outside cylinder and then points it
on<00:05:55.259> to<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.650> surface<00:05:55.979> so<00:05:56.639> if<00:05:56.729> I<00:05:56.819> do<00:05:56.879> tangent<00:05:57.509> I'm

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
on to a surface so if I do tangent I'm

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.379 
on to a surface so if I do tangent I'm
going<00:05:58.379> to<00:05:58.440> do<00:05:58.620> outside<00:05:59.460> not<00:05:59.759> inside<00:05:59.969> but

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
going to do outside not inside but

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:05.170 
going to do outside not inside but
outside<00:06:00.800> I'm<00:06:01.800> gonna<00:06:01.889> pick<00:06:02.990> this<00:06:03.990> surface<00:06:04.469> and

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
outside I'm gonna pick this surface and

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.040 
outside I'm gonna pick this surface and
the<00:06:06.180> outside<00:06:06.750> of<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.050> cylinder<00:06:08.810> let<00:06:09.810> me<00:06:09.870> say

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
the outside of the cylinder let me say

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.029 
the outside of the cylinder let me say
okay<00:06:10.379> I'm<00:06:11.250> gonna<00:06:11.430> show<00:06:11.610> you<00:06:11.669> that<00:06:12.589> it's<00:06:13.589> always

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
okay I'm gonna show you that it's always

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:16.159 
okay I'm gonna show you that it's always
gonna<00:06:14.219> be<00:06:14.490> straight<00:06:14.969> up<00:06:15.000> and<00:06:15.270> down<00:06:15.300> okay

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
gonna be straight up and down okay

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.879 
gonna be straight up and down okay
but<00:06:16.830> it<00:06:16.949> can<00:06:17.099> go<00:06:17.250> in<00:06:17.520> two<00:06:18.089> other<00:06:18.270> directions<00:06:18.889> so

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
but it can go in two other directions so

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.709 
but it can go in two other directions so
what<00:06:20.219> I'm<00:06:20.279> gonna<00:06:20.370> do<00:06:20.580> next<00:06:20.789> is<00:06:21.240> I'm<00:06:21.569> going<00:06:21.599> to

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
what I'm gonna do next is I'm going to

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.860 
what I'm gonna do next is I'm going to
do<00:06:21.810> the<00:06:21.930> same<00:06:22.139> thing<00:06:22.909> I'm<00:06:23.909> going<00:06:24.089> to<00:06:24.210> a<00:06:24.240> tangent

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
do the same thing I'm going to a tangent

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.079 
do the same thing I'm going to a tangent
on<00:06:25.020> the<00:06:25.199> top<00:06:25.440> surface

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:26.089 
on the top surface

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:30.230 
on the top surface
it's<00:06:27.089> a<00:06:27.270> tangent<00:06:28.050> constraint<00:06:28.229> and<00:06:29.219> it's<00:06:30.120> gonna

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
it's a tangent constraint and it's gonna

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.390 
it's a tangent constraint and it's gonna
be<00:06:30.449> an<00:06:30.539> outside<00:06:31.789> here<00:06:32.789> in<00:06:33.020> here<00:06:34.370> say<00:06:35.370> okay

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
be an outside here in here say okay

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:43.070 
be an outside here in here say okay
so<00:06:37.440> now<00:06:38.820> the<00:06:39.820> last<00:06:40.030> thing<00:06:40.240> we<00:06:40.419> want<00:06:40.449> to<00:06:40.630> do<00:06:40.810> is

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
so now the last thing we want to do is

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.270 
so now the last thing we want to do is
we're<00:06:44.080> going<00:06:44.199> to<00:06:44.440> do<00:06:44.620> a<00:06:44.860> mate<00:06:46.020> flush<00:06:47.020> of<00:06:47.740> the

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
we're going to do a mate flush of the

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.430 
we're going to do a mate flush of the
outside<00:06:48.729> of<00:06:48.850> this<00:06:49.000> will<00:06:49.270> and<00:06:49.570> the<00:06:49.990> outside<00:06:50.410> of

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
outside of this will and the outside of

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.469 
outside of this will and the outside of
this<00:06:50.650> will<00:06:50.919> say<00:06:51.699> okay<00:06:52.410> so<00:06:53.669> you<00:06:54.669> hear<00:06:54.940> my<00:06:55.120> child

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 
this will say okay so you hear my child

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:57.870 
this will say okay so you hear my child
in<00:06:55.720> the<00:06:55.810> background<00:06:56.290> playing<00:06:57.190> toys<00:06:57.550> what

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
in the background playing toys what

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.939 
in the background playing toys what
we're<00:06:58.060> doing<00:06:58.300> are<00:06:58.449> simply<00:06:58.840> we<00:06:59.380> can<00:06:59.560> notice
