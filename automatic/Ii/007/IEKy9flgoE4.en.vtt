some stairs this is also covered in the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.519 
some stairs this is also covered in the
real<00:00:13.889> illusion<00:00:14.070> help<00:00:14.429> manual<00:00:15.109> as<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.230> can<00:00:16.350> see

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
real illusion help manual as you can see

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.099 
real illusion help manual as you can see
I<00:00:16.770> have<00:00:17.400> loaded<00:00:17.730> an<00:00:17.789> avatar<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.510> I've<00:00:18.930> loaded

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
I have loaded an avatar and I've loaded

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.279 
I have loaded an avatar and I've loaded
the<00:00:19.320> box<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.800> zero<00:00:20.100> zero<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:21.080> building<00:00:22.080> block

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
the box of zero zero to a building block

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.720 
the box of zero zero to a building block
and<00:00:22.619> shaped<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.390> actually<00:00:24.390> scaled<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.900> like<00:00:25.080> so

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
and shaped it actually scaled it like so

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.509 
and shaped it actually scaled it like so
I'm<00:00:26.730> gonna<00:00:26.880> shift<00:00:27.150> D<00:00:27.830> to<00:00:28.830> bring<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> multi

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
I'm gonna shift D to bring in the multi

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.420 
I'm gonna shift D to bring in the multi
duplicate<00:00:33.079> zero<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.200> up<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.280> see

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
duplicate zero it up so you can see

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.040 
duplicate zero it up so you can see
what's<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:35.910> here

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.590 

and<00:00:41.050> you<00:00:41.170> can<00:00:41.289> see<00:00:41.440> here<00:00:41.710> by<00:00:41.949> using<00:00:42.160> both<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
and you can see here by using both you

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.529 
and you can see here by using both you
can<00:00:46.690> build<00:00:46.870> a<00:00:46.899> stairway<00:00:48.120> now<00:00:49.120> you'll<00:00:49.479> just

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
can build a stairway now you'll just

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.259 
can build a stairway now you'll just
need<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:49.870> experiment<00:00:50.530> with<00:00:50.649> this<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:52.120> can

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
need to experiment with this you can

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.660 
need to experiment with this you can
also<00:00:52.420> build<00:00:52.989> a<00:00:53.519> spiral<00:00:54.519> stairway<00:00:56.280> all<00:00:57.280> kinds

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
also build a spiral stairway all kinds

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:06.640 
also build a spiral stairway all kinds
of<00:00:57.729> things

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.850 

as<00:01:07.430> far<00:01:08.420> as<00:01:08.540> walking<00:01:08.750> up<00:01:09.080> these<00:01:09.230> there's<00:01:09.650> not<00:01:09.830> a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
as far as walking up these there's not a

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.480 
as far as walking up these there's not a
real<00:01:10.220> good<00:01:10.490> way<00:01:10.730> to<00:01:10.790> do<00:01:11.240> it<00:01:11.360> easily<00:01:12.340> but<00:01:13.340> you

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
real good way to do it easily but you

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.270 
real good way to do it easily but you
can't<00:01:13.700> add<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:13.910> to<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.270> terrain<00:01:14.950> and<00:01:15.950> get<00:01:16.190> it

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
can't add it to the terrain and get it

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:29.740 
can't add it to the terrain and get it
done<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:16.730> way<00:01:26.800> well<00:01:27.800> right-click<00:01:28.540> add<00:01:29.540> them

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
done that way well right-click add them

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.290 
done that way well right-click add them
all<00:01:29.870> to<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.170> Train<00:01:30.850> it's<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.910> great<00:01:32.090> feature

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
all to the Train it's a great feature

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.930 
all to the Train it's a great feature
being<00:01:32.600> able<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:32.870> multi<00:01:33.200> select<00:01:33.500> for<00:01:33.710> that

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.359 

right<00:01:37.940> click<00:01:38.240> move<00:01:38.660> walk<00:01:39.619> forward

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
right click move walk forward

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.350 
right click move walk forward
let's<00:01:40.880> send<00:01:41.180> him<00:01:41.300> up<00:01:41.479> here<00:01:42.880> like<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:44.030> said<00:01:44.060> is

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
let's send him up here like I said is

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:53.770 
let's send him up here like I said is
not<00:01:44.510> perfect

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.180 

now<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.840> could<00:01:55.080> build<00:01:55.170> platforms<00:01:55.800> out<00:01:55.979> here

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
now you could build platforms out here

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.250 
now you could build platforms out here
and<00:01:56.340> just<00:01:56.490> keep<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:56.960> doing<00:01:57.960> whatever

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
and just keep on going doing whatever

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.650
