 shoot like a normal camera with 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.269
 the shutter button 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:05.710
 is a top cover with its own 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.520
 1020 milliamperes and battery 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.450

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.450

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.450
 now let 's do it 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.130
 when 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.700
 is fixed to the screw this of course is a 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:37.610
 tripod we found here but 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:40.009
 applies to any type of accessory in 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.460
 this soft rubbery gummed case 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.610
 allows you to take pictures and place 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.679
 in front of the lens any kind of 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.140

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:55.159

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.580
 right now we don't have the hand 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.500
 but we find ourselves 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.319
 an example was made during the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.920
 presentation on a bank or vehicle 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:21.040
