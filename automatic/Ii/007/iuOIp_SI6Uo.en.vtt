mentioned<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.819> glue<00:02:13.970> build<00:02:14.180> a<00:02:14.360> about<00:02:14.540> the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
mentioned to the glue build a about the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.620 
mentioned to the glue build a about the
opportunity<00:02:15.170> we've<00:02:15.260> gone<00:02:16.269> huge<00:02:17.269> and

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
opportunity we've gone huge and

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.430 
opportunity we've gone huge and
hopefully<00:02:18.319> we<00:02:18.440> can<00:02:18.590> say<00:02:18.799> that<00:02:20.079> what<00:02:21.079> mediately

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
hopefully we can say that what mediately

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.949 
hopefully we can say that what mediately
goes<00:02:21.650> through<00:02:21.920> your<00:02:21.980> mind<00:02:22.299> when<00:02:23.299> Australia

think<00:02:40.299> every<00:02:41.299> sandwich<00:02:41.540> at<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.810> field<00:02:42.049> is<00:02:42.200> a

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
think every sandwich at the field is a

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.140 
think every sandwich at the field is a
challenge<00:02:42.590> set<00:02:42.769> down<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.190> not<00:02:43.910> bigger<00:02:44.120> than

facing Australian I think it's only

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.599 
facing Australian I think it's only
natural<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.769> have<00:02:48.890> some<00:02:49.100> self<00:02:49.370> doubt

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
natural that you have some self doubt

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.729 
natural that you have some self doubt
that<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.660> know<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:50.840> question<00:02:51.440> whether<00:02:51.590> you

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739

a bill I never said that Adam thought
about<00:04:36.229> it<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:38.960> think<00:04:39.020> certainly<00:04:39.740> in<00:04:40.039> this

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
about it and I think certainly in this

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.430 
about it and I think certainly in this
last<00:04:40.430> six<00:04:40.750> now<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:41.780> months<00:04:42.050> have<00:04:42.169> been<00:04:42.199> asked

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
last six now I months have been asked

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.490 
last six now I months have been asked
quite<00:04:42.620> a<00:04:42.680> bit<00:04:42.860> what<00:04:43.820> would<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:43.970> world<00:04:44.090> cup<00:04:44.500> win

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
quite a bit what would the world cup win

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.500 
quite a bit what would the world cup win
min<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.830> this<00:04:45.949> country<00:04:46.160> minted<00:04:46.760> agree<00:04:47.030> well<00:04:47.270> I

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
min to this country minted agree well I

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.540 
min to this country minted agree well I
think<00:04:48.410> it's<00:04:48.560> really<00:04:48.680> difficult<00:04:48.949> to<00:04:49.220> pull<00:04:49.400> out

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
think it's really difficult to pull out

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.920 
think it's really difficult to pull out
into<00:04:49.699> words<00:04:49.910> because<00:04:50.090> there's<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:50.810> many

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
into words because there's so many

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.540 
into words because there's so many
different<00:04:51.139> angles<00:04:51.349> you<00:04:51.620> could<00:04:51.770> go<00:04:51.949> down<00:04:52.190> and

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
different angles you could go down and

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.230 
different angles you could go down and
what<00:04:52.820> it<00:04:52.910> mean<00:04:53.180> but<00:04:53.389> I<00:04:54.190> think<00:04:55.190> for<00:04:55.340> me<00:04:55.490> to<00:04:56.090> put

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
what it mean but I think for me to put

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.120 
what it mean but I think for me to put
four<00:04:56.479> years<00:04:56.780> behind<00:04:57.080> us<00:04:57.289> for<00:04:57.770> years<00:04:57.949> of
