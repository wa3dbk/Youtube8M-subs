 this man commanded for two years the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.029
 comdabra aerospace defense command 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.599

 front of the Air Force High Command 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.380
 today in reserve 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.510
 the josÃ© carlos pereira brigadeiro helped 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.430
 Brazilian ufologists to commission 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.149
 pressure the government to release 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.180
 documents which for so long 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.890
 this information will be kept confidential 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.420

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.620
 the Second World War and the Cold War 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.449
 where any apparition whatever 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.820
 strange phenomenon that happened in the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.620
 planet was always seen as a weapon. 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.620
 secret of an American secret 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.640
 there is the notion and that for a long time 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.909
 the nautical tried to hide information 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.520
 about fleeing over flying objects 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.470
 You already know that I know. 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.399
 that the world every day and the 80's 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.920
 answering does not answer because 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.729
 national security was needed 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.729
 this was a farewell 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.210
 these files reveal that the space 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.300
 Brazilian air force was visited by 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.759
 aliens in this period these 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.229
 files reveal the presence of objects 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.080
 claim to be extraterrestrial is a 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.240
 complex training but revealed that the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.179
 unidentified object 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.490
 to circulate in Brazilian airspace 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.490
 the unidentified object 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.670
 your confirms that the dish operation 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.630
 existed 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:19.510
 the album did you know well the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:23.090
 major Dutch commander was made in 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.820
 1997 just three months after treating 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.060
 this interview the colonel legend was 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.590
 found dead in his house the police 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.590
 treated the case as suicide 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.010
 Do you think he may have been 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.000
 victim of the phenomenon he witnessed 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.560
 not directly 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.480
 but perhaps a catalyst effect yes to 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.400
 lack of water 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.510
 maybe because I could not get the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.209
 explanation of that family obsessed with 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.330

 had this gomes said year has to 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.760
 come the end of it 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.590
 sport can not say that but it is a 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.070
 feeling that this may have aggravated 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.070
