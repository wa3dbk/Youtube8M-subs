get a high score or anything like that I

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.939 
get a high score or anything like that I
was<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.480> trying<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.870> get<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.230> dog<00:01:01.680> tag

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
was just trying to get this dog tag

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.770 
was just trying to get this dog tag
achievement<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> teabagging<00:01:03.030> 10<00:01:03.359> victims

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
achievement for a teabagging 10 victims

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.750 
achievement for a teabagging 10 victims
and<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.140> doesn't<00:01:04.409> say<00:01:04.589> whether<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.400> had<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and it doesn't say whether you had to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.910 
and it doesn't say whether you had to
kill<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.000> victim<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.350> think

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
kill the victim or not so I think

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.740 
kill the victim or not so I think
actually<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> tea<00:01:09.060> bags<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> did

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
actually one of the tea bags that I did

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.080 
actually one of the tea bags that I did
that<00:01:09.960> counted<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:10.560> an<00:01:11.189> assist<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.790> got

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that counted was an assist that I got

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.420 
that counted was an assist that I got
for<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.420> kill<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.110> ran<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.650> still<00:01:13.860> teabag

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
for a kill but I ran up and still teabag

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.130 
for a kill but I ran up and still teabag
the<00:01:14.580> dead<00:01:14.729> body<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.750> actually

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
the dead body and I think that actually

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.080 
the dead body and I think that actually
counted<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.700> got<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.850> couple

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
counted and then I just got a couple

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.940 
counted and then I just got a couple
more<00:01:18.270> kills<00:01:18.540> during<00:01:18.810> around<00:01:19.200> where<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> didn't

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
more kills during around where I didn't

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980 
more kills during around where I didn't
get<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.070> chance<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.490> run<00:01:20.610> over<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.119> teabag<00:01:21.960> the
