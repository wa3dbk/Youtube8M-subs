00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.440 

different<00:05:28.810> change<00:05:30.220> looks<00:05:31.220> like<00:05:31.370> it<00:05:31.970> all<00:05:32.120> fell

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
different change looks like it all fell

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.010 
different change looks like it all fell
down<00:05:32.480> and<00:05:33.110> that's<00:05:33.740> just<00:05:34.310> how<00:05:34.580> nature<00:05:34.610> works<00:05:35.540> if

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
down and that's just how nature works if

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.590 
down and that's just how nature works if
you<00:05:36.440> break<00:05:36.710> one<00:05:36.740> part<00:05:37.310> of<00:05:37.520> it<00:05:37.730> you<00:05:38.030> break<00:05:38.330> all

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
you break one part of it you break all

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.360 
you break one part of it you break all
the<00:05:38.870> other<00:05:39.020> parts<00:05:39.500> too<00:05:39.770> oh<00:05:41.590> that<00:05:42.590> reminds<00:05:43.220> me

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
the other parts too oh that reminds me

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.490 
the other parts too oh that reminds me
of<00:05:43.580> ice<00:05:43.790> cream<00:05:44.090> coming<00:05:44.390> from<00:05:44.540> dirt<00:05:44.810> mm-hmm

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
without the milk we can't have ice cream

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.610 
without the milk we can't have ice cream
