00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.490
 welcome to a new video tutorial 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.489
 I speak to you servant and brother Daniel the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.109
 10 in 1636 throughout this time that 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.359
 been on youtube I have received several 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.579
 questions which tell me how 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.679
 buy a computer by parts and what 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.839
 parts we must buy to be able 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.220
 put together our computer and good this 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:36.690
 it's a very important issue which 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.489
 we will be seeing today 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.530
 I will be saying the parts you have 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.659
 what to buy to be able to build your 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.360
 computer and good let's start with 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.970
 this tutorial and the number requirement 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.239
 one or part number one is to buy the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.329
 cabinet or the tower better known as 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.120
 the cpu but actually it wrongly 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.519
 we say cpu since it has nothing 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.519
 see the cabinet the tower is where 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.009
 We have the different components as 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.950
 the dvd unit of venue the card 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.240
 network audio video and so on so 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.170
 this is the first requirement that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.470
 we need the tower or the cabinet the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.929
 number two is the cpu or better known 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.200
 like the microprocessor this is very 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.640
 important we will also need what 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.940
 what is ram memory 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.310
 that we all know that ram memory 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.590
 as point number 4 we will need the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.180
 rom memory is called rom memory 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.030
 rm-1 this is not the same as memory 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.850
 ram by itself for the people who 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 confuse in this on this good subject 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.660
 we're also going to need a hard drive 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.940
 we all know that on the hard drive it 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.700
 save all the information that is in 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.780
 our computer we will need the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.990
 dvd and cd drive we are also going to 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.390
 need a CD or DVD burner that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.030
 many times what would be the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.619
 DVD and CD drive and DVD burner 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.690
 and cd are included among each other but there 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.239
 There are times that you have to buy it 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.370
 separate good we're also going to need 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.830
 a monitor we already know that the monitor is 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.600
 to transfer what is the image 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.170
 we are going to need what is the mouse or 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.720
 a mouse the keyboard the mother card already 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.180
 that the mother card is in the middle of 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.370
 connection between the microprocessor and 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.650
 electronic circuits that we introduce 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.569
 in our computer 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.670
 well we're going to need what 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.549
 is the source of power this is very very 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.700
 important and the sound cards of 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.099
 video and network everything mentioned is what 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.319
 I will be leaving an image as you saw 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.569
 back in the video I put an image 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.629
 so that they do not get confused in any case 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.430
 that they will not understand me and in the 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.950
 video description I will be leaving you 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.140
 a link that reduction will make my blog in 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.569
 which I'll explain step by step 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.790
 what is the purpose of each characteristic that 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.950
 I just mentioned since the point of 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.389
 this tutorial was to mention what are 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.030
 the parts that have to be bought 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:10.129
 to be able to build your computer so if 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.959
 you want to know a little more about 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.430
 characteristics of each party in the 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.409
 description of the video I'll be leaving you 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.840
 a link that will reflect my blog and 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.909
 there you can see that its characteristics 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.769
 well this has been a very tutorial 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.780
 short I hope it has served you more than 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.180
 nothing in case you are interested in buying 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.340
 a computer because I recommend you 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.260
 that the buy in parts will come out 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.019
 cheaper and you'll be able to put together a 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.260
 supercomputer and good this up here 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.900
 d'angelo test in 1666 says goodbye to his 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.420
 brother and 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.420
 in a next tutorial until next time
