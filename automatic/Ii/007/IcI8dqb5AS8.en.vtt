we want to begin teaching puppies when

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.399 
we want to begin teaching puppies when
they're<00:00:44.790> young<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.269> that<00:00:45.900> they<00:00:46.019> can<00:00:46.199> learn

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
they're young so that they can learn

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.469 
they're young so that they can learn
through<00:00:46.830> and<00:00:47.159> through<00:00:47.729> for<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> rest<00:00:48.330> of

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479 
through and through for the rest of

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.350 
through and through for the rest of
their<00:00:48.629> lives<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.549> pick<00:00:50.729> a<00:00:50.760> puppy<00:00:51.120> up<00:00:51.239> at

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
their lives so if you pick a puppy up at

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.660 
their lives so if you pick a puppy up at
7<00:00:51.690> weeks<00:00:51.839> that<00:00:52.350> puppy<00:00:52.650> should<00:00:52.710> recognize<00:00:53.430> his

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
7 weeks that puppy should recognize his

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.259 
7 weeks that puppy should recognize his
own<00:00:53.820> name<00:00:54.059> at<00:00:54.239> about<00:00:54.449> 9<00:00:54.720> weeks<00:00:55.549> at<00:00:56.549> 9<00:00:56.820> weeks<00:00:57.059> of

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
own name at about 9 weeks at 9 weeks of

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.930 
own name at about 9 weeks at 9 weeks of
age<00:00:57.769> you<00:00:58.769> can<00:00:58.949> begin<00:00:59.100> training<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> puppy

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
age you can begin training the puppy

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.289 
age you can begin training the puppy
when<00:01:00.570> he<00:01:00.720> recognizes<00:01:01.470> his<00:01:02.070> or<00:01:02.369> her<00:01:02.699> own<00:01:02.940> name

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
when he recognizes his or her own name

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.109 
when he recognizes his or her own name
so<00:01:04.170> right<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:04.559> these<00:01:05.070> two<00:01:05.309> dogs<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.820> trained

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
so right now these two dogs are trained

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.670 
so right now these two dogs are trained
and<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.720> well<00:01:06.930> know<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> sit<00:01:07.530> command

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
and they well know the sit command

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.070 
and they well know the sit command
however<00:01:08.220> I'm<00:01:08.820> gonna<00:01:09.150> take<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.659> through<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
however I'm gonna take them through the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.530 
however I'm gonna take them through the
rudimentary<00:01:10.710> steps<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.400> show<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:11.970> what<00:01:12.330> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
rudimentary steps and show you what you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.139 
rudimentary steps and show you what you
can<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:12.899> with<00:01:13.380> your<00:01:13.560> puppy<00:01:14.039> or<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.579> older<00:01:14.939> dog

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
can do with your puppy or your older dog

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.319 
can do with your puppy or your older dog
so<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.990> teach<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.320> sit<00:01:16.530> command<00:01:16.829> to<00:01:17.329> the

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
so you can teach a sit command to the

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.209 
so you can teach a sit command to the
simple<00:01:18.780> tools<00:01:19.049> needed<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.649> teach<00:01:19.859> the<00:01:20.009> sit

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219 
simple tools needed to teach the sit

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.789 
simple tools needed to teach the sit
command<00:01:20.399> our<00:01:21.090> elite<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.200> I'm<00:01:22.350> using<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
command our elite and all I'm using is a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.609 
command our elite and all I'm using is a
piece<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.100> rope<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.420> collar<00:01:24.719> how<00:01:25.380> many

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
piece of rope and a collar how many

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.910 
piece of rope and a collar how many
people<00:01:26.009> advocate<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> use<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:27.439> of<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.649> pinch

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
people advocate the use of of a pinch

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.399 
people advocate the use of of a pinch
collar<00:01:29.159> or<00:01:29.609> perhaps<00:01:30.359> the<00:01:30.750> use<00:01:30.899> of<00:01:30.929> a<00:01:31.170> choke

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
collar or perhaps the use of a choke

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.399 
collar or perhaps the use of a choke
chain<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.920> tend<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.060> use<00:01:33.390> these<00:01:33.659> as<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
chain I tend not to use these as as a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.679 
chain I tend not to use these as as a
lot<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.009> people<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.609> the<00:01:35.850> signal<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.359> the<00:01:36.479> dog

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
lot of people like the signal to the dog

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.929 
lot of people like the signal to the dog
that<00:01:37.380> he's<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.189> restrained<00:01:38.700> for

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
that he's going to be restrained for

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.029 
that he's going to be restrained for
healing<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.539> for<00:01:39.719> singing<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
healing or for singing and they like the

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.010 
healing or for singing and they like the
idea<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.609> the<00:01:41.969> choke<00:01:42.210> can't<00:01:42.570> did<00:01:42.810> choke

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
idea that the choke can't did choke

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.050 
idea that the choke can't did choke
chain<00:01:43.380> begins<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.280> tighten<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> dog's

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
chain begins to tighten on the dog's

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.690 
chain begins to tighten on the dog's
neck<00:01:45.359> and<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.990> dog<00:01:46.200> begins<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:47.009> modify<00:01:47.460> his

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
neck and the dog begins to modify his

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.480 
neck and the dog begins to modify his
behaviors<00:01:48.329> ahead<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> command<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.859> tend

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
behaviors ahead of the command I tend

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.010 
behaviors ahead of the command I tend
not<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.999> that<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.539> like<00:01:51.719> to<00:01:51.840> surprise

immediately and then I know precisely
when<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.979> force<00:02:02.249> is<00:02:02.399> applied<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> dog<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.469 
when the force is applied to the dog and
I<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.049> time<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.439> command<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.039> match<00:02:05.249> that<00:02:05.549> so

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
I can time the command to match that so

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.180 
I can time the command to match that so
I'm<00:02:06.600> gonna<00:02:06.719> walk<00:02:06.929> this<00:02:07.200> dog<00:02:07.259> right<00:02:07.710> now<00:02:07.740> and

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
command is the use of a treat now what I

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.320 
command is the use of a treat now what I
tend<00:06:36.830> to<00:06:36.949> use<00:06:37.190> is<00:06:37.400> that<00:06:37.430> it<00:06:37.699> a<00:06:37.759> little<00:06:37.940> piece<00:06:38.180> of

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
tend to use is that it a little piece of

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.960 
tend to use is that it a little piece of
meat<00:06:38.539> fried<00:06:39.229> up<00:06:39.500> or<00:06:39.919> just<00:06:40.310> the<00:06:40.400> regular<00:06:40.580> dog
