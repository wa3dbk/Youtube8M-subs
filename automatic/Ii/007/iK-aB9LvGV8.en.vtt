00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.090
 hello everyone welcome to another scari 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.650
 properties 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.270
 last time i told you we would have 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.789
 was a method of increasing 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.670
 stopover services also because now 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.029
 can be weighed down by many fashions 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:27.650
 this program model patch plug in 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:34.880
 call it what you want the anti tk skyrim 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:37.460
 power lauder this kappa ad yes 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.930
 simply finds on sky nexus e 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.289
 writing on the relative bar of the search 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.039
 just write a di of k as I am 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.039
 showing 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.559
 just click on search and go alone 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.859
 that you absolutely can't 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:00.800
 make mistakes as if installed as 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.780
 works as you have noticed 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.420
 there is no download manager so it goes 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.270
 installed manually and before 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.280
 install it I remind you to always give a 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.960
 look at the description 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.560
 at this point just click on 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.189
 download and all files will open 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.310
 that you have 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:23.180
 if you go below you will notice that here is the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.780
 manager download but recommends you 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.680
 also not to use and install it 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.700
 manually 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.420
 this is because the boss manager does not always 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.430
 system files as it should then in 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.369
 this case not to spoil 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.689
 completely skyrim I recommend you 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.689
 download it manually 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.380
 here is the tdk package installer that is 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:55.850
 absolutely recommended as you see 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.460
 here written just crush up 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:05.030
 manual downloads 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:08.660
 choose one of the available servers e 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.200
 wait at this point for the brit and is 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.380
 simply extract it where it is most 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.910
 you want for example the whining of the desktop 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.310
 once you've done the double 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:27.200
 on the tdk installer just distracted 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.090
 from the folder an iris is installed is 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.020
 once installed it will come out 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.800
 this kg milk double click on it 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.790
 and here it is a little 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.920
 little program that allows you to give a 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.560
 priority to everything related to sky 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.990
 from the upload options up to 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.870
 those of the logo you can directly 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.780
 skip them or leave them globally you can 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.130
 also delimit the steam options 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.440
 maybe you could create guided lakes 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.790
 the priority of the various programs when 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.550
 launch skyrim 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.430
 in this case I don't have a computer 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.300
 so powerful in the truth of 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.730
 exhaust placed high and neither that of 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.760
 other programs in low but this does not want 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.810
 to say that everything else will suck 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.270
 no because the program will adjust by 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.700
 based on your 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.720
 computers as obviously all do 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.930
 programs will therefore improve the appearance of 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.360
 skyrim the fluidity of the game without then 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.280
 so much change everything else 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.420
 once you have chosen all the 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.430
 your options 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:50.780
 just click on tk deeds waiting for a 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:55.340
 soon and it will make you start the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:04:00.020
 game don't worry about making it a star 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:04.040
 tare run sks and with the extended script 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.470
 of sky because the ttk the already set in 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.720
 correct way to make them work 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.200
 perfectly all the fashions for a hundred 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.070
 one hundred 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.280
 having said that I hope there has been 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.810
 useful or useful 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:23.570
 obviously in the description you will find 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:26.440

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.440
