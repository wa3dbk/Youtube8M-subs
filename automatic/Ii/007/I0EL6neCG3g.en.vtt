00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.080 
actually has what's called a bypass
valve<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.590> when<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.829> release<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.399> trigger<00:01:50.670> on

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
valve so when you release the trigger on

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.789 
valve so when you release the trigger on
your<00:01:51.119> gun<00:01:51.479> rather<00:01:52.170> than<00:01:52.409> building<00:01:52.680> up

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
your gun rather than building up

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.289 
your gun rather than building up
pressure<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.250> your<00:01:53.280> pump<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.790> prematurely

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
pressure in your pump and prematurely

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.760 
pressure in your pump and prematurely
damaging<00:01:54.810> your<00:01:54.930> pump<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.290> actually<00:01:55.649> you'll

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
damaging your pump it actually you'll

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.399 
damaging your pump it actually you'll
notice<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.340> follow<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.969> path<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:58.200> watch

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
notice if you follow the path to watch

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.069 
notice if you follow the path to watch
you<00:01:58.590> recirculate<00:01:59.310> your<00:01:59.460> water<00:01:59.689> back<00:02:00.689> up<00:02:00.719> here

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
you recirculate your water back up here

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.760 
you recirculate your water back up here
into<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> water<00:02:01.500> tank<00:02:02.840> okay<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:04.380> only<00:02:04.530> does

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
into the water tank okay not only does

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.029 
into the water tank okay not only does
it<00:02:04.799> act<00:02:05.100> as<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.790> bypass<00:02:06.750> system<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.619> also<00:02:07.770> in

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
it act as a bypass system but also in

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.440 
it act as a bypass system but also in
pumping<00:02:08.399> water<00:02:08.610> through<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.030> side<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.390> the
