00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
to what you'd think about that kind of

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
to what you'd think about that kind of
optional<00:01:27.610> what<00:01:27.760> I<00:01:27.850> should<00:01:28.000> just<00:01:28.120> keep<00:01:28.240> on

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
optional what I should just keep on

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.210 
optional what I should just keep on
doing<00:01:28.570> I'm<00:01:28.660> doing<00:01:28.780> now<00:01:29.050> I'm<00:01:29.920> just<00:01:30.010> rying<00:01:30.190> to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
doing I'm doing now I'm just rying to

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.320 
doing I'm doing now I'm just rying to
think<00:01:30.370> of<00:01:30.430> ways<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.640> can<00:01:30.790> spread<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.180> out<00:01:31.270> a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
think of ways I can spread it out a

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.730 
think of ways I can spread it out a
little<00:01:31.510> bit<00:01:31.600> more<00:01:31.780> that's<00:01:32.140> sort<00:01:32.410> of<00:01:32.440> my<00:01:32.590> only

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
little bit more that's sort of my only

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.730 
little bit more that's sort of my only
real<00:01:33.510> theory<00:01:34.510> on<00:01:34.690> that<00:01:34.720> one<00:01:35.050> I<00:01:35.080> don't<00:01:35.290> know<00:01:35.350> it

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
real theory on that one I don't know it

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.930 
real theory on that one I don't know it
so<00:01:35.980> they<00:01:36.100> came<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.400> other<00:01:36.580> day<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:36.790> I<00:01:36.850> just

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
so they came to the other day and I just

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.130 
so they came to the other day and I just
thought<00:01:37.060> why<00:01:37.330> not<00:01:37.360> ask<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:37.750> guys<00:01:37.870> you<00:01:38.080> guys

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
thought why not ask you guys you guys

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.960 
thought why not ask you guys you guys
know<00:01:38.620> better<00:01:38.860> than<00:01:38.980> me<00:01:39.130> so<00:01:39.520> let<00:01:39.730> me<00:01:39.760> know<00:01:39.880> you

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
know better than me so let me know you

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.040 
know better than me so let me know you
think<00:01:40.120> in<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.300> comments<00:01:40.600> I'll<00:01:40.690> be<00:01:40.810> kind<00:01:40.990> of

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
think in the comments I'll be kind of

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.030 
think in the comments I'll be kind of
curious<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.350> know<00:01:41.440> if<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.560> have<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:41.770> say<00:01:41.950> about

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
curious to know if you have to say about

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.640 
curious to know if you have to say about
that<00:01:42.190> with<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.240> completion<00:01:43.390> of<00:01:43.960> my<00:01:44.050> red<00:01:44.410> sauce

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
that with the completion of my red sauce

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.080 
that with the completion of my red sauce
say<00:01:44.830> which<00:01:45.010> has<00:01:45.130> been<00:01:45.280> massively<00:01:45.670> fun<00:01:45.910> I've

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
say which has been massively fun I've

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.820 
say which has been massively fun I've
really<00:01:46.270> enjoyed<00:01:46.300> doing<00:01:46.510> over<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:46.960> last<00:01:46.990> four

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
really enjoyed doing over the last four

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.410 
really enjoyed doing over the last four
or<00:01:47.890> five<00:01:47.950> months<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.490> which<00:01:48.820> has<00:01:48.940> been<00:01:49.060> amazing

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
or five months I which has been amazing

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.300 
or five months I which has been amazing
and<00:01:49.510> we<00:01:50.170> now<00:01:50.290> have<00:01:50.440> to<00:01:50.560> choose<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.770> new<00:01:51.010> series

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
and we now have to choose a new series

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.740 
and we now have to choose a new series
now<00:01:51.520> about<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.700> sort<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.030> point<00:01:52.330> where<00:01:52.540> I<00:01:52.570> don't

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
now about a sort of point where I don't

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.380 
now about a sort of point where I don't
know<00:01:53.260> what<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.680> do<00:01:53.920> I've<00:01:54.700> got<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.850> couple<00:01:55.120> of

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
know what to do I've got a couple of

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.850 
know what to do I've got a couple of
ideas<00:01:55.540> that<00:01:56.020> are<00:01:56.380> sort<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.560> floating<00:01:56.800> around

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
ideas that are sort of floating around

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.710 
ideas that are sort of floating around
in<00:01:57.010> my<00:01:57.040> head<00:01:57.130> but<00:01:57.310> I'm<00:01:57.430> really<00:01:57.610> not<00:01:57.760> certain<00:01:58.420> on

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
in my head but I'm really not certain on

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.150 
in my head but I'm really not certain on
any<00:01:58.960> of<00:01:59.110> them<00:01:59.260> there's<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.770> couple<00:01:59.860> things<00:02:00.040> I

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
any of them there's a couple things I

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.680 
any of them there's a couple things I
know<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.310> don't<00:02:00.460> want<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.970> do<00:02:01.120> but<00:02:01.390> that<00:02:01.480> is

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
know I don't want to do but that is

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.570 
know I don't want to do but that is
literally<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.350> very<00:02:02.800> small<00:02:03.070> amount<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.370> things

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
literally a very small amount of things

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.190 
literally a very small amount of things
really<00:02:03.880> when<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.300> think<00:02:04.360> about<00:02:04.540> it<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:05.080> I'm

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
really when you think about it so I'm

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.390 
really when you think about it so I'm
putting<00:02:05.380> this<00:02:05.500> out<00:02:05.650> there<00:02:05.710> just<00:02:06.010> to<00:02:06.130> see<00:02:06.280> if

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
putting this out there just to see if

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.009 
putting this out there just to see if
you<00:02:06.490> guys<00:02:06.610> have<00:02:06.760> got<00:02:06.790> any<00:02:07.030> ideas<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:07.630> when<00:02:07.990> I

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
you guys have got any ideas and when I

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.160 
you guys have got any ideas and when I
say<00:02:08.259> ideas<00:02:08.560> I<00:02:08.590> don't<00:02:08.739> mean<00:02:09.099> like<00:02:09.840> no<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:10.869> should

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
say ideas I don't mean like no I should

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.540 
say ideas I don't mean like no I should
do<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.319> mean<00:02:11.560> just<00:02:11.769> about<00:02:11.920> anything<00:02:12.190> really

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
do I mean just about anything really

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.040 
do I mean just about anything really
drop<00:02:12.819> anything<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.239> as<00:02:13.540> long<00:02:13.690> as<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:13.930> not

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
drop anything in as long as it's not

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.660 
drop anything in as long as it's not
things<00:02:14.319> like<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.830> know<00:02:14.950> manager<00:02:15.370> premier

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
things like you know manager premier

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.250 
things like you know manager premier
league<00:02:15.850> team<00:02:16.060> something<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:16.960> isn't<00:02:17.170> gonna

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
league team something that isn't gonna

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.170 
league team something that isn't gonna
be<00:02:17.410> mindlessly<00:02:17.890> boring<00:02:18.280> basically<00:02:18.730> but

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
be mindlessly boring basically but

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.580 
be mindlessly boring basically but
frankly<00:02:19.540> I'm<00:02:19.690> open<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.960> just<00:02:20.110> about<00:02:20.230> any

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
frankly I'm open to just about any

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.949 
frankly I'm open to just about any
ideas<00:02:20.769> you<00:02:20.890> could<00:02:21.010> throw<00:02:21.129> out<00:02:21.190> move<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.959> I'm

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
ideas you could throw out move it I'm

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:23.910 
ideas you could throw out move it I'm
going<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.230> say<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.560> then<00:02:23.620> immediately

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
going to say that and then immediately

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.410 
going to say that and then immediately
go<00:02:24.190> well<00:02:24.310> not<00:02:24.519> this<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.879> this<00:02:25.030> but<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.330> know

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
go well not this that this but you know

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.059 
go well not this that this but you know
what<00:02:25.510> i<00:02:25.540> mean<00:02:25.720> like<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.319> I<00:02:26.349> Pentagon<00:02:26.769> challenge

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
what i mean like so I Pentagon challenge

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.740 
what i mean like so I Pentagon challenge
for<00:02:27.190> me<00:02:27.310> wouldn't<00:02:27.489> be<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:27.790> interesting<00:02:28.180> not

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
for me wouldn't be that interesting not

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.640 
for me wouldn't be that interesting not
because<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:29.050> wouldn't<00:02:29.260> want<00:02:29.379> to<00:02:29.410> do<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.530> but

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
because I wouldn't want to do it but

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.020 
because I wouldn't want to do it but
because<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:30.069> would<00:02:30.160> clash<00:02:30.370> too<00:02:30.610> much<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.940> be

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
because it would clash too much and be

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.490 
because it would clash too much and be
very<00:02:31.180> similar<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.510> my<00:02:31.660> outcast<00:02:31.989> for<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.260> can't

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
very similar to my outcast for I can't

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.839 
very similar to my outcast for I can't
say<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.830> bit<00:02:33.099> pointless<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.519> be<00:02:33.610> doing<00:02:33.819> that

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
say so a bit pointless to be doing that

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.850 
say so a bit pointless to be doing that
so<00:02:34.660> perhaps<00:02:34.840> not<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.319> if<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.590> got<00:02:35.709> anything

offline<00:03:26.859> but<00:03:27.010> i've<00:03:27.100> not<00:03:27.250> done<00:03:27.280> much<00:03:27.579> on<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:27.910> yet

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
offline but i've not done much on it yet

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.309 
offline but i've not done much on it yet
i<00:03:28.150> haven't<00:03:28.329> had<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.510> chance<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.780> really<00:03:28.959> do<00:03:29.139> much

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
i haven't had a chance to really do much

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.699 
i haven't had a chance to really do much
for<00:03:29.470> me<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:30.160> i<00:03:30.430> had<00:03:30.790> another<00:03:30.970> idea<00:03:31.090> there's<00:03:31.600> a

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
for me so i had another idea there's a

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.509 
for me so i had another idea there's a
database<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:32.739> can<00:03:33.010> download<00:03:33.220> on<00:03:33.489> the

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
database you can download on the

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.580 
database you can download on the
internet<00:03:33.910> off<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:34.810> FM<00:03:35.049> scale<00:03:35.350> which<00:03:35.470> is

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
internet off of FM scale which is

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.449 
internet off of FM scale which is
generally<00:03:35.799> where<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:36.010> get<00:03:36.160> most<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.400> my

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
generally where I get most of my

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.710 
generally where I get most of my
databases<00:03:36.849> or<00:03:37.150> not<00:03:37.329> because<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.569> any

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.879 
databases or not because of any
preference<00:03:38.079> just<00:03:38.260> because<00:03:38.440> it's<00:03:38.560> convenient

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
preference just because it's convenient

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.170 
preference just because it's convenient
for<00:03:39.040> me<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.310> they<00:03:39.370> have<00:03:39.489> a<00:03:39.519> lot<00:03:39.760> more<00:03:39.910> stuff

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
for me and they have a lot more stuff

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.809 
for me and they have a lot more stuff
than<00:03:40.239> most<00:03:40.900> other<00:03:41.079> sites<00:03:41.260> i<00:03:41.410> found<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.889> this

download<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.370> yeah<00:03:51.489> I<00:03:51.700> actually<00:03:51.790> have<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.120> go

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
download it yeah I actually have to go

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.280 
download it yeah I actually have to go
into<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.359> editor<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:52.810> change<00:03:52.959> some<00:03:53.169> stuff

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
about it to make it actually work and

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.490 
about it to make it actually work and

bit<00:03:56.620> working<00:03:56.799> earlier<00:03:57.190> today<00:03:57.340> while<00:03:57.609> i<00:03:57.639> was

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
bit working earlier today while i was

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.490 
bit working earlier today while i was
doing<00:03:57.880> some<00:03:58.060> tests<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:59.079> doesn't<00:03:59.470> look

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
doing some tests and it doesn't look

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.990 
doing some tests and it doesn't look
quite<00:03:59.709> cool<00:04:00.040> so<00:04:00.250> we<00:04:00.370> could<00:04:00.519> start<00:04:00.700> in<00:04:00.849> like<00:04:00.970> a

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
quite cool so we could start in like a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.729 
quite cool so we could start in like a
fifth<00:04:01.329> tier<00:04:01.599> or<00:04:01.750> maybe<00:04:02.230> fourth<00:04:02.470> tip<00:04:02.650> because

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
fifth tier or maybe fourth tip because

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.289 
fifth tier or maybe fourth tip because
they're<00:04:02.919> amateur<00:04:03.220> seems<00:04:03.370> otherwise<00:04:03.489> in<00:04:04.180> the

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
they're amateur seems otherwise in the

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.490 
they're amateur seems otherwise in the
American<00:04:04.660> leagues<00:04:04.810> with<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:05.019> really<00:04:05.260> sort<00:04:05.440> of

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.810 
talk about them briefly when I was
looking<00:04:20.079> at<00:04:20.139> sleeping<00:04:20.470> giant<00:04:20.829> saves<00:04:21.099> and<00:04:21.310> I

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
looking at sleeping giant saves and I

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.580

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
didn't choose them in the end just

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
didn't choose them in the end just
because<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.830> didn't<00:04:24.010> think<00:04:24.070> they<00:04:24.190> kind<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.430> fit

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
because I didn't think they kind of fit

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.860

disappeared off the face of the map
that's<00:04:42.700> just<00:04:43.660> yeah<00:04:44.380> it's<00:04:44.590> just<00:04:44.740> another<00:04:44.920> idea

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
that's just yeah it's just another idea

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.130

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
rebuilding series for F m16 I'm strongly

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.650 
rebuilding series for F m16 I'm strongly
leaning<00:04:50.740> towards<00:04:51.250> doing<00:04:51.370> parlor<00:04:51.880> I<00:04:52.030> think

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
leaning towards doing parlor I think

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.760 
leaning towards doing parlor I think
that'd<00:04:52.780> be<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:52.960> fun<00:04:53.140> one<00:04:53.320> you<00:04:53.470> know<00:04:53.560> they're<00:04:53.680> in

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
that'd be a fun one you know they're in

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.110 
that'd be a fun one you know they're in
horrible<00:04:54.190> situation<00:04:54.670> at<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.790> moment<00:04:54.850> so<00:04:55.060> I

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
horrible situation at the moment so I

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.610 
horrible situation at the moment so I
think<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.420> would<00:04:55.480> be<00:04:55.540> quite<00:04:55.690> a<00:04:55.810> good<00:04:56.020> one<00:04:56.200> to

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
think that would be quite a good one to

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.380 
think that would be quite a good one to
do<00:04:56.950> there's<00:04:57.250> a<00:04:57.310> few<00:04:57.460> other<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.790> over<00:04:58.060> wouldn't

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
do there's a few other the over wouldn't

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.670 
do there's a few other the over wouldn't
be<00:04:58.480> a<00:04:58.510> too<00:04:58.750> bad<00:04:58.960> one<00:04:59.140> but<00:04:59.170> I'd<00:04:59.320> like<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.530> make<00:04:59.650> a

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
be a too bad one but I'd like to make a

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.490 
be a too bad one but I'd like to make a
new<00:04:59.770> site<00:04:59.950> outside<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.340> UK<00:05:01.320> it's<00:05:02.320> just

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
new site outside the UK it's just

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.170 
new site outside the UK it's just
another<00:05:02.710> theory<00:05:03.310> of<00:05:03.400> mine<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.610> other<00:05:03.730> save

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
another theory of mine the other save

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.840 
another theory of mine the other save
either<00:05:04.330> come<00:05:04.630> up<00:05:04.720> with<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:04.930> far<00:05:04.960> there's<00:05:05.350> a<00:05:05.380> few

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
either come up with so far there's a few

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.430 
either come up with so far there's a few
again<00:05:06.850> this<00:05:06.970> is<00:05:07.120> just<00:05:07.270> stuff<00:05:07.450> I'm<00:05:07.630> of<00:05:07.930> almost

YouTube channel everyone knows that it's
really<00:06:19.120> simple<00:06:19.510> but<00:06:19.840> how<00:06:20.470> you<00:06:20.530> can<00:06:20.890> kind<00:06:21.070> of

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
really simple but how you can kind of

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.940 
really simple but how you can kind of
get<00:06:22.990> that<00:06:23.110> little<00:06:23.260> boost<00:06:23.500> when<00:06:23.650> you<00:06:23.770> first

get that little boost when you first
start<00:06:24.220> off<00:06:24.310> I<00:06:24.460> suppose<00:06:24.520> but<00:06:25.090> I'm<00:06:25.210> not

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
start off I suppose but I'm not

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.670 
start off I suppose but I'm not
pretending<00:06:25.600> to<00:06:25.720> be<00:06:25.900> Tom<00:06:26.320> that<00:06:26.470> knows<00:06:26.590> what

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
pretending to be Tom that knows what

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.750 
pretending to be Tom that knows what
they're<00:06:26.800> talking<00:06:26.860> about<00:06:27.100> specifically<00:06:27.580> on

that<00:06:27.880> but<00:06:28.030> my<00:06:28.120> point<00:06:28.330> is<00:06:28.420> I<00:06:28.600> guess<00:06:29.290> I<00:06:29.410> could<00:06:29.650> I

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
that but my point is I guess I could I

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.220 
that but my point is I guess I could I
must<00:06:30.640> have<00:06:30.790> done<00:06:31.030> something<00:06:31.360> right<00:06:31.600> at<00:06:31.930> some

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
must have done something right at some

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.930 
must have done something right at some
point<00:06:32.530> is<00:06:32.740> all<00:06:32.890> I<00:06:33.010> can<00:06:33.160> really<00:06:33.280> say<00:06:33.430> about<00:06:33.580> that

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
point is all I can really say about that

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.900 
point is all I can really say about that
um<00:06:34.710> so<00:06:35.710> I<00:06:35.890> was<00:06:36.190> thinking<00:06:36.280> about<00:06:36.520> everything<00:06:36.730> a

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
um so I was thinking about everything a

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.280 
um so I was thinking about everything a
one-off<00:06:37.180> video<00:06:37.480> where<00:06:37.690> I<00:06:37.720> could<00:06:37.930> just<00:06:38.110> walk

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
one-off video where I could just walk

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.390 
one-off video where I could just walk
through<00:06:38.320> some<00:06:38.680> of<00:06:38.770> the<00:06:38.860> simple<00:06:39.160> things<00:06:39.280> you

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
through some of the simple things you

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.620 
through some of the simple things you
can<00:06:39.520> do<00:06:39.700> when<00:06:39.790> you<00:06:39.880> start<00:06:40.120> off<00:06:40.180> a<00:06:40.240> youtube

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
can do when you start off a youtube

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.090 
can do when you start off a youtube
channel<00:06:40.660> so<00:06:41.170> maybe<00:06:41.380> just<00:06:41.650> give<00:06:41.770> yourself<00:06:42.040> a

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.100 
channel so maybe just give yourself a

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.440 
channel so maybe just give yourself a
little<00:06:42.130> with<00:06:42.460> a<00:06:42.490> boost<00:06:42.730> from<00:06:42.850> things<00:06:43.360> like

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.450 
little with a boost from things like

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.670 
little with a boost from things like
where<00:06:43.810> I<00:06:43.840> get<00:06:44.080> good<00:06:44.230> logos<00:06:44.680> in
