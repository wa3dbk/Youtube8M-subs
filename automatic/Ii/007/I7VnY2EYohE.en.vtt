to<00:01:35.880> control<00:01:36.240> otherwise<00:01:36.690> it<00:01:37.140> will<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.440> simply

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
to control otherwise it will be simply

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.500 
to control otherwise it will be simply
in<00:01:37.980> drivable<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.730> will<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.240> doing

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
in drivable and you will be here doing

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.990 
in drivable and you will be here doing
this<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.050> instead<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.580> control

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this and instead you just I just control

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.120 
this and instead you just I just control
a<00:01:42.030> little<00:01:42.360> bit<00:01:42.480> as<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.960> can<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.560> many<00:01:43.740> times

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
a little bit as you can see many times

you<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.460> great<00:01:47.820> fun<00:01:50.090> because<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.330> bodywork

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you know great fun because the bodywork

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.690 
you know great fun because the bodywork
is<00:01:51.990> always<00:01:52.290> painted<00:01:52.650> glassy<00:01:53.040> or<00:01:53.070> white<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:53.580> you
