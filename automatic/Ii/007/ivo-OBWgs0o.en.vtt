00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
couldn't make a play so what actually

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.929 
couldn't make a play so what actually
happened<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.800> didn't<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.550> mean<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.910> i<00:01:03.439> may<00:01:04.439> have

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
happened I didn't I mean I i may have

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.480 
happened I didn't I mean I i may have
glanced<00:01:05.939> with<00:01:06.090> maybe<00:01:06.479> my<00:01:06.689> right<00:01:07.439> eye<00:01:07.490> quickly

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
glanced with maybe my right eye quickly

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.460 
glanced with maybe my right eye quickly
like<00:01:08.880> barely<00:01:09.450> barely<00:01:10.020> enough<00:01:10.229> though<00:01:10.439> to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
like barely barely enough though to

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.960 
like barely barely enough though to
really<00:01:11.150> see<00:01:12.150> his<00:01:12.330> positioning<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.640> knew<00:01:14.640> he<00:01:14.850> was

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
really see his positioning I knew he was

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.510 
really see his positioning I knew he was
on<00:01:15.119> his<00:01:15.150> post<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.830> only<00:01:16.979> thing<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.430> would

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
on his post so the only thing that would

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.240 
on his post so the only thing that would
probably<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.509> was<00:01:19.049> low<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.560> mean<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.979> I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
probably be there was was low I mean I I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.090 
probably be there was was low I mean I I
knew<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.900> either<00:01:21.900> lower<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.590> far<00:01:22.860> side

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
knew that either lower to the far side

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.420 
knew that either lower to the far side
but<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> wasn't<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.820> great<00:01:23.939> angle<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.770> I<00:01:25.770> just

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
but I wasn't a great angle so I just

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.039 
but I wasn't a great angle so I just
tried<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.729> put<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.360> know<00:01:27.450> around<00:01:27.689> that

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
tried to put it you know around that

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.450 
tried to put it you know around that
area<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.710> didn't<00:01:28.979> know<00:01:29.070> whether<00:01:29.220> there's

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
area and I didn't know whether there's

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.700 
area and I didn't know whether there's
gonna<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> rebound<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.390> anything<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.960> you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
gonna be a rebound or anything and you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.200 
gonna be a rebound or anything and you

everyone was off the bench pretty quick
it<00:06:23.550> was<00:06:23.669> what<00:06:24.000> a<00:06:24.029> second<00:06:24.419> or<00:06:24.509> two<00:06:24.539> but<00:06:24.930> it's<00:06:25.770> a

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
it was what a second or two but it's a

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.469 
it was what a second or two but it's a
