00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.640
 yes 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.640
 i 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.100
 hi people i am that you clipper and today 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.980
 I bring a little tutorial on how to do 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.810
 a super epic boss is worth remembering 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.450
 I made a map the subject contains all and 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.369
 in contains 22 there are a few voices 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.520
 but they are voices that they have as a daughter 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.380
 as a distinct feature they are worth 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.570
 special attacks and more little things 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.190
 then I'll explain more or less 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.900
 how did I do one of them is it worth the 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.970
 first it appears that it is quite 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.530
 easy you have to touch some things because 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.380
 I did that voice a long time ago 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.329
 forget the first the boss is worth 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.190
 let's see first without attacking and then 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.039
 to see how it attacks is worth what you see there 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.949
 basically it's like some particles and 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.870
 now with one explode everything as you see this 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.149
 that comes out there that what's there that 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.679
 fire is fire 630 memo zero 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.329
 chases me or is it like it's throwing 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.129
 fire towards me and after the second 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.760
 attack is this you are going to see now that 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.530
 of the particles are you saying just like 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.850
 explode everything well let's schedule a 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.940
 demo of zero and let's see 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.980
 make me in action attentive explain each 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.470
 one of the attacks separately the 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.659
 first of all it's a kind of fire 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.340
 leaving it to fijaros principle 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.259
 you are going to see it now this is the fire that 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.240
 it comes out and comes towards me and it hurts me 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.159
 You see, it hurt me right now 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.200
 basically it's an invisible silver fish 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.880
 that goes on fire and comes towards me 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.100
 all milk and then I removed my from that is 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.840
 if we are far away, another attack is worth a 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.450
 attack do not you another defense is that if 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.119
 you throw arrows as you can see there made me 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.880
 damage with fire without arrows 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.500
 It works because I wanted to activate 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.280
 which has been fighting the body 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.009
 body 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.780
 it's going to take a lot of life to pick up a bit 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.189
 of this we are going to see another one 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.959
 characteristic pie that is those 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.200
 particles that come out there kotal explodes 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.879
 all is worth those are bats that come out 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.009
 well as well a lot of 

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:02.590
 bats and they move then everyone 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.360
 by its side with some particles and then 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.849
 they explode they basically become 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.579
 creepers and they explode and there are the 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:13.180
 particles and now I have not been bad 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:16.420
 at that moment admin or this enemy 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.030
 because resistance is given then 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.890
 does not take life to the explosion 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.600
 let's see I'm having a lot of life 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.910
 in the fire mantle 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.080
 As you can see, it is an enemy that I can not go 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.970
 for the arrows I have to go body to 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.540
 body and I'm going away because it's going to 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.190
 burst 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.560
 well let's fight again against 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.380
 admin and if you wonder why 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.600
 admin name because nothing is a one 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.730
 set of letters that are the a to z the 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.040
 ml and the n like in frames that is 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.260
 the m to the one that the faith side and the s 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.480
 okay so let's fight against admin 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.400
 Now I have changed my life quite you 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.620
 I put is then so that you see 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.900
 what can be good has 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.700
 as you see it is a fire enemy 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.320
 burning all the time in fact we could 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.150
 take away what is the fire putting in 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.730
 the watch a command that removes the fire 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.720
 fire 0 and even god what will you comment 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.580
 and that I'm Satanism 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.350
 but not as you can see it's super epic and 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.020
 these are one of the enemies that there are in 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.820
 continents two there are quite a few voices and it's 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.340
 one of the things that has taken most in 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.740
 design as special attacks 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.810
 other than that will not be before apart 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.190
 I did it a long time ago and I had it 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.590
 there kept secret because it was something 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.180
 that was very important and of course you have to 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.560
 play map to see it to see the 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.960
 'boxes' that there are because there are some that 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.180
 they are quite epic I only say one thing 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.990
 a small spoiler there is a box that 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.970
 better has 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.950
 and this is good because I put you created too much 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.450
 life I create fertilizer and the one of killed perfect 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.400
 Well now we will explain some 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.440
 as how this works okay I am going to 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.150
 leave the map to download and before 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.950
 nothing I will explain to you as initially 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.320
 the map of continents how is the 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.090
 enemy this is basically worth this one of 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.650
 here uy touch for this mind moment 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.540
 moment moment good moment then here 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.820
 you are seeing what is being the 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.020
 enemy that there are in continent two like 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.400
 you see here is the fish envelope because it is 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.950
 we have three and here are the 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.360
 bats that now fall and explode if 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.520
 you look at what is being the 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.800
 bats move different they 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.090
 move linear because it says movement 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.850
 one by one is better and in 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.430
 kind of curve and as such low 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.170
 and everything explodes and this one is cool too 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.060
 only then the other was a test 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.130
 with particles and the whole roll this 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.049
 it has less less particles but I 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.030
 It cost a lot to do this nonsense and 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.870
 good as any you this is bosco 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.870
 They are quite doing it 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.060
 well I'll explain if above it 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.470
 what is being the system is worth how 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.030
 all this works first of all it is 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.250
 when we reach an area it is activated 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.280
 this system everything here that what does 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.530
 is to generate here a pulse of the rest is worth 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.810
 well a pulse of crestón that comes by 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.940
 here what it does is generate a 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.040
 silver fish this is activated and what it does 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.199
 is the being the fis comes towards us not 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.699
 because the silver fish is a malignant being 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.830
 that came to us and what it does is 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.240
 generate fire particles worth for 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.440
 start this comes around here and here it 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.240
 it grows again and I start again 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.860
 another system to look forward to now 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.990
 it comes around and here it resists another 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.240
 once you see again I have been here 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.430
 it works every two shifts it is worth saying 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.250
 there is a turn where it appears to say the cis 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.350
 and another turn where what comes 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.030
 being the bats is worth and then another 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.229
 turn the fish envelope another turn of 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.669
 bat and when the 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.410
 bat appears the bat and the 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.449
 silver fish I think that you have 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.580
 well understood what you see here all 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.830
 are bats not then when this 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.690
 gives pulse sees a pulse that is recorded 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.310
 many bats and this from here what 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.720
 does good is basically was in the 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.520
 previous the one you saw there that were 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.930
 the bats action as a kind 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.969
 of curve good because these are the curves 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.289
 that do everything curve to curve to curve 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:34.939
 and now that the end what the 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.619
 bat spoil down and 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.110
 here it explodes in this last command 

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:40.819
 it explodes is that I do not know how to explain it 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.619
 because they are many commands and so what 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.259
 you see one by one posts explaining 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:46.579
 how the mechanism works basically and 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.829
 Well, as the bats explode 

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:51.349
 die logically and then go back to 

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:52.759
 start the system again and you're 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.169
 basically that's not much 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.819
 good science the only thing is that when 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.679
 exploits what is this here and here is 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.349
 which she explodes at the end of it all 

00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:04.219
 here he goes crazy in resistance 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:05.959
 4 to do so that he does not die for 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.469
 explosion because if you do not believe you lie the 

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:08.509
 face 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:11.269
 logically good because this is the first 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:12.649
 voice that contains is 2 and it is a forest os 

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:15.319
 I wanted to teach because it seemed like a 

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:17.419
 pretty simple concept and such and that what 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:19.639
 Well, I liked to show you 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.219
 that you see what can be done with a 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.949
 mod and you can create a forest have 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:26.689
 special attacks I did there there are 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.029
 enough in content there are enough 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:31.399
 voices are out there back but not 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:34.009
 you want to fight the then maybe 

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:36.649
 In a while I tell you, it teaches you 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.119
 some and I'll show you how they're made and 

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:40.000
 If you do not want to despoil you can play the 

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:43.210
 Map 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.920
 and I do not know map eyes or just do not 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.390
 you see these videos but good yo 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.190
 I just wanted to teach them the concept 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.260
 and that you know that this map is not 2 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.520
 but this area here you have it to 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.340
 download so you can try it for 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.780
 your account and nothing else I hope that you 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.610
 I liked it a lot, it has cost me 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.170
 very much make these damn poses like that 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.590
 that please a like for the epic 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.590
 of the boss 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.630
 and nothing else is not legislated cinema and peace 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.860
 but like if you like I do video 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.900
 thanks for seeing it
