 tutorial

 good as most of you already 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.739
 know are the two requirements xperia 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.600
 logically with x10 x10 and the usb cable 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.600
 what we are going to do at this moment is 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:01.809
 connect the xperia to the pc vale 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.809
 good connect the xperia to the pc 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.080
 no no 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.770
 and good when we both leave 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.689
 options 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.670
 these two options are going to give 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.770
 take care of the axis and there is no 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.040
 only problem we give charge phone 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.590
 and good 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.360
 in the pc the only thing we need as 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.220
 requirement is that you download the flash 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.040
 tool like the previous root video 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.620
 because it is a necessary requirement also 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.940
 have surrounded xperia x10 if not what 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.950
 you have then I leave you the video too 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.770
 so that you rub or if you already have it 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.500
 rooted no problem is legal but 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.690
 the important requirement here is to have it 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.850
 surrounded the x10 the only thing we have 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.680
 other requirements download the flash tool e 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.229
 install in our pc as normally 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.940
 we install any other program like this 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.070
 that with that also there will not be any 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.009
 problem only download and install 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.979
 very fast is an executable program 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.050
 we go to once you have it here in 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.729

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.369
 let's do is just click

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.330
 all this tutorial works 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.900
 of the x recovery is not the x recovery is the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.490
 0.3 is the one that comes by defaul should 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.070
 to come by foul in our 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.050
 devices but it's not like that so 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.270
 good good we should appear these 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.460

 permissions to install x recovery 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.020
 our flash tool 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.390
 here already says that it detected my android 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.150
 version the kernel and everything else and more 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.220
 important rotax ex to the side if they do not arrive 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.050
 to have this message because it is because 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.910
 they have root you know the description of 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.280

 root your devices so 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.970
 different easy and fast 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.540
 here in freestyle we have several 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.730
 options are not seeing is a rayito a 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.220
 padlock unlocked a key a boat 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.740
 of trash an arrow and this is the most 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.130
 important with which he will install us 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.490
 recovery is a cross let's click 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.650
 there on the cross 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.590
 appeared in some messages and we get 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.260

 xperia devices you will get to 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.510
 work the club work mode so it's 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.750
 more recommended to give him is 0.3 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.210
 who has the key that is he so 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.220

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.540
 messages as you are seeing them in 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.819
 screen 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.350
 and what to say that he is already installing in 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.620
 our devices 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.240

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.750

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.870
 the recovery in the shakespeare 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.220
 now let's start what are we going 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.329
 disconnect our spy that is 10 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.329
 and we will pay 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.490
 we turn it off as we normally do 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.410
 when it has completely turned off 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.510
 our xperia to start in x 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.480
 recovery let's learn 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.060
 when the phone vibrates when you turn it on 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.620
 when it vibrates then what vibrates we go to 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.930
 press the backspace key 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.870
 repeatedly to enter ax recovery 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.390
 well in this way we are going to press the 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.100
 repeatedly the backspace key 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.800
 I know they're watching, we're going to press 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.810
 well repeatedly several times 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.080
 until the recovery is started 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.080
 OK 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:07.620
 ah already vibrated we pressed several times 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.620
 until the sony logo appears 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:23.160
 until now and now when we have already 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.370
 pressed the key repeatedly we 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.120
 must have appeared this android 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.540
 like a troll 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.180
 and here we see all the x recovery 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.700
 vouchers in version 0.3 as they had 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.590
 said look at the options of the font robot 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.450
 Install points and gather from 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.530
 heaters reset that is the most 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:45.990
 important very practical we kate passion 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:49.950
 I forgot that with the keys 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:53.480
 volume move down up key of 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:56.460
 volume to increase volume go up and 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.940
 otherwise they go down with the volume key 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.550
 ok and with the center key that is 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.770
 here with the center key 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.830
 they will select their good option 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.710
 continuous and there is also the option of 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:14.330
 install a chip 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:17.000
 to install our roms 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:21.860
 and it also comes what is the backup and 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.289
 restore party youtube and advanced option 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.210
 well those options that are relatively 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:29.060
 They are those that come by default even 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.569
 in the same way how would the design that 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.569
 is a little 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.560
 a little bit as we will say low in 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:39.270
 visual performance but it does not matter the 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.870
 joke is that we have x recovery 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.340
 our issued crisis to today this was 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.800
 all 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.260
 let's bounce it to start 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.870
 again and that's how it starts na x 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.729
 recovery and that's how to list valència 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.229
 we see the next and the next 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.490
 base the first round that we're going to 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:07:00.720
 install or some other tutorial and 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.270
