00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.529
 stepper motors with these or these 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.660
 There are different types 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.580
 one of them is bipolar 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.389
 stepper motor recognizable by the four 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.920
 connections 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.320
 here we have liezen the four connection 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.250
 the on the ribbon cable also 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.140
 four connections if you have this engine 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.330
 a bridge or a stepper motor 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.760
 then you have to know 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
 which of these connections you have together 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.369
 belong 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.869
 and now you can either through 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.300
 to find out 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.899
 or if you have a simple one 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.300
 Multimeter features the multimeter 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.410
 stand the multimeter here on the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.969
 shone setting the resistance 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.309
 Measurement is displayed here in the display 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.500
 a 1 that is the resistance of the time 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.390
 is infinitely high is also clear the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.550
 both contacts are not connected 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.160
 if i change the associations then 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.340
 the height of the resistance goes to zero 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.579
 and you hear that signal that is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.530
 you can see on this sound signal the 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.590
 continuous testing that is it exists 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.739
 a connection between the two 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.199
 connections 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.010
 so we can do that step by step 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.530
 mother need 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.369
 I go here on the routes connection 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.590
 and on the yellow and we see the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.900
 Resistance is still going to continue 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.909
 a 1 is displayed it is infinitely high 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.130
 so no connection between them 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.860
 both connections while believing that 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.729
 same here at the green a we hear 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.860
 the sound of the continuity test and us 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.710
 get a resistance of about 33 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.049
 and displayed that means these two 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.590
 So the route and the green connection 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.060
 they are similar to the same winding 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.329
 she would now have the yellow and blue 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.329
 his 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.689
 yes here the same result applies and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.990
 also blog together 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.810
 yellow and green yellow and red none 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.880
 pass that is at this larger 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.500
 stepper motor at a smaller than 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.520
 here i have a dvd drive 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.950
 expanded 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.350
 there works the first as often 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.909
 connection under second also here this 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.420
 Wide belong together 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.179
 third fourth canton identifiable passage 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.970
 but between third and fourth 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.220
 There is another connection 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.200
 connection that means the two with 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.920
 lungs hang on connection one and two 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.750
 and three and four 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.400
 so does the cause of a 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.670
 bipolar stepper motors with the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.890
 multimeter stepper motors with five six 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.250
 or more connections are 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.980
 rather unipolar stepper motors as 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.060
 the fair a bit more complicated show that 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.060
 I was you another 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.360
 out
