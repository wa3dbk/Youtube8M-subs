00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
mute button volume up and volume down I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.050 
mute button volume up and volume down I
find<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.780> use<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:08.670> go<00:02:08.819> it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
find this I use this like you go it

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.639 
find this I use this like you go it
shows<00:02:09.300> up<00:02:09.450> little<00:02:09.840> green<00:02:10.140> thing<00:02:10.379> at<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
shows up little green thing at the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.140 
shows up little green thing at the
bottom<00:02:10.770> right

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
bottom right

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.559 
bottom right
there<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.299> go<00:02:13.480> I<00:02:13.689> use<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.530> all<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.890> time<00:02:15.569> play

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
there you go I use it all the time play

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.039 
there you go I use it all the time play
and<00:02:16.930> pause<00:02:17.110> not<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:17.920> much<00:02:18.069> I<00:02:18.189> use<00:02:18.340> VLC<00:02:19.049> mainly

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
and pause not so much I use VLC mainly

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.490 
and pause not so much I use VLC mainly
and<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:22.060> not<00:02:22.239> really<00:02:22.959> linked<00:02:23.200> up<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.379> that

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
and it's not really linked up to that

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.429 
and it's not really linked up to that
and<00:02:23.560> then<00:02:23.680> calculator<00:02:24.189> I<00:02:24.250> use<00:02:24.489> this<00:02:24.730> like<00:02:25.030> tons

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
and then calculator I use this like tons

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.539 
and then calculator I use this like tons
just<00:02:26.439> it<00:02:26.920> just<00:02:26.950> pops<00:02:27.430> up<00:02:28.709> calculator<00:02:29.709> when<00:02:30.459> you

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
just it just pops up calculator when you

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.369 
just it just pops up calculator when you
press<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:32.379> then<00:02:33.069> let's<00:02:33.700> see<00:02:34.140> then<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.230> got

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
press it and then let's see then you got

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.550 
press it and then let's see then you got
all<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.620> standard<00:02:35.860> keys<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:37.450> then<00:02:38.290> there's

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
all the standard keys and then there's

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.119 
all the standard keys and then there's
this<00:02:38.680> little<00:02:38.739> thing<00:02:39.010> here<00:02:40.650> which<00:02:41.650> lets<00:02:41.980> you

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
this little thing here which lets you

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.580 
this little thing here which lets you
zoom<00:02:42.159> in<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.030> out<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.150> documents<00:02:44.109> but<00:02:44.290> what<00:02:44.560> I

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
zoom in and out on documents but what I

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.500 
zoom in and out on documents but what I
tend<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:44.920> do<00:02:45.069> is<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.280> just<00:02:45.310> hold<00:02:45.730> down<00:02:45.790> control

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
tend to do is I just hold down control

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.319 
tend to do is I just hold down control
with<00:02:47.079> my<00:02:47.260> left<00:02:47.560> pinky<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.549> then<00:02:48.970> use<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
with my left pinky and then use the

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.869 
with my left pinky and then use the
mouse<00:02:49.480> wheel<00:02:49.650> but<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.920> mean<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.430> guess<00:02:51.639> if<00:02:51.790> you

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
mouse wheel but I mean I guess if you

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.970 
mouse wheel but I mean I guess if you
didn't<00:02:52.090> want<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.299> use<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.109> could<00:02:53.319> this

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
didn't want to use that you could this

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.580 
didn't want to use that you could this
little<00:02:54.250> star<00:02:54.489> thing<00:02:55.409> brings<00:02:56.409> up<00:02:56.650> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
little star thing brings up the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.680 
little star thing brings up the
Microsoft<00:02:59.590> keyboard<00:03:00.090> Center<00:03:01.090> thing<00:03:01.389> where

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
Microsoft keyboard Center thing where

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.699 
Microsoft keyboard Center thing where
you<00:03:01.810> can<00:03:02.049> program<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.859> even<00:03:03.129> more<00:03:04.349> so<00:03:05.349> here<00:03:05.590> all

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
you can program it even more so here all

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.580 
you can program it even more so here all
my<00:03:05.920> little<00:03:06.310> shortcuts<00:03:06.849> in<00:03:07.150> there<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.319> for

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
my little shortcuts in there so for

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.360 
my little shortcuts in there so for
example<00:03:12.780> here's<00:03:13.780> one<00:03:14.049> that<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.260> use<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.859> open<00:03:15.040> up

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
example here's one that I use to open up

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.330 
example here's one that I use to open up
through<00:03:15.609> Firefox<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> specific<00:03:18.010> location

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
through Firefox to a specific location

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.720 
through Firefox to a specific location
here<00:03:18.849> so<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:20.049> path<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.459> actual

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
here so the path is to the actual

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.990 
here so the path is to the actual
Firefox<00:03:22.569> program<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.410> then<00:03:23.980> I<00:03:24.099> put<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.549> web

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
Firefox program and then I put the web

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.580 
Firefox program and then I put the web
address<00:03:25.299> I<00:03:25.449> want<00:03:25.569> to<00:03:25.690> go<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:26.199> open<00:03:26.349> up

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
address I want to go to to open up

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.360 
address I want to go to to open up
Firefox<00:03:27.069> my<00:03:27.669> default<00:03:28.560> search<00:03:29.560> engine<00:03:29.709> is

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
Firefox my default search engine is

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.140 
Firefox my default search engine is
Chrome

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
Chrome

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.240 
Chrome
so<00:03:31.480> when<00:03:31.629> I<00:03:31.660> do<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:32.169> goes<00:03:32.319> straight<00:03:33.010> to

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
so when I do that it goes straight to

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.400 
so when I do that it goes straight to
there<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:34.109> also<00:03:35.109> I<00:03:35.650> mean<00:03:36.150> if<00:03:37.150> you're<00:03:38.049> super

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
there I also I mean if you're super

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:46.830 
there I also I mean if you're super
hardcore<00:03:38.650> into<00:03:41.910> like<00:03:45.060> programming<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.810> can

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
hardcore into like programming you can

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.110 
hardcore into like programming you can
use<00:03:47.230> something<00:03:47.769> like<00:03:47.919> autohotkey<00:03:48.489> which<00:03:48.970> is

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
use something like autohotkey which is

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.839 
use something like autohotkey which is
what<00:03:49.269> I<00:03:49.299> use<00:03:49.540> which<00:03:49.780> is<00:03:50.430> which<00:03:51.430> is<00:03:51.609> something

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
what I use which is which is something

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.149 
what I use which is which is something
that<00:03:52.359> uses<00:03:53.199> scripts<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:54.459> help<00:03:54.639> program<00:03:55.569> out

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
that uses scripts to help program out

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.740 
that uses scripts to help program out
certain<00:03:57.159> commands<00:03:57.579> so<00:03:57.819> like<00:03:58.030> for<00:03:58.239> example<00:03:58.299> if

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
certain commands so like for example if

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.640 
certain commands so like for example if
I<00:03:58.989> press<00:03:59.609> windows<00:04:00.609> 1<00:04:01.049> it'll<00:04:02.049> open<00:04:02.230> up<00:04:02.500> a

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
I press windows 1 it'll open up a

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.240 
I press windows 1 it'll open up a
specific<00:04:02.859> folder<00:04:03.430> in<00:04:03.819> my<00:04:04.510> computer<00:04:05.349> that<00:04:06.190> I

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
specific folder in my computer that I

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.219 
specific folder in my computer that I
frequent<00:04:06.819> a<00:04:07.949> lot<00:04:08.949> so<00:04:09.609> anyway<00:04:09.970> that's<00:04:10.720> pretty

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.229 
frequent a lot so anyway that's pretty

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:12.750 
frequent a lot so anyway that's pretty
much<00:04:11.379> it<00:04:11.590> for<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.859> keyboard<00:04:12.099> I<00:04:12.489> mean<00:04:12.639> it

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
much it for the keyboard I mean it

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.460 
much it for the keyboard I mean it
survives<00:04:13.199> it<00:04:14.199> survived<00:04:14.680> for<00:04:14.949> many<00:04:15.340> years<00:04:15.699> I

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
survives it survived for many years I

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.560 
survives it survived for many years I
mean<00:04:17.470> one<00:04:18.400> thing<00:04:18.639> I've<00:04:18.760> heard<00:04:18.970> about<00:04:19.090> our<00:04:19.239> like

mean one thing I've heard about our like
mechanical<00:04:20.200> keyboards<00:04:20.709> that<00:04:20.919> they're<00:04:21.130> pretty

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
mechanical keyboards that they're pretty

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.510 
mechanical keyboards that they're pretty
good<00:04:22.740> but

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
good but

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.710
