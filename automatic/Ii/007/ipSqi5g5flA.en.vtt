00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
this setup a little bit more especially

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.129 
this setup a little bit more especially
because<00:02:32.590> I'm<00:02:32.739> like<00:02:32.859> a<00:02:32.920> heel<00:02:33.129> striker<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:34.540> don't

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
Pegasus for the foot but it is nice to

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.059 
Pegasus for the foot but it is nice to

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.890 
have because on toe offs you're getting
a<00:02:42.129> little<00:02:42.189> bit<00:02:42.370> more<00:02:42.459> response<00:02:42.909> and<00:02:43.209> just<00:02:43.780> a

they're<00:02:47.969> got<00:02:48.969> a<00:02:49.000> rubber<00:02:49.480> full-blown<00:02:50.049> rubber

they're got a rubber full-blown rubber

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.520 
they're got a rubber full-blown rubber
on<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.680> back<00:02:50.859> here<00:02:51.220> on<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.549> highway<00:02:51.669> areas

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
on the back here on the highway areas

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.610 
on the back here on the highway areas
also<00:02:53.530> in<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.769> toe<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.220> then<00:02:54.700> this<00:02:54.939> blue<00:02:55.900> area

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
also in the toe and then this blue area

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.110 
also in the toe and then this blue area
right<00:02:56.739> here<00:02:56.799> in<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.099> forefoot<00:02:57.459> it's<00:02:57.669> actually

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
right here in the forefoot it's actually

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.199 
right here in the forefoot it's actually
a<00:02:58.150> dura<00:02:58.629> line<00:02:58.980> which<00:02:59.980> is<00:03:00.159> kind<00:03:00.549> of<00:03:00.609> a<00:03:00.730> mix<00:03:00.970> of

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
a dura line which is kind of a mix of

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.309 
a dura line which is kind of a mix of
rubber<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.519> foam<00:03:03.689> so<00:03:04.689> it<00:03:04.870> won't<00:03:05.049> be<00:03:05.200> as

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
rubber and foam so it won't be as

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.520 
rubber and foam so it won't be as
durable<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:06.790> it'll<00:03:07.450> give<00:03:07.659> you<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.810> nice<00:03:08.019> soft

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
durable but it'll give you a nice soft

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.610 
durable but it'll give you a nice soft
feel<00:03:08.829> and<00:03:09.689> then<00:03:10.689> I<00:03:10.719> believe<00:03:11.109> this<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.439> like<00:03:11.590> a

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
feel and then I believe this is like a

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.530 
feel and then I believe this is like a
like<00:03:12.129> a<00:03:12.159> shank<00:03:12.430> plate<00:03:12.700> for<00:03:12.879> a<00:03:12.909> torsional

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
like a shank plate for a torsional

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.149 
like a shank plate for a torsional
rigidity<00:03:15.599> overall<00:03:16.599> it's<00:03:16.900> really<00:03:17.230> nice<00:03:17.409> shoe<00:03:17.650> I
