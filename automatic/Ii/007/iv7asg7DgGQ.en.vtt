what's<00:00:07.830> up<00:00:08.069> YouTube<00:00:08.429> so<00:00:08.910> today<00:00:09.150> we're<00:00:09.330> be

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
what's up YouTube so today we're be

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.060 
what's up YouTube so today we're be
talking<00:00:09.719> about<00:00:09.780> randomizers<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.769> can<00:00:10.950> make

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
talking about randomizers and I can make

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.709 
talking about randomizers and I can make
something<00:00:11.280> truly<00:00:11.670> random<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.210> Minecraft<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.559> I

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
something truly random in Minecraft so I

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.210 
something truly random in Minecraft so I
have<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> couple<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.289> examples<00:00:16.590> here<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.070> how

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
have a couple of examples here and how

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.090 
have a couple of examples here and how
you<00:00:17.279> can<00:00:17.400> do<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:19.140> thing<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.410> with

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
you can do this but the thing is with

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.310 
you can do this but the thing is with
anything<00:00:20.580> was<00:00:20.820> about<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> computer<00:00:21.480> there<00:00:22.140> is

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
anything was about a computer there is

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.710 
anything was about a computer there is
nothing<00:00:23.039> completely<00:00:23.789> random<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> computer

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
nothing completely random on a computer

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.310 
nothing completely random on a computer
even<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.220> go<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.640> like<00:00:27.210> say<00:00:27.449> open<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
even if we go and like say open up a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.929 
even if we go and like say open up a
batch<00:00:28.439> file<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.920> type<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.250> percent<00:00:29.640> random

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
batch file and type in percent random

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.080 
batch file and type in percent random
percent<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:31.109> always<00:00:31.349> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> be

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
percent it's not always going to be

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.160 
percent it's not always going to be
random<00:00:33.090> there's<00:00:33.300> always<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.079> always

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
random there's always like it can always

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.400 
random there's always like it can always
loop<00:00:34.410> around<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.390> here's<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.840> example<00:00:36.989> I

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
loop around so here's one example I

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.600 
loop around so here's one example I
think<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.620> Nets<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> whole<00:00:38.160> bunch<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.460> these

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
think a Nets have a whole bunch of these

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.810 
think a Nets have a whole bunch of these
is<00:00:38.850> um<00:00:39.840> I'll<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.800> kind<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.070> tick<00:00:41.280> around<00:00:41.579> and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
is um I'll just kind of tick around and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.180 
is um I'll just kind of tick around and
it<00:00:42.629> does<00:00:42.780> keep<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.680> back<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.950> forth

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
it does keep like going back and forth

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.420 
it does keep like going back and forth
and<00:00:44.660> eventually<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:46.620> will<00:00:46.770> line<00:00:47.039> up<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and eventually they will line up and

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.860 
and eventually they will line up and
turn<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.360> torch<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.870> right<00:00:49.170> there<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:51.690> more

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
turn this torch on right there the more

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.450 
turn this torch on right there the more
longer<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.199> make<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.500> two-way<00:00:52.949> longer<00:00:53.370> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
longer you make this two-way longer it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.830 
longer you make this two-way longer it
gets<00:00:53.550> as<00:00:53.820> long<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.539> one

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
gets as long as you have just have one

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.889 
gets as long as you have just have one
more<00:00:54.989> repeater<00:00:55.379> there<00:00:56.480> there<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.539> go<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.780> saw

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
more repeater there there you go you saw

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.990 
more repeater there there you go you saw
this<00:00:58.350> i'll<00:00:58.559> turn<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.190> then<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.850> turn

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
this i'll turn on and then it is in turn

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.360 
this i'll turn on and then it is in turn
on<00:01:00.090> again<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:00.750> there<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.289> go<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.309> I'm

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
on again because there you go so I'm

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.399 
on again because there you go so I'm
going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.609> turn<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.789> off<00:01:03.049> there's<00:01:04.049> why<00:01:04.229> don't

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
going to turn this off there's why don't

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.870 
going to turn this off there's why don't
like<00:01:04.500> using<00:01:04.680> these<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.129> because<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.460> only<00:01:05.580> tix

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
like using these is because it only tix

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.700 
like using these is because it only tix
once<00:01:06.119> every<00:01:06.600> once<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.840> while<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.229> even<00:01:07.500> if

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
once every once a while and even if

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.649 
once every once a while and even if
invert<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.310> only<00:01:08.670> takes<00:01:08.970> once<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.450> it

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
invert it it only takes once and it

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.469 
invert it it only takes once and it
doesn't<00:01:09.900> hold<00:01:10.020> state<00:01:10.820> this<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.060> doesn't<00:01:12.330> hold

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
doesn't hold state this one doesn't hold

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.080 
doesn't hold state this one doesn't hold
it<00:01:12.600> say<00:01:12.750> either<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.950> guess<00:01:14.909> in

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it say either but it is I guess in

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.090 
it say either but it is I guess in
saleable<00:01:15.390> random<00:01:16.850> but<00:01:18.110> it's<00:01:19.110> very<00:01:19.439> laggy<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
saleable random but it's very laggy and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.530 
saleable random but it's very laggy and
it<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.320> always<00:01:22.320> starts<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:24.330> last

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it just it always starts and the last

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.090 
it just it always starts and the last
one<00:01:26.060> which<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:27.960> useful<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.070> have

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
one which is not very useful if you have

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.390 
one which is not very useful if you have
like<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> one-second<00:01:30.180> dangler<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.220> is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
like a one-second dangler so this is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.210 
like a one-second dangler so this is
what<00:01:32.640> i<00:01:32.670> use<00:01:33.140> say<00:01:34.140> for<00:01:34.350> my<00:01:34.409> template<00:01:34.799> notch<00:01:34.979> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
what i use say for my template notch and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.590 
what i use say for my template notch and
i'll<00:01:35.310> explain<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.670> after<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> explain<00:01:36.450> this

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
i'll explain that after I explain this

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.850 
i'll explain that after I explain this
one<00:01:36.780> um<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:38.299> involves<00:01:39.299> human<00:01:39.659> input<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.590> is

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
one um and involves human input that is

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.960 
one um and involves human input that is
the<00:01:41.040> only<00:01:41.130> way<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.610> make<00:01:41.759> something

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the only way you can make something

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.300 
the only way you can make something
truly<00:01:42.390> random<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.200> Minecraft<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
truly random in Minecraft so you have a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.280 
truly random in Minecraft so you have a
user<00:01:47.579> step<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.299> pressure<00:01:48.450> plate<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:49.049> start

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
user step on a pressure plate to start

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.830 
user step on a pressure plate to start
triggering<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> now<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> start

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
triggering it so now it's going to start

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.280 
triggering it so now it's going to start
going<00:01:51.990> through<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.909> counting<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.079> binary<00:01:55.079> in

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
going through and counting in binary in

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.499 
going through and counting in binary in
three<00:01:55.470> bits<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.770> minor<00:01:55.920> E<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.909> now<00:01:57.270> I'm<00:01:57.390> just

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
three bits of minor E so now I'm just

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.539 
three bits of minor E so now I'm just
going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.750> keep<00:01:57.869> counting<00:01:58.290> through<00:01:58.549> until

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
going to keep counting through until

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.719 
going to keep counting through until
they<00:02:00.299> step<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.890> locks<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.399> stay

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
they step on this and it locks that stay

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.889 
they step on this and it locks that stay
in<00:02:02.969> whichever<00:02:03.509> one<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:04.049> had<00:02:04.469> lit<00:02:04.710> up<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.899> that

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
in whichever one they had lit up so that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.880 
in whichever one they had lit up so that
would<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:08.810> one<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.959> binary<00:02:10.349> even<00:02:10.830> though

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
would be on one in binary even though

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.440 
would be on one in binary even though
this<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.160> inverted<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.819> will<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.120> 1<00:02:12.150> this

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
this is inverted so this will be 1 this

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.570 
this is inverted so this will be 1 this
would<00:02:12.660> be

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
would be

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.660 
would be
six<00:02:14.360> in<00:02:14.630> binary<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:17.320> we<00:02:18.320> are<00:02:18.500> um<00:02:18.710> that's<00:02:19.490> way

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
six in binary so we are um that's way

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.040 
six in binary so we are um that's way
you<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:19.880> make<00:02:20.030> it<00:02:20.180> truly<00:02:20.330> random<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:20.930> I'm

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
you can make it truly random so I'm

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.150 
you can make it truly random so I'm
gonna<00:02:21.140> go<00:02:21.260> ahead<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.440> go<00:02:21.560> over<00:02:21.590> here<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.950> my

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
gonna go ahead and go over here to my

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.250 
gonna go ahead and go over here to my
temple<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.520> notch<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.060> just<00:02:23.660> kind<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.840> explain

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
temple a notch and just kind of explain

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.980 
temple a notch and just kind of explain
how<00:02:24.500> my<00:02:24.620> randomizer<00:02:25.070> works<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.790> how<00:02:26.510> it's

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
how my randomizer works and how it's

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.860 
how my randomizer works and how it's
truly<00:02:27.470> random<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:28.910> know<00:02:29.180> how<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.390> have<00:02:29.690> my

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
truly random so you know how I have my

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.810 
truly random so you know how I have my
little<00:02:29.990> fountain<00:02:30.230> over<00:02:30.500> here<00:02:30.680> i'll<00:02:31.310> hit<00:02:31.700> it

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
little fountain over here i'll hit it

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.060 
little fountain over here i'll hit it
inside<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.300> here<00:02:32.470> well<00:02:33.470> as<00:02:33.740> soon<00:02:33.890> as<00:02:33.980> you're

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
inside of here well as soon as you're

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.310 
inside of here well as soon as you're
thrown<00:02:34.220> an<00:02:34.310> item<00:02:34.720> actually<00:02:35.720> let<00:02:35.810> me<00:02:35.840> I'm<00:02:36.020> gonna

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
thrown an item actually let me I'm gonna

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:47.080 
thrown an item actually let me I'm gonna
turn<00:02:37.010> notch<00:02:37.370> on<00:02:43.660> alright<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.790> when<00:02:46.790> I<00:02:46.820> throw

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
turn notch on alright so when I throw

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.280 
turn notch on alright so when I throw
something<00:02:47.450> into<00:02:47.600> here<00:02:49.120> say<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.330> ace<00:02:51.260> a

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
something into here say it ace a

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.080 
something into here say it ace a
redstone<00:02:51.680> it'll<00:02:52.459> go<00:02:52.580> through<00:02:52.760> an<00:02:52.820> item

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
redstone it'll go through an item

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.550 
redstone it'll go through an item
detector<00:02:53.480> which<00:02:53.660> will<00:02:53.780> toggle<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.200> T<00:02:54.350> flip

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
detector which will toggle the T flip

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.490 
detector which will toggle the T flip
flop<00:02:54.770> which<00:02:55.010> would<00:02:55.190> keep<00:02:55.490> it<00:02:55.730> all<00:02:56.060> on<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:57.380> now

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
flop which would keep it all on so now

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.990 
flop which would keep it all on so now
it's<00:02:57.680> on<00:02:57.800> so<00:02:58.280> now<00:02:58.400> if<00:02:58.610> we<00:02:58.640> come<00:02:58.880> back<00:02:59.030> here<00:03:01.000> fly

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
it's on so now if we come back here fly

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.850 
it's on so now if we come back here fly
up<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:02.360> around<00:03:05.230> we're<00:03:06.230> going<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.410> notice<00:03:06.590> that

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
up and around we're going to notice that

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.260 
up and around we're going to notice that
this<00:03:07.370> line<00:03:07.670> right<00:03:07.850> here<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:08.240> on<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:10.270> making

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
this line right here is on and making

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.900 
this line right here is on and making
this<00:03:11.660> just<00:03:11.900> toggle<00:03:12.170> through<00:03:12.580> so<00:03:13.580> now<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:13.760> can

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
this just toggle through so now you can

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.080 
this just toggle through so now you can
see<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.090> it's<00:03:14.330> going<00:03:14.540> truly<00:03:14.840> random<00:03:15.070> now<00:03:16.090> if

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
see that it's going truly random now if

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.000 
see that it's going truly random now if
I<00:03:17.480> step<00:03:17.840> on<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.080> pressure<00:03:18.290> plate<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.739> open<00:03:18.920> the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
I step on the pressure plate to open the

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.550 
I step on the pressure plate to open the
door<00:03:19.160> this<00:03:19.640> line<00:03:19.910> is<00:03:19.940> going<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.239> light<00:03:20.390> up<00:03:20.560> this

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
door this line is going to light up this

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.440 
door this line is going to light up this
white<00:03:21.860> one<00:03:22.010> right<00:03:22.040> here<00:03:22.340> it's<00:03:23.150> going<00:03:23.300> to<00:03:23.330> hit

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
white one right here it's going to hit

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.880 
white one right here it's going to hit
this<00:03:23.630> T<00:03:23.870> flip-flop<00:03:24.290> power<00:03:24.830> this<00:03:25.390> turn<00:03:26.390> off<00:03:26.890> the

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
this T flip-flop power this turn off the

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.120 
this T flip-flop power this turn off the
randomizer<00:03:29.080> lock<00:03:30.080> in<00:03:30.260> those<00:03:30.410> states<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.980> then

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
randomizer lock in those states and then

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.620 
randomizer lock in those states and then
allow<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.489> through<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:31.820> go<00:03:31.910> into<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.239> decoder

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
allow it through to go into the decoder

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.620 
allow it through to go into the decoder
and<00:03:34.060> come<00:03:35.060> out<00:03:35.150> in<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.330> decimal<00:03:35.720> number<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:37.630> make

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
and come out in a decimal number to make

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
and come out in a decimal number to make
notch<00:03:38.930> tick<00:03:39.830> or<00:03:40.070> whatever<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:42.230> is<00:03:42.410> how

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
notch tick or whatever so that is how

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.530 
notch tick or whatever so that is how
the<00:03:42.709> randomizer<00:03:43.220> works<00:03:43.459> it's<00:03:43.790> all<00:03:44.030> based<00:03:44.330> on

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
the randomizer works it's all based on

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.949 
the randomizer works it's all based on
user<00:03:45.230> inputs<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.190> no<00:03:46.430> one<00:03:46.580> knows<00:03:46.850> like<00:03:47.720> it

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
user inputs so and no one knows like it

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.690 
user inputs so and no one knows like it
never<00:03:48.140> stops<00:03:48.530> on<00:03:48.769> like<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.310> same<00:03:49.519> number

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
never stops on like the same number

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.000 
never stops on like the same number
because<00:03:50.120> even<00:03:50.690> though<00:03:50.840> somebody's<00:03:51.739> ago<00:03:51.890> was

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
because even though somebody's ago was

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.350 
because even though somebody's ago was
in<00:03:52.130> there<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.430> will<00:03:52.550> randomize<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:52.940> few<00:03:53.180> times

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
in there it will randomize a few times

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.960 
in there it will randomize a few times
afterwards<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.310> walked<00:03:55.310> through<00:03:55.489> this<00:03:55.640> I

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
afterwards so I walked through this I

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.430 
afterwards so I walked through this I
have<00:03:56.209> no<00:03:56.390> idea<00:03:56.420> which<00:03:56.780> events<00:03:57.050> going<00:03:57.320> to<00:03:57.380> go

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
have no idea which events going to go

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.960 
have no idea which events going to go
off<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:59.350> walk<00:04:00.350> through<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:03.489> he<00:04:04.489> will<00:04:04.610> pick<00:04:04.820> a

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
off I walk through and he will pick a

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.330 
off I walk through and he will pick a
random<00:04:05.180> event<00:04:05.420> which<00:04:05.870> is<00:04:05.900> right<00:04:06.170> there<00:04:06.410> so

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
random event which is right there so

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.509 
random event which is right there so
that<00:04:09.190> will<00:04:10.190> um<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:11.060> will<00:04:11.180> take<00:04:11.360> through

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
that will um that will take through

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.340 
that will um that will take through
power<00:04:13.519> back<00:04:13.790> send<00:04:14.390> another<00:04:14.480> pulse<00:04:14.840> going<00:04:15.170> back

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
power back send another pulse going back

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.670 
power back send another pulse going back
through<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:17.019> make<00:04:18.019> sure<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.229> randomized<00:04:18.500> is

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
through and make sure the randomized is

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.460 
through and make sure the randomized is
off<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:19.130> everything<00:04:19.310> so<00:04:19.669> that<00:04:20.260> also<00:04:21.260> that

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
off and everything so that also that

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.190 
off and everything so that also that
also<00:04:21.739> that<00:04:21.919> stick<00:04:22.130> that<00:04:22.280> goes<00:04:22.430> up<00:04:22.580> there<00:04:23.200> and

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
also that stick that goes up there and

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.200 
also that stick that goes up there and
I'll<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.590> shuts<00:04:24.860> off<00:04:25.039> the<00:04:25.400> randomizer<00:04:25.820> power

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
I'll it shuts off the randomizer power

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.340 
I'll it shuts off the randomizer power
line<00:04:26.479> for<00:04:26.870> the

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
line for the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.600 
line for the
really<00:04:28.160> offering<00:04:28.520> so<00:04:30.070> just<00:04:31.070> some<00:04:31.280> thought<00:04:31.580> I

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
really offering so just some thought I

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.030 
really offering so just some thought I
let<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.390> all<00:04:32.540> know<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:33.020> it<00:04:33.260> was<00:04:33.350> a<00:04:33.380> request<00:04:33.770> to

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
let you all know and it was a request to

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.720 
let you all know and it was a request to
see<00:04:34.880> how<00:04:35.030> my<00:04:35.150> randomizer<00:04:35.510> works<00:04:35.780> and<00:04:36.080> see<00:04:37.070> how

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
see how my randomizer works and see how

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.600 
see how my randomizer works and see how
actually<00:04:38.030> make<00:04:38.330> notch<00:04:38.600> random<00:04:39.110> you<00:04:40.010> may<00:04:40.160> say

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
actually make notch random you may say

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.640 
actually make notch random you may say
that<00:04:40.640> while<00:04:41.510> taking<00:04:41.900> through<00:04:42.140> one<00:04:42.470> through

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
that while taking through one through

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.650 
that while taking through one through
seven<00:04:42.860> is<00:04:43.130> a<00:04:43.160> random<00:04:43.430> but<00:04:43.790> when<00:04:44.330> it's<00:04:44.450> being

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
seven is a random but when it's being

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.270 
seven is a random but when it's being
based<00:04:44.930> off<00:04:45.140> a<00:04:45.170> user<00:04:45.410> input<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:45.920> you<00:04:46.070> never

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
based off a user input and you never

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.220 
based off a user input and you never
know<00:04:46.460> which<00:04:46.730> it's<00:04:46.880> going<00:04:47.030> to<00:04:47.090> land<00:04:47.210> on<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:47.990> is

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
know which it's going to land on that is

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.680 
know which it's going to land on that is
