00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
way to do this swap however you can do

way to do this swap however you can do
this<00:02:34.160> swap<00:02:34.430> with<00:02:35.420> out<00:02:35.930> removing<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.530> body<00:02:36.709> by

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
this swap with out removing the body by

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.620 
this swap with out removing the body by
putting<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.730> engine<00:02:37.850> in<00:02:38.090> through<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.420> front

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
putting the engine in through the front

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.110 
putting the engine in through the front
that<00:02:39.319> does<00:02:39.560> require<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:40.069> remove<00:02:40.100> removing<00:02:41.000> the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
that does require to remove removing the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.470 
that does require to remove removing the
grill<00:02:41.329> some<00:02:42.319> wiring<00:02:42.650> harnesses<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:44.090> actually

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
grill some wiring harnesses it actually

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.330 
grill some wiring harnesses it actually
takes<00:02:44.690> more<00:02:44.870> time<00:02:45.079> in<00:02:45.290> my<00:02:45.410> opinion<00:02:45.829> to<00:02:46.010> remove

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
takes more time in my opinion to remove

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.550 
takes more time in my opinion to remove
the<00:02:46.730> front<00:02:46.880> end<00:02:47.120> than<00:02:47.299> it<00:02:47.329> does<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.930> remove<00:02:48.440> the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
the front end than it does to remove the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.009 
the front end than it does to remove the
body<00:02:48.739> however<00:02:49.430> not<00:02:49.910> everyone<00:02:50.239> has<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.720> proper
