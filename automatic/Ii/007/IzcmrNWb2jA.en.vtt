00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:14.219
 so we collaborate between frandroid 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.929
 and geeks and come we are lucky 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.720
 to welcome alex the course that is 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.510
 Regional Director for Canada 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.990
 hello at sony mobile is good in 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.490
 the device 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.859
 we suspected it because it was 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.010
 presented it was announced for Japan 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.230
 it was called the z to ace and europe 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.410
 and the united states and canada have the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.360
 right or z one that was presented during 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.280
 the ifa and there we see if this a compact that 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.600
 is called to be a mini website you 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.620
 can compare the present 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.690
 succinctly 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.210
 yes absolutely so if I take it in 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.710
 my hands here so the beauty in order to get 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.850
 put a compact what is it 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.370
 saw in the phone market 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.989
 much more info the mini versions 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.399
 we hear that there is always a 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.960
 compromise in terms of components in 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.370
 terms of performance but that's the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.960
 beauty of a compact is that we have 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.370
 really took the best of his nest the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.049
 best technologies to all 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.909
 components of the rincon ex rda has already 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.080
 launched and we were introduced on a 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.850
 much more compact format a lot 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 more racist but had compromised at that 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.090
 level there so it's still superb 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.290
 camera with 20.7 g lens 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.270
 megapixels still albino technology 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.740
 in friends has since provided 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.810
 so it's a screen what size 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.579
 and what definition so we're talking about a 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.600
 4.3-inch screen with a definition 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.100
 720p 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.119
 beauty is sometimes what is it 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.649
 Chad called to the menu you 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.880
 have a much broader palette of 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.990
 compartment colors some 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.950
 competitors so we are going to go 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.259
 look for a lot more details in 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.369
 terms of colors so more than 30 on 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.930
 the same color to the buildings to 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.640
 some competing phones that 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.450
 will go + / 7 / and plans the 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.470
 make more alive 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.939
 we we will look for more 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.170
 precision that plus the three cantons of 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.750
 is while by the colors 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.130
 the v10 no compromise on the side 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.750
 processor of the coup we are left with 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.950
 the same as the inside yes 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.539
 absolutely so we have Serbian 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.429
 dragan 800 of two sizes gigahertz 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.720
 with two geeks of ram so really from 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.799
 the full power in terms of 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.600
 smartphone performance 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.729
 high-end and in a hyper format 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.959
 compact on the thickness we are how much 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.700
 I deserve this award to be honest I 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.860
 not there I do not have the exact measure it is 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.780
 a little bit wider than I 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.040
 the experience of a direct game in terms 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.390
 of components just because you 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.340
 pedals in addition that we could make a little 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.569
 more compact it was necessary to make a 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.580
 adjustment in terms of the beyond 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.019
 and concerning the software offer we are 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.269
 on the same thing as caregivers with 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.280
 for example all the world music video 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.750
 video games so we would go and 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.730
 4.3 but what do we do 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.230
 add the user experience of sony 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.670
 when the beauty with sony is that we 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.290
 have we have applications of 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.510
 media in signature applications 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.250
 at sony so the album the reader of 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.260
 music is called own so hailed 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.760
 integration no longer runs 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.350
 an experience of the ribs a life a 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.269
 viewing experience so that's it 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.530
 really the first focus the leyre in 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.730
 do this for only at sony mobile 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.959
 it's really about living a 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.820
 entertainment experience and its 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.010
 smart phones you go 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.120
 offer content then when buying 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.560
 the phone are such that they are 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.880
 in it I actually believe the experience 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.350
 of a yes yes he came up with 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.000
 a package so we had movies 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.440
 free music we are certain 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.670
 packages that is 60 days trial 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.410
 unlimited music free 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.170
 you also have playstation games 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.280
 mobile the experience of being a compact it 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.989
 are presently trailer of 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.519
 launch so here in the case of cis 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.930
 do we do what we announce 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.000
 phone as a global ad which 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.829
 there are no definitive details of what 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.209
 country on which launch date and 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.920
 what price so what are we doing here 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.329
 right now it's just going to have to 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.580
 that it is for this refusal to concentrate 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.470
 about product features 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.540
 and we are already talking about a 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.520
 day 4 years done everything 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.600
 update so obviously every time 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.470
 that cool night an update 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.330
 works very hard to be able to 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.220
 work on it, you have to be able to 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.050
 reintegrate into different products 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.640
 we do not have a fixed announced date 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.680
 currently no official announcement 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.640
 in terms of kat kit but that would be 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.070
 something we are going to work 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.840
 I imagine that the battery a capacity 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.120
 lower than the in what do we have the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.560
 same autonomy as the transferor enters into 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.630
 terms of autonomy I could not 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.160
 compare one versus another advantage 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.300
 to like him go here right now 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.070
 we have so much experience of a 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.290
 compact a battery of 2300 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.460
 milliamperes but beauty at sony 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.540
 it's been several generations 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.100
 of phones in our version of 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.480
 software if we have a version that 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.800
 is called stamina mode so go away 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.340
 in donkey battery management 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.350
 serious management see it remains a 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.360
 22 hours approximately 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.470
 hard and battery cij activates the mode 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.750
 stamina you'll see he sees 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.920
 almost kipling even times 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.549
 quadruple and so we went to three 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.959
 days 20 hours 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.280
 what does it mean is enough 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.049
 with stamina mode know that I can 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.670
 go control the way that the 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.350
 battery must be used so I can 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.030
 prevent certain applications from 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.470
 always make updates always 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.150
 need even if you phone 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.400
 armed pocket or in a bag that 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.890
 I do not use it and it will stop actually 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.640
 to do everything the updates and to 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.020
 update on different 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.180
 applications like applications of 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.310
 temperature or institutes it goes without saying 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.450
 only for calls or texting pipe 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.220
 in fact what prepares you for his 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.510
 custom made here the material the 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.950
 way that you have at home are going 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.210
 use your battery by putting 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.140
 applications an exception so if I 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.870
 still want to keep my emails 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.700
 active even in stand-by mode 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.350
 watch i can put it in the bottom 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.419
 it's right here I'm preparing to 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.990
 of applications and a panoply of very 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.450
 big options 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.400
 so I can put applications to 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.260
 the exception so that's fashion 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.940
 feminine on the design one is exactly 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.130
 on the teeth ie two plates 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.540
 glass repaired everything metal yes 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.700
 absolutely so forwards and backwards 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.620
 you have tempered glass 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.610
 then if you look at the outline the 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.590
 beauty is actually that we really 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.360
 does one piece a single piece in 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.340
 metal that we put all around 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.720
 the device and in terms of design if we 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.280
 continue high level at this level 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.210
 it's clear good the cave advantage at 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.890
 sony it's been several 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.110
 generations phone in the z line 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.729
 you really have water resistance 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.710
 so the phone experience to be a 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.900
 compactor is literally submerged in 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.680
 toulouse we compare 1.5 m from 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.250
 depth 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.910
 up to 30 minutes in the water ip68 these 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.960
 58 years old ip cut 58 hockey and he 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.820
 will be defined in several hills 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.680
 color because there is a color 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.000
 yellow pretty fluo I imagine there are some 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.009
 people who want something else 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.530
 obviously we made two colors 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.090
 a little more a little more flash so we have 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.250
 here a color more the same we have there 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.320
 a neon pink that should satisfy 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.210
 reveal the young ladies and where 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.600
 we have a black version very very 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.240
 stable 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.419
 a white version too is what we 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.060
 can talk about price availability you 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.620
 it's too early we are afraid here at 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.479
 ocs we have no ads in terms of 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.580
 price or launch date for 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.990
 the experience is a compact announce it 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.669
 in fact has been done more for traders 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.930
 is the version exclusively 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:23.120
 launched in the united states are taken to 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.009
 video we here a little information 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.259
 about the price the availability in 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:31.039
 france and sony france who gives it to us 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:33.440
 is that it does not engage you it's 549 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:35.030
 euros for availability late February 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.590

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:41.539
 price below the disdain what seems 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:43.340
