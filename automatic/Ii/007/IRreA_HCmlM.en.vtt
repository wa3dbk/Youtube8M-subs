00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.200
 paolo design is born from a union of tra 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.060
 entrepreneurs who have decided to 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.090
 merge to bring the world and art 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:01:00.700
 Italian combined with the construction of 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:02.739
 cook the kitchen itself normally is 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.070
 always represented with 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.930
 a wood aesthetic with a lacquered aesthetic 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.570
 this is the time to move on 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.720
 something else to do one step lower 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.000
 down and create a surface that gives 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.369
 another type of kitchen image 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.969
 the kitchen can become art can 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:25.329
 become an expression something that 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.829
 excites you and this is our mission 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.369
 this is what we seek to 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.369
 to do it 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.159
 we are presented and the first time at 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:57.700
 milano 2010 presenting our first 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:02.289
 model our first work 0 23 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.630
 profile this is the model state 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.209
 presented in two themes the venice who 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:13.569
 represents our logo a little 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:15.970
 sweet life from this however we are 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.220
 realized that we see something pass 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.040
 more modular something that is more 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.780
 integrable and without taking anything away from the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.819
 monoblock that has been realized that is 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.440
 more a work of art and therefore we are 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.420
 passed in the modular version one 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.239
 modular version made to measure 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.190
 like a tailor and this in this 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.140
 case the version was created 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.900
 modular of this project 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.959
 basically the big difference that 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.400
 it can be seen is that our kitchens 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.970
 they are completely covered 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.099
 artistic bonding and in this case 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.470
 give another kind of image to the 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.950
 kitchen another type of finish e 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.470
 compared to the standard is not a 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.930
 monochrome is not a wood finish is 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.450
 another kind of impact for those who search 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.459
 an exclusive thing 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.459
 the thing also personalized 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.670
 our main markets of 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:37.510
 reference are the first place russia 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:41.500
 internal america search for expansion 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.030
 towards the east and in general with the new one 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.060
 network does not reject new requests 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:50.590
 of China and that always point more and more 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.250
 a search of the made in Italy by the author 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.160
 made in italy is however that it has one 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.430
 substance that has the research of 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.430
 particular 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:14.170
 then on these kitchens we try to give 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.219
 of content that goes beyond that 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.940
 I see 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:22.090
 let's have a logical sense 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.560
 to everything we are going to put on s 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:30.430
 at this 2012 show 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:34.810
 we have had luck and complacency 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.949
 to have excellent collaborations with 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.639
 graphics taxotti 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:46.360
 as for the cards the themes 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:48.580
 offered in 13 types of graphics and make 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.120
 your who gave us a great deal 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.940
 support regarding 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.740
 the expense application of the card and part 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:03.039
 ii of details and we have had 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.889
 buys very much valid as far as 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.440
 concerns the rhinestones performed in the 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.930
 same composition is purple was carollo 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:16.599
 who followed us in all the details 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:20.330
 and the cousin and thanks to this team we are 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:23.949
 then succeeded in realizing what it is 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.949
 the kitchen like the one you can see 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.230
 all
