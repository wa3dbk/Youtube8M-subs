their<00:01:59.950> results<00:02:00.610> on<00:02:00.820> time<00:02:01.090> so<00:02:02.020> if<00:02:02.230> we<00:02:02.260> were<00:02:02.590> to

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
their results on time so if we were to

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.250 
their results on time so if we were to
take<00:02:03.490> what<00:02:04.000> we<00:02:04.090> have<00:02:04.300> out<00:02:04.570> here<00:02:04.630> on<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.020> cloud

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
take what we have out here on the cloud

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.800 
take what we have out here on the cloud
and<00:02:05.530> essentially<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.460> was<00:02:06.640> suck<00:02:07.330> it<00:02:07.480> down<00:02:07.600> to

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
and essentially it was suck it down to

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.960 
and essentially it was suck it down to
here<00:02:08.110> we'd<00:02:08.470> have<00:02:08.500> direct<00:02:09.100> access<00:02:09.250> on<00:02:09.760> all

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
here we'd have direct access on all

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.540 
here we'd have direct access on all
those<00:02:10.090> machines<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.310> little<00:02:12.400> bit

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
those machines and it's a little bit

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.670 
those machines and it's a little bit
easier<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:12.940> do<00:02:13.210> network<00:02:13.630> security<00:02:13.870> job<00:02:14.530> on

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
easier to do network security job on

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.860 
easier to do network security job on
machines<00:02:15.460> which<00:02:15.700> are<00:02:15.760> local<00:02:16.240> as<00:02:16.540> opposed<00:02:16.840> to

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
machines which are local as opposed to

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.300 
machines which are local as opposed to
one<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.260> ones<00:02:17.530> which<00:02:17.740> are<00:02:17.830> in<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.010> clouds

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
one this ones which are in the clouds

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.580 
one this ones which are in the clouds
okay<00:02:19.090> just<00:02:19.540> as<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.690> reminder<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:20.050> all<00:02:20.290> user

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
okay just as a reminder that all user

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.930 
okay just as a reminder that all user
level<00:02:20.800> password<00:02:21.220> changes<00:02:21.430> need<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.670> be<00:02:21.760> some

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
level password changes need to be some

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.400 
level password changes need to be some
into<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.240> white<00:02:22.390> female<00:02:22.690> electronic<00:02:22.870> format

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
into the white female electronic format

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.870 
into the white female electronic format
so<00:02:23.590> any<00:02:23.770> changes<00:02:24.070> we<00:02:24.160> may<00:02:24.340> need<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.700> submit

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
so any changes we may need to submit

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.910 
so any changes we may need to submit
kinda<00:02:25.750> said<00:02:25.930> maybe<00:02:26.440> change<00:02:26.770> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
kinda said maybe change the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.010 
kinda said maybe change the
administrator<00:02:27.400> password<00:02:27.690> have<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.780> change

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
administrator password have you change

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.150 
administrator password have you change
the<00:02:29.110> administrator<00:02:29.590> password<00:02:31.830> we<00:02:32.830> all<00:02:32.950> sort

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
the administrator password we all sort

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.650 
the administrator password we all sort
of<00:02:33.250> have<00:02:33.370> services<00:02:33.820> that<00:02:34.000> were<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.240> charge<00:02:34.270> of

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
of have services that were in charge of

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.810 
of have services that were in charge of
and<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:35.740> think<00:02:35.950> we're<00:02:36.070> all<00:02:36.160> just<00:02:36.310> trying<00:02:36.490> to<00:02:36.730> do

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
and I think we're all just trying to do

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.260 
and I think we're all just trying to do
that<00:02:36.970> right<00:02:37.120> now<00:02:38.100> we<00:02:39.100> all<00:02:39.220> have<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.520> specialty

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
that right now we all have a specialty

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.250 
that right now we all have a specialty
OSS<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.230> we<00:02:41.350> are<00:02:41.740> mostly<00:02:42.310> trained<00:02:42.640> in<00:02:43.260> we're

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
OSS that we are mostly trained in we're

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.060 
OSS that we are mostly trained in we're
pretty<00:02:44.410> much<00:02:44.500> just<00:02:44.650> trying<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:44.980> get

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
pretty much just trying to get

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.220 
pretty much just trying to get
everything<00:02:45.280> all<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.270> index<00:02:46.660> ready<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.080> go

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
everything all the index ready to go

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.770 
everything all the index ready to go
well<00:02:48.040> we<00:02:48.190> have<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.640> list<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.270> users<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:49.750> I

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
well we have a list of the users but I

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.150 
well we have a list of the users but I
guess<00:02:49.959> we<00:02:50.080> should<00:02:50.230> still<00:02:50.410> check<00:02:50.650> if<00:02:50.860> there<00:02:51.010> any

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
guess we should still check if there any

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.410 
guess we should still check if there any
