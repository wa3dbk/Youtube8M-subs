00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.100
 greet friends with you and maiden and 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.140
 Today we will have the first review of 2015 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.900
 year and it will touch the plane 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.630
 first rank and 301 review will 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.239
 pass under very famous music 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.370
 great music, and for good reason but 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.780
 let's begin already so the reason for 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.670
 making this car 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.340
 there is a situation in Spain where 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.890
 debuted the German Messerschmitt 109 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.629
 need to pay tribute to steel but he is deep 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.640
 created a situation the complexity of the situation 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.369
 because mr smith was really 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.050
 very serious car differently and became not 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.940
 would attract design 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.759
 antimage schmit almost any 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.770
 volunteers 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.840
 aviation engineers as a result of hunchbacks 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.640
 suggested a shop but go out in love roses 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.430
 proposal to build a fighter with 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.590
 water cooled motor at risk 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.190
 Dreams and projects Lavochkin fulfilled just for 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.500
 a week 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.090
 After all, hunchbacks shop better than others 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.830
 designers knew the possibilities 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.440
 Soviet aviation industry 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.080
 union so the plane they offered 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.060
 solid wooden in general then their 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.490
 designs is and unparalleled in 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.600
 fighter history 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.880
 English target on wooden masks are you 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.289
 comparing syllables is hardly appropriate and my 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.509
 blue relied on keeping 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.340
 maneuverable air combat his element 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.729
 this is a speedy flight with smooth 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.440
 turnarounds for creation and 301 or veins 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.479
 one for hunchbacks and a shopkeeper were 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.429
 awarded the special Stalin Prize 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.190
 but now let's see what 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.300
 is a 301 in our fight with 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.610
 Mayor 2 and 3 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.280
 as you see the main rivals is a 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.280
 20 spitfire and hurricane and sometimes typhoon 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.260
 p3 being from difficult opponents can 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.870
 highlight hellcat which surpasses us 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.250
 as the maneuvering characteristics and on 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.830
 speed in a straight line because it has 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.300
 more powerful engine and our engine 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.270
 not too good and 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.130
 takeoff weight of three tons and we viewers 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.170
 m-105 we have only 1050 horsepower 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.849
 so we are not special miracles in a straight line. 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.090
 show and in the climber too 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.310
 but there is an exit for example you saw on 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.950
 situation where i just went about easter eggs 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.980
 there beat him because we have a chic 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.830
 head-on war 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.140
 i am not composed of one 23 millimeter 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.390
 guns dvushka saw and 2 types of sti 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.340
 millimeter machine guns against I had 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.830
 applied the same tactic though very 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.629
 fun to meet for japanese aviation 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.640
 German Messerschmitt anyway 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.049
 against the Japanese in us only 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.480
 tactics are attack passes and 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.160
 respectively falconry but here 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.830
 there are difficulties because at speed 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.980
 at 700 kilometers an hour will tear us apart 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.390
 us pretty early flotar threshold here 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.010
 and the enemy should essentially 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.049
 stop the engine nonetheless 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.940
 nearby enemy field and i decided 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.849
 pure machine guns on him 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.799
 work while saving cannon 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.470
 armament consisting as I said 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.859
 because of one 23 millimeter cannon with 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.390
 ammunition 8011 outfit as you see bye 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.680
 he is not too high at speed 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.379
 I try to attack the enemy on 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.170
 maximum preservation because 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:36.329
 energy we have some problems have 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.970
 we are quickly extinguished speed and me 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.250
 it is necessary even here such situations 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.419
 keep maximum traction so that later 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.940
 come back and make a second loop with us 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.709
 quite often the engine is heated here 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.840
 have to periodically drop traction 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.819
 especially when you go with an opponent 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.530
 somewhere on the center of the map I am before it to 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.329
 seventy percent shedding traction and 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.160
 waiting for the engine to cool 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.220
 use in the afterburner only during 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.709
 bout by the way when you make a candle or 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.569
 loop in any principle vertically 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.669
 low speed maneuver 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.859
 closed nod before taking off or landing 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.260
 because if again you have speed 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.389
 pretty small then dive out you 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.639
 will go out long it turns 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.590
 almost into logs ice a while 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.750
 maneuver combat is extremely dangerous 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.910
 situation imagine that you went down and 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.860
 for a long time you can't lift your nose 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.229
 the plane makes a pretty sweeping 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.599
 maneuver let's say split and therefore 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.550
 the enemy is easy to sit you on 6 here 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.919
 will help you advance flaps 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.500
 and a little thrown off the main thing on time 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.970
 pull the handle over during 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.740
 upward spiral and when you 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.449
 hang the opponent's steering wheel and 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.370
 direction is better not to touch because 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.590
 nose and so pretty heavy when you 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.720
 do roll at low speed then 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.669
 the plane quickly begins to fall down 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.639
 diagram of the type of situation when you want 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.590
 stay on in 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.110
 for those slightly longer than the enemy to sit down 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.849
 him on 6 how to see him i have me 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.129
 there was a rather difficult situation 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.469
 not less due to the chic roll that is 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:03.939
 roll we can even miss such 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.129
 airplanes like green sorry 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.680
 I have too many opponents 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:11.409
 virtually no chance of winning 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.150
 in any case, I shot down three opponents in 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.939
 mostly it was a hawk and 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.069
 frontal attack and summing up on this 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:20.830
 I want to tell the plane that the main feature 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.990
 car is a beautiful frontal armament 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.580
 for the first rank therefore the plane in 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.759
 as a collectible very very 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.860
 even interesting well, I hope to review 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.060
 you were interested in subscribing to 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.009
 channel put your finger up 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.229
 Well, of course, leave your 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.110
 comments on this say goodbye to you 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.199
 all the best and good luck in the sky war 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.199
 thunder 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:48.279
 but
