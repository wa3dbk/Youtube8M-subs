00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.049
 subscribers and readers this is dmitri 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.389
 Likhanov portal successful trading 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.389
 recently on one of the webinars evgeny 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.139
 asked me what book is worth 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.380
 read and what books I read in general 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.869
 time at the beginning of his what bosses and 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.880
 colleagues Artyomovskoy so I answered 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.949
 he decided to give a video answer for everyone 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.010
 their readers then it seemed to me that 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.170
 the topic is interesting and lands so here are the guys on 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.390
 actually when i started four years 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.440
 back I'm in the first few months 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.290
 I read almost all that was then in 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.719
 all that should have been possible 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.250
 find a portrait I read almost everything 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.460
 I do not read very quickly now yet 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.200
 3 left to read here but what I want 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.390
 reply 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.840
 in the end , I just have porridge in my head 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.120
 It turned out because I and this is mine 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.100
 recommendation you do n't even read why 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.430
 because when you're new 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.320
 you just start what's the new topic 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.479
 thousand don't understand me these ca n't 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.490
 distinguish valuable information useless 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.229
 information or that information which 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.970
 do not apply now 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.040
 except you can not distinguish which 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.020
 information with which to connect for 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.330
 order to make a sequence 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.659
 because you need a result and not just 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.350
 set of information is correct so here is when 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.330
 you are new 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.759
 you can't do it practically 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.140
 the odds are very unlikely that you 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.890
 can make 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.799
 let's complete system or understand 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.930
 make the rules and so I tell you 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.210
 I recommend not to read because I have 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.729
 personally in my head turned out just chaos 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.829
 flow yes i traded i life like this 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.820
 here today I am doing a deal one by one 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.520
 strategies tomorrow 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.870
 other then 3 then I try it here at 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.300
 me every deal was different 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.830
 the only thing I look at now is my 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.320
 first year of trading 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.270
 I earned then one hundred or two hundred 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.180
 percent I do not remember but the creature was 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.369
 what I earned just because I 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.290
 clearly followed the rules 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.240
 I licked it very hard unprofitable 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.039
 transaction that is I was pulled calf 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.250
 I always I closed profitable deals I 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.830
 kept that's why i earned but 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.370
 the principles on which I traded not 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.070
 were very chaotic very and 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.570
 accordingly i would recommend you and 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.360
 Generally his students an example of those who 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.280
 coming to my course I recommend not 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.800
 nothing to read for at least three 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.930
 months after the start of training because 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.570
 so that your personal experience appears 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.940
 my experiences in trading live and 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.010
 present and then already if you 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.870
 need you can read of course 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.180
 you can read later 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.370
 using your experience and sift out 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.850
 part of the information calmly accordingly 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.390
 here are my recommendations for you 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:57.480
 count nothing and if you collect on 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.530
