this<00:00:38.670> part<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.059> crucial<00:00:39.480> because<00:00:39.629> Magnus<00:00:40.290> has

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
this part is crucial because Magnus has

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.260 
this part is crucial because Magnus has
glowing<00:00:41.040> skin<00:00:41.520> not<00:00:42.000> dry<00:00:43.489> now<00:00:44.489> I'm<00:00:44.640> taking<00:00:45.030> this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
glowing skin not dry now I'm taking this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.990 
glowing skin not dry now I'm taking this
tinted<00:00:45.960> moisturizer<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.550> reason<00:00:47.850> why

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
tinted moisturizer and the reason why

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
tinted moisturizer and the reason why
I'm<00:00:48.210> using<00:00:48.390> tinted<00:00:48.899> moisturizer<00:00:49.469> rather<00:00:50.129> than

I'm using tinted moisturizer rather than

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.810 
I'm using tinted moisturizer rather than
foundation<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.530> Magnus's<00:00:53.430> skin

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
foundation is because Magnus's skin

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.819 
foundation is because Magnus's skin
doesn't<00:00:54.210> look<00:00:54.329> cakey<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.079> said<00:00:55.289> before<00:00:55.440> it

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
looks very glowing so that's why I'm

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.700
