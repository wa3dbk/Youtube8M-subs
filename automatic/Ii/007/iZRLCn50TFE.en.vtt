00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.069 
and guess what we're in a situation
today<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.579> demonstrates<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.570> happens

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
today that demonstrates what happens

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.620 
today that demonstrates what happens
when<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.920> have<00:01:44.100> no<00:01:44.490> control<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> monetary

when you have no control of the monetary
authorities<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> reason<00:01:47.280> that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
authorities and this is the reason that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.340 
authorities and this is the reason that
for<00:01:47.909> many<00:01:48.149> decades<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:48.869> been<00:01:49.170> talking

about monetary policy in the Federal
Reserve<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.290> why<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:53.009> only<00:01:53.549> should<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.240> audit

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
Reserve and why not only should we audit

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.539 
Reserve and why not only should we audit
the<00:01:55.170> Federal<00:01:55.439> Reserve<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.130> need<00:01:56.369> to

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
the Federal Reserve but we need to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.940 
the Federal Reserve but we need to
change<00:01:56.850> our<00:01:57.090> foreign<00:01:57.479> policy<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.350> our

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
change our foreign policy and our
