this shot is it's pretty much a two-tone
shot<00:00:55.649> we've<00:00:55.890> got<00:00:56.070> these<00:00:56.280> kind<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.699> greeny<00:00:57.210> blue

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
shot we've got these kind of greeny blue

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.549 
shot we've got these kind of greeny blue
cyan<00:00:58.109> e<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.800> kind<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.250> edge<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.789> cooler

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
cyan e that kind of edge of the cooler

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.450

kind<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.910> more<00:01:03.239> yellowy<00:01:03.719> ish<00:01:04.820> tones<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:06.090> here

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
kind of more yellowy ish tones up here

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.940 
kind of more yellowy ish tones up here
so<00:01:06.840> you'd<00:01:07.020> normally<00:01:07.170> think<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.860> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
so you'd normally think to do is you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
so you'd normally think to do is you
know<00:01:08.040> drag<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> lift<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.820> way<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.479> gamma

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
know drag a lift this way and your gamma

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.630 
know drag a lift this way and your gamma
that<00:01:09.960> way<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.290> call<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.590> good<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.860> go<00:01:11.040> but

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that way and call it good to go but

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.469 
that way and call it good to go but
we're<00:01:11.760> gonna<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:12.270> bit<00:01:12.360> more

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
we're gonna be a little bit more

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.000 
we're gonna be a little bit more
selective<00:01:12.990> than<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:13.860> we're<00:01:13.950> gonna

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
selective than that so what we're gonna

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.260 
selective than that so what we're gonna
do<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.580> we're<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> go<00:01:15.000> over<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.240> our

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
do is we're going to go over to our

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.780 
do is we're going to go over to our
qualifiers<00:01:15.869> tab<00:01:16.229> uncheck<00:01:16.549> hue<00:01:17.549> and

qualifiers tab uncheck hue and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.170 
qualifiers tab uncheck hue and
saturation<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:18.960> bring<00:01:19.200> our<00:01:19.409> luminance

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.300 
saturation and then bring our luminance
selection<00:01:21.180> way<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.630> hit<00:01:21.900> shift<00:01:22.229> H<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:23.040> what

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.890 
match the tones as best I can
we<00:02:26.520> won't<00:02:26.670> try<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:26.940> get<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.120> exactly<00:02:27.630> right

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
we won't try and get it exactly right

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.360 
we won't try and get it exactly right
because<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.380> know<00:02:28.500> we're<00:02:28.650> not<00:02:28.740> crazy

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.630 
that is much better okay wow that was a
close<00:02:58.200> call<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:59.130> could<00:02:59.220> do<00:02:59.340> ended<00:02:59.520> up

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
close call that could do ended up

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.550 
close call that could do ended up
looking<00:02:59.730> really<00:03:00.270> bad<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.050> I'm<00:03:01.110> gonna<00:03:01.200> sort<00:03:01.470> of

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
looking really bad so I'm gonna sort of

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.560 
looking really bad so I'm gonna sort of
contrast<00:03:02.070> up<00:03:02.220> these<00:03:02.400> highs<00:03:02.610> here<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.390> see

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
contrast up these highs here and you see

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.570 
contrast up these highs here and you see
it's<00:03:03.930> just<00:03:04.020> affecting<00:03:04.740> that<00:03:04.890> high<00:03:05.220> part<00:03:05.459> of

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
it's just affecting that high part of

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.280 
it's just affecting that high part of
image<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:05.940> it's<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.180> localized<00:03:06.750> contrast

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
image so it's this localized contrast

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.930 
image so it's this localized contrast
thing<00:03:07.470> but<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.650> really<00:03:08.220> love<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.850> that's

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
thing but I really love so that's

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.850 
thing but I really love so that's
starting<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.840> get<00:03:09.959> there<00:03:10.320> we<00:03:10.530> could<00:03:10.709> maybe

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
starting to get there we could maybe

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.520 
starting to get there we could maybe
even<00:03:11.240> it's<00:03:12.240> just<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.570> bit<00:03:12.810> like<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.320> said<00:03:13.470> I'm

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
gonna bring it back down in just a bit

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.370 
gonna bring it back down in just a bit
also<00:03:16.950> gonna<00:03:17.130> go<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.810> contrast<00:03:18.810> this<00:03:18.989> up<00:03:19.230> a

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
also gonna go and contrast this up a

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.560 
also gonna go and contrast this up a
smidgen<00:03:20.040> by<00:03:20.489> smidgen<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.000> mean<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.209> whole<00:03:21.540> lot

apparently<00:03:22.380> there<00:03:22.860> we<00:03:23.130> go<00:03:23.310> it's<00:03:23.550> looking

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
apparently there we go it's looking

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.150 
apparently there we go it's looking
pretty<00:03:23.880> good<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.330> see<00:03:24.510> before<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.900> after

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
we're definitely getting there the next

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
thing I'm gonna do is hit alt l whoa

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.570 
thing I'm gonna do is hit alt l whoa
that's<00:03:30.239> too<00:03:30.480> many<00:03:30.660> make<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> new<00:03:31.890> layer<00:03:32.130> mixer

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
that's too many make a new layer mixer

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.979 
that's too many make a new layer mixer
node<00:03:32.790> I'm<00:03:33.060> just<00:03:33.209> gonna<00:03:33.300> delete<00:03:33.600> this

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
node I'm just gonna delete this

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.740 
node I'm just gonna delete this
connection<00:03:34.769> here<00:03:35.010> I'm<00:03:35.190> gonna<00:03:35.550> connect<00:03:36.510> this

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
connection here I'm gonna connect this

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.990 
connection here I'm gonna connect this
corrector<00:03:37.380> node<00:03:37.560> up<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.220> input<00:03:38.550> there<00:03:38.760> and

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
corrector node up to the input there and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.060 
corrector node up to the input there and
what<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.120> layer<00:03:39.360> mixer<00:03:39.720> does<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:40.170> kind<00:03:40.800> of<00:03:40.860> just

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
what a layer mixer does is kind of just

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.530 
what a layer mixer does is kind of just
what<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.280> sounds<00:03:41.580> like<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.850> acts<00:03:42.000> like<00:03:42.090> layer

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
what it sounds like it acts like layer

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.090 
what it sounds like it acts like layer
so<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:42.930> can<00:03:43.050> combine<00:03:43.380> these<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.709> ways<00:03:43.890> that

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
so you can combine these in ways that

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.190 
so you can combine these in ways that
make<00:03:44.250> sense<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:44.790> photoshop<00:03:45.180> or<00:03:45.600> After<00:03:45.930> Effects

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
make sense to photoshop or After Effects

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.660 
make sense to photoshop or After Effects
or<00:03:46.320> premiere<00:03:46.650> users<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:47.370> we're<00:03:47.489> gonna<00:03:47.610> use

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
or premiere users so we're gonna use

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.940 
or premiere users so we're gonna use
this<00:03:48.030> for<00:03:48.090> its<00:03:48.570> kind<00:03:48.810> of<00:03:48.959> do<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.350> more<00:03:49.590> normal

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
this for its kind of do a more normal

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.830 
this for its kind of do a more normal
grade<00:03:50.190> on<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.850> corrector<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.570> know<00:03:51.690> maybe

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
grade on this corrector you know maybe

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.140 
grade on this corrector you know maybe
add<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.380> little<00:03:52.470> bit<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.800> contrast<00:03:53.250> increase

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
add a little bit of contrast increase

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.390 
add a little bit of contrast increase
the<00:03:54.269> saturation<00:03:54.450> some<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.890> sort<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.220> thing

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
the saturation some that sort of thing

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.520 
the saturation some that sort of thing
so<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:56.790> looks<00:03:56.940> kind<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.180> normal<00:03:57.480> ish<00:03:57.870> they're

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
so it looks kind of normal ish they're

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.930 
so it looks kind of normal ish they're
going<00:03:58.680> over<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:58.950> our<00:03:59.010> layer<00:03:59.220> mixer<00:03:59.610> note<00:03:59.790> hit

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
going over to our layer mixer note hit

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.300 
going over to our layer mixer note hit
shift<00:04:00.150> aids<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.600> undo<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.140> silliness<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:02.130> in

shift aids to undo that silliness and in
here<00:04:02.430> we're<00:04:02.550> gonna<00:04:02.610> make<00:04:02.850> sure<00:04:02.970> our<00:04:03.000> composite

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
here we're gonna make sure our composite

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.229 
here we're gonna make sure our composite
mode<00:04:03.690> is<00:04:03.900> set<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.140> normal<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:05.670> should<00:04:05.910> be<00:04:06.030> out

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
mode is set to normal it should be out

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.520 
mode is set to normal it should be out
of<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.450> box<00:04:06.600> but<00:04:06.930> if<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.080> want<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.260> go<00:04:07.350> play

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
of the box but if you want to go play

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.720 
of the box but if you want to go play
around<00:04:07.739> some<00:04:07.980> of<00:04:08.070> these<00:04:08.130> other<00:04:08.370> composite

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
around some of these other composite

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.490 
around some of these other composite
nodes<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.239> can<00:04:09.360> be<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.480> lot<00:04:09.660> of<00:04:09.690> fun<00:04:09.930> next<00:04:10.350> we're

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
nodes it can be a lot of fun next we're

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.110 
nodes it can be a lot of fun next we're
gonna<00:04:10.560> go<00:04:10.680> back<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:10.950> our<00:04:11.190> corrector<00:04:11.940> node

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
gonna go back to our corrector node

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.759 
gonna go back to our corrector node
where<00:04:12.870> we<00:04:12.989> kind<00:04:13.170> of<00:04:13.230> did<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.470> more<00:04:13.560> normal

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
where we kind of did it more normal

down<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:22.440> we'll<00:04:23.070> see<00:04:23.310> we<00:04:23.970> turn<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.210> down<00:04:24.330> to

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
down and we'll see we turn it down to

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.110 
down and we'll see we turn it down to
zero<00:04:24.660> we<00:04:24.780> get<00:04:24.900> all<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.410> this

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
zero we get all of this

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.840 
zero we get all of this
player<00:04:26.330> turn<00:04:26.840> up<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.110> one<00:04:27.320> we<00:04:28.040> get<00:04:28.250> all<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.490> this

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
player turn up to one we get all of this

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.520 
player turn up to one we get all of this
bottom<00:04:29.180> layer<00:04:29.330> here<00:04:29.900> we<00:04:30.020> can<00:04:30.139> bring<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:30.500> down

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
bottom layer here we can bring it down

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.580 
bottom layer here we can bring it down
some<00:04:31.070> to<00:04:31.430> taste<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:32.030> now<00:04:32.419> at<00:04:32.870> about<00:04:33.229> you<00:04:33.440> know

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
some to taste and now at about you know

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.189 
some to taste and now at about you know
33<00:04:34.460> ish<00:04:34.639> percent<00:04:35.090> we<00:04:35.360> are<00:04:35.510> we're<00:04:35.900> getting

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
33 ish percent we are we're getting

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:36.790 
33 ish percent we are we're getting
somewhere

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
somewhere

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.100 
somewhere
I'm<00:04:37.040> gonna<00:04:37.220> hit<00:04:37.430> one<00:04:37.729> more<00:04:37.940> node<00:04:38.210> did<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:38.870> sort

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
I'm gonna hit one more node did you sort

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.360 
I'm gonna hit one more node did you sort
of<00:04:39.199> play<00:04:39.410> around<00:04:39.530> with<00:04:39.680> this<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:39.919> little<00:04:40.040> bit

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
of play around with this a little bit

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.150 
of play around with this a little bit
more<00:04:40.760> maybe<00:04:41.270> bump<00:04:41.780> up<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.080> saturation<00:04:42.229> now

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
more maybe bump up the saturation now

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.879 
more maybe bump up the saturation now
bump<00:04:43.490> down<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.880> saturation<00:04:44.389> just<00:04:44.780> a<00:04:45.110> bit<00:04:45.320> okay

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
bump down the saturation just a bit okay

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.040 
bump down the saturation just a bit okay
just<00:04:46.070> a<00:04:46.160> little<00:04:46.550> bit<00:04:46.699> more<00:04:46.940> contrast<00:04:47.449> II<00:04:47.840> I'm

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
just a little bit more contrast II I'm

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.170 
just a little bit more contrast II I'm
gonna<00:04:48.380> bump<00:04:48.919> up<00:04:49.040> these<00:04:49.220> highs<00:04:49.460> some<00:04:49.820> to<00:04:50.120> you

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
gonna bump up these highs some to you

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.920 
gonna bump up these highs some to you
and<00:04:50.479> maybe<00:04:51.410> even<00:04:51.530> make<00:04:51.860> it<00:04:52.010> a<00:04:52.190> little<00:04:52.400> bit<00:04:52.639> more

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
and maybe even make it a little bit more

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.659 
and maybe even make it a little bit more
yellowy<00:04:53.930> ER<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:54.530> then<00:04:54.979> finally<00:04:55.460> what<00:04:55.580> we're

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
yellowy ER and then finally what we're

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.580 
yellowy ER and then finally what we're
gonna<00:04:55.760> do<00:04:56.060> is<00:04:56.270> go<00:04:56.660> over<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.810> our<00:04:56.960> luminance

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
gonna do is go over to our luminance

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.260 
gonna do is go over to our luminance
versus<00:04:57.889> saturation<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:58.669> this<00:04:58.789> is<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:58.970> big

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
versus saturation and this is a big

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.029 
versus saturation and this is a big
thing<00:04:59.510> with<00:04:59.539> cinematic<00:04:59.990> looks<00:05:00.350> like<00:05:00.560> this<00:05:00.770> but

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
thing with cinematic looks like this but

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.760 
thing with cinematic looks like this but
not<00:05:01.669> a<00:05:01.699> lot<00:05:01.910> of<00:05:02.030> people<00:05:02.240> know<00:05:02.419> is<00:05:02.770> desaturating

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
not a lot of people know is desaturating

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.920 
not a lot of people know is desaturating
your<00:05:04.280> shadows<00:05:04.789> so<00:05:05.300> what<00:05:05.389> we're<00:05:05.479> gonna<00:05:05.539> do<00:05:05.780> here

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
your shadows so what we're gonna do here

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.240 
your shadows so what we're gonna do here
is<00:05:06.020> just<00:05:06.169> click<00:05:06.350> on<00:05:06.470> this<00:05:06.560> bottom<00:05:06.919> and<00:05:07.070> oh<00:05:07.100> this

is just click on this bottom and oh this

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.490 
is just click on this bottom and oh this
does<00:05:07.490> is<00:05:07.729> shows<00:05:08.120> which<00:05:08.600> luminance<00:05:09.080> range<00:05:09.169> of

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
does is shows which luminance range of

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.600 
does is shows which luminance range of
the<00:05:09.590> image<00:05:09.710> that<00:05:09.919> you're<00:05:10.039> selecting<00:05:10.460> so

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
the image that you're selecting so

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.879 
the image that you're selecting so
shadows<00:05:11.060> down<00:05:11.300> here<00:05:11.630> highlights<00:05:12.410> up<00:05:12.590> here

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:12.889 
shadows down here highlights up here

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.610 
shadows down here highlights up here
mid-tones<00:05:13.699> here<00:05:14.060> we<00:05:14.690> all<00:05:14.810> got<00:05:14.960> that<00:05:15.169> and<00:05:15.410> then

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
mid-tones here we all got that and then

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.840 
mid-tones here we all got that and then
it<00:05:15.740> lets<00:05:15.889> you<00:05:16.010> determine<00:05:16.520> how<00:05:16.699> much

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
it lets you determine how much

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.909 
it lets you determine how much
saturation<00:05:17.510> you<00:05:17.539> want<00:05:17.780> in<00:05:17.960> those<00:05:18.199> parts<00:05:18.620> so

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
saturation you want in those parts so

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.830 
saturation you want in those parts so
it's<00:05:19.039> really<00:05:19.220> great<00:05:19.550> so<00:05:19.910> I'll<00:05:20.180> just<00:05:20.510> click<00:05:20.720> on

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
it's really great so I'll just click on

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.420 
it's really great so I'll just click on
the<00:05:20.960> shadows<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:21.590> bring<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:21.889> down<00:05:22.100> you<00:05:22.310> see

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
the shadows and bring it down you see

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.920 
the shadows and bring it down you see
the<00:05:22.550> shadows<00:05:22.880> are<00:05:23.000> getting<00:05:23.180> me<00:05:23.300> saturated<00:05:23.840> and

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
the shadows are getting me saturated and

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.480 
the shadows are getting me saturated and
the<00:05:23.990> highlights<00:05:24.320> still<00:05:24.560> have<00:05:24.740> color<00:05:24.979> going<00:05:25.190> on

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
the highlights still have color going on

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.820 
the highlights still have color going on
I'm<00:05:26.300> just<00:05:26.360> gonna<00:05:26.539> modify<00:05:27.080> this<00:05:27.139> some<00:05:27.530> so<00:05:27.710> it's

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
I'm just gonna modify this some so it's

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.770 
I'm just gonna modify this some so it's
not<00:05:27.949> quite<00:05:28.190> so<00:05:28.310> dramatic

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
not quite so dramatic

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.080 
not quite so dramatic
my<00:05:29.990> add<00:05:30.229> just<00:05:30.500> a<00:05:30.650> little<00:05:30.680> bit<00:05:31.280> because<00:05:31.789> I'm

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
my add just a little bit because I'm

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.120 
my add just a little bit because I'm
Theo<00:05:32.360> up<00:05:32.720> there<00:05:33.289> and<00:05:33.470> then<00:05:33.560> bring<00:05:33.860> them<00:05:33.919> down

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
Theo up there and then bring them down

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.409 
Theo up there and then bring them down
just<00:05:34.400> a<00:05:34.460> bit<00:05:34.490> in<00:05:34.700> the<00:05:34.760> highlights<00:05:35.180> and

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
just a bit in the highlights and

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:36.730 
just a bit in the highlights and
whenever<00:05:35.630> you<00:05:35.810> look<00:05:35.840> at<00:05:36.050> this<00:05:36.200> image<00:05:36.410> you'll

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
whenever you look at this image you'll

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.950 
whenever you look at this image you'll
see<00:05:36.889> the<00:05:37.460> shadows<00:05:37.820> are<00:05:37.970> green<00:05:38.210> but<00:05:38.479> the<00:05:38.720> blacks

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
see the shadows are green but the blacks

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.110 
see the shadows are green but the blacks
are<00:05:39.169> black<00:05:39.410> and<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:40.099> highlights<00:05:40.639> are<00:05:40.789> yellowy

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
are black and the highlights are yellowy

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.690 
are black and the highlights are yellowy
but<00:05:41.599> the<00:05:41.900> whites<00:05:42.110> are<00:05:42.289> pretty<00:05:42.440> much<00:05:42.620> white<00:05:42.889> so

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
but the whites are pretty much white so

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.219 
but the whites are pretty much white so
that's<00:05:43.880> what<00:05:44.030> this<00:05:44.150> is<00:05:44.210> doing<00:05:44.539> so<00:05:45.080> now<00:05:45.200> our

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
that's what this is doing so now our

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.050 
that's what this is doing so now our
skin<00:05:45.530> tones<00:05:45.770> are<00:05:45.950> still<00:05:46.190> a<00:05:46.220> little<00:05:46.460> bit<00:05:46.729> kind

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
skin tones are still a little bit kind

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.570 
skin tones are still a little bit kind
of<00:05:47.180> pink<00:05:47.810> n2e<00:05:48.169> for<00:05:48.500> me<00:05:48.620> so<00:05:49.070> I'm<00:05:49.130> just<00:05:49.220> gonna<00:05:49.370> go

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
of pink n2e for me so I'm just gonna go

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.360 
of pink n2e for me so I'm just gonna go
do<00:05:49.760> our<00:05:49.840> huber<00:05:50.840> siz<00:05:51.050> hue<00:05:51.380> you<00:05:52.039> just<00:05:52.190> make<00:05:52.340> a

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
do our huber siz hue you just make a

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.909 
do our huber siz hue you just make a
