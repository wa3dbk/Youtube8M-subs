00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.809
 there are people who do not respect immigrants the case 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.160

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.660
 but will this be what will become the new windows mobile 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.220

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.740
 I was transformed with the help of the second catherine boy

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.750
 find the answer to these and other questions who says 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.450
 Also, it's out of dreamworks 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.940
