 with this I want to say that for a 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.580
 time has been distorted the concept of 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.650
 the fame of this my opinion doing 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.360
 famous to certain little people with 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.250
 less lights than the fourth plate 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.840
 millennium is a lot to ask that fame be 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.820
 use for something else that came out in the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.040
 magazines the hundred rags or for 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.860
 go out in video clips doing the clown and 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.410
 If fame is too much, it should not be the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.810
 objective but the consequence and how 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.490

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.410
