hours unattended and if you video here

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.270 
hours unattended and if you video here
you<00:00:33.690> won't<00:00:33.989> find<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.469> single<00:00:34.860> mistake

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
you won't find a single mistake

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.570 
you won't find a single mistake
that's<00:00:35.790> how<00:00:35.970> accurate<00:00:36.390> these<00:00:36.510> stations<00:00:37.020> are

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
that's how accurate these stations are

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.460 
that's how accurate these stations are
one<00:00:38.580> of<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> reasons<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.570> libro<00:00:39.990> single

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
one of the reasons that the libro single

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.650 
one of the reasons that the libro single
and<00:00:40.740> the<00:00:41.340> libros<00:00:41.700> speed<00:00:42.000> became<00:00:42.420> so

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and the libros speed became so

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.840 
and the libros speed became so
affordable<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.800> because<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> invention

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
affordable is because with the invention

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.570 
affordable is because with the invention
of<00:00:45.060> this<00:00:45.240> machine<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:46.470> make<00:00:46.710> these<00:00:47.010> stations

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
of this machine we make these stations

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.690 
of this machine we make these stations
the<00:00:48.390> same<00:00:48.660> way<00:00:48.900> Henry<00:00:49.260> Ford<00:00:49.680> makes<00:00:49.980> cars<00:00:50.340> we

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
the same way Henry Ford makes cars we

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.610 
the same way Henry Ford makes cars we
make<00:00:50.910> them<00:00:51.060> a<00:00:51.150> lot<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> time<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> cost

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
make them a lot at a time so the cost

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.850 
make them a lot at a time so the cost
has<00:00:52.860> gone<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:53.310> and<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.610> share<00:00:53.880> that<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.270> you

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
has gone down and we share that with you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.729 
has gone down and we share that with you
if<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.980> come<00:00:56.130> around<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.610> take<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.790> look<00:00:57.030> here

if you come around and take a look here

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.790 
if you come around and take a look here
it's<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.070> same<00:00:59.460> rotating<00:01:00.239> disc<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.500> same

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
it's the same rotating disc the same

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.329 
it's the same rotating disc the same

behind<00:01:07.590> every<00:01:08.070> one<00:01:08.190> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> stations<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
behind every one of the stations and the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.170 
behind every one of the stations and the
software<00:01:10.380> automatically<00:01:11.070> will<00:01:11.430> recreate<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
software automatically will recreate the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030 
software automatically will recreate the
pattern<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.840> create<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.560> design

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
pattern that you create that you design

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.620 
pattern that you create that you design
and<00:01:14.750> again<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:16.290> back<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.970> cabinet

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and again just back up here this cabinet

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.649 
and again just back up here this cabinet
is<00:01:18.920> fundamental<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:21.270> there's<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
is fundamental because here there's a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.740 
is fundamental because here there's a
vacuum<00:01:21.930> pump<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.650> every<00:01:22.890> station<00:01:23.540> unlike<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
vacuum pump for every station unlike the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.660 
vacuum pump for every station unlike the
imitators<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.590> competitors<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.400> use

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
imitators and the competitors that use

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.660 
imitators and the competitors that use
air<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> create<00:01:28.290> vacuum<00:01:28.530> which<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.250> kind<00:01:29.610> of

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
air to create vacuum which is kind of

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.090 
air to create vacuum which is kind of
like<00:01:29.850> using<00:01:30.120> a<00:01:30.600> pressure<00:01:31.049> washer<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.830> dry<00:01:32.040> you

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
like using a pressure washer to dry you

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.180 
like using a pressure washer to dry you
off<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:33.060> use<00:01:33.299> an<00:01:33.510> individual<00:01:34.049> vacuum<00:01:34.530> for

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
off we use an individual vacuum for

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.830 
off we use an individual vacuum for
every<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.850> stations<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> collect<00:01:36.690> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
every one of the stations to collect the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.289 
every one of the stations to collect the
crystal<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:38.040> that's<00:01:38.280> why<00:01:38.580> like<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.940> mentioned

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
crystal and that's why like I mentioned

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.530 
crystal and that's why like I mentioned
before<00:01:39.330> every<00:01:40.320> single<00:01:41.060> thing<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.299> can

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
before every single thing that you can

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.270 
before every single thing that you can
see<00:01:42.750> there<00:01:42.990> isn't<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.260> single<00:01:43.470> stone<00:01:43.830> missing

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
see there isn't a single stone missing

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.940 
see there isn't a single stone missing
and<00:01:44.549> we're<00:01:45.119> using<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.570> cheap<00:01:45.780> Korean<00:01:46.049> stones

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
