it back on there like so and look at

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.150 
it back on there like so and look at
that<00:02:36.200> that's<00:02:37.200> not<00:02:37.350> dropping<00:02:37.560> off<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:37.770> tear<00:02:38.010> at

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
that that's not dropping off a tear at

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.480 
that that's not dropping off a tear at
all<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.780> put<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.280> your<00:02:41.400> pocket

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
instead of having the case flapping

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.190 
instead of having the case flapping
about<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.180> can<00:02:45.330> fold<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.630> back<00:02:45.780> if<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:45.990> really
