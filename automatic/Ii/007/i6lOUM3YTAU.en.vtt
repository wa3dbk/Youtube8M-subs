wanted to make a video for this but teen

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:20.800 
wanted to make a video for this but teen
who<00:00:53.270> didn't<00:00:53.480> show<00:00:53.510> up<00:00:53.660> so<00:01:18.280> they<00:01:19.280> stroke<00:01:19.810> in

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
who didn't show up so they stroke in

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.779 
who didn't show up so they stroke in
different<00:01:21.170> sequences<00:01:21.680> that<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:22.190> cast<00:01:22.399> in

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
different sequences that you cast in

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.359 
different sequences that you cast in
weird<00:01:22.970> shadows<00:01:23.360> you<00:01:23.660> have<00:01:23.810> more<00:01:24.470> white<00:01:24.890> noise

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
weird shadows you have more white noise

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.440 
weird shadows you have more white noise
and<00:01:25.910> you<00:01:26.330> have<00:01:26.539> white<00:01:27.470> balance<00:01:27.770> problems<00:01:28.450> in

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
and you have white balance problems in

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.330 
and you have white balance problems in
green<00:01:29.720> alright<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:30.860> we've<00:01:30.979> made<00:01:31.009> our<00:01:31.280> way

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
green alright so we've made our way

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.710

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
show us how fast we have to walk or how

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.339 
show us how fast we have to walk or how
slowly<00:02:10.789> we<00:02:10.940> have<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.270> walk<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:12.050> get<00:02:12.140> through

slowly we have to walk to get through

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.960 
slowly we have to walk to get through
the<00:02:12.470> room<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:12.770> access<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.310> black<00:02:13.489> badges<00:02:13.700> up

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
the room and access the black badges up

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.120 
the room and access the black badges up
to<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> maximum<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.810> all<00:02:15.260> we're<00:02:15.830> going<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.010> get

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
to a maximum of all we're going to get

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.150 
to a maximum of all we're going to get
the<00:02:16.220> ruins<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.580> body<00:02:16.760> temperature<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:18.160> two

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
the ruins of body temperature of two

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.290 
the ruins of body temperature of two
inches<00:02:19.489> but<00:02:19.640> that's<00:02:20.599> gonna<00:02:20.780> sink

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
inches but that's gonna sink

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.960 
inches but that's gonna sink
so<00:02:21.720> there's<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> temperature<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.740> Celsius<00:02:23.190> if<00:02:23.850> I

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
so there's a temperature in Celsius if I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.190 
so there's a temperature in Celsius if I
raise<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.360> champ<00:02:24.570> rich<00:02:24.750> i'm<00:02:24.870> just<00:02:25.020> going<00:02:25.140> to

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
raise the champ rich i'm just going to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:40.370 
raise the champ rich i'm just going to
grab<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.740> with<00:02:25.920> my<00:02:25.950> hand<00:02:39.050> that's<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.140> speed

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
grab it with my hand that's the speed

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.320 
grab it with my hand that's the speed
you<00:02:40.500> have<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.740> walk<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.130> defeat<00:02:41.430> mines<00:02:41.670> robust

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
you have to walk to defeat mines robust

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:50.120 
you have to walk to defeat mines robust
security<00:02:42.720> system<00:02:43.350> you're<00:02:43.530> asking<00:02:44.280> for<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:49.130> or

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
security system you're asking for it or

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.880 
security system you're asking for it or
you<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.430> achieving<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.420> step<00:02:51.660> size<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:52.320> one

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
you can achieving a step size of one

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.040 
you can achieving a step size of one
foot<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.430> you're<00:02:53.550> really<00:02:53.850> kind<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.180> inching

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
foot so you're really kind of inching

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.290 
foot so you're really kind of inching
forward<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:56.370> realized<00:02:56.670> those<00:02:56.880> are<00:02:57.030> feet

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
forward I just realized those are feet

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.750 
forward I just realized those are feet
yeah<00:02:57.630> actually<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:59.250> probably<00:02:59.490> just<00:02:59.640> a

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
yeah actually it's probably just a

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.340 
yeah actually it's probably just a
mention<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.240> just<00:03:00.390> blue<00:03:00.600> box<00:03:00.840> an<00:03:00.990> altar

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
mention that you just blue box an altar

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.220 
mention that you just blue box an altar
