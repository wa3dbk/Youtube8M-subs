00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
all right throwing a good cast net to me

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.110 
all right throwing a good cast net to me
is<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.680> lot<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.160> shooting<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.669> gun<00:00:32.910> you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
is a lot like shooting the gun you

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.240 
is a lot like shooting the gun you
really<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.780> load<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.050> right<00:00:34.380> before<00:00:35.160> you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
really have to load it right before you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.970 
really have to load it right before you
can<00:00:35.400> shoot<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.140> I'm<00:00:37.140> very<00:00:37.560> particular

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
can shoot it so I'm very particular

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.220 
can shoot it so I'm very particular
about<00:00:38.370> making<00:00:39.210> sure<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.690> start<00:00:40.080> off

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
about making sure that you start off

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.619 
about making sure that you start off
with<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> net<00:00:40.770> loaded<00:00:41.160> right<00:00:41.370> right<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
with a net loaded right right so the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.660 
with a net loaded right right so the
first<00:00:42.840> thing<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.290> got<00:00:43.470> your<00:00:43.500> line<00:00:44.100> wrapped

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
first thing is you got your line wrapped

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.210 
first thing is you got your line wrapped
around<00:00:44.790> your<00:00:45.090> wrist<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.930> coil<00:00:46.199> it<00:00:46.350> neatly<00:00:46.620> so

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
around your wrist you coil it neatly so

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.920 
around your wrist you coil it neatly so
that<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> line<00:00:47.730> itself<00:00:48.090> doesn't<00:00:48.360> tangle<00:00:48.660> if

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
that the line itself doesn't tangle if

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.020 
that the line itself doesn't tangle if
you<00:00:49.020> need<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.290> throw<00:00:49.440> distance<00:00:49.980> then<00:00:50.580> the<00:00:50.760> next

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you need to throw distance then the next

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.700 
you need to throw distance then the next
thing<00:00:51.150> I'll<00:00:51.330> do<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.720> I'll<00:00:51.989> make<00:00:52.020> sure<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
thing I'll do is I'll make sure that the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.770 
thing I'll do is I'll make sure that the
net<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.920> laying<00:00:53.340> right<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:54.120> me<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.330> gather<00:00:54.510> it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
net is laying right for me to gather it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.630 
net is laying right for me to gather it
up<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.110> I'll<00:00:55.200> take<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.680> nut<00:00:55.890> which<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
up so I'll take the nut which is the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.690 
up so I'll take the nut which is the
very<00:00:56.850> top<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.600> net<00:00:57.810> and<00:00:58.190> basically<00:00:59.190> drag

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
very top of the net and basically drag

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.970 
very top of the net and basically drag
the<00:01:00.120> net<00:01:00.360> along<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.350> ground<00:01:01.620> until

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the net along the ground until

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.120 
the net along the ground until
everything<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.270> perfectly<00:01:03.870> level<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
everything is just perfectly level the

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.190 
everything is just perfectly level the
nut<00:01:05.369> lines<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> rest<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.660> the<00:01:06.780> panels

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
nut lines up with the rest of the panels

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.219 
nut lines up with the rest of the panels
on<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.590> cast<00:01:07.890> net<00:01:08.160> and<00:01:08.750> then<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.930> only<00:01:10.020> then

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
on the cast net and then and only then

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.740 
on the cast net and then and only then
will<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.950> start<00:01:11.250> gathering<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.479> trick<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
will I start gathering and the trick is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.630 
will I start gathering and the trick is
on<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.229> 10-footer<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.009> want<00:01:14.190> to<00:01:14.250> come<00:01:14.460> down

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
on a 10-footer you want to come down

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.560 
on a 10-footer you want to come down
about<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> foot<00:01:15.810> below<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.290> nut<00:01:17.210> punch<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> net

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
about a foot below the nut punch the net

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.840 
about a foot below the nut punch the net
up<00:01:18.690> and<00:01:18.930> bring<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.410> you<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> little<00:01:19.800> bit<00:01:19.950> till

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
up and bring it to you a little bit till

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.870 
up and bring it to you a little bit till
it's<00:01:21.000> about<00:01:21.149> halfway<00:01:21.420> down<00:01:22.160> take<00:01:23.160> another

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it's about halfway down take another

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.389 
it's about halfway down take another
grab<00:01:24.210> bring<00:01:25.050> it<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.289> so<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.830> lead<00:01:26.100> lines

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
grab bring it up so that the lead lines

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.359 
grab bring it up so that the lead lines
or<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:27.299> below<00:01:27.479> knee<00:01:27.810> level<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:29.190> grab

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
or just below knee level and then grab

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.820 
or just below knee level and then grab
it<00:01:29.520> again<00:01:29.930> now<00:01:30.930> you've<00:01:31.080> got<00:01:31.229> your<00:01:31.350> left<00:01:31.560> hand

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
it again now you've got your left hand

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.410 
it again now you've got your left hand
loaded<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> trick<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.820> loading<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.390> rest

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
loaded now the trick is loading the rest

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.120 
loaded now the trick is loading the rest
of<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.780> net<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.470> what<00:01:34.619> I'll<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.890> I'll<00:01:35.100> take

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
of the net so what I'll do is I'll take

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.730 
of the net so what I'll do is I'll take
the<00:01:35.610> lead<00:01:35.850> that's<00:01:36.360> closest<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> my<00:01:37.200> left<00:01:37.440> knee

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the lead that's closest to my left knee

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.719 
the lead that's closest to my left knee
and<00:01:38.010> put<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.610> my<00:01:38.640> mouth<00:01:39.650> all<00:01:40.650> right<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and put it in my mouth all right and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.929 
and put it in my mouth all right and
then<00:01:42.119> I'll<00:01:42.450> take<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:43.650> lead<00:01:44.460> line<00:01:44.670> that's

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
then I'll take the lead line that's

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.000 
then I'll take the lead line that's
closest<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:45.540> right<00:01:45.750> hand<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.229> take<00:01:46.710> five

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
closest to my right hand and take five

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.250 
closest to my right hand and take five
swings<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.960> my<00:01:49.140> arm

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
swings up on my arm

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.380 
swings up on my arm
once<00:01:52.260> I<00:01:52.380> got<00:01:52.530> five<00:01:52.770> swings<00:01:53.220> I'll<00:01:53.820> take<00:01:54.180> my

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
once I got five swings I'll take my

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.420 
once I got five swings I'll take my
right<00:01:54.600> hand<00:01:54.660> and<00:01:55.050> come<00:01:55.590> up<00:01:55.710> as<00:01:55.830> close<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.310> my

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
right hand and come up as close to my

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.820 
right hand and come up as close to my
left<00:01:56.760> hand<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.120> possible<00:01:57.630> turn<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.590> hand

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
left hand as possible turn the hand

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.370 
left hand as possible turn the hand
around<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.240> now<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.480> you've<00:02:00.660> got<00:02:00.870> this<00:02:01.080> punch

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
around so now that you've got this punch

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.460 
around so now that you've got this punch
in<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:01.920> right<00:02:02.130> hand<00:02:02.870> last<00:02:03.870> thing<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.350> is

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
in your right hand last thing you do is

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.080 
in your right hand last thing you do is
you're<00:02:04.620> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.800> take<00:02:05.010> your<00:02:05.220> thumb<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:05.850> your

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
you're going to take your thumb and your

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.920 
you're going to take your thumb and your
forefinger<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:06.840> you're<00:02:07.500> going<00:02:07.620> to<00:02:07.650> grab<00:02:08.930> the

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
forefinger and you're going to grab the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.960 
forefinger and you're going to grab the
lead<00:02:10.110> line<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.650> this<00:02:10.980> is<00:02:11.130> very<00:02:11.370> important

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
lead line and this is very important

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.750 
lead line and this is very important
because<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:13.200> thumb<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:13.740> forefinger<00:02:14.460> is<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
because this thumb and forefinger is the
