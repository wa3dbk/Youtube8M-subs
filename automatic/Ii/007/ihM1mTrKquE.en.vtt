00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.540

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.280
 occupying benches like this but today 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.350
 we are talking about a coach whose track record 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.930
 maybe it's not as important as other 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.470
 coaches but where has stepped has 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.900

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.110

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.230

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.020
 in this two-story manor house 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.420
 next to the center of rosario 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.940
 despite the own deterioration of several 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.030
 years of neglect the house still retains the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.550
 trace of the splendor of yesteryear the 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.650
 bielsa still owners of the farm have 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.890
 something in common with their tenants the 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.630

 brother of rafael and maria eugenia who 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.030
 I ran away from his piano lessons by jumping 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.909
 that window to leave to play at 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.280
 football 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.490

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.990

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.390

 marcelo of children were the best 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.280
 friends always together like the day that 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.310
 a neighbor fed up with her balonazos called 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.310
 to the police 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.490
 we are in full swing 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.610
 marcelo is going to kick a corner us 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.039
 we see that the patrol car arrives 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.039
 running and he was just crouching 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.180
 when he gets up to see the patrolman 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.420
 in front of him he could not start injuries and 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.980
 cumshots and they took him arrested to him 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.500
 single 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.260
 Marcelo did not want to leave the police station 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.240
 until his ball regains his stubbornness 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.760
 imposed on his father and the commissioner 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.360
 when he came back we continue when football 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.460
 always had that character 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.860
 for marcelo bielsa soccer always 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.370
 it was a capital issue at age 13 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.800
 He entered the quarry of newll's old boys- 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.870
 At 16 , football had absorbed him 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.090
 such a way that one day he left home 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.110
 to live in a boarding house next to their 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.630
 Teammates 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.730
 Y 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.730
 I operated with my seven part of your house 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.340
 and I told my mom that I was going 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.590
 and the mother asked him why the time 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.160
 I have things to do 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.930
 good marcelo got out of the way like that 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.060
 marked in a family of eminent 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.769
 lawyers like his grandfather his father his 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.819
 brother and the heavy city 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.819
 well-known and respected 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.670
 vera 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.670
 A nobody 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.170
 Rafael Bielsa 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.280
 the renewed news field is called today 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.950
 stadium marcelo bielsa 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.290
 here worked nelly dÃ­az the manager 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.030
 of the bar of the field and accomplice of marcelo 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.030
 since the first day 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.930
 At first I did not talk to anyone because 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.549
 he was a quiet boy he was not 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.129
 when he started to go with the bicycle 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.180
 she started to tell me the lady cares for me 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:42.910
 of the bicycle and he was going to practice 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.540
 and there I think he was a poor boy 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:50.829
 and I did not have any power 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.730
 he was humble after the 45 thousand he 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.730
 returned one day the house 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.580
 because I already had the things of the house 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.320
 but there was no turning back the way 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.310
 of bielsa was already drawn when 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.930
 he met his mentor in football in 1972 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.630
 jorge griffa returned to rosario after 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.710

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.990
 2 in Spanish 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.590
 griffa would go to direct the quarry of 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.880
 muse for the next 23 years no 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.130

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.200

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.690
