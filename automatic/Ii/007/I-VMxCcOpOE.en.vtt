loads it comes with a good case the that
Senko<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.130> case<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.490> came<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.820> was<00:01:45.060> just

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
Senko the case that came in was just

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.560 
Senko the case that came in was just
really<00:01:45.750> flimsy<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.770> not<00:01:47.360> what<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> would

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
really flimsy and not what I would

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.780 
really flimsy and not what I would
expect<00:01:48.600> from<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.649> tool<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.250> was<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.579> bloody

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
expect from a tool that was so bloody

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.600 
expect from a tool that was so bloody
expensive<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.040> you've<00:01:53.220> got<00:01:53.369> room<00:01:53.579> for

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
expensive you know you've got room for

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.300 
expensive you know you've got room for
extra<00:01:54.030> fuel<00:01:54.149> cells<00:01:54.509> here<00:01:54.780> nails<00:01:55.170> an<00:01:55.680> extra

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
extra fuel cells here nails an extra

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.700 
extra fuel cells here nails an extra
battery<00:01:56.460> there<00:01:56.880> really<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> difference

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
battery there really like the difference

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.520 
battery there really like the difference
in<00:01:58.829> battery<00:01:59.130> say<00:01:59.899> we<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.079> kind<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.380> go<00:02:01.500> through

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
in battery say we can kind of go through

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.410 
in battery say we can kind of go through

wincing<00:02:07.970> wait<00:02:08.180> I<00:02:08.450> mean<00:02:08.630> this<00:02:08.750> way<00:02:08.960> is<00:02:09.020> next<00:02:09.530> to

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
wincing wait I mean this way is next to

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.710 
wincing wait I mean this way is next to
nothing<00:02:09.790> and<00:02:10.790> this<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.120> kind<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.390> heavy<00:02:11.570> so

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
nothing and this is kind of heavy so

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.760 
nothing and this is kind of heavy so
pretty<00:02:12.530> slick<00:02:12.830> there<00:02:14.200> until<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.440> exact

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
pretty slick there until you the exact

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.080 
pretty slick there until you the exact
weight<00:02:15.980> difference<00:02:16.400> but<00:02:16.580> it's<00:02:16.790> pretty

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
weight difference but it's pretty

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.280 
weight difference but it's pretty
significant

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
significant

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.410 
significant
what<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.650> just<00:02:19.160> absolutely<00:02:19.370> loved<00:02:19.970> about<00:02:20.180> this

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
and what it kind of kills me about the

then on it has a click before it goes

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.870 
then on it has a click before it goes
all<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.320> way<00:02:30.440> in<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.800> turns<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.190> gun<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.400> I

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
of trim for up there and then up here I

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.990

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.610 
think up here I may put in a loo
tiny<00:04:19.209> piece<00:04:19.450> of<00:04:19.600> crown<00:04:19.720> molding<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.290> kind<00:04:20.560> of

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
tiny piece of crown molding to kind of

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.860 
tiny piece of crown molding to kind of
fill<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:20.829> in<00:04:21.190> from<00:04:21.489> where<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.790> old<00:04:21.940> old

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
fill that in from where the old old

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.440 
fill that in from where the old old
ceiling<00:04:23.320> used<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.620> be<00:04:23.710> because<00:04:23.890> when<00:04:24.070> I<00:04:24.450> took

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
ceiling used to be because when I took

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.810 
ceiling used to be because when I took
the<00:04:25.600> old<00:04:25.690> ceiling<00:04:26.170> out<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:27.160> came<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.580> about

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
the old ceiling out it came to about

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.240 
the old ceiling out it came to about
here<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.360> so<00:04:28.630> this<00:04:28.810> transom<00:04:29.320> was<00:04:29.530> covered<00:04:29.920> it

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
here and so this transom was covered it

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.890 
here and so this transom was covered it
was<00:04:30.370> really<00:04:30.730> a<00:04:30.760> short<00:04:31.000> ceiling<00:04:31.480> this<00:04:31.600> is<00:04:31.660> only

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
was really a short ceiling this is only

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.080 
was really a short ceiling this is only
about<00:04:32.170> you<00:04:33.040> know<00:04:33.130> six<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:33.490> a<00:04:33.520> half<00:04:33.550> feet<00:04:33.850> right

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
about you know six and a half feet right

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.960 
about you know six and a half feet right
here<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.360> just<00:04:34.540> went<00:04:34.690> here<00:04:35.700> straight<00:04:36.700> over

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
here I just went here straight over

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.020 
here I just went here straight over
there<00:04:37.150> so<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:37.690> just<00:04:37.930> raised<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.410> ceiling<00:04:38.770> up

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
there so I just raised the ceiling up

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.860 
there so I just raised the ceiling up
with<00:04:40.030> enough<00:04:40.240> room<00:04:40.450> for<00:04:40.510> some<00:04:41.250> r30<00:04:42.600> in<00:04:43.600> the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
with enough room for some r30 in the

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.230 
with enough room for some r30 in the
hour<00:04:44.500> 30<00:04:44.800> and<00:04:45.040> some<00:04:45.160> airspace<00:04:45.610> above<00:04:45.790> it<00:04:46.090> but

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
hour 30 and some airspace above it but

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.090 
hour 30 and some airspace above it but
just<00:04:46.750> put<00:04:47.050> it<00:04:47.140> to<00:04:47.230> the<00:04:47.320> top<00:04:47.470> of<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.650> door<00:04:47.830> there

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
just put it to the top of the door there

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.730 
just put it to the top of the door there
so<00:04:48.480> it's<00:04:49.480> kind<00:04:49.540> of<00:04:49.690> why<00:04:49.840> it's<00:04:50.050> kind<00:04:50.200> of<00:04:50.290> an<00:04:50.440> odd

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
so it's kind of why it's kind of an odd

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.710 
so it's kind of why it's kind of an odd
angle<00:04:50.980> like<00:04:51.340> that<00:04:51.580> but<00:04:51.880> anyway<00:04:52.090> yeah<00:04:52.510> I<00:04:52.540> think

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
angle like that but anyway yeah I think

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.010 
angle like that but anyway yeah I think
it's<00:04:52.960> a<00:04:53.200> looks<00:04:53.590> pretty<00:04:53.830> good<00:04:54.070> I<00:04:54.310> took<00:04:54.730> my<00:04:55.020> ro

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
it's a looks pretty good I took my ro

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.710 
it's a looks pretty good I took my ro
150<00:04:56.830> there<00:04:57.040> and<00:04:57.910> I<00:04:58.030> did<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.210> little<00:04:58.360> bit<00:04:58.510> of<00:04:58.540> a
