00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it comes up a fair bit of time I mean on

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.660 
it comes up a fair bit of time I mean on
for<00:01:05.970> textures<00:01:06.420> where<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.840> 986<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.040> you

thing<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:04.860> said<00:02:04.979> about<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
thing that we said about it is that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.630 
thing that we said about it is that
especially<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.129> tournaments<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.220> live<00:02:08.399> play

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
especially in tournaments and live play

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.550 
especially in tournaments and live play
against<00:02:08.940> weaker<00:02:09.300> players<00:02:09.539> as<00:02:09.780> well<00:02:09.810> you're

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
against weaker players as well you're

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.040 
against weaker players as well you're
going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> develop<00:02:11.700> like<00:02:12.209> every<00:02:12.629> bed<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:13.020> a

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
going to develop like every bed is a

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.460 
going to develop like every bed is a
piece<00:02:13.290> of

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
piece of

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.720 
piece of
information<00:02:13.890> right<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> little<00:02:14.340> piece<00:02:14.580> to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
information right it's a little piece to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.640 
information right it's a little piece to
your<00:02:14.760> puzzle<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> more<00:02:15.690> times<00:02:16.320> that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
your puzzle and so the more times that

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.650 
your puzzle and so the more times that
your<00:02:17.370> opponent<00:02:17.550> beds<00:02:17.880> two<00:02:18.090> more<00:02:18.240> cards<00:02:18.450> that

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
your opponent beds two more cards that

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.210 
your opponent beds two more cards that
come<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.960> more<00:02:19.110> situations<00:02:19.650> they<00:02:19.830> have<00:02:20.040> and

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
come the more situations they have and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.800 
come the more situations they have and
the<00:02:20.280> more<00:02:20.310> decisions<00:02:20.760> they<00:02:20.880> make<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.660> more

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
the more decisions they make the more

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.120 
the more decisions they make the more
information<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.260> get<00:02:22.440> gauge<00:02:22.740> about<00:02:22.980> their

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
information you get gauge about their

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.640 
information you get gauge about their
hands<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.550> sometimes<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.750> flop<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
hands so sometimes on the flop in the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.050 
hands so sometimes on the flop in the
situation<00:02:26.100> like<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.310> I'll<00:02:26.490> be<00:02:26.610> pretty<00:02:26.790> sure

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
situation like this I'll be pretty sure

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.940 
situation like this I'll be pretty sure
my<00:02:27.720> opponents<00:02:28.140> bluffing<00:02:28.470> or<00:02:28.620> I'll<00:02:28.740> be<00:02:28.860> pretty

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
my opponents bluffing or I'll be pretty

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.900 
my opponents bluffing or I'll be pretty
sure<00:02:29.130> he<00:02:29.220> has<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.400> good<00:02:29.430> hand<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.850> then

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
sure he has a good hand and then

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.980 
sure he has a good hand and then
something<00:02:30.120> will<00:02:30.300> happen<00:02:30.420> on<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.720> turn<00:02:30.870> to

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
something will happen on the turn to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.420 
something will happen on the turn to
completely<00:02:31.350> change<00:02:31.410> my<00:02:31.680> situation<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.340> my

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
completely change my situation in my

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.180 
completely change my situation in my
mind<00:02:33.000> about<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.870> hand<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.560> lot<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:35.010> times

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
mind about the hand so a lot of times

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.340 
mind about the hand so a lot of times
it's<00:02:35.370> good<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.640> just<00:02:35.700> play<00:02:36.630> defense<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.170> just

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
it's good to just play defense and just

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.020 
it's good to just play defense and just
see<00:02:37.830> kind<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.040> what<00:02:38.160> happens<00:02:38.190> because<00:02:38.730> you

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
see kind of what happens because you

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.610 
see kind of what happens because you
know<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.930> game<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.140> incomplete

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
know it's a game of incomplete

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.840 
know it's a game of incomplete
information<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.280> more<00:02:41.430> information<00:02:41.580> you

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
information and the more information you

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.220 
information and the more information you
have<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.150> better<00:02:42.180> soon<00:02:42.540> as<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.720> can<00:02:42.870> make<00:02:43.020> so

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
have the better soon as you can make so

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.140 
have the better soon as you can make so
it's<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:44.100> spots<00:02:44.400> we<00:02:44.550> have<00:02:44.580> marginal<00:02:44.970> hands

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
it's in spots we have marginal hands

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.910 
it's in spots we have marginal hands
it's<00:02:45.300> not<00:02:45.420> great<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.870> rush<00:02:46.050> into<00:02:46.230> making<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.650> big

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
it's not great to rush into making a big

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920 
it's not great to rush into making a big
pot<00:02:47.250> decision<00:02:47.730> because<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.390> you're<00:02:48.780> not

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
pot decision because you just you're not

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.430 
pot decision because you just you're not
assurance<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:50.280> really<00:02:51.410> bring<00:02:52.410> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
assurance so you you really bring the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.020 
assurance so you you really bring the
skill<00:02:52.800> level<00:02:52.830> between<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.760> pair<00:02:53.970> of

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
skill level between you and the pair of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.160 
skill level between you and the pair of
players<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.300> are<00:02:54.480> inferior<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:54.990> a<00:02:55.020> lot

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
players that are inferior to you a lot

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.870 
players that are inferior to you a lot
closer<00:02:55.410> when<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.770> do<00:02:55.860> those<00:02:56.010> things<00:02:56.190> we'd

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
closer when you do those things we'd

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.400 
closer when you do those things we'd
