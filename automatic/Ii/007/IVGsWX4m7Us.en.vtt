00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.880
 I was there. 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:27.640
 Wanmu What else do you do ? Yes . 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:34.040
 Minutes must be against the Kindle when you're

 Because he's a freak who wants to do it. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.120
 After the owner finishes the preparation of the seafood, he goes through a full verification with the minerals . 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.970
 I started 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.970
 First we start with the evaluation of broth in seafood. 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.050
 How about the taste of soup 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.719

 My daughter still has a taste. 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.600

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:19.360

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.600

 Oh, you're calling me now, yeah. 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:50.210
 Ah, it is like a living dream 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.210
 Oh, I hate you. 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.800
 The more you walk in the street, the more questions you have about residents. 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.930
 So what creature to purchase 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:07.230

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.230
 I 've met a few games in agriculture. Yes. 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.400
 I thought about this again . 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.210
 All 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.650
 There are so many. 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.650
 You have a game. 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.750
 We want to see frozen seafood from the ingredients in seafood. 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:29.580
 I requested 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:37.020
 Then, without hesitation, the owner who opens the door of the freezer is a little quick to enter. 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:37.949
 It's just not touch him domestically fit in. What you do not break anything like 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.980
 It's getting better. 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:45.290
 I'd like to go. 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:47.210
 Now, what about the frog crab and shrimp, which are hard to find for living creatures? 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.600
 The place sells. 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.600
 What are you doing 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:58.760
 What about evaluating the verification team here ? 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.560
 Oh when I smell the dream and eat the dreams ah bs tail I forget the sea bass 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:06.720
 It's high. 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:11.880
 Sarah knew exactly what to do as she stated, and she's an example. 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:17.820
 What are we doing that than with its Black Tiger radeunga of these plans 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:20.600
 Lead rather than salt to the state and to think that the high score itself 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.600
 I do not think so. 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.300
 There is a part to be sure to confess in the selection of a good restaurant 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.020
 Is it true that every day I go to the market and buy a little anatomy? 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.160
 As a result of observation from afar , you can see the owner 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.230
 The owner takes the seafood out of a small bag and puts it in the aquarium. 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:55.949
 It was confirmed to buy a small amount of seafood in the market. 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.760
 If so, would it be delicious to go to the market every day? 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:10.770
 Yes, I went to the market and asked if I had a seafood house owner. 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:14.310
