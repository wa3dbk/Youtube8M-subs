00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.349
 the pure beauty of the business is the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.240
 next my brother 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.920
 I want to begin classes with the question for 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.980
 You in the winter usually take 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.490
 shock when we get out of our car 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.890
 Why does this happen so let's go 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.000
 start the next you answer this 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.160
 question you have to understand 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.710
 first some details some 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.899
 things and one of them is here on the board 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.870
 for you look at the board drivers 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.690
 electric conductors is that 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.550
 brother conducting the electrons 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.989
 which drives the electrons 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.090
 I think that who are the best 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.360
 conductors metals 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.030
 the human body also the conductor the earth 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.329
 so driver then it's there for you 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.670
 the water that sometimes you put the lessons 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.620
 mix with salt are also only in the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.750
 driver because the pure water in the driver 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.820
 No, I will not talk to you, I'll tell ya 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.750
 for you straight that pure water is 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.000
 on here 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.909
 drivers are divided into electronics 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.490
 and bus electronics electronic driver 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.909
 when electron steps by it attacked the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.340
 colleague for him the driver and only 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.740
 when you have a 12 year movement in the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.850
 case of salt water 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.369
 Do you have wine involvement? 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.530
 positive and negative to high school 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.930
 now besides the drivers you have a 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.000
 electrical insulating also look for 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.380
 the insulator also known as 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.409
 electric day 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.320
 porcelain rubber or plastic glass 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.590
 Pure water, that's what I meant. 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.619
 exactly the pure water is insulating water 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.729
 which has salt to what you have there is already a water 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.040
 that the conductor 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.110
 Stay tuned, this is cool, my 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.149
 then you have a driver and you have the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.130
 steering wheel the driver allows the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.340
 select not because this happens 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.229
 they do not arrive because in metals the electrons 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.270
 of the latest calls 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.430
 they can move because the connection 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.819
 between the electrons of the last calls 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.790
 and the nucleus how far the force is 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.410
 It's small they leave the atom. 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.800
 wander around 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.050
 by the metal in the case of the 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.970
 force between the electro-nucleus that 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.980
 are yours is too big there 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.700
 holds the electrons has no electrons 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.860
 free 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.100
 The difference is this from the driver to the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.720
 the conductor has free electrons 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.670
 insulation has no legal value 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.130
 another very important thing has to 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.810
 also know if someone wants to be 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.980
 the ground wire 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.830
 every time a positive body it 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.780
 connected to the ground by a wire in the 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.630
 electronics has a lot of it so if the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.130
 body is positive that barrinha 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.310
 Are you seeing there the positive balance? 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.590
 is in a green art has a bar 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.620
 green down then that art there she 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.690
 is insulating, ie by that area not 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.850
 rises or falls in electrons 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.550
 so I have a ground wire then wire 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.240
 earth for what to say electrify the 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.670
 body 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.180
 so when you connect a positive body 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.670
 earth's electrons rise to 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.740
 to neutralize the body is legal and when 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.920
 you no negative body there 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.920
 electrons from the body descend to earth 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.620
 that you learned that only electrons that 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.300
 can move the ready are in the 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.270
 core was cool 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.920
 So you see, you've learned that there is 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.750
 metals that drivers require and 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.290
 learned also requires the insulation is 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.000
 right 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.620
 Now see well and you learned in the 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.840
 also that the body can be 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.650
 neutral and that the body can be used 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.930
 How do I make a boy a body? 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.610
 neutralized first thing of process 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.280
 frictional elitisation 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.420
 get two different bodies can 14 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.640
 You have the role and the bat and the 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.900
 paper are essentially neutral there 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.780
 you to 30 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.690
 enough with the paper mind stick 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.910
 on paper are equal or different bodies 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.459
 different bodies then amanda physics 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.020
 reveal different bodies you can only 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.050
 believe account different understand 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.340
 because if you try two equal bodies 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.980
 electronic affinity is the same then and 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.690
 nobody wants to lose electro nobody Alex 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.890
 or rather they want to lose that 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.989
 win the same way 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.300
 one wants another also wants to be 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.670
 you take two different bodies one goes 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.950
 want to lose Alex will want to win 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.530
 that's why it's positive and negative 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.720
 I was clear then every time you 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.670
 shoots two different bodies 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.920
 the signs that one is different from the one of 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.480
 one is positive because he lost Alex and 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.790
 another is negative because the 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.070
 hydropower is cool did not capture this 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.380
 message now how important this is 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.400
 in practical life to check the list at 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.110
 explanation 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.710
 when you see when you come to a post 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.870
 of gasoline a truck from lettre 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.060
 unloading the truck will go down to the 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.270
 gasoline that is there in your tank to 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.160
 the tank of the post office the driver 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.620
 he no ground wire 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.660
 What is the purpose of this earth mine? 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.760
 the purpose of this ground wire 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.130
 to say electrify the truck 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.410
 first because when 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.670
 truck is on the road is tweeting 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.280
 truck with air 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.770
 the truck and are the same materials for 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.690
 different difference then becomes positive 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.270
 gets negative 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.120
 see when the truck will slide 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.160
 when the driver touches that 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.710
 where you will take the oil 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.180
 gasoline gives a spark because the 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.820
 State- owned truck 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.700
 the driver works as ground wire there 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.400
 the electrons in the truck pass through 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.830
 driver a jerk or if your engine 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.470
 car you have is positively aimed at the 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.380
 selected by the capello driver of the 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.670
 a sparks truck and then there 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.010
 catch fire in a truck 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.840
 to avoid what happens if the 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.200
 the ground wire there once it is 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.480
 the face can slip or it can 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.310
 to get her out of the way without a problem is that 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.160
 are showing you in that picture there 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:13.160
 So this is it, baby, this is you. 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.160
 study much, review, class, spoke nice
