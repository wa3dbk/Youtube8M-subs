00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
now I do the follow through with the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.840 
now I do the follow through with the
line<00:01:12.110> carry<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> line<00:01:13.409> through<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.770> rest<00:01:14.670> of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
line carry the line through the rest of

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.250 
line carry the line through the rest of
the<00:01:15.000> way<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:15.300> that<00:01:15.630> gives<00:01:16.050> you<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
the way because that gives you the

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:25.040 
the way because that gives you the
straight<00:01:16.710> point<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:18.409> board<00:01:23.990> now<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
straight point on this board now the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:39.440 
straight point on this board now the
other<00:01:25.290> side

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.700 

I<00:01:39.830> now<00:01:40.830> have<00:01:41.009> cut<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> shelf<00:01:42.530> this<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
I now have cut the shelf this is the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:57.260 
I now have cut the shelf this is the
square<00:01:43.950> point<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:46.850> fits<00:01:47.850> very<00:01:48.210> nice
