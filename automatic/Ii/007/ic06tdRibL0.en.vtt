00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.140
 actually a little about the plot 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.570
 It all starts with the fact that the main character 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.760
 waking up see a girl who is clearly not 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.379

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.899
 to our bomber that he is dead and 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.940
 located in the world which is located 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.220
 on the way to the edge and then it starts 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.780
 interesting and now let's get started 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.590

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.409

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.250
 they are no more than three as they 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.360
 completely different but they are united 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.630

 well and we move on to the next anime and 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.600
 let's talk about such anime as the heir 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.600
 the devil 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.730
 probably everyone watched as a child 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.890
 Pokemon so here is the mechanics of these pictures 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.420
 made on the same principle only 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.790
 the main character is a bit older 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.250
 cute pokemons 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.330
 replaced by mobile and of course 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.760
 the plot of this anime 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.010
 makes more sense and since I spoke 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.920
 the plot but how do you like this situation 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.240

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.920
 will learn about the new software for mobile 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.709
 phones with which you can 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.020
 find out how your friend will die first 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.780
 video from this software does not take long 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.310
 wait for yourself and the guys die but how do you 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.459
 You know, not everything is so simple 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.650
