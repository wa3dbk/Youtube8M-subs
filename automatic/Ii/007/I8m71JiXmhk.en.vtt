00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello, I continue to test my 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.189
 new acquisition this 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.980
 drying combine ezidri ultra hd 1000 and 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.080
 today i want to cook try 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.570
 first yogurt marshmallow 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.390
 and it is done very simply take 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.310
 some miracle yogurt can be added 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.130
 something like coconut 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.410
 chips and sesame seeds seeds nuts 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.660
 but we can not add anything in principle 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.650
 and you can add 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.920
 any 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.829
 fruit puree of fresh berries whip them 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.380
 blender and add to yogurt but i 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.570
 I will do more simplified now 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.270
 options here is such a miracle yogurt 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.489
 I have a coconut shake from here, I guess 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.559
 add coconut shavings seem i 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.620
 perhaps add yoghurt 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.170
 raspberry frappe 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.110
 I won't add anything at all 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.629
 how do they say mating yoghurt worthy 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.300
 Percent these, too, two and a half 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.850
 percent is three percent don't know 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.150
 how thick is it not thick 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.010
 Now all this will probably be starting 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.010
 with this is my cool coconut shake 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.040
 yogurt apparently drinking 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.610
 pretty liquid what will i do like me 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.330
 I will do take a pallet specifically for 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.490
 marshmallows 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.210
 and I had a desire to lubricate it 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.220
 oiled so for yogurt and marshmallow I 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.320
 perhaps grease oil here with me 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.600
 olive oil to avoid 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.850
 foreign smell so i think that 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.280
 yogurt on I post it more such 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.010
 fragile is likely to be so she 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.320
 Easy to remove it, I probably will be able to 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.840
 leaf for marshmallow olive oil 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.380
 make it comfortable using silicone 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.380
 tassels 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:02:01.880
 yogurt i just 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:06.560
 stir up like a shaker shake and have him 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.100
 on baking tray using silicone 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.100
 spatula spread over the entire surface 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.200
 here somehow it is not enough for the whole leaf in 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.260
 Generally it turns out on such one 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.760
 solid tray for my model 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.430
 drying machines 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.920
 it takes more yogurt as if i am 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.290
 I tried to distribute it but special 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.390
 there is no success then it is better to pour it on 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.090
 so the whole surface will 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.690
 improvise and add this 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.510
 yogurt will not work my idea 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.120
 initially and on each sheet and face 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.489
 Yoga means I will mix them all the same 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.250
 but nothing more interesting happens in 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.470
 end this here is my will 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.230
 spotty well what about these layers 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:57.140
 there are special sides so you can 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:00.140
 get carried away and pour over the edges so it means to 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.410
 one layer will be less than my marshmallow 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.329
 but that's okay 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.239
 I hook this layer and kosovo and struct and 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:11.150
 she will stick well to yogurt cuffs 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.660
 And therefore, immediately mix yogurt 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.549
 and do not need enough sprinkle with 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.709
 the blades can be slightly flatten it 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.440
 coconut chips where poured and and 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.660
 more thicker layer than interesting 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.730
 like this 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.420
 it look like when dry too 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.000
 such an interesting spotted effect 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.410
 sends an atlas drying machine and 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.840
 starting to create the next 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:40.180
 yogurt new layer post and so here y 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.580
 I will use yogurt flavor 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.260
 peach passion fruit 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.400
 here it contains pieces of fruit 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.200
 sweet niki taste so spill this 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.810
 yogurt is more mating 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.510
 well, as in the first case, all the same and he 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.590
 on the reservoir is not enough means here dolyu 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.980
 this is the rest 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:04.900
 a little yogurt there raspberry frappe y 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.540
 I went to the supplement I think this video 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.360
 will be useful to all newbies like me 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.970
 because I thought one thing but on 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.250
 practice, it turns out differently 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.680
 but that's all right 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.200
 It turned out in the end I forgot butter 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.480
 grease too experience will be like him 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.700
 will lead when I shoot already know 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.480
 so yogurt is here a little left well 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.480
 somehow 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.870
 I will distribute well then this layer is mine 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.930
 go sesame seeds additive in 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.090
 ideally the edges should have a thicker layer 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.000
 eat more mass yogurt on 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.980
 in the middle, less edges dry faster 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.980
 also so slightly spotted 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.450
 it turns out who has already done such marshmallow 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.210
 Share your experience please in 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.070
 comments so the second layer is the future 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.830
 yogurt and pastila also sent 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.100
 drying apparatus all can proceed to 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.950
 drying I will dry at 55 degrees 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.260
 instead of the drying apparatus still remains 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.490
 I have a lot like this 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.630
 cut off the peel perhaps by land too 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.410
 just dry 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.600
 but such a lattice zest I want later 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.760
 grind and add as 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.880
 flavoring such as baking 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.800
 or live it is orange peel 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.290
 orange and went to the juice and zest to 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:28.270
 did not disappear was cut and that's her 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:31.390
 I will try to dry the bus 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.900
 when the power is over i will show that i have 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:38.170
 the result will be thin and thin chickens 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.940
 dried very quickly the crusts I can 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.650
 take off 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.350
 they were located on my net 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.260
 pallet additionally but this lattice 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.710
 for dinner and this one already 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:54.810
 homemade grille protects against 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.810
 so that these small particles fall down 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:03.160
 but such a beauty turned out well 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.040
 yogurt on I will just do more 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.880
 discussed further so we check our 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:18.520
 marsh marshmallow here this stratum 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:22.510
 it looks like this layer is also kind of 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:25.080
 ready and you can really try to have 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:28.650
 marshmallow just here but where are oiled 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:32.200
 Here it goes perfectly, very comfortable 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:35.080
 removed well due to the fact that the sheet 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:39.780
 smeared with vegetable oil in general 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.780
 knockdown try a piece 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:47.620
 medka dream shichko taste yogurt sour cream 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:50.230
 fruits with berries very bright taste and in 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.110
 This piece has mixed 2 yogurt even 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:55.660
 well heard coconut chips together 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.880
 fits very well all the same now 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.340
 try people on her most likely 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.860
 just have to break into pieces on 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:06.610
 better still not risk turning away 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.950
 about motif into pieces well, in general it 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.650
 skirts on the marshmallow and which was 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:14.110
 oiled separated enough 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.160
 easy here's a new doctor kana not rolling down 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.650
 she's quite a circle 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.170
 but it is well torn to keep mine 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:24.430
 still we will not do it so that 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:27.280
 sweets eat here I comprehend 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.920
 Of course everything was bad. The reservoir was not smeared. 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.930
 oil and tear it almost 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.570
 unrealistic so don't repeat my 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.370
 mistakes must be oiled with 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.330
 help back of course succeeded 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.240
 scrape off 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:42.280
 all this marshmallow she tastes very 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.500
 delicious of course that's well here such here 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.300
 the pieces turned out sour sour sweetheart 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.600
 soft she is not crumbly 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.740
 fell on drying took 9 hours I still 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.140
 let's experiment of course at leisure 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:55.600
 but I will try to make more of course 

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.700
 Be sure to grease the pallet and 

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.860
 vegetable oil do not forget about it 

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.140
