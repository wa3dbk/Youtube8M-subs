00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 I greet you if you love 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.410
 I'm sportverein simon smith muscle 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.450
 maker in this video, I'll show you 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.189
 the covers like you specially for 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.420
 The breast is created by the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.040
 It always comes down to the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.110
 motion execution 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.059
 as you also on the banks or in 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.039
 this case is positioned on the ground 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.080
 then it's about whether you just the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.359
 participation outside of the sawmill 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.430
 Advertisement exploited out of the country and out 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.830
 many other tools or you 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.119
 the whole mainly about the 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.949
 Run chest muscles and exactly 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.750
 so I have the box 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.610
 puddle recruiter just learned about the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.500
 also train isolated for chest 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.690
 I am currently the breast 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.250
 to train and feel isolated 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.450
 That's why you also see the trainings 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.000
 weight I just have a few 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.890
 bandages clamped in between means 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.200
 every movement stops me 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.640
 the hand together inside 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.690
 press and you can over this pressure 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.559
 Of course you can introduce yourself 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.300
 Just imitate 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.710
 if you compress slightly inward 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.840
 then the chest muscles work 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.489
 This prevents you from being 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.680
 has, so to speak pushes outwardly away 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.820
 Men's box is explained quite logically 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.920
 of course has the possibility too 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.239
 Straight over strong arms outward 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.500
 then push the stake 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.540
 stronger on the frame so on the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.830
 triceps muscle and the whole thing goes by 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.659
 the chest away and that's natural 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.520
 especially if you have robust but the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.170
 climate conscious and big problem so me 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.729
 show you the whole hearty position 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.770
 my feet are on the floor 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.080
 here you can also angle on and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.909
 start to move to a position 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.220
 where I like the bench press 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.320
 the shoulders together pull back 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.710
 and a small bridge farmer 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.869
 Now I grab the dumbbells either 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.759
 stretched out I recommend slightly 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.560
 Angled and now just look 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.549
 I'll say one or two sentences to that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.549
 in connection 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.310
 so 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.810
 I think I do not need many 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.189
 make repetitions to show you 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.870
 that it is exhausting 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.579
 you have seen I have between 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.709
 each repetition briefly deposed 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:41.269
 I still have the possibility 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.159
 Take me completely in the 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.180
 starting position you can 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.920
 introduce you, of course 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.569
 that's just the case with the putsch exercises 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.209
 always very strong the case that you look 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.310
 in the course of the movement often too 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.599
 tilted when bank presses one tends 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.980
 plus the shoulders forward too 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.900
 then someday you get completely in 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.060
 the position how to do the exercises 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.439
 and that's why I work 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.049
 with these little breaks that is too 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.459
 So who provides for more 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.299
 interested just look in the 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.739
 infobox rows 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.139
 there you will find the book again 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.819
 explains why these little breaks make sense 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:13.040
 I can do that to you now 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.720
 shown that you have seen that yourself 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.609
 This movement always with small 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.950
 breaks carried out thereby the 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.319
 possibility again my position 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.970
 here on the floor correct me 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.190
 then to fix accordingly with 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.569
 the shoulders pulled backwards and 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.900
 thus also the possibility to 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.599
 to have 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.459
 very much at every single repetition 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.379
 to train cleanly and seriously 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.120
 a little tip at the end again me 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.069
 have a few weeks ago the whole already 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.049
 I showed in the gym 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.549
 positioned me completely differently where that 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.840
 whole more on the lake town hall is and 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.060
 I also have a very different involvement 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.799
 the back muscles feel best 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.959
 not even so by pressing so 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.519
 this after pumping when the trade 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.139
 moves up I have got myself 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.459
 Of course at some point a nice point 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.599
 on the triceps he also feels 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.400
 installer but i can turn you off 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.470
 experience that is just about the 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.329
 chest muscles to feel all the incentive 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.190
 that's why it's really the focus 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.900
 on the essential an isolation 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.379
 Exercise should always be an isolation exercise 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.090
 stay 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.010
 in this sense just imitate 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.900
 Look again exactly how I am 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.220
 have positioned here on the floor 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.030
 easy the high cross to the rear 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.829
 drawn shoulders 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.599
 just imitate and comment 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.010
 no exercise i can tell you 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.900
 see us in the next video is doing well 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.900
 many greetings your simon
