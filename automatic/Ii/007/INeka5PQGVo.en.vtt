00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
problem for most blondes is that they

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.429 
problem for most blondes is that they
don't<00:01:32.939> want<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.390> go<00:01:33.509> too<00:01:33.570> warm<00:01:34.049> too

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
yellowish and then there's always the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120 
yellowish and then there's always the
danger<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.390> goes<00:01:36.659> brassy<00:01:37.200> as<00:01:37.320> well<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.860> for

just a violet eCall tone over top is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.969 
just a violet eCall tone over top is
almost<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> filter<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.290> gives<00:01:46.920> it

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
almost like a filter and just gives it

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.789 
almost like a filter and just gives it
this<00:01:47.040> real<00:01:47.369> cool<00:01:48.090> glimmer<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.470> what<00:01:49.649> would<00:01:49.770> be

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
this real cool glimmer and what would be

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.980 
this real cool glimmer and what would be
the<00:01:50.130> main<00:01:50.310> difference<00:01:50.790> between<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.810> go

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the main difference between the go

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.740 
the main difference between the go
blonder<00:01:52.560> lightening<00:01:53.340> range<00:01:53.610> compared<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
blonder lightening range compared to the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.230 
blonder lightening range compared to the
highlight<00:01:55.200> activating<00:01:55.950> well<00:01:56.759> something<00:01:57.210> like

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
highlight activating well something like

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.929 
highlight activating well something like
go<00:01:57.689> blonder<00:01:58.170> has<00:01:58.439> got<00:01:58.649> lightness<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.610> so

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
go blonder has got lightness in it so

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.639 
go blonder has got lightness in it so
you<00:02:00.030> are<00:02:00.060> actually<00:02:00.540> physically<00:02:00.960> lightening

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
you are actually physically lightening

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.539 
you are actually physically lightening
the<00:02:01.770> color<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.159> your<00:02:02.250> hair

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
the color of your hair

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.270 
the color of your hair
whereas<00:02:03.509> something<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.979> highlight

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
whereas something like the highlight

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.930 
whereas something like the highlight
activating<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.390> removing<00:02:07.290> residues<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.160> kind

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
activating is removing residues and kind

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.609 
activating is removing residues and kind
of<00:02:09.000> renewing<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> condition<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> hair<00:02:10.379> so

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
of renewing the condition of the hair so

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.920 
of renewing the condition of the hair so
