00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.690
 Grisel says hello I have a problem I have 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.300
 two grammy see the two scalars two the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.190
 Two-color bird and two cichlids 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.630
 got sick of white point and treat them 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.639
 with green malachite and blue 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.980
 methylene but now they have the base of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.230
 the red-rimmed fins the grammy and the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.720
 scalars that can be how we can 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.130
 treat thank you and greetings to try in the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.930
 direct aquarium with malachite green 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.640
 many bacteria must have died 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.320
 good is a single makes it rise in the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.119
 unit with the water intoxicating the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.859
 fish that's why the fins are reddened 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.840
 among other problems one of the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.910
 solutions is to make water dogs almost 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.290
 20 percent daily newspapers using 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.210
 conditioners that eliminate the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.610
 ammonia that are somewhat expensive but deserves 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.590
 the penalty should also not be siphoned 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.840
 to two nor filter cleanings during a 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.670
 month for the bacteria to regenerate 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.559
 a christopher says hello jose and me 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.629
 I really like your videos I have a 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.309
 asks how to make water from 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.739
 my aquarium does not turn yellow and brown 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.870
 It will be because I have a mangle but it is already 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.430
 cured even if a trunk is cured 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.350
 they can continue releasing also those that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.090
 they have the water despite being good they are 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.620
 very annoying and the most that can be done 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.570
 is to get them out of there follow 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.400
 watching them editing them and changing the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.960
 of water until you have a second 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.550
 option is to go making water changes 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.380
 very usual that although you will not notice 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.420
 will quickly end up leaving the water of 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.400
 crystal tokyo whatever you do not 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.380
 will be a problem for the fish since 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.540
 franco says hello jose greetings from 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.520
 mexico thanks to your videos I mounted a 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.160
 planted aquarium of 200 liters where 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.100
 I have two scalars 10 neon is a grammy 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.050
 2 has seen ramÃ­rez grass and 3 moles the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.730
 motive is you could tell me what plants 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.680
 I already have the truth that they are 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.750
 growing big and beautiful quickly 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.750
 and after giving an idea to all your 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.640
 followers do not use co2 or fertilizers I do not have 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.770
 nutritious substrate and the truth is that 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.250
 I'm happy and in the process you can tell me if 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.870
 I have overpopulation greetings from mexico 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.370
 two plants seem to be resourceful of 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.860
 read and the biggest and baco for 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.690
 carolina the most elongated and finite are 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.280
 of fast growth and not very demanding 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.770
 although with much light it grows more 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.240
 densely you do not have overpopulation of 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.610
 done you can put some more or 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.190
 increase the population of neonates jonah 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.260
 blonde says good again for a while 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.970
 couple of days I notice one of my coisas 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.140
 so you commented on a video 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.569
 previous is male 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.730
 that is a bit weird always hidden 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.220
 on a rope 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.590
 and it only comes out a little when the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.390
 another macho bottom there is except 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.980
 when something is already out of the way 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.980
 that stays in a back corner of the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.810
 aquarium still without moving 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.200
 I have also observed that some brands of 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.459
 his face have stood out more their colors 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.440
 will have something to do and that is what 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.390
 happens I have also observed that in a 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.580
 of its caves and the occasional element 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.950
 decorative have come out like little balls 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.720
 white I do not know if they can be the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.000
 huevones of something that another fish or snail 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.390
 that attached photos greetings and thanks for 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.610
 your help 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.200
 If you are sure you have two males 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.209
 colist what happens in all several a 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.160
 Territoriality problem the solution 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.720
 happens to change one of the males for 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.430
 a couple of females because to keep 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.349
 the males of unamid the day one 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.030
 guard the color changes in one of 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.890
 them is one more sample that is 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.049
 stressed about the bet if I did not 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.609
 I'm wrong you have zebra snails and for 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.829
 the size and shape of the eggs as well 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.420
 oval they show that they are snails 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.430
 zebra the problem here is that for 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.470
 hatch perfectly need to 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.989
 Brackish water roughly one tablespoon 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.450
 every 10 liters flush with natural salt without 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.889
 cry or sea salt who says hello 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.150
 Good night friend, I hope you 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.670
 find good I have 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.260
 about my 80 liter aquarium I wanted 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.269
 know if I can put several types of 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.069
 boat I've read that the tiger bottle is 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.439
 aggressive but the bottle yo yo and boat to 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.540
 Clown can get along well with my aquarium 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.700
 it measures 60 centimeters long by 50 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.680
 high and 30 wide you think it could 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.260
 put bottles and a clown with sumatra 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.970
 thank you and greetings from mexico 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.620
 function are fish that come to live more 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.629
 of 20 years so you have to take it 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.400
 very seriously and I explain almost all the 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.230
 varieties of bottles need to be 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.939
 in groups of the same species for example 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.530
 the clown need more than 100 liters 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.510
 for each one of them so in your 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.639
 aquarium would not be good again the voice already 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.920
 joe the backpack is smaller and if 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.629
 you could keep about 360 wario together 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.639
 with a small school of tiger beards 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.049
 The yoyo problem is that they eat 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.060
 and they bury the plants more 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.709
 delicate both types of boat so 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.659
 would do well in larger aquariums 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.069
 300 liters as you said the 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.930
 Tigers bottles would be too 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.359
 aggressive and you should avoid 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.760
 modest drip and vote them to mosley samuel 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.349
 says hello means a lot to me and 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.290
 I would like to know what you think of my third 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:24.270
 I'm sorry if I'm heavy 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.370
 I think you have some rights left 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.080
 with some leaves a little damaged and 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.330
 I would pay a little salt of 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.040
 potassium sulfate with each water change 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.870
 if you can not find them you can use 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.550
 some type of fertilizer that contains potassium 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.350
 trying to prevent it from containing many 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.300
 micronutrients and one more council 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.340
 aesthetic if you feel like doing it would be 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.590
 put a harem of beta females but 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.960
 putting many hiding places as per 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.670
 example put several flakes behind you have 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.530
 of holes or put some bah cups 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.390
 Caroline wings all over the aquarium and 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.190
 will grow very fast and will prevent the male 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.810
 accuse the females anyway the 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.670
 aquarium is already very well and more than 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.040
 will be as the plants grow 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.410
 well we have already finished but 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.690
 I remember you have me on a twitter in 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.670
 facebook on my video game channel jose 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.010
 little pieces that imitate by avoiding 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.930
 the hd or I hope you are 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.960
 happy with my videos you give this to 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.850
 and if not then it is memories for you 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.790
 fish and see you in the next video 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.070
 goodbye thank you for being there and being the 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.250
