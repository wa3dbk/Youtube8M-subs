every engine would give you some sort of
a<00:07:33.620> response<00:07:33.919> but<00:07:34.250> i'm<00:07:35.210> sure<00:07:35.270> they<00:07:35.449> could<00:07:35.569> have

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:35.659 
a response but i'm sure they could have

a response but i'm sure they could have
done<00:07:35.719> a<00:07:35.810> little<00:07:35.960> better<00:07:36.199> with<00:07:36.409> the<00:07:36.500> tuning<00:07:36.830> and

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:37.270 
done a little better with the tuning and

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.820 
done a little better with the tuning and
overall<00:07:38.270> I<00:07:38.300> think<00:07:38.419> the<00:07:38.599> car<00:07:38.840> still<00:07:39.050> one<00:07:39.650> of<00:07:39.740> the

overall I think the car still one of the
best<00:07:39.860> answer<00:07:40.400> I<00:07:40.610> think<00:07:40.879> this<00:07:40.969> is<00:07:41.030> the

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 
best answer I think this is the

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.939 
best answer I think this is the
