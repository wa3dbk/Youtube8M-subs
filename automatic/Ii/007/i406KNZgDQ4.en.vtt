00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.580
 hello welcome to art attack the program 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.580
 which shows that you must be professional 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.410
 to be a great artist you already know that 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.660
 we always have to kill people and not 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.610
 We know how to dispose of the corpse but 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.289
 this is over today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.860
 incinerate a body with materials 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:36.970
 home, look for this, you're going to 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.910
 need a butane gas cartridge 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.050
 and alcohol 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.050
 and a small box 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.900
 The first thing you should do is dump it 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.700
 the alcohol in which 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.700
 try to do it in quantity 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.620
 and now the fun part we're going to 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.620
 set fire to the channel 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.140
 and once you have completed the 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.770
 body fire will have something left 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.929
 like this pure ash 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.270
 you can do it in a car or in a bowl 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:15.909
 and if you're not sure if your family is going 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.440
 to doubt you can put a poster 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:22.220
 that says it's not human ashes 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.210
 if you raise 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.880
 and I'm afraid we ran out of time 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.760
 the next few weeks where I will teach 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.760

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.590
 in the sky 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.680
 Andrea Bocelli 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.150

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.910
 sandro 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.700
 on the crimson red ruby lips for 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.450
 to draw 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.450
 that's it 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.890
 from the heart 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.890
 ah 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.620
 Excuse me, we are joining together so that 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.060
 the whales can vote yes for 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.950
 that the whales can mount the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.659
 whales and because the stays also 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.099
 they deserve to be in the electoral system of 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.200
 our country, what we are 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.170
 doing is to create a system of 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.760
 piletones of 3 pools in which it goes to 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.620
 have a choice of four colors for 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.349
 that they with their horn can vote in 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.390
 this principle is reduced to what is 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.159
 sea area but in the future the zebras 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.079
 lions and maybe even five million 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.510
 of clicks for what I need is a 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.010
 signature of you because the hiding place 177 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.480
 billion signatures we 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.970
 we got a lot of thanks but I ceased to 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.650
 you the reasons and the people are going to 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.090
 vote in the same place alive perÃ³n and the 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.090
 sea sra 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.579

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.260
 hole and to the front and to look at what 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.760

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.760
 hole back in case he wants you 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.210

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.920
 It has an object, I say 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.880

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:41.240

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.240

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.749

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.699

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.759

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:05.299
 an instrument 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.770
 life 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.460
 vicentico the roads 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.760

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.800

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.750
