options

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.880 

the<00:00:45.330> moon<00:00:45.540> is<00:00:45.780> an<00:00:45.900> obvious<00:00:46.260> one<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.590> may<00:00:46.680> not<00:00:46.830> be

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the moon is an obvious one it may not be

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.280 
the moon is an obvious one it may not be
the<00:00:47.070> best<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:48.480> least<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.870> advantage

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
the best but at least the advantage

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.200 
the best but at least the advantage
there<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.800> you've<00:00:49.920> got<00:00:50.210> completely

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
there is that you've got completely

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.310 
there is that you've got completely
predictable<00:00:52.160> weather<00:00:53.630> with<00:00:54.630> the<00:00:55.020> exception

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
predictable weather with the exception

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.340 
predictable weather with the exception
of<00:00:55.710> maybe<00:00:56.280> some<00:00:56.610> solar<00:00:56.880> flare<00:00:57.210> ups<00:00:57.390> it's

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
of maybe some solar flare ups it's

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.640 
of maybe some solar flare ups it's
always<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.860> think<00:00:59.720> 215<00:01:00.720> degrees<00:01:00.900> in<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
always I think 215 degrees in the

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.119 
always I think 215 degrees in the
daytime<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:03.570> always<00:01:03.770> near<00:01:04.770> absolute

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
daytime and it's always near absolute

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.990 
daytime and it's always near absolute
zero<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.790> night

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
zero at night

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.880 
zero at night
and<00:01:07.690> those<00:01:07.810> are<00:01:07.840> of<00:01:08.080> course<00:01:08.230> scary<00:01:08.770> numbers

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
and those are of course scary numbers

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.610 
and those are of course scary numbers
for<00:01:09.730> a<00:01:09.760> person<00:01:10.120> who<00:01:10.210> lives<00:01:10.510> at<00:01:10.750> 70<00:01:11.230> degrees<00:01:11.260> but

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
for a person who lives at 70 degrees but

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.400 
for a person who lives at 70 degrees but
an<00:01:12.220> engineer<00:01:13.180> will<00:01:13.330> tell<00:01:13.510> you<00:01:13.660> that<00:01:13.870> as<00:01:14.260> long

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
an engineer will tell you that as long

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.140 
an engineer will tell you that as long
as<00:01:14.470> they've<00:01:14.650> got<00:01:14.680> predictability<00:01:15.190> they<00:01:15.940> can

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
as they've got predictability they can

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.660 
as they've got predictability they can
they<00:01:16.600> can<00:01:16.630> be<00:01:16.870> ready<00:01:17.350> for<00:01:17.650> it<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.340> fact<00:01:18.580> that

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
they can be ready for it the fact that

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.420 
they can be ready for it the fact that
it's<00:01:18.820> got<00:01:18.880> lower<00:01:19.240> gravity<00:01:19.660> than<00:01:20.110> Mars<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.740> no

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
it's got lower gravity than Mars and no

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.219 
it's got lower gravity than Mars and no
atmosphere<00:01:21.970> means<00:01:22.210> is<00:01:22.360> much<00:01:22.540> easier<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.990> get

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
atmosphere means is much easier to get

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.609 
atmosphere means is much easier to get
something<00:01:24.010> from<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.550> surface<00:01:24.790> up<00:01:25.150> into<00:01:25.510> orbit

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
something from the surface up into orbit

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.640 
something from the surface up into orbit
or<00:01:26.619> so<00:01:26.800> much<00:01:26.950> closer<00:01:27.250> to<00:01:27.369> Earth<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.780> one<00:01:29.410> big

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
or so much closer to Earth and one big

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.859 
or so much closer to Earth and one big
tourist<00:01:30.160> draw<00:01:30.550> that<00:01:30.850> would<00:01:31.030> be<00:01:31.270> present<00:01:31.840> on

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
tourist draw that would be present on

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.690 
tourist draw that would be present on
the<00:01:31.990> moon<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.350> might<00:01:32.500> not<00:01:32.619> really<00:01:32.770> be<00:01:32.890> viable

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
the moon that might not really be viable

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.490 
the moon that might not really be viable
much<00:01:34.060> anywhere<00:01:34.390> else<00:01:34.570> is<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:34.960> if<00:01:35.290> you<00:01:35.350> had<00:01:35.470> a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
much anywhere else is that if you had a

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.260 
much anywhere else is that if you had a
big<00:01:35.770> enough<00:01:36.010> dome<00:01:36.430> or<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.880> big<00:01:37.060> enough

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
big enough dome or a big enough

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.870 
big enough dome or a big enough
underground<00:01:37.570> structure<00:01:38.260> you<00:01:39.190> could<00:01:39.310> strap<00:01:39.580> on

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
underground structure you could strap on

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.450 
underground structure you could strap on
wings<00:01:40.240> probably<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.110> fly<00:01:41.350> like<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.619> bird

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
wings probably and fly like a bird

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.330 
wings probably and fly like a bird
I<00:01:43.810> suspect<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:44.990> flying<00:01:45.290> like<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.619> bird<00:01:46.010> is

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
I suspect it flying like a bird is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.520 
I suspect it flying like a bird is
probably<00:01:46.700> more<00:01:47.000> fun<00:01:47.330> than<00:01:47.600> like<00:01:47.840> floating<00:01:48.229> in

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
probably more fun than like floating in

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.580 
probably more fun than like floating in
a<00:01:48.890> weightless<00:01:49.159> context<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.380> think<00:01:51.380> it's<00:01:51.470> bike

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
a weightless context I think it's bike

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.290 
a weightless context I think it's bike
just<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.920> just<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.310> right<00:01:52.460> amount<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.820> gravity

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
just of just the right amount of gravity

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.510 
just of just the right amount of gravity
there<00:01:53.690> to<00:01:54.470> make<00:01:54.890> this<00:01:55.070> kind<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.340> thing

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
there to make this kind of thing

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.030 
there to make this kind of thing
possibly<00:01:56.030> practical<00:01:56.690> there's<00:01:57.409> every<00:01:57.800> mineral

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
possibly practical there's every mineral

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.080 
possibly practical there's every mineral
you'd<00:01:58.970> ever<00:01:59.150> won<00:01:59.590> every<00:02:00.590> element<00:02:01.100> with<00:02:02.000> the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
you'd ever won every element with the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.340 
you'd ever won every element with the
exception<00:02:02.540> of<00:02:02.659> shortage<00:02:03.530> in<00:02:03.680> hydrogen<00:02:04.130> and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
exception of shortage in hydrogen and

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.630 
exception of shortage in hydrogen and
there's<00:02:06.350> going<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:06.890> be<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:07.009> shortage<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.430> water

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
there's going to be a shortage of water

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.630 
there's going to be a shortage of water
too<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.060> in<00:02:08.479> fact<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:10.069> know<00:02:10.160> there's

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
too and in fact you know there's

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.120

theoretically<00:02:11.380> various<00:02:12.380> locations<00:02:12.890> that

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
theoretically various locations that

haven't been found yet well I it could

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.820 
haven't been found yet well I it could
be<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.810> little<00:02:18.019> wrong<00:02:18.170> about<00:02:18.380> that<00:02:18.440> there<00:02:18.739> might

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
be a little wrong about that there might

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.040 
be a little wrong about that there might
be<00:02:18.890> one<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.370> was<00:02:19.610> found<00:02:19.790> anyway<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.660> beats

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
be one that was found anyway it beats

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.949 
be one that was found anyway it beats
Mars<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.620> mean<00:02:21.739> it<00:02:22.010> takes<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.340> second<00:02:22.850> for<00:02:22.970> a

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
Mars I mean it takes a second for a

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.740 
Mars I mean it takes a second for a
radio<00:02:24.830> signal<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.459> reach<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.880> moon<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.510> takes

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
radio signal to reach the moon it takes

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.470 
radio signal to reach the moon it takes
eight<00:02:26.959> minutes<00:02:27.019> for<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.830> reach<00:02:28.070> Mars<00:02:28.480> so

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
eight minutes for it to reach Mars so

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.340 
eight minutes for it to reach Mars so
you<00:02:29.570> could<00:02:29.660> have<00:02:29.750> normal<00:02:30.110> internet

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
you could have normal internet

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
but some folks say you could do even

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.170 
but some folks say you could do even
better<00:02:37.230> than<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.790> might<00:02:38.970> actually

better than that that it might actually

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.640 
better than that that it might actually
be<00:02:39.390> better<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:41.150> colonize<00:02:42.230> nothing<00:02:43.230> as<00:02:43.440> in

probably involve landing on a near-earth
