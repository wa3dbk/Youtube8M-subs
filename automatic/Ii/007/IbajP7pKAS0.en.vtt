00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Today in science at home we will learn to distinguish between raw egg and boiled egg 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.730
 Today in science at home we will learn to distinguish between raw egg and boiled egg 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.520
 Here is my sincere help 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.350
 Hanna, to say that your mother prepared boiled eggs and put it in the refrigerator 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.440
 Next to the raw eggs. How can you identify boiled eggs? 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.800
 I have no idea! 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.030
 Well, today we will learn to distinguish between the two types without falling in love 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.600
 Everything you need is simple 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.320
 Place the eggs on the table to rotate them 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.760
 I will explain: First boiled egg 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.750
 Turn better than raw eggs 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.130
 If I run it ... 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.410
 I saw that 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.340
 Now I will turn that egg 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.400
 You can see that they are turning strongly 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.980
 But it is difficult to know what is difficult and what is easy 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.960
 Within a minute we will learn exactly how to distinguish between a solid and a solid egg 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.730
 Solid egg 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.480
 And the raw egg 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.400
 In the raw egg, and because it contains liquid in it, this liquid hinders the circulation process 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.320
 So they drift more slowly 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.190
 Suppose we can not accurately observe whether the rotation is fast or slow 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.290
 We will learn how to differentiate hundred percent 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.360
 Suppose we played the egg and then pressed our fingers until it stopped 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.530
 It stops 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.280
 If stopped - this indicates that it is solid 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.900
 On the contrary, the raw egg: now its turn 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.750
 - Stop arrest! - But they continue to spin! 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.880
 The reason is ... that the fluid inside the egg continues to spin 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.740
 Even though I stop it, the fluid inside continues to spin 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.250
 And .. Continue to rotate the egg 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.790
 Let us examine the validity of our claims according to the following experiment, this raw egg 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.600
 This egg is solid 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 lets see 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.580
 This is actually a solid egg 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.290
 - And this 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.800
 The raw 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.460
 that's cool!
