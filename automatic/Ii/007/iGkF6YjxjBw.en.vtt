that in there right and adjust it you
don't<00:00:40.649> need<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.129> use<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.000> if<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.530> receiver

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
don't need to use this if the receiver

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.220 
don't need to use this if the receiver
is<00:00:44.040> not<00:00:44.280> installed<00:00:44.670> yet<00:00:44.930> because<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.050> can

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
is not installed yet because you can

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.049 
is not installed yet because you can
reach<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.440> easily<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:47.070> your<00:00:47.250> fingers<00:00:47.610> but

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
reach it easily with your fingers but

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.029 
reach it easily with your fingers but
once<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> receiver<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.960> installed<00:00:49.440> you'll

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
once the receiver is installed you'll

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.160 
once the receiver is installed you'll
need<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.910> adjust<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.329> back<00:00:51.629> adjuster

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
need this to adjust the back adjuster

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.600 
need this to adjust the back adjuster
the<00:00:52.350> front<00:00:52.590> ones<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.280> use<00:00:53.340> your

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the front ones you can just use your

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.729 
the front ones you can just use your
finger<00:00:53.969> or<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.629> also<00:00:54.809> use<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> tool<00:00:55.500> like

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
wish so that's the tool and then you

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.670 
wish so that's the tool and then you
will<00:01:02.430> also<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.270> plate<00:01:03.680> little

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
will also have a little plate little

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.310 
will also have a little plate little
tray<00:01:05.100> you'll<00:01:05.970> find<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:06.780> perfect

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
tray you'll find that it's not perfect

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.560 
tray you'll find that it's not perfect
it's<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.860> perfectly<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:08.880> symmetrical

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it's not as perfectly as symmetrical

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.020 
it's not as perfectly as symmetrical
it's<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.900> done<00:01:10.110> by<00:01:10.290> end<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.740> use<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.030> dremel

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it's just done by end I use a dremel

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.520 
it's just done by end I use a dremel
tool<00:01:12.420> drill<00:01:13.350> press<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.890> some<00:01:14.790> done<00:01:15.240> burs<00:01:16.140> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
tool drill press and some done burs to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.910 
tool drill press and some done burs to
do<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.820> essentially<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.720> 30<00:01:19.170> s<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.740> what

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
do this but essentially the 30 s is what

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.010 
do this but essentially the 30 s is what
really<00:01:20.369> matters<00:01:20.490> most<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.270> need<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> line<00:01:21.840> up

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
really matters most you need to line up

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.140 
really matters most you need to line up
with<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.229> three<00:01:22.560> holes<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> frame<00:01:23.250> one

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
with the three holes on the frame one

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.960 
with the three holes on the frame one
two<00:01:24.689> three<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.409> they<00:01:25.710> will<00:01:25.950> line<00:01:26.189> up<00:01:26.220> well<00:01:26.640> so

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
two three and they will line up well so

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.569 
two three and they will line up well so
that<00:01:27.540> will<00:01:27.689> work<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.470> then<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.430> will

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
that will work for you and then you will

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.100 
that will work for you and then you will
have<00:01:29.610> three<00:01:30.000> linkage<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.400> they're<00:01:32.400> different

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
have three linkage and they're different

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.390 
have three linkage and they're different
well<00:01:34.110> two<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.470> them<00:01:34.619> are<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> same<00:01:35.130> let<00:01:35.310> me

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
well two of them are the same let me

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.210 
well two of them are the same let me
show<00:01:35.579> them<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.680> two<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.829> them<00:01:37.950> are<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
show them to you two of them are the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.550 
show them to you two of them are the
same<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> front<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.290> here's

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
same for the front and this one here's

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.039 
same for the front and this one here's
for<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.799> back<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.630> will<00:01:42.630> also<00:01:42.780> have

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
for the back and you will also have

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.410 
for the back and you will also have
three<00:01:43.380> springs<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.430> see<00:01:44.670> here<00:01:44.939> three

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
three springs as you can see here three

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.020 
three springs as you can see here three
tiny<00:01:45.720> Springs<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.439> three<00:01:47.220> little<00:01:47.460> washers

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
tiny Springs and three little washers

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.410 
tiny Springs and three little washers
the<00:01:48.780> washers<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.670> holes<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the washers are because the holes on the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.120 
the washers are because the holes on the
frame<00:01:51.659> are<00:01:51.840> too<00:01:51.990> big<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.590> these<00:01:52.680> tiny<00:01:53.009> little

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
frame are too big for these tiny little

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.370 
frame are too big for these tiny little
Springs<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.420> will<00:01:54.630> need<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> put<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> washer

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
Springs so you will need to put a washer

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.380 
Springs so you will need to put a washer
on<00:01:55.829> which<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.969> spring<00:01:57.270> will<00:01:57.479> sit<00:01:59.180> you<00:02:00.180> can

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
on which the spring will sit you can

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.149 
on which the spring will sit you can
actually<00:02:00.570> use<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.960> little<00:02:01.320> bit<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.469> epoxy<00:02:01.890> in

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
actually use a little bit of epoxy in

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.459 
actually use a little bit of epoxy in
the<00:02:02.310> holes<00:02:02.520> instead<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.299> poke<00:02:04.020> through<00:02:04.320> it

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
the holes instead and poke through it

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.200 
the holes instead and poke through it
with<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> needle<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.549> think<00:02:05.790> it'd<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:05.939> better

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
with a needle I think it'd be better

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.119 
with a needle I think it'd be better
than<00:02:06.450> those<00:02:06.630> big<00:02:07.140> washers<00:02:07.619> which<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.950> what<00:02:08.099> I

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
than those big washers which is what I

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.160 
than those big washers which is what I
did<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.520> my<00:02:08.550> Ellie<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> i'm<00:02:09.179> not<00:02:09.390> using<00:02:09.599> washers

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
did on my Ellie I i'm not using washers

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.530 
did on my Ellie I i'm not using washers
on<00:02:10.440> my<00:02:10.890> le<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.520> install<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.360> pretty

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
on my le so to install this is pretty

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.400 
on my le so to install this is pretty
straightforward

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
straightforward

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.960 
straightforward
you<00:02:13.830> need<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.070> pair<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.340> long<00:02:14.820> nose<00:02:15.060> pliers<00:02:15.090> and

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
you need a pair of long nose pliers and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.700 
you need a pair of long nose pliers and
then<00:02:20.090> always<00:02:21.090> start<00:02:21.360> with<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.540> back<00:02:21.810> one<00:02:22.110> some

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
then always start with the back one some

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.950 
then always start with the back one some
reason<00:02:23.160> find<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.640> easier<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.120> begin<00:02:24.630> with<00:02:24.810> the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
reason find it easier to begin with the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.130 
reason find it easier to begin with the
rear<00:02:25.170> one<00:02:25.440> get<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.490> on<00:02:26.670> there<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.960> just

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
rear one get that on there and you just

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.190 
rear one get that on there and you just
get<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.530> through<00:02:30.350> framework<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:33.630> frame<00:02:33.960> as

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
get that through framework the frame as

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:47.150 
get that through framework the frame as
such<00:02:40.580> you'll<00:02:41.580> see<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:46.350> other<00:02:46.590> end<00:02:46.860> of

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
such you'll see that the other end of

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.810 
such you'll see that the other end of
the<00:02:47.430> adjusters<00:02:47.970> goes<00:02:48.270> into<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.950> hole<00:02:50.510> like<00:02:51.510> this

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
the adjusters goes into a hole like this

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.310 
the adjusters goes into a hole like this
that's<00:02:53.820> usually<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.360> hole<00:02:54.630> for<00:02:54.870> this<00:02:55.050> cruise

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
that's usually a hole for this cruise

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.490 
that's usually a hole for this cruise
with<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.560> stock<00:02:56.100> tray<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.240> stock<00:02:57.540> receiver

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
with the stock tray the stock receiver

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.830 
with the stock tray the stock receiver
tray<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.340> now<00:02:59.490> this<00:02:59.670> can't<00:02:59.970> move<00:03:00.360> out<00:03:00.540> there

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
tray so now this can't move out there

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.630 
tray so now this can't move out there
and<00:03:01.500> we<00:03:01.590> can't<00:03:01.830> have<00:03:01.920> anything<00:03:02.250> under<00:03:02.490> here

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
and we can't have anything under here

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.190 
and we can't have anything under here
because<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.150> main<00:03:03.330> gear<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.660> there<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.080> that's

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
because the main gear is there so that's

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.050 
because the main gear is there so that's
how<00:03:04.440> it's<00:03:04.620> designed<00:03:04.770> just<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.280> fit<00:03:05.550> on<00:03:05.700> there

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
how it's designed just to fit on there

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.640 
how it's designed just to fit on there
like<00:03:06.270> this<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.630> adjustments<00:03:07.200> from<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.440> top

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
like this the adjustments from the top

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.340 
like this the adjustments from the top
and<00:03:07.860> then<00:03:08.610> from<00:03:08.910> there<00:03:08.970> we'll<00:03:09.900> need<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.230> take

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
and then from there we'll need to take

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.760 
and then from there we'll need to take
your<00:03:10.500> little<00:03:10.680> washer<00:03:11.220> if<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.750> have<00:03:12.900> not<00:03:13.140> used

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
your little washer if you have not used

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.660 
your little washer if you have not used
epoxy<00:03:14.240> put<00:03:15.240> that<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:15.600> there<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.400> then<00:03:17.400> put

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
epoxy put that on there and then put

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.590 
epoxy put that on there and then put
your<00:03:17.700> spring<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.420> there<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:20.520> then<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.270> tray

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
your spring on there and then the tray

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.080 
your spring on there and then the tray
down<00:03:22.970> there<00:03:23.970> hold<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.750> together<00:03:24.990> and<00:03:26.090> then

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
down there hold that together and then

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.710 
down there hold that together and then
put<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.570> linkage<00:03:28.050> on<00:03:28.430> air<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:30.030> linkage<00:03:30.450> and

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
put the linkage on air the linkage and

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.570 
put the linkage on air the linkage and
on<00:03:30.870> there<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.940> that's<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:34.160> it's<00:03:35.160> easier<00:03:35.490> for

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
on there and that's that it's easier for

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.400 
on there and that's that it's easier for
me<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.000> do<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.330> quickly<00:03:36.570> because<00:03:37.020> there's<00:03:37.230> no

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
me to do it quickly because there's no

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.160 
me to do it quickly because there's no
servos<00:03:37.860> on<00:03:38.040> there<00:03:38.250> now<00:03:38.400> like<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.180> said<00:03:39.209> if<00:03:39.690> you

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
servos on there now like I said if you

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.530 
servos on there now like I said if you
want<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.590> can<00:03:40.740> always<00:03:41.070> use<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.640> little<00:03:42.360> tool

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
want you can always use a little tool

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.130 
want you can always use a little tool
here<00:03:43.550> alright<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:44.820> just<00:03:45.330> screw<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:45.930> in

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
here alright and just screw that in

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.410 
here alright and just screw that in
there<00:03:49.489> ok<00:03:50.489> so<00:03:50.550> I'm<00:03:50.850> just<00:03:50.970> going<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.239> use<00:03:51.360> my

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
there ok so I'm just going to use my

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.690 
there ok so I'm just going to use my
finger<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:52.080> easier<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.850> what<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.150> do<00:03:54.270> is<00:03:55.700> I

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
finger it's easier and what I do is I

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.229 
finger it's easier and what I do is I
put<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:57.650> about<00:03:58.650> mid<00:03:58.980> tension<00:03:59.489> of<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.760> spring

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
put it about mid tension of the spring

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.570 
put it about mid tension of the spring
so<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.260> don't<00:04:01.560> squish<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.010> springs<00:04:02.310> all<00:04:02.489> the

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
so I don't squish the springs all the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.520 
so I don't squish the springs all the
way<00:04:02.700> down<00:04:02.940> just<00:04:03.300> about<00:04:03.480> mid<00:04:03.750> tension<00:04:04.170> now<00:04:04.320> look

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
way down just about mid tension now look

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.650 
way down just about mid tension now look
at<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.800> tree<00:04:05.010> you<00:04:05.100> see<00:04:05.280> it's<00:04:05.400> tilted<00:04:05.790> that's

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
at the tree you see it's tilted that's

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.479 
at the tree you see it's tilted that's
because<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.230> end<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.709> spring<00:04:07.920> of<00:04:08.190> course

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
because the end of the spring of course

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.970 
because the end of the spring of course
it's<00:04:08.940> just<00:04:09.270> it's<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.600> cut-up<00:04:09.840> Springs<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.800> now

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
it's just it's a cut-up Springs so now

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.670 
it's just it's a cut-up Springs so now
we'll<00:04:11.190> just<00:04:11.220> turn<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.730> spring<00:04:13.190> until<00:04:15.680> you

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
we'll just turn the spring until you

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.070

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.370 
well because that the bloody spring can
can<00:05:50.680> call<00:05:50.980> around<00:05:51.250> it<00:05:51.520> so<00:05:52.300> just<00:05:52.600> tighten<00:05:53.260> that

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
can call around it so just tighten that

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:01.200 
can call around it so just tighten that
