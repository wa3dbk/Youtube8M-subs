is going to be our first battle Archer
gramin<00:01:02.750> vs<00:01:03.110> vandy<00:01:03.559> colum<00:01:03.950> so<00:01:04.640> let's<00:01:04.879> get

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
gramin vs vandy colum so let's get

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.020 
gramin vs vandy colum so let's get
started<00:01:06.610> man<00:01:07.610> dick<00:01:07.820> olum<00:01:08.149> Sam<00:01:08.450> oh<00:01:09.550> whoa<00:01:10.550> it's

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
started man dick olum Sam oh whoa it's

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.710 
started man dick olum Sam oh whoa it's
getting<00:01:11.330> a<00:01:11.539> little<00:01:11.720> right<00:01:12.200> in<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:13.310> corner

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.650 

so<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.010> round<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.670> first<00:01:17.850> round<00:01:18.000> goes<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> ban

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
so the round the first round goes to ban

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.280 
so the round the first round goes to ban
de<00:01:18.810> Coulomb<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> score<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.830> 10<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.290> let's

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
de Coulomb with the score of 10 so let's

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.410 
de Coulomb with the score of 10 so let's
try<00:01:22.470> round<00:01:22.740> two<00:01:28.760> syllable<00:01:29.760> flashing<00:01:30.210> right

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
try round two syllable flashing right

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.670 
try round two syllable flashing right
now<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.940> nexus<00:01:33.540> stadium<00:01:34.080> out<00:01:34.230> with<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
now in a nexus stadium out with the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.640 
now in a nexus stadium out with the
score<00:01:34.980> of<00:01:35.100> 11<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.330> now<00:01:36.510> round<00:01:36.780> three<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.530> it's

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
score of 11 so now round three so it's

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.200 
score of 11 so now round three so it's
gonna<00:01:37.770> leave<00:01:37.950> five<00:01:38.160> rounds<00:01:38.580> then<00:01:40.730> now<00:01:41.730> Ben<00:01:42.060> de

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
gonna leave five rounds then now Ben de

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.290 
gonna leave five rounds then now Ben de
Coulomb<00:01:44.660> in<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.990> corner<00:01:46.560> goes<00:01:47.119> with<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
Coulomb in the corner goes with the

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.930 
Coulomb in the corner goes with the
score<00:01:48.690> up<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:50.240> 16<00:01:51.240> are<00:01:51.660> let's<00:01:51.990> move<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.290> camera

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
score up to 16 are let's move the camera

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.870 
score up to 16 are let's move the camera
21<00:01:53.940> so<00:01:54.750> now<00:01:54.930> let<00:01:55.229> us<00:01:55.260> get<00:01:55.470> your<00:01:55.680> own<00:01:55.830> flies<00:01:58.880> hey
