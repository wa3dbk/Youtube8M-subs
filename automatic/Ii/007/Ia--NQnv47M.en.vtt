the frame inside but you know the bottom
layer<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:22.800> that's<00:02:23.800> so<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.430> my<00:02:24.970> logs

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
layer and that's so that my logs

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.640 
layer and that's so that my logs
wouldn't<00:02:25.630> be<00:02:25.690> laying<00:02:25.930> right<00:02:26.020> on<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.350> ground

wouldn't be laying right on the ground
and<00:02:26.860> running<00:02:27.220> then<00:02:27.580> then<00:02:27.940> post<00:02:28.240> are<00:02:28.630> treated

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.030 
and running then then post are treated
so<00:02:29.500> they<00:02:29.770> should<00:02:30.670> last<00:02:30.880> quite<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.209> while<00:02:31.300> now

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040
