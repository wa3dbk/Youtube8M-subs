00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.599
 training and decided to do a test 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.599
 with the theme of the handicapped 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.490
 see now in the visual journal 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.180
 a subtle and delicate look at shapes 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.450
 disabilities a playful form of 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.800
 treat a theme so often 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.620
 neglected by society 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:45.040
 we now give an interview with 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.040
 psychologist and photographer martha alencar 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.730
 Hello here today in limited action we are going 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.180
 meet two super figures 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.610
 interesting 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.360
 one of them is the marta alencar who is 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.910
 I'm a psychologist here with me, she's a photographer too. 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.040
 It's a brand that will tell us a little 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.670
 of some projects that she comes 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.100
 developing for some time already with 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.390
 children and people with disabilities 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.190
 way of social inclusion in the world that 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.380
 We live today, and Martha tells us. 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.130
 a little bit of this project 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.610
 during my work I've always listened 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.560
 much about the donor 's suffering in 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.340
 relation to discrimination and prejudice 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.580
 unfortunately today is because the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.619
 So people, so what I did was 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.090
 to ally a pleasure of mine that was the photograph 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:46.060
 along with my work and I 'm from my 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.190
 transforming power is to bring a 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.970
 positive image about people with 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.970
 deficiency 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.189
 but beyond this project the brand solved 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.759
 invent more active flapping its 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:05.060
 newest athina experience is 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.850
 a character that I created is c'mon 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.860
 imagine that China is a metaphor for the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.340
 times about the possibilities are not 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.530
 then this character she tragic neither me 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.500
 I try to take this character to several 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.440
 places in places that maybe a person 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.880
 disabled would not do but as she is 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.580
 a possibility 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.040
 I think it's important, it's annoying. 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.769
 it is clear that this is not to say that 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.230
 She has some kind of handicapped person. 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.860
 she has a physical disability 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.440
 and she is not what prevents 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.930
 it does not have an internal barrier 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.830
 it encounters external barriers 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.069
 external barriers she seeks to return 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.920
 Because she has a blog, it's fun. I created it. 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.440
 So this project is the one I created a blog to 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.560
 From this character and I photograph 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.170
 and it is as if to humanize if this 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.720
 Piece is a doll then to be a 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.600
 humanism she 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.630
 Athina, in fact, her name is 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.840
 brave is valentina because she suffered 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.239
 a cordon ring and her mother had 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.150
 another name thought ah no she will not 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.280
 Call Gabriela and call Valentina. 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.220
 because she was very brave overcame 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.569
 that trauma is what caused it a 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.569
 trauma a poor 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.780
 I heard that you guys made a 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.560
 travel recently tells us a 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.530
 little of that trip is is I traveled snow there 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.460
 Nepalese way, the Brazilians are 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.400
 the trek 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.920
 I dreamed of seeing the everest and then took 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.780
 You had a bath with me. 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.270
 then 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.750
 it was shocking, the people's relationship 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.110
 with her then china children 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.970
 made a major impact on it. 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.460
 Is there a chair for her? 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.270
 Beautiful wheels and when people have 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.550
 disability does not have these and does not have 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.850
 these resources is not that we already have 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.850
 Here in Brazil 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.829
 and speaking of accessibility as you 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.510
 sees this question even in practice, I 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.840
 I would like to talk same sensitivity 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.000
 relates Latin in which is her role 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.280
 old athina to break another 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.940
 not the physical barriers and 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.460
 so my idea skates it to take 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.180
 is to create a wide range of accessibility 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.180
 people's hearts 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.520
 So now the big time has come. 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.840
 It's so expected I'll finally meet the 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.350
 athina nÃ© 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:56.570
 come on, show yourself, that line 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.970
 Tina is the active barbie unleashed shoots 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.300
 no, it's not the dam cell 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:08.930
 She is a friend of the bar. 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:14.660
 es abecs including so athina brings 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:17.870
 another concept that is different 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.700
 Different bar and the bar EFE 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.420
 perfect woman is an example of woman 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:27.380
 60 woman lean to mec woman who is more 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.400
 that consume this inclusive 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.470
 but she came holding something is not 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.460
 so jokes she brought you remembered 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.659
 in Nepal and brought this gift and that 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:42.990

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:55.620

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.509

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:02.789

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:06.360
 It's you too, it kills but we do not 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:09.090
 have to stay alone for piano of course 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:12.630
 that we are going to do an action sport 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.880
 and adventure but the customer ask for 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.930
 Take my picture with her since you 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.930
 It was the mother in law. 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:28.870
