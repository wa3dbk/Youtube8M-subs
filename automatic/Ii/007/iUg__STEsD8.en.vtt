00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
between the tile or if you have a shower

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.720 
between the tile or if you have a shower
stall<00:00:28.859> between<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> tile<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> tub<00:00:31.730> areas

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.610 
stall between the tile and the tub areas
in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:32.969> corners<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> tendency<00:00:34.350> to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
in the corners we have a tendency to

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.450 
in the corners we have a tendency to
crack<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.399> also<00:00:36.500> sealing<00:00:37.500> around<00:00:37.590> downspouts

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
crack and also sealing around downspouts

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.880 
crack and also sealing around downspouts
and<00:00:38.760> your<00:00:39.030> faucet<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:40.079> make<00:00:40.379> sure<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.710> water

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and your faucet to make sure that water

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.260 
and your faucet to make sure that water
is<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.190> getting<00:00:41.399> back<00:00:41.610> behind<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.090> wall

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
is not getting back behind the wall

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
is not getting back behind the wall
because<00:00:42.600> obviously<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.410> did<00:00:43.649> then<00:00:43.920> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
because obviously if it did then you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.510 
because obviously if it did then you
would<00:00:44.190> never<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.480> would<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.629> be

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
would never know it and it would just be

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.920 
would never know it and it would just be
prolonged<00:00:47.520> maintenance<00:00:48.180> issues<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
prolonged maintenance issues and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
prolonged maintenance issues and
eventually<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.800> would<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.070> some<00:00:50.280> sort<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
eventually you would have some sort of

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.750 
eventually you would have some sort of
dry<00:00:50.760> dry<00:00:51.329> rot<00:00:51.570> problems<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.530> once<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.579> come<00:00:53.699> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
dry dry rot problems so once you come a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.790 
dry dry rot problems so once you come a
little<00:00:53.910> closer<00:00:54.210> we'll<00:00:54.629> take<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> look<00:00:55.050> here<00:00:55.260> one

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
little closer we'll take a look here one

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.840 
little closer we'll take a look here one
of<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.920> first<00:00:56.129> areas<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.520> we're<00:00:56.699> talking

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
of the first areas that we're talking

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.630 
of the first areas that we're talking
about<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.410> seal<00:00:58.800> right<00:00:59.190> around<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
about is just the seal right around the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.029 
about is just the seal right around the
edge<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> tub<00:01:00.329> now<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.890> not

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
edge of the tub now if this is not

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.860 
edge of the tub now if this is not
maintained<00:01:02.579> well<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:03.329> will<00:01:03.480> happen<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
maintained well what will happen is

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
maintained well what will happen is
water<00:01:04.110> will<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.409> behind<00:01:04.559> there<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
water will get behind there and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.320 
water will get behind there and
eventually<00:01:05.100> it'll<00:01:05.430> make<00:01:05.670> its<00:01:05.880> way<00:01:06.030> back

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
eventually it'll make its way back

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.810 
eventually it'll make its way back
around<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.110> edge<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> tub<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.700> will

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
around the edge of the tub and it will

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.399 
around the edge of the tub and it will
actually<00:01:09.000> creep<00:01:09.479> down<00:01:09.720> along<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> edge<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
actually creep down along the edge of

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.030 
actually creep down along the edge of
the<00:01:10.530> tub<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.400> all<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.939> areas<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.630> I

is the the grout has a tendency to crack
because<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> tubs<00:01:37.590> flexing<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.790> can

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
because the tubs flexing and as you can

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.399 
because the tubs flexing and as you can
see<00:01:38.970> here<00:01:39.329> at<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> tub<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.840> flexing<00:01:40.290> it's

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
see here at the tub is flexing it's

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.319 
see here at the tub is flexing it's
moving<00:01:40.740> away<00:01:40.829> from<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.220> grout<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.939> grout<00:01:42.180> is

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
moving away from the grout the grout is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.060 
moving away from the grout the grout is
cracked<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.530> needs<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.920> done

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
cracked and what this needs to be done

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.710 
cracked and what this needs to be done
needs<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.430> dried<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.299> needs<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> be

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
needs to be dried it needs to be

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.440 
needs to be dried it needs to be
regrouting<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.619> after<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> grout<00:01:47.490> dry<00:01:47.909> it

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
regrouting and after the grout dry it

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.840 
regrouting and after the grout dry it
needs<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.899> thin<00:01:49.229> layer<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.850> silicone

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
needs to have a thin layer of silicone

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.020 
needs to have a thin layer of silicone
clear<00:01:51.270> silicone<00:01:52.310> smeared<00:01:53.310> along<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:53.820> what

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
clear silicone smeared along there what

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.149 
clear silicone smeared along there what
that<00:01:54.360> will<00:01:54.570> do<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.590> silicone<00:01:56.009> will

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
that will do is the the silicone will

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.620 
that will do is the the silicone will
act<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.549> rubber<00:01:56.790> seal<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.390> we'll<00:01:57.509> keep

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
act like a rubber seal and we'll keep

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.090 
act like a rubber seal and we'll keep
the<00:01:57.810> grout<00:01:58.049> from<00:01:58.259> cracking<00:01:58.560> but<00:01:58.799> also

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the grout from cracking but also

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.709 
the grout from cracking but also
obviously<00:01:59.790> keep<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> water<00:02:00.360> from<00:02:00.570> getting

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
obviously keep the water from getting

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.780 
obviously keep the water from getting
behind<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:01.259> as<00:02:01.380> well<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.640> obviously

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
behind there as well this is obviously

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.740 
behind there as well this is obviously
not<00:02:03.299> finished<00:02:03.810> need<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.530> trim<00:02:04.950> along<00:02:05.310> here

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
not finished need a trim along here

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.020 
not finished need a trim along here
and<00:02:06.080> when<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.290> have<00:02:06.380> trim<00:02:06.620> along<00:02:07.100> here<00:02:07.430> then

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
and when you have trim along here then

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.120 
and when you have trim along here then
this<00:02:08.149> needs<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.509> be<00:02:08.600> sealed<00:02:08.840> well<00:02:09.140> along<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.320 
but one area that's really important as
well<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.590> quarters<00:02:25.130> when<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.820> have<00:02:26.030> two

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
well is the quarters when you have two

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.270 
well is the quarters when you have two

corners that meet together they flex and
grout<00:02:28.760> never<00:02:29.030> seems<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.420> last<00:02:29.750> in<00:02:29.930> here<00:02:30.050> if<00:02:30.200> you

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
grout never seems to last in here if you

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.150 
grout never seems to last in here if you
come<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.500> little<00:02:30.650> closer

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
come a little closer

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.070 
come a little closer
get<00:02:31.820> closer<00:02:32.090> with<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.420> camera<00:02:32.780> what<00:02:32.960> you'll

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
get closer with the camera what you'll

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.470 
get closer with the camera what you'll
see<00:02:33.260> is<00:02:33.470> in<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:34.010> corner<00:02:34.430> you'll<00:02:34.610> actually<00:02:34.850> see

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
see is in the corner you'll actually see

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.710 
see is in the corner you'll actually see
areas<00:02:35.990> where<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:37.490> grout<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.450> already

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
areas where the grout is already

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.210 
areas where the grout is already
starting<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.140> crack<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:39.770> is<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:39.920> fairly

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
starting to crack and this is a fairly

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.580 
starting to crack and this is a fairly
new<00:02:40.370> shower<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.120> what<00:02:41.810> we<00:02:41.930> need<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.110> do<00:02:42.320> is<00:02:42.470> we

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
new shower and what we need to do is we

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.170 
new shower and what we need to do is we
need<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.770> come<00:02:42.980> back<00:02:43.160> along<00:02:43.430> here<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:43.940> just

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
need to come back along here and just

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.690 
need to come back along here and just
seal<00:02:44.450> these<00:02:44.720> corners<00:02:45.290> with<00:02:45.770> some<00:02:45.950> silicone<00:02:46.430> um

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
seal these corners with some silicone um

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.150 
seal these corners with some silicone um
even<00:02:47.690> when<00:02:47.990> they're<00:02:48.140> brand<00:02:48.350> new<00:02:48.560> they<00:02:48.950> don't

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
even when they're brand new they don't

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.680 
even when they're brand new they don't
last<00:02:49.340> for<00:02:49.550> very<00:02:49.580> long<00:02:49.790> before<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.390> corner

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
last for very long before the corner

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.810 
last for very long before the corner
start<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.020> crack<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.470> another<00:02:52.370> area<00:02:52.580> that

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
start to crack and another area that

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.760 
start to crack and another area that
seems<00:02:53.240> to<00:02:53.480> be<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.630> little<00:02:53.930> bit<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.140> an<00:02:54.260> issue<00:02:54.410> is

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
seems to be a little bit of an issue is

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.890 
seems to be a little bit of an issue is
around<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.520> spout<00:02:55.790> now<00:02:56.030> if<00:02:56.270> this<00:02:56.450> stop<00:02:56.720> was

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
around the spout now if this stop was

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.800 
around the spout now if this stop was
taken<00:02:57.290> off<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:58.370> then<00:02:58.700> what<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.660> would

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
taken off and then what you would

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.570 
taken off and then what you would
probably<00:03:00.170> find<00:03:00.410> behind<00:03:00.950> here<00:03:01.130> if<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.280> was<00:03:01.400> done

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
probably find behind here if it was done

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.140 
probably find behind here if it was done
properly

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
properly

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.720 
properly
would<00:03:02.900> be<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.470> hole<00:03:03.709> itself<00:03:04.160> where<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.520> pipe

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
would be the hole itself where the pipe

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.570 
would be the hole itself where the pipe
is<00:03:04.910> coming<00:03:05.090> out<00:03:05.390> would<00:03:06.020> be<00:03:06.230> filled<00:03:06.650> with<00:03:06.950> a

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
is coming out would be filled with a

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.240 
is coming out would be filled with a
silicone<00:03:08.270> or<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.660> caulking<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.680> some<00:03:09.890> sort<00:03:10.190> that

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
silicone or a caulking of some sort that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.920 
silicone or a caulking of some sort that
would<00:03:10.489> not<00:03:10.700> allow<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.060> water<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.540> get<00:03:11.720> back

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
would not allow the water to get back

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
I went to a resident and the gasket that

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.380 
I went to a resident and the gasket that
seals<00:03:35.360> this<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.110> pipe<00:03:36.519> was<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.580> 30-cent

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
seals this to the pipe was a 30-cent

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.440 
seals this to the pipe was a 30-cent
o-ring<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.110> that<00:03:39.620> oring<00:03:40.040> had<00:03:40.250> failed<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:40.880> the

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
o-ring and that oring had failed and the

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.680 
o-ring and that oring had failed and the
client<00:03:41.959> had<00:03:42.200> sealed<00:03:42.920> it<00:03:43.220> around<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:44.420> spout

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
client had sealed it around the spout

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.990 
client had sealed it around the spout
because<00:03:44.989> they<00:03:45.470> did<00:03:45.650> not<00:03:45.680> want<00:03:45.980> water<00:03:46.280> spewing

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
because they did not want water spewing

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.430 
because they did not want water spewing
out<00:03:47.299> of<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.540> back<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.930> spout<00:03:48.200> and<00:03:48.350> they

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
out of the back of the spout and they

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.870 
out of the back of the spout and they
thought<00:03:48.650> that<00:03:48.799> would<00:03:48.920> be<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.100> reasonable<00:03:49.519> fix

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
thought that would be a reasonable fix

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.850 
thought that would be a reasonable fix
but<00:03:50.510> instead<00:03:50.900> what<00:03:51.140> it<00:03:51.230> was<00:03:51.350> doing<00:03:51.500> was

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
but instead what it was doing was

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.770 
but instead what it was doing was
forcing<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.489> water<00:03:52.700> back<00:03:52.970> into<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.360> wall<00:03:53.540> by

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
forcing the water back into the wall by

forcing the water back into the wall by

peel<00:04:46.500> this<00:04:46.680> back<00:04:46.920> most<00:04:47.250> likely<00:04:47.370> what<00:04:48.000> we're

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
peel this back most likely what we're

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.000 
peel this back most likely what we're
going<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.240> find<00:04:48.480> is<00:04:48.690> this<00:04:49.260> this<00:04:49.650> is<00:04:49.830> actually

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
going to find is this this is actually

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.640 
going to find is this this is actually
sealed<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.420> is<00:04:51.570> not<00:04:51.780> sealed<00:04:52.050> as<00:04:52.230> well<00:04:52.410> it

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
sealed and it is not sealed as well it

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.130 
sealed and it is not sealed as well it
could<00:04:52.830> be<00:04:53.120> but<00:04:54.120> we<00:04:54.450> would<00:04:54.630> want<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:54.840> make<00:04:54.960> sure

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
could be but we would want to make sure

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.410 
could be but we would want to make sure
that<00:04:55.290> this<00:04:55.440> hole<00:04:55.740> is<00:04:56.010> filled<00:04:56.400> with<00:04:57.000> some<00:04:57.210> type

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
that this hole is filled with some type

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.660 
that this hole is filled with some type
of<00:04:57.450> caulking<00:04:58.110> or<00:04:58.290> something<00:04:59.070> to<00:04:59.190> prevent

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
of caulking or something to prevent

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.070 
of caulking or something to prevent
water<00:05:00.060> from<00:05:00.210> getting<00:05:00.360> in<00:05:00.750> there<00:05:00.960> and

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
water from getting in there and

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.930 
water from getting in there and
obviously<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.920> showers<00:05:02.250> not<00:05:02.400> used<00:05:02.670> in<00:05:02.820> this

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
obviously the showers not used in this

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.790 
obviously the showers not used in this
area<00:05:03.270> very<00:05:03.480> much<00:05:03.720> so<00:05:03.990> doesn't<00:05:04.560> have<00:05:04.740> a

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
area very much so doesn't have a

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.070 
area very much so doesn't have a
potential<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.520> higher<00:05:05.700> you<00:05:05.970> get<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.900> less

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
potential the higher you get the less

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.780 
potential the higher you get the less
potential<00:05:07.590> there<00:05:07.710> is<00:05:07.740> for<00:05:07.860> water<00:05:08.250> problems

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
potential there is for water problems

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.850 
potential there is for water problems
one<00:05:09.450> more<00:05:09.630> area<00:05:09.810> that<00:05:10.020> we<00:05:10.110> can<00:05:10.260> discuss<00:05:10.620> just

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
one more area that we can discuss just

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.050 
one more area that we can discuss just
real<00:05:11.010> quickly<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:11.580> then<00:05:11.670> I'm<00:05:11.760> going<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:11.910> let

real quickly and then I'm going to let

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.450 
real quickly and then I'm going to let
me<00:05:12.150> go<00:05:12.300> over<00:05:12.360> today<00:05:12.750> is<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.410> area<00:05:13.800> around<00:05:14.100> and

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
me go over today is the area around and

behind your toilet um if you ever for

behind your toilet um if you ever for

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
some reason find that there's staining

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.740 
some reason find that there's staining
around<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:20.490> edge<00:05:20.669> of<00:05:20.790> your<00:05:20.910> toilet<00:05:21.330> you<00:05:21.450> come

around the edge of your toilet you come

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.330 
around the edge of your toilet you come
down<00:05:21.960> a<00:05:21.990> little<00:05:22.200> closer<00:05:22.440> here<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:22.919> look<00:05:23.130> and

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
down a little closer here and look and

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.980 
down a little closer here and look and
this<00:05:23.850> is<00:05:23.910> an<00:05:24.120> area<00:05:24.210> you<00:05:24.450> don't<00:05:24.630> really<00:05:24.780> get

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
this is an area you don't really get

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.470 
this is an area you don't really get
down<00:05:25.169> too<00:05:25.380> much<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.740> look<00:05:25.890> behind<00:05:26.040> but<00:05:26.760> an<00:05:27.030> easy

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
down too much to look behind but an easy

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.120 
down too much to look behind but an easy
way<00:05:27.690> to<00:05:27.720> check<00:05:28.020> for<00:05:28.200> leaks<00:05:28.380> is<00:05:28.530> just<00:05:28.740> to<00:05:28.860> feel

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
way to check for leaks is just to feel

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.580 
way to check for leaks is just to feel
and<00:05:29.430> if<00:05:29.790> you<00:05:29.910> if<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.240> feel<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:31.020> lower<00:05:31.200> parts

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
and if you if you feel the lower parts

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.550 
and if you if you feel the lower parts
of<00:05:31.740> it<00:05:31.890> the<00:05:32.460> vowel<00:05:32.730> and<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.570> end<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.930> line<00:05:34.200> and

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
of it the vowel and the end the line and

of it the vowel and the end the line and
you<00:05:34.860> feel<00:05:35.040> any<00:05:35.250> kind<00:05:35.460> of<00:05:35.520> water<00:05:35.760> at<00:05:36.000> all<00:05:36.150> then

you feel any kind of water at all then

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.510 
you feel any kind of water at all then
you<00:05:36.720> know<00:05:36.870> they<00:05:37.080> have<00:05:37.290> a<00:05:37.320> potential<00:05:38.280> for<00:05:38.490> a

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
you know they have a potential for a

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.520 
you know they have a potential for a
leak<00:05:38.730> there<00:05:38.970> and<00:05:39.180> also<00:05:39.630> down<00:05:39.900> around<00:05:40.230> the<00:05:40.410> base
