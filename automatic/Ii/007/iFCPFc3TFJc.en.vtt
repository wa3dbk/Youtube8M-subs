 benefit 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.560
 we have this orange hair in a 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.010
 the retiree has more than one 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:39.130
 value in relation to blue because it is 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:41.860

 that he recovers to treat 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.800
 so you avoid if in life you have a 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.950
 series of facts 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.340
 I already knew today that I have not yet 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.950
 I can talk, I'll ask the staff of the 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.560
 technology if I can speak to who 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.860
 I competed with this car here and I go 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.200
 talk how this person competed and here 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.620
 People have the top car today from the store. 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.560
 here one of the most top out of the market 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.740
 this way is that we 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:25.569
 the people comment the price was as follows 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:29.039
 go beyond treated copper in 99 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:32.229
 good 9% copper 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.089
 then the cable my brother is absurd 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.569
 very good car 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:40.240
 is he also avoids the senate and everything else 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:42.849
 for being treated guest in a car 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.059
 unusual in that you see on the premises 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:48.879
 and there are cars that we will present 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:51.189
 with that green team cable on that line 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:52.979
 of special day of competition technology 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:56.409
 We 'll point the way there. 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:59.469
 but there is agreement with him here in our 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:00.520
 brr channel your portfolio of each car you 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.279
 he will be there 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.080
 besides these videos that we will ask for 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.759
 stay a little deeper than each 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.039
 because when you make a 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.279
 video on the car 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.289
 we try to pass in general that the 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:16.599
 people did in this car because they 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.479
 kobler that whole story 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:24.779
 already in this other sequence he lives the 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:28.449
 people will try to elucidate for you is 

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:31.649
 each each item the why of each item 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:34.269
 let's do the internship the pastor begins 

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:38.979
 This is what we expect everyone to 

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:42.339
 are you liking it there and we're going? 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:44.919
 try to demonstrate each video and will have 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:49.779
 a slightly longer posting period of 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:52.419
 each video because the person you said 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:55.749
 video for us to rs 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:57.939
 He has another job so he 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:07:00.369
 it will take a little tone not always 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:01.930
 I'll be able to upload video every week. 

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:04.479
 I hope you have a bit of 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.629
 patience in relation to this but 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:10.599
 tendency is to follow this schedule to do 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:13.469
 all to show a little more to you 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:13.469
