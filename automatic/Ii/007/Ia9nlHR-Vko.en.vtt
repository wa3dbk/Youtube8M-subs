00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.069
 very good today I bring you a retro boxing 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.110
 Those who follow me on twitter would see 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.950
 the other day that I bought a housing for 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.559
 give it the color 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.830
 he had to buy a hand and that 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.830
 I was 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.010
 and I found a store on ebay a 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.020
 seller who sold it and the truth is 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.410
 that quite the peak let's go 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.890
 difference that is not an original anymore 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.500
 that easy to change and it looks great 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.210
 now I have to buy one is to 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.760
 he harangued about poker that is also the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.930
 second hand and foreigners 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.280
 We are already perfect but there is 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.560
 truth is that I do not know not being the one I bought it 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.390
 but we will be much shame 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.700
 in principle the seller that I have 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.210
 bought this one gave me one for the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.670
 word because 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.670
 and this is what I bring today 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.980
 it's one thing the truth that pretty 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.180
 surprising because it looks a little bit 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.740
 online and not 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.740
 we do not know about the existence of this 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.710
 well I seem and you already tell me 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.640
 that is to say the face the casing that we have 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.479
 given to him 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.479
 from the very little 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.560
 but a little 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.720
 with our equal 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.500
 screwdriver 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.310
 once purchased this is 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.310
 implicit in the video 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:03.550
 and if it's a friend of color but it 's 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.570
 something other than being very color 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.570
 now you will see why 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.940
 to try with what I think is the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.540
 only rhythm and color game that I have 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.540
 and later 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.430
 the backlit color did not know that 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.060
 we existed 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.060
 not always 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.379
 in obrajes ending on ebay because I 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.280
 I knew there was light memory that 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.990
 it only came out in japan 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.910
 but that it had backlighting but 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.120
 they create black and white I did not know the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.890
 existence will be colored boy 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.610
 I asked if it was a mod and in principle not 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.610
 he told me we were 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.950
 I'm going to try a little bit of light 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.810
 I think it's pretty clear 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.810
 101 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.310
 the video looks worse what 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.930
 in person 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.360
 I think it must be because I say no 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.390
 there is a concrete color model 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.190
 number 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.230
 and then I've also read online and 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.980
 the people who said that the columns were 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.980
 I could do the mod 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.190
 the price is much lower than what is 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.020
 quote the gameboy light that they sell it to you 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.020
 about 100 150 euros 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.030
 and well, that was the color 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.890
 backlit 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.780
 that I found curious and good as 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.120
 has a more or less interesting price 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.360
 well 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.280
 I will comment if I stay with her or the 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.280
 I return if it is bad that I am deaf
