00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
bottle now it just puts said into

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.599 
bottle now it just puts said into
perspective<00:01:35.750> really<00:01:36.320> I<00:01:36.350> think<00:01:36.409> puts<00:01:36.799> with

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
perspective really I think puts with
