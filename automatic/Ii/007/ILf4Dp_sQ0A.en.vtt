00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009 

you

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:05.019 

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:07.749 

hi<00:00:06.019> this<00:00:06.080> is<00:00:06.229> Larry<00:00:06.529> from<00:00:06.769> Brite<00:00:06.979> therapy<00:00:07.370> calm

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:07.759 
hi this is Larry from Brite therapy calm

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.000 
hi this is Larry from Brite therapy calm
and<00:00:08.059> a<00:00:08.539> common<00:00:08.930> question<00:00:09.080> we<00:00:09.289> get<00:00:09.530> is<00:00:09.590> what's

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
and a common question we get is what's

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.949 
and a common question we get is what's
the<00:00:10.099> difference<00:00:10.459> between<00:00:10.610> LED<00:00:11.330> light<00:00:11.510> therapy

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:11.959 
the difference between LED light therapy

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.080 
the difference between LED light therapy
and<00:00:12.129> low-level<00:00:13.129> laser<00:00:13.459> therapy<00:00:13.639> or<00:00:14.059> just

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
and low-level laser therapy or just

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.140 
and low-level laser therapy or just
laser<00:00:14.570> therapy<00:00:15.010> and<00:00:16.010> actually<00:00:16.670> just<00:00:16.939> comes

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
laser therapy and actually just comes

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.779 
laser therapy and actually just comes
down<00:00:17.240> to<00:00:17.560> coherent<00:00:18.560> light<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:19.010> basically

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
down to coherent light and basically

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.359 
down to coherent light and basically
what<00:00:20.029> coherent<00:00:20.539> line<00:00:20.689> needs<00:00:20.990> is<00:00:21.289> all<00:00:21.890> the

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
what coherent line needs is all the

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.999 
what coherent line needs is all the
photons<00:00:23.300> are<00:00:23.480> traveling<00:00:23.900> in<00:00:23.990> parallel<00:00:24.439> a

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
photons are traveling in parallel a

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.329 
photons are traveling in parallel a
common<00:00:25.669> analogy<00:00:26.359> is<00:00:26.779> you<00:00:27.409> imagine<00:00:27.859> soldiers

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:28.339 
common analogy is you imagine soldiers

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.069 
common analogy is you imagine soldiers
walking<00:00:28.669> on<00:00:28.789> a<00:00:28.820> bridge<00:00:28.999> or<00:00:29.359> marching<00:00:29.810> in<00:00:30.050> time

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
walking on a bridge or marching in time

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.589 
walking on a bridge or marching in time
and<00:00:30.560> when<00:00:31.009> they<00:00:31.099> step<00:00:31.339> it's<00:00:31.579> boom-boom<00:00:32.180> both

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
and when they step it's boom-boom both

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.380 
and when they step it's boom-boom both
can<00:00:32.930> feel<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.890> steps<00:00:34.610> of<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.850> soldiers<00:00:35.180> but

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
can feel the steps of the soldiers but

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.310 
can feel the steps of the soldiers but
if<00:00:35.510> you<00:00:35.600> have<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:35.780> same<00:00:35.930> amount<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.200> people

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
if you have the same amount of people

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.380 
if you have the same amount of people
just<00:00:37.070> walking<00:00:37.400> over<00:00:37.490> a<00:00:37.610> bridge<00:00:37.850> at<00:00:38.030> different

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
just walking over a bridge at different

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.970 
just walking over a bridge at different
paces<00:00:38.540> you're<00:00:39.200> not<00:00:39.350> going<00:00:39.500> to<00:00:39.560> feel<00:00:39.710> those

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
paces you're not going to feel those

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.220 
paces you're not going to feel those
steps<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:40.610> so<00:00:41.030> because<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.870> light<00:00:42.050> is

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
steps and so because the light is

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.190 
steps and so because the light is
coherent<00:00:42.970> you<00:00:43.970> get<00:00:44.120> much<00:00:44.330> more<00:00:44.360> power<00:00:44.810> and

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
coherent you get much more power and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.290 
coherent you get much more power and
that's<00:00:45.620> what<00:00:45.890> a<00:00:46.010> laser<00:00:46.310> light<00:00:46.610> gives<00:00:46.880> you<00:00:47.030> it

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
that's what a laser light gives you it

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.090 
that's what a laser light gives you it
gives<00:00:47.360> you<00:00:47.600> coherent<00:00:48.200> light<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.920> both

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
gives you coherent light the both

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.490 
gives you coherent light the both
monochromatic<00:00:49.610> but<00:00:50.570> you<00:00:50.690> get<00:00:50.840> coherent<00:00:51.380> light

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
monochromatic but you get coherent light

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.080 
monochromatic but you get coherent light
and<00:00:51.680> that's<00:00:51.740> why<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:51.980> laser<00:00:52.250> travels<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:52.880> far

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
and that's why the laser travels so far

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.640 
and that's why the laser travels so far
you<00:00:53.240> get<00:00:53.330> so<00:00:53.510> much<00:00:53.630> brightness<00:00:53.930> for<00:00:54.590> the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
you get so much brightness for the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.520 
you get so much brightness for the
amount<00:00:54.860> of<00:00:54.980> power<00:00:55.960> so<00:00:56.960> you'll<00:00:57.110> think<00:00:57.170> well

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
amount of power so you'll think well

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.130 
amount of power so you'll think well
okay<00:00:57.860> LED<00:00:58.640> light<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:59.060> not<00:00:59.360> coherent<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.020> it's

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
okay LED light is not coherent so it's

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.400 
okay LED light is not coherent so it's
probably<00:01:00.380> not<00:01:00.560> effective<00:01:01.070> but<00:01:01.930> LED<00:01:02.930> light

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
probably not effective but LED light

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.679 
probably not effective but LED light
turns<00:01:03.920> coherent<00:01:04.579> when<00:01:04.909> it<00:01:05.059> passes<00:01:05.269> through<00:01:05.509> a

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
turns coherent when it passes through a

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.600 
turns coherent when it passes through a
fluid<00:01:05.979> and<00:01:06.979> you<00:01:07.490> can<00:01:07.640> see<00:01:07.820> this<00:01:08.030> when<00:01:08.780> you<00:01:09.610> when

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
fluid and you can see this when you when

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.490 
fluid and you can see this when you when
you<00:01:10.700> look<00:01:10.790> at<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:10.970> bottom<00:01:11.240> of<00:01:11.330> pool<00:01:11.480> when<00:01:12.440> you

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
you look at the bottom of pool when you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.450 
you look at the bottom of pool when you
look<00:01:12.650> at<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.800> bottom<00:01:13.040> you'll<00:01:13.130> notice<00:01:13.159> that

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
look at the bottom you'll notice that

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.100 
look at the bottom you'll notice that
there's<00:01:13.670> some<00:01:13.909> dark<00:01:14.210> spots<00:01:14.480> and<00:01:14.690> light<00:01:14.810> spots

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
there's some dark spots and light spots

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.260 
there's some dark spots and light spots
and<00:01:15.500> those<00:01:15.770> light<00:01:16.220> spots<00:01:16.610> at<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:16.970> bottom<00:01:17.180> of

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
and those light spots at the bottom of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.530 
and those light spots at the bottom of
pool<00:01:17.450> are<00:01:18.080> coherent<00:01:18.650> light<00:01:18.800> and<00:01:19.070> your<00:01:20.030> body<00:01:20.300> is

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
pool are coherent light and your body is

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.090 
pool are coherent light and your body is
made<00:01:20.750> up<00:01:20.870> of<00:01:21.020> almost<00:01:21.409> eighty<00:01:21.560> percent<00:01:21.620> water

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
made up of almost eighty percent water

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.980 
made up of almost eighty percent water
so<00:01:22.340> when<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:22.610> LED<00:01:23.000> passes<00:01:23.450> through<00:01:23.600> your<00:01:23.720> skin

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
so when the LED passes through your skin

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.870 
so when the LED passes through your skin
it<00:01:24.290> turns<00:01:24.680> go<00:01:24.890> hearing<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.550> hits<00:01:25.729> of

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
it turns go hearing the hits of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.330 
it turns go hearing the hits of
mitochondria<00:01:26.510> and<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:27.380> affects<00:01:27.710> the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
mitochondria and it affects the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.780 
mitochondria and it affects the
mitochondria<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.150> same<00:01:29.360> as<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:30.200> laser<00:01:30.409> does

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
mitochondria the same as the laser does

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.670 
mitochondria the same as the laser does
so<00:01:31.790> they're<00:01:32.210> both<00:01:32.420> effective<00:01:33.110> for<00:01:33.530> light

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
so they're both effective for light

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.510 
so they're both effective for light
therapy<00:01:34.270> we<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.630> like<00:01:36.170> lasers<00:01:36.620> because<00:01:37.250> the

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
therapy we I like lasers because the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.480 
therapy we I like lasers because the
treatment<00:01:37.909> times<00:01:38.229> are<00:01:39.229> shorter<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:40.280> light

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
treatment times are shorter the light

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.780 
treatment times are shorter the light
all<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.180> light<00:01:41.360> is<00:01:41.479> coherent<00:01:42.020> but<00:01:42.950> lasers<00:01:43.460> you

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
all the light is coherent but lasers you

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.180 
all the light is coherent but lasers you
have<00:01:43.909> a<00:01:43.940> small<00:01:44.270> treatment<00:01:44.570> area<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.500> treatment

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
have a small treatment area so treatment

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.399 
have a small treatment area so treatment
times<00:01:46.460> are<00:01:46.729> shorter<00:01:47.119> but<00:01:47.330> you<00:01:48.020> have<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.290> move

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
times are shorter but you have to move

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.040 
times are shorter but you have to move
the<00:01:48.560> laser

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
the laser

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.230 
the laser
around<00:01:49.230> to<00:01:49.410> treat<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> entire<00:01:49.890> area<00:01:50.210> with<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
around to treat the entire area with a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.460 
around to treat the entire area with a
le<00:01:52.080> led<00:01:52.980> to<00:01:53.160> led<00:01:53.400> device<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.780> get<00:01:55.050> a<00:01:55.230> much

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
le led to led device you get a much

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.680 
le led to led device you get a much
larger<00:01:55.920> treatment<00:01:56.280> area<00:01:56.550> but<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.270> light<00:01:57.480> has

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
larger treatment area but the light has

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.720 
larger treatment area but the light has
to<00:01:57.840> turn<00:01:58.050> coherent<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.220> treatment<00:01:59.550> times

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
to turn coherent so the treatment times

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.570 
to turn coherent so the treatment times
are<00:01:59.910> about<00:02:00.030> three<00:02:00.240> times<00:02:00.420> longer<00:02:01.130> but<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.310> nice

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
are about three times longer but a nice

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.050 
are about three times longer but a nice
thing<00:02:02.760> about<00:02:02.790> LED<00:02:03.330> is<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:04.670> for<00:02:05.670> example<00:02:05.970> this

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
thing about LED is that for example this

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.210 
thing about LED is that for example this
is<00:02:06.210> my<00:02:06.240> red<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.780> infrared<00:02:06.960> head<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.620> can<00:02:08.010> switch

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
is my red and infrared head I can switch

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.070 
is my red and infrared head I can switch
the<00:02:08.400> head<00:02:08.520> out<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.000> now<00:02:09.180> I<00:02:09.210> can<00:02:09.450> use<00:02:09.480> blue<00:02:09.869> for

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
the head out and now I can use blue for

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.040 
the head out and now I can use blue for
treating<00:02:10.500> acne<00:02:10.650> so<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.490> get<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
treating acne so you get that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.600 
treating acne so you get that
flexibility<00:02:13.050> with<00:02:13.260> LED<00:02:13.740> that<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.250> don't<00:02:14.430> get

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
flexibility with LED that you don't get

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.400 
flexibility with LED that you don't get
with<00:02:14.760> lasers<00:02:15.150> we<00:02:15.570> like<00:02:15.720> them<00:02:15.870> both<00:02:16.020> they're

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
with lasers we like them both they're

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.130
