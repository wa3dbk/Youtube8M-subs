using that should be a sign that

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.280 
using that should be a sign that
someone's<00:03:04.299> coming<00:03:04.570> up<00:03:04.660> behind<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:05.079> and<00:03:05.110> you

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
something stupid like that because

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.749 
something stupid like that because
that's<00:05:29.380> just<00:05:29.530> absolutely<00:05:29.860> ridiculous<00:05:30.550> I

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 
that's just absolutely ridiculous I

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.640 
that's just absolutely ridiculous I
can't<00:05:31.300> believe<00:05:31.389> Infinity<00:05:31.930> Ward<00:05:32.139> hasn't<00:05:32.530> like

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
can't believe Infinity Ward hasn't like

can't believe Infinity Ward hasn't like
nerf<00:05:33.009> that<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:33.490> Mike<00:05:33.729> made<00:05:34.000> it<00:05:34.150> so<00:05:34.270> that<00:05:34.300> your

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
nerf that and Mike made it so that your

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:36.270 
nerf that and Mike made it so that your
care<00:05:34.780> packages<00:05:35.319> can<00:05:35.500> only<00:05:35.710> get<00:05:36.009> killstreaks

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
care packages can only get killstreaks

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.010 
care packages can only get killstreaks
up<00:05:36.789> to<00:05:37.030> like<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.479> don't<00:05:38.169> know<00:05:38.380> seven<00:05:38.979> like<00:05:39.610> is

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
up to like I don't know seven like is

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.850 
up to like I don't know seven like is
reasonably<00:05:41.020> like<00:05:41.259> it<00:05:41.409> doesn't<00:05:41.740> make<00:05:41.800> any

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
reasonably like it doesn't make any

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.550 
reasonably like it doesn't make any
sense<00:05:42.190> like<00:05:42.460> you<00:05:42.639> get<00:05:42.789> four<00:05:43.180> kills<00:05:43.539> and<00:05:43.900> then

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
sense like you get four kills and then

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.339 
sense like you get four kills and then
you're<00:05:44.830> awarded<00:05:45.250> in<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.599> ac-130<00:05:46.599> potentially

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
you're awarded in the ac-130 potentially

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.980 
you're awarded in the ac-130 potentially
it's<00:05:47.560> just<00:05:47.680> absolutely<00:05:48.280> crazy<00:05:48.810> also<00:05:49.810> on<00:05:49.960> that

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
it's just absolutely crazy also on that

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.020 
it's just absolutely crazy also on that
