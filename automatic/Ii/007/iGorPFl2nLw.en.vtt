to learn how to have a smooth and fluid

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.669 
to learn how to have a smooth and fluid
service<00:00:12.960> motion<00:00:13.230> because<00:00:13.440> that's<00:00:13.590> so

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
service motion because that's so

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.560 
service motion because that's so
important<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.429> smoother<00:00:15.150> your<00:00:15.299> service

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
important the smoother your service

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.760 
important the smoother your service
motion<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.049> be<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.470> better<00:00:16.619> your

so like I was saying do you have trouble

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.060 
so like I was saying do you have trouble
with<00:00:32.020> your<00:00:32.140> service<00:00:32.410> motion<00:00:32.650> is<00:00:32.770> it<00:00:32.920> like

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
with your service motion is it like

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.620 
with your service motion is it like
jerky<00:00:33.520> and<00:00:33.730> you<00:00:33.820> can't<00:00:34.030> figure<00:00:34.210> it<00:00:34.330> out

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
jerky and you can't figure it out

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.790 
jerky and you can't figure it out
well<00:00:34.870> in<00:00:35.020> this<00:00:35.110> video<00:00:35.350> I'm<00:00:35.500> going<00:00:35.590> to<00:00:35.680> show<00:00:35.770> you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
well in this video I'm going to show you

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.369 
well in this video I'm going to show you
a<00:00:35.920> simple<00:00:36.250> way<00:00:36.400> to<00:00:36.670> train<00:00:37.239> yourself<00:00:38.080> to<00:00:38.140> have<00:00:38.290> a

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
a simple way to train yourself to have a

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.410 
a simple way to train yourself to have a
better<00:00:38.530> service<00:00:39.129> motion<00:00:39.430> so<00:00:39.940> what<00:00:40.210> is<00:00:40.300> that

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
better service motion so what is that

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.150 
better service motion so what is that
way<00:00:40.540> well<00:00:41.230> we<00:00:41.379> don't<00:00:41.530> need<00:00:41.770> this<00:00:42.989> mu<00:00:43.989> D<00:00:44.170> is<00:00:44.440> this

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
way well we don't need this mu D is this

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.920 
way well we don't need this mu D is this
so<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:47.320> easiest<00:00:47.650> way<00:00:47.830> to<00:00:47.860> train<00:00:48.370> your<00:00:48.930> service

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
so the easiest way to train your service

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.259 
so the easiest way to train your service
motion<00:00:50.230> is<00:00:50.410> just<00:00:50.620> by<00:00:51.280> learning<00:00:51.519> how<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:52.000> throw

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
motion is just by learning how to throw

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.689 
motion is just by learning how to throw
now<00:00:52.690> why<00:00:52.840> is<00:00:52.900> this<00:00:53.050> important<00:00:53.620> you<00:00:54.370> know<00:00:54.460> a<00:00:54.489> lot

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
now why is this important you know a lot

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:55.619 
now why is this important you know a lot
of<00:00:54.730> times<00:00:54.910> maybe<00:00:55.180> you've<00:00:55.390> heard<00:00:55.510> it<00:00:55.600> before

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
of times maybe you've heard it before

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.600 
of times maybe you've heard it before
throwing<00:00:56.110> well<00:00:56.680> throw<00:00:57.160> it<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.370> throwing

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
throwing well throw it the throwing

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.070 
throwing well throw it the throwing
mechanics<00:00:57.940> are<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.180> exact<00:00:58.510> same<00:00:58.629> as<00:00:58.989> the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
mechanics are the exact same as the

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.630 
mechanics are the exact same as the
serve<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.680> only<00:00:59.860> difference<00:01:00.129> is<00:01:00.280> we're<00:01:00.550> gonna

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
serve the only difference is we're gonna

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.060 
serve the only difference is we're gonna
be<00:01:00.760> throwing<00:01:01.000> up<00:01:01.239> okay<00:01:01.960> many<00:01:02.440> of<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.739> major

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
be throwing up okay many of the major

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.710 
be throwing up okay many of the major
components<00:01:03.579> of<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.879> throwing<00:01:04.330> mechanics

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
components of the throwing mechanics

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.690 
components of the throwing mechanics
like<00:01:05.020> the<00:01:05.229> wind<00:01:05.530> up<00:01:05.800> you're<00:01:06.070> seeing<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.430> coil

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
like the wind up you're seeing the coil

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.760 
like the wind up you're seeing the coil
you're<00:01:07.149> seeing<00:01:07.330> my<00:01:07.450> left<00:01:07.720> arm<00:01:07.990> being<00:01:08.229> active

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
you're seeing my left arm being active

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.340 
you're seeing my left arm being active
and<00:01:08.920> then<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.430> see<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.729> elbow<00:01:09.880> up<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.570> the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
and then you see the elbow up and the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.410 
and then you see the elbow up and the
whip<00:01:11.560> effect<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:12.100> bringing<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.759> shoulders

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
whip effect of bringing the shoulders

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.120 
whip effect of bringing the shoulders
around<00:01:13.570> that's<00:01:14.020> gonna<00:01:14.140> be<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.440> exact<00:01:14.800> same

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
around that's gonna be the exact same

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.279 
around that's gonna be the exact same
thing<00:01:15.550> that<00:01:15.729> you<00:01:15.880> need<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.240> use<00:01:16.690> in<00:01:16.930> your<00:01:17.050> serve

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
thing that you need to use in your serve

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.190 
thing that you need to use in your serve
so<00:01:17.979> what<00:01:18.850> do<00:01:18.910> we<00:01:18.970> need<00:01:19.119> to<00:01:19.240> do<00:01:19.360> well<00:01:19.720> we<00:01:19.930> really

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
so what do we need to do well we really

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.690 
so what do we need to do well we really
need<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.440> focus<00:01:20.590> on<00:01:20.860> learning<00:01:21.160> how<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.430> throw

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
need to focus on learning how to throw

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.550 
need to focus on learning how to throw
and<00:01:22.119> then<00:01:22.720> just<00:01:22.899> putting<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.170> racquet<00:01:23.410> in<00:01:23.470> our

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
and then just putting the racquet in our

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.100 
and then just putting the racquet in our
hand<00:01:23.710> okay<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:24.580> I'm<00:01:24.940> gonna<00:01:25.149> go<00:01:25.330> over<00:01:25.479> some<00:01:26.080> of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
hand okay so I'm gonna go over some of

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.290 
hand okay so I'm gonna go over some of
what<00:01:26.410> I<00:01:26.440> think<00:01:26.560> are<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.039> major<00:01:27.310> keys<00:01:27.910> to

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
what I think are the major keys to

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.210 
what I think are the major keys to
throwing<00:01:28.630> now<00:01:28.960> let<00:01:29.740> me<00:01:29.830> give<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.039> the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
throwing now let me give you the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.940 
throwing now let me give you the
disclaimer<00:01:30.580> I<00:01:30.880> am<00:01:31.090> NOT<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.479> baseball<00:01:31.960> coach<00:01:32.110> I

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
have not well I did play baseball but I

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:36.990 
have not well I did play baseball but I
wasn't<00:01:35.860> like<00:01:36.009> a<00:01:36.039> pitcher<00:01:36.399> anything<00:01:36.670> I<00:01:36.789> pitched

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
for a little bit that was like minor

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.650 
for a little bit that was like minor
leagues<00:01:38.500> but<00:01:38.619> but<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.520> point<00:01:39.700> is<00:01:39.880> some<00:01:40.420> major

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
leagues but but the point is some major

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.680 
leagues but but the point is some major
things<00:01:40.780> I<00:01:41.170> I<00:01:41.410> see<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.660> comparison<00:01:43.660> between

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
things I I see the comparison between

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.260 
things I I see the comparison between
the<00:01:44.069> throwing<00:01:45.069> action<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.940> serving

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
the throwing action and the serving

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.719 
the throwing action and the serving
action<00:01:46.690> I<00:01:47.349> think<00:01:47.679> that<00:01:48.099> will<00:01:48.220> really<00:01:48.250> help<00:01:48.580> you

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
action I think that will really help you

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.550 
action I think that will really help you
out<00:01:48.880> so<00:01:49.360> first<00:01:49.599> of<00:01:49.750> all<00:01:49.840> we<00:01:50.229> want<00:01:50.440> to<00:01:50.470> be

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
out so first of all we want to be

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.139 
out so first of all we want to be
relaxed<00:01:51.039> okay<00:01:51.369> because<00:01:51.580> I<00:01:51.729> see<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.910> lot<00:01:51.970> of

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
relaxed okay because I see a lot of

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.359 
relaxed okay because I see a lot of
times<00:01:52.360> weird<00:01:52.569> way<00:01:52.720> too<00:01:52.780> stiff<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.440> the

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
times weird way too stiff and the

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.859 
times weird way too stiff and the
stiffer<00:01:54.880> you<00:01:55.060> are<00:01:55.209> the<00:01:55.420> more<00:01:55.599> your<00:01:55.720> muscles

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
stiffer you are the more your muscles

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.779 
stiffer you are the more your muscles
going<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.319> contract<00:01:57.160> and<00:01:57.399> you're<00:01:57.520> not<00:01:57.640> going

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
going to contract and you're not going

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.040 
going to contract and you're not going
to<00:01:57.849> be<00:01:57.910> able<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.090> have<00:01:58.209> that<00:01:58.330> nice<00:01:58.630> fluid

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
to be able to have that nice fluid

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.770 
to be able to have that nice fluid
motion<00:01:59.349> okay<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:00.729> what<00:02:01.390> do<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.539> think<00:02:01.569> about

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
motion okay so what do I think about

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.270 
motion okay so what do I think about
when<00:02:02.050> I'm<00:02:02.140> throwing<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:02.830> I'm<00:02:02.920> throwing<00:02:03.160> I

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
when I'm throwing and I'm throwing I

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.949 
when I'm throwing and I'm throwing I
think<00:02:03.429> about<00:02:03.580> having<00:02:03.819> a<00:02:03.880> nice<00:02:04.030> upright<00:02:04.660> chest

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
think about having a nice upright chest

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.540 
think about having a nice upright chest
and<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.470> first<00:02:05.739> move<00:02:05.979> I'm<00:02:06.099> going<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.310> make<00:02:06.429> is

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
and the first move I'm going to make is

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.240 
and the first move I'm going to make is
I'm<00:02:06.910> going<00:02:07.000> to<00:02:07.060> coil<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:07.630> take<00:02:07.929> the<00:02:08.289> ball<00:02:09.009> back

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
I'm going to coil and take the ball back

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.059 
I'm going to coil and take the ball back
so<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.489> can<00:02:09.610> throw<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:09.940> okay<00:02:10.450> so<00:02:10.920> preference<00:02:11.920> or

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
so I can throw it okay so preference or

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.860 
so I can throw it okay so preference or
not<00:02:12.489> preference<00:02:12.910> but<00:02:13.090> basically<00:02:13.480> what<00:02:13.750> I

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
not preference but basically what I

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.990 
not preference but basically what I
don't<00:02:14.200> want<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.500> see<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.709> do<00:02:14.800> is<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.130> okay

point<00:02:24.040> I'm<00:02:24.280> going<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.550> turn<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.000> take<00:02:25.390> the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
point I'm going to turn and take the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.479 
point I'm going to turn and take the
racket<00:02:25.720> back<00:02:25.900> now<00:02:26.230> two<00:02:26.920> things<00:02:27.069> I'm<00:02:27.459> doing

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
racket back now two things I'm doing

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.530 
racket back now two things I'm doing
there<00:02:27.970> I've<00:02:28.180> coiled<00:02:29.110> okay<00:02:29.950> my<00:02:30.220> trunk<00:02:30.610> has<00:02:31.480> a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
there I've coiled okay my trunk has a

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.720 
there I've coiled okay my trunk has a
source<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:31.930> power<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.379> also<00:02:32.890> I've<00:02:33.099> got<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
source of power and also I've got the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.260 
source of power and also I've got the
ball<00:02:34.660> ready<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.260> throw<00:02:35.500> my<00:02:35.739> elbows<00:02:36.280> up<00:02:36.520> now<00:02:37.030> I

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
ball ready to throw my elbows up now I

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.610 
ball ready to throw my elbows up now I
personally<00:02:37.870> think<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.140> reason<00:02:38.380> why<00:02:38.470> your

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
personally think the reason why your

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.830 
personally think the reason why your
elbows<00:02:38.980> up<00:02:39.130> is<00:02:39.280> because<00:02:39.760> it'll<00:02:40.570> match<00:02:40.810> your

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
elbows up is because it'll match your

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.180 
elbows up is because it'll match your
other<00:02:41.170> elbow<00:02:41.380> okay

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
other elbow okay

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.920 
other elbow okay
like<00:02:42.310> like<00:02:42.970> when<00:02:43.210> you're<00:02:43.330> like<00:02:43.540> flexing

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
like like when you're like flexing

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.050 
like like when you're like flexing
position<00:02:44.320> well<00:02:44.800> there's<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.490> reason<00:02:45.670> for<00:02:45.850> that

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
position well there's a reason for that

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.020 
position well there's a reason for that
if<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.930> look<00:02:47.110> at<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.260> bouncing<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.490> person<00:02:48.940> who

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
if you look at a bouncing a person who

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.330 
if you look at a bouncing a person who
bounces<00:02:49.480> on<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.720> tightrope<00:02:50.080> tight<00:02:50.680> rope<00:02:51.070> Walker

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
bounces on a tightrope tight rope Walker

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.520 
bounces on a tightrope tight rope Walker
I'm<00:02:51.790> really<00:02:52.300> losing<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.660> today<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.410> way

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
I'm really losing it today but the way

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.620 
I'm really losing it today but the way
their<00:02:53.680> arms<00:02:53.980> move<00:02:54.190> they're<00:02:54.520> together<00:02:54.910> same

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
their arms move they're together same

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.300 
their arms move they're together same
thing<00:02:55.840> as<00:02:55.960> our<00:02:56.080> elbow<00:02:56.410> now<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.980> reason<00:02:57.220> why

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
thing as our elbow now the reason why

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.860 
thing as our elbow now the reason why
this<00:02:57.370> is<00:02:57.520> important<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.300> because<00:02:58.450> when<00:02:58.750> this

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
this is important is because when this

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.540 
this is important is because when this
arm<00:02:59.140> moves<00:02:59.440> guess<00:02:59.710> what<00:02:59.890> it's<00:03:00.100> going<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.370> pull

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
arm moves guess what it's going to pull

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.970 
arm moves guess what it's going to pull
this<00:03:00.700> arm<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:01.570> if<00:03:01.930> we're<00:03:02.140> here<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.710> we're

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
this arm so if we're here and we're

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.290 
this arm so if we're here and we're
using<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.310> left<00:03:03.610> arm<00:03:03.820> which<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.000> want<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.180> talk

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
using that left arm which I want to talk

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.490 
using that left arm which I want to talk
about<00:03:04.390> in<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.600> second<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:04.960> actually<00:03:05.110> pull<00:03:05.470> down

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
about in a second to actually pull down

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.680 
about in a second to actually pull down
guess<00:03:06.100> what<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.640> actually<00:03:06.880> accelerates

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
guess what this actually accelerates

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.370 
guess what this actually accelerates
this<00:03:08.350> arm<00:03:08.680> through<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.670> throw<00:03:10.540> which<00:03:11.050> will<00:03:11.230> be

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
this arm through the throw which will be

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.470 
this arm through the throw which will be

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
relax you're gonna have lag so if I

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.780 
relax you're gonna have lag so if I
relax<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.680> you're<00:03:56.950> gonna<00:03:57.040> feel<00:03:57.310> how<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.520> arm

relax and you're gonna feel how the arm

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.970 
relax and you're gonna feel how the arm
goes<00:03:58.030> back<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.450> then<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:58.900> catapults<00:03:59.620> forward

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
goes back and then it catapults forward

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.830

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
motion this is the way to do it you're

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.460 
motion this is the way to do it you're
gonna<00:04:57.729> get<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.090> lot<00:04:58.270> more<00:04:58.300> power<00:04:58.659> and<00:04:59.169> your

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
gonna get a lot more power and your

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.649 
gonna get a lot more power and your
motions<00:04:59.979> gonna<00:05:00.129> be<00:05:00.220> a<00:05:00.250> lot<00:05:00.430> more<00:05:00.460> fluid<00:05:01.240> so<00:05:01.629> I

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
motions gonna be a lot more fluid so I
