00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.570
 good youtube friends welcome from 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.330
 new to my channel and here I bring you a 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.680
 gameplay with the mp 7 we are here in the 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.720
 fourth episode of rock already had 97 for 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.390
 get this golden camouflage that 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.250
 so much good desire the truth is that it is the 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.630
 first time I use in this 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:31.060
 prestige the emt the mp7 pencil that 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.920
 used in the game in this prestige 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.650
 exactly at mpn 7 since in 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.650
 previous prestigious did not have 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.830
 because I had not bought a chip that 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.470
 allowed me to use it from level 4 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.449
 which is where they give us in creating classes 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.750
 ok then what I did was buy 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:53.140
 with a prestigious chip I bought this 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.449
 weapon that is an absolute barbarity and 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.769
 taking advantage of that when starting the prestige 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.730
 I did this series of good 97 golf time 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.640
 I hope you like it 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.180
 the episode and I have you that is a 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.970
 split the truth the so-called aggressive 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.040
 with the mete 7 and what 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.400
 as you will see very very released in this 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.340
 game I go to sack it's almost as if 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.500
 I was playing competitive and will play 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.580
 with the sub-machine gun or the lines 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.220
 ahead because the truth of time in 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:34.000
 when I like to go crazy and get me out 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:37.100
 good clicks and today the topic to be discussed is 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.170
 tactical or predetermined to the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.840
 Button configuration is tactical 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.000
 default to put myself in the in the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.880
 comments to those who are watching this 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.560
 in which setting you prefer and why 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.530
 ok I'll tell you the story that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.900
 I have with these configurations since 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.420
 I'm pretty inaccurate right now in 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.420
 the replay I'm taking the tactics and 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.750
 you are going to see what it is to bring this 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.940
 configuration since I do some spurts 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.940
 to hallucinate I already find enemies 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.080
 23 enemies in front I have all of 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.650
 lose if I had had the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.170
 predetermined they would have killed me 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.420
 but by taking the tactic you see what 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.530
 you see that I am going to get rid of it and more if 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.100
 I'm going to kill and I'm going to do 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.600
 I'm going to make a show a show is what 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.760
 what will I do and good 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.520
 later I will tell you when that 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.430
 part and I will try to comment with all 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.560
 the energy that characterizes me and how 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.310
 you see here I am carrying the gusts of 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.170
 predator and reaper and good flow there 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.000
 you see the disadvantage of carrying 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.010
 tactical configuration and that is in a one 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.610
 against one as the enemy would say the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.620
 knife 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.110
 date for lost as you have the connection 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.510
 a little bit of a leak since he stabbed but 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.110
 well I think that 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.819
 the default advantage 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.459
 and the advantage of tactical want to win the 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.829
 advantages and lose the cons of the 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.489
 predetermined therefore I believe and I 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.349
 I remain with the tactics I have two 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.790
 weeks with the tactic vale had played 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.340
 throughout my life I started in the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.579
 point 4 had played during all my 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.579
 lifetime 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.110
 to all with the configuration 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.270
 predetermined and in this short so a 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.280
 first time that it has changed and that has 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.200
 maintained is worth watching look here h is 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.450
 when it was spoken dances comes to me one wine 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.190
 another tail I bend down with the r3 here I 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.550
 find another I crouch with the r3 what 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.170
 get kill me here another one I duck with 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.360
 the r3 and are a real barbarity 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.340
 you in r3 here for example I ducked 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.350
 ones because I crouched down I did not have to 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.200
 have spent but good faithful but the 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.810
 granada and I get the page low but here 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.000
 You will see what happens 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.069
 granada killed him I come back 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.659
 but nothing good happens friends to what 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.880
 We went tactical configuration 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.610
 I'll tell you a little bit by default 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.810
 In what situations would you like the 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.100
 tactical configuration of the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.200
 normally default 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.940
 a few games small maps 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.000
 I would recommend a configuration 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.650
 tactics since around the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.100
 corners you can usually find 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.660
 to an enemy in this case then 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.760
 you pretend you all stab it you know 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.320
 stabbing him but there's the trick what 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.930
 what you have to do is when doubles 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.080
 a corner does not double it is on the side 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.750
 port but for when you see a corner 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.710
 and two on the side if for example you want 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.830
 turn to the right 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.940
 so go left so that 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.680
 yes not open the corner 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.750
 I'm not the reach of the knife 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.130
 rival to get is with this then 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.979
 nothing else bend injuries you find 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.380
 the rival you crouch the opponent will tend to 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.780
 stabbing you may not come or 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.970
 Do not get a knife and if you do not get a knife 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.700
 nothing else to crouch you will be all crazy 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.380
 the rival and you will get to kill him since 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.270
 you will be reached this comes in handy 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.070
 for example when there are two enemies worth 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.090
 here he has killed me because he came 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.580
 the right but if it comes for example 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.060
 three enemies and you go with that function 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.570
 tactics you possibly bend over 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.030
 put to shoot as possessed how 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.470
 are the three firing possibly 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.270
 hit one 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.670
 Both of you like a lot and you'll hit a couple 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.230
 of bullets but you when ducking 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.810
 you will get to dodge them and if you are 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.250
 quick you will get to kill all three in 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.200
 change how you have the configuration 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.610
 default date for lost because 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.640
 they will know where you are do not do 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.280
 you will do all the bullets or 90% will go to 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.410
 for you and as you do not get tired with the 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.880
 circle fast fast friend date by 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.200
 lost since you will die and that's why I believe 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.120
 which is the main reason why 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.730
 I'm carrying right now right now 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.760
 now it not now the 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.980
 Tactical configuration I recommend you 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.070
 that you try it on previous call of 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.980
 duty life but I tell you once that the 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.650
 mold warfare2 last nothing even an hour and 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.020
 I went back will change the default because 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.780
 I did not do it with her but now I'm 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.370
 doing with her especially the most 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.200
 I started to get more more since I got the 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.520
 he has put you I mean it totally seriously 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.140
 that is, since I put this 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.960
 I'm getting worse, I do not know if 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.570
 it will be chance or the one but now that 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.560
 I already have the habit of nothing else to return 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.500
 the corner 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.620
 it served an enemy to duck me even if 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.590
 on your back stooping since that gives you 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.270
 many advantages also because if this one 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.040
 is a cornice for example and you go out to 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.350
 outdoors and while shooting up 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.300
 porridge possibly if the rival is 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.980
 hearing bullets and turn around and you 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.720
 you're going to see you instead 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.840
 shoot and 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.030
 and crouch the opponent will turn around 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.030
 imagine that he hears bullets even if he has 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.250
 silencer may not see you for 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.780
 So you will give a lot of advantage to 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:58.830
 the time of 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:01.620
 make a long streak is a low 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.570
 which you may not have in 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.250
 account but are factors of the game 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.370
 quite small that make you 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.110
 you get big games and that's what 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.870
 I'm commenting on the plan to duck 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.430
 now I bend over here and now I bend over 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.350
 are already factors that will make you 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.450
 make good matches good these 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.580
 they are my advice you can have them not 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:24.240
 you can follow them but well here we are 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.800
 in another video that is running out 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.150
 same here you are looking down to 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.910
 final and good friends I hope that I have 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.440
 liked to give lake and favorites and about 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.720
 all if you are not subscribed to subscribe 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.070
