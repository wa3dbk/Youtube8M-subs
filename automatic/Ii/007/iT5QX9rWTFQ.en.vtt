we're gonna slice a cucumber using the

we're gonna slice a cucumber using the
slicing<00:00:46.590> blade<00:00:47.270> first<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.450> put<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.660> shaft<00:00:49.050> in

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
slicing blade first we put the shaft in

slicing blade goes on top and we put the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
slicing blade goes on top and we put the
cover<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:59.460> don't<00:00:59.579> lock<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.030> cover<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
cover on we don't lock the cover the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.810 
cover on we don't lock the cover the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
when I locked the cover the machine

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.240 
when I locked the cover the machine
unexpectedly<00:01:12.030> turned<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.040> didn't<00:01:14.040> know

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
unexpectedly turned on I didn't know

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.670 
unexpectedly turned on I didn't know
that<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> machine<00:01:14.909> was<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.930> off<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
that the machine was on the off and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.820 
that the machine was on the off and
pulse<00:01:17.670> our<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.479> button<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.590> should

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
pulse our one button they should

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.160 
pulse our one button they should
actually<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.460> two<00:01:20.759> separate<00:01:21.390> buttons<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
actually be two separate buttons and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.890 
actually be two separate buttons and
there's<00:01:22.830> no<00:01:22.979> indicator<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.970> light<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.540> tell<00:01:24.750> me

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
there's no indicator or light to tell me

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.070 
there's no indicator or light to tell me
that<00:01:25.049> if<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.380> machine<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.250> off<00:01:27.080> this

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
that if the machine is on or off this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.950 
that if the machine is on or off this
cucumber<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.799> slim<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.520> will<00:01:30.000> fit<00:01:30.240> into<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
cucumber is slim and will fit into the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.359 
cucumber is slim and will fit into the
feeder<00:01:31.290> hole<00:01:32.570> my<00:01:33.570> second<00:01:34.049> cucumber<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.799> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
feeder hole my second cucumber is a

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.770 
feeder hole my second cucumber is a
little<00:01:35.759> bit<00:01:35.909> fatter<00:01:36.540> around<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> edge<00:01:37.259> and

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
little bit fatter around the edge and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.260 
little bit fatter around the edge and
gets<00:01:39.780> stuck<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.500> tube<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.610> had<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.119> cut

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
gets stuck in the tube so I had to cut

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.179 
gets stuck in the tube so I had to cut
it<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.509> half<00:01:45.110> okay<00:01:46.110> I'm<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> little<00:01:46.619> afraid<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
it in half okay I'm a little afraid to

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.280 
it in half okay I'm a little afraid to
use<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.520> machine<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:48.659> gonna<00:01:48.810> brave<00:01:49.110> it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
use this machine but I'm gonna brave it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:02:02.600 
use this machine but I'm gonna brave it
and<00:01:49.470> slice<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.950> cucumber

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.300 

okay<00:02:03.610> let's<00:02:03.850> see<00:02:04.090> how<00:02:04.360> well<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.170> sliced<00:02:08.310> it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
okay let's see how well the sliced it

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.009 
okay let's see how well the sliced it
did<00:02:09.519> a<00:02:09.550> decent<00:02:10.269> job<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:13.150> can<00:02:13.299> see<00:02:13.510> their<00:02:13.720> slice

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
did a decent job you can see their slice

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.559 
did a decent job you can see their slice
pretty<00:02:14.440> thinly<00:02:17.129> so<00:02:18.129> I've<00:02:18.220> reversed<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:18.940> disc

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
pretty thinly so I've reversed this disc

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.380 
pretty thinly so I've reversed this disc
and<00:02:19.900> now<00:02:20.049> it's<00:02:20.379> on<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.799> shredding<00:02:21.459> side<00:02:21.700> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
and now it's on the shredding side the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:39.140 
and now it's on the shredding side the
tube<00:02:22.750> will<00:02:23.049> fit<00:02:23.260> about<00:02:23.500> three<00:02:23.830> medium<00:02:24.310> carrots

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.000 

so<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.209> see<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.629> carrots<00:02:41.049> are<00:02:41.319> pretty<00:02:41.709> nicely

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
so you see the carrots are pretty nicely

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.640 
so you see the carrots are pretty nicely
shredded<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.010> cut<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> cabbage<00:02:45.819> into<00:02:45.849> about

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
shredded so I cut the cabbage into about

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.410 
shredded so I cut the cabbage into about
1<00:02:47.650> inch<00:02:47.859> thick<00:02:48.189> slices<00:02:48.579> because<00:02:49.090> that's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
1 inch thick slices because that's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.640 
1 inch thick slices because that's
what's<00:02:49.629> going<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.870> fit<00:02:50.170> into<00:02:50.439> the<00:02:51.280> feed<00:02:51.849> tube

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
what's going to fit into the feed tube

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:06.750 
what's going to fit into the feed tube
so<00:02:53.650> let's<00:02:53.859> shred<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.370> cabbage<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.579> can

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
so let's shred the cabbage so you can

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.030 
so let's shred the cabbage so you can
see<00:03:06.939> on<00:03:07.090> top<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.750> blade<00:03:07.989> there's<00:03:08.739> big

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
see on top of the blade there's big

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.390 
see on top of the blade there's big
pieces<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.519> cabbage<00:03:10.209> if<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.959> keep<00:03:11.200> pulsing<00:03:11.530> it

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
pieces of cabbage if you keep pulsing it

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.470 
pieces of cabbage if you keep pulsing it
might<00:03:12.760> chop<00:03:13.659> it<00:03:13.840> into<00:03:13.989> smaller<00:03:14.409> pieces<00:03:14.769> but

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
might chop it into smaller pieces but

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.729 
might chop it into smaller pieces but
