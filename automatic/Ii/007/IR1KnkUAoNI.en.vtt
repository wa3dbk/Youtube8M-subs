00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.980
 hello today I will stay you 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.110
 how to change the state of mind 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.860
 so first we will use a line 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.519
 hexagonal one came series in the morning 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.519
 right here 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.470
 he does not fight too tight 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.759
 then these are pieces not do well 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.059
 swimming our not escaped from pieces 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.059
 because these are ten of the small pieces 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:41.210
 like this one 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:44.329
 so we have two spaces one space to one 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.719
 other space succeeded since the screw there 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:52.309
 must be careful I will do 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:57.739
 like this next for this model if 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.960
 it's possible to charge a little less 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.000
 wasteful and less expensive 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.250
 then we want to keep the snow brighten 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.020
 the direction to insert the pie then 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:15.220
 for the sincere haunting each other 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.220
 selection like this 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:51.550
 we will leave until the francs and that's it 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.550
 That's it 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:14.690
 here is the excess is sometimes a 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:31.700
 little more is it doing it alone 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:36.860
 have to put words here after your 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:41.110
 Biennial earnings with the agent so 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.110
 to avoid animating the tires 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:57.720
 and that's if we had to loosen the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.080
 fresh to remove the pie then we 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.830
 go one goes the tight ranks like these 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.170
 like how to dance performance of 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.740
 our videos 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:16.770
 and then in turn is here and that's it 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.540
 now and we are ready for that on 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.280
 the end thank you very much 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.610
 it was franÃ§ois dagenais for cyclists 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.610
 dead point
