00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.750
 hello to all well we we 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.180
 let 's meet again on guild wars 2 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.060
 and although this time it's the same 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.250
 present Basque we have already seen but 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.949
 rather to give you a little guide 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.930
 a little trick a little trick 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.619
 that we find in one in a city 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.030
 if I can say but very useful or even 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.969
 this one and although you will 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.129
 to access a small hidden chest under 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.910
 reserve to have said to make a little code 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.950
 so good here it's very ambiguous started 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.480
 what I explain to you 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.030
 so I'll show you next 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.829
 always on video so already what he 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.960
 must do well to be able to have 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.340
 access what the offer is what you 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.750
 know what you need to know is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.879
 that this box there and well by a good he 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 has a rest time that is apparently 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.930
 on world is over I do not know of 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.110
 how long but I know that I 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.220
 do I have access to the chest what 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.770
 gave me an item is jelly redone 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.240
 let's say half an hour later he 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.040
 was no longer then the door was 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.509
 closed etc 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.250
 so that's exactly where you find me 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.880
 in a small carriage where everything is beautiful 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.470
 so I 'm going to show you his up so at 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.710
 level of the place where we are 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.909
 find 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.580
 just like I'm going to show 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.850
 interface then we are precisely 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.290
 so to bastions of black hawks for 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.229
 to be a little more accurate so if I know 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.490
 so basing myself on how does that 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.250
 to the divine promontory 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.060
 while he is here so this game 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.619
 tell it's the lion's ark 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.409
 so the divine promontory he is here 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.420
 anarchic lion is here and when one 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.670
 goes down a little more diagonally 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.549
 we will end up at the bastions of 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.500
 black hawks that is right here 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.240
 we the place that interests us is 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.860
 precisely to sk still so the 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.610
 panorama that believed the lungs for 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.780
 the moment so far south and fine if I 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.720
 so come back or do I 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.220
 I'm down south, here we do it 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.310
 go see a small staircase in which I 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.130
 can go up so we'll go hop good 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.280
 this one we have the possibility and well 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.870
 just go there to ride and once 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.650
 that the euro is well apart from 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.540
 nice view well you also have the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.799
 possibility on that roof there and 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.510
 jump on the one opposite 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.900
 and there you arrive directly in front of 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.470
 this organ 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.569
 so you have a big north great organ 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.530
 on which you can compose well 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:42.120
 some starts with some notes of 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.120
 music that you can 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.860
 here's hearing here and when you have 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.280
 composed the right note you have a 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.510
 door that opens right here with good 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.940
 sure the chest you see there 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.760
 currently who when it's closed and 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.319
 well so lets have an item is 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.040
 precisely the item that I was listening to all 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.620
 at the time ccc that 's the focus 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.660
 elysed at the fifth level 27 it's not 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.830
 super interesting what I like and if 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.819
 is likely to be there thouars and 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.290
 then let's say it's an item that's 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.049
 totally free we need to know 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.599
 the code well it's pretty simple no 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:23.220
 but I lost my equipment 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:24.540
 so in town equipment here it is 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.860
 is possible that this door opens 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.650
 I will love you for the moment I have not 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.019
 found the little code to do I do not know 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.299
 if some know him they know 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.709
 that the door opens and and 40 famous 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.120
 code do not hesitate to put me in 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:42.180
 comment and and that's it 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.200
 so well to summarize in this 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.560
 city ​​where she will see you so 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.950
 exactly how does it work and there 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.840
 right now is that how about on 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.540
 the video you have the opportunity is 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.680
 good to see the code to do so that's 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.190
 you simply press the keys 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.870
 or directly to the fact that the mouse so 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.370
 ben respect you simply this 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.709
 code you also have the arrows at 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.840
 shut up so you'll see in 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.480
 started in the video the following to do 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.010
 it's pretty simple so here's this 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.250
 wish you a good viewing and then 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.109
