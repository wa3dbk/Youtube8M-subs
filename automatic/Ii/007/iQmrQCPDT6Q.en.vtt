00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.340
 I promised you how you can get 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.779
 absolutely all the badges and 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.490
 good as always usually do in this 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.169
 kind of guides I'll start from the 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.240
 beginning since I know it's a lot of people 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.919
 who has been playing for a short time 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.260
 there will be people who do not even know what they are 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.300
 the badges so good what are the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.920
 badges and what are they good for? 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.840
 the badges say they are like 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.430
 achievements or goals that we have to 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.649
 complete in animal crossing you live 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.270
 for the simple purpose of having all the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.550
 Extra animal content crossing you 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.100
 live completed is for example like the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.140
 museum what is the use of donating fish or 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.660
 insects in the museum simply because 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.510
 to have them well in that area and let's say 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.550
 that and incite them not to those that we play 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.519
 here we are that we do everything we fish or 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.530
 type of fish or insects not because 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.810
 badges is the same is made so that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.840
 we have something to have that 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.880
 complete some objectives which is 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.040
 very well and I have always supported this 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.060
 type of content in the games of 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.250
 nintendo so good 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.049
 I 'm going to explain we're going with the theme of 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.000
 the badges and also another of the 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.399
 things that you have to know is that the 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.950
 badges or will you give them a sea lion 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.500
 which is called helium, many of us will already have 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.020
 seen and you know that as soon as 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.880
 some of the objectives will appear in 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.310
 your people then when I speak to you 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.039
 exposed give the different badges 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.439
 that you will have them in your drp inside 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.000
 of the game so well you also have 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.590
 to know that if you complete some of 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.929
 the objectives and you see that the I do not 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.580
 appear do not worry because you can 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.619
 to appear the next day although 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.030
 normally there are no rainy days or 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.069
 storm so if you see that it does not appear 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.350
 that's why you do not worry about 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.450
 how much have you completed different 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.890
 objectives let's say that the me when 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.110
 appear there are times that will give us 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.179
 simply a badge can give you 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.429
 two or three in agreement so that's why not 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.500
 do you worry, just cinched in 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.200
 achieve the objectives that I am going to 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.060
 name now and so little by little 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.700
 could help you complete is 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.590
 your animal crossing new live little to 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.799
 little so good the subject of the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.180
 badges you have to know that there are 24 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.260
 badges to get but not 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.180
 However, just like the tools 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.430
 let's say that the badges also 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.680
 They have their normal or copper model 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.629
 your silver model and your gold model 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.159
 so I'll explain first what 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.370
 objectives you have to complete for 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.959
 get the 24 copper badges and 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.060
