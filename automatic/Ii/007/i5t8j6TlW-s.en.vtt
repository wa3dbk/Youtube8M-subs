you're scared to gun pressed my up the
part<00:01:40.680> because<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> little<00:01:41.220> guy<00:01:41.430> finds<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.909> hole

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
part because the little guy finds a hole

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.660 
part because the little guy finds a hole
in<00:01:42.299> offer<00:01:42.720> your<00:01:43.049> two<00:01:43.320> central<00:01:43.770> defenders<00:01:44.310> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
in offer your two central defenders and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.160 
in offer your two central defenders and
that's<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> problem<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.509> end<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:45.840> drop

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that's the problem so we end up drop

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.600 
that's the problem so we end up drop
dropping<00:01:46.530> one<00:01:46.710> off<00:01:46.920> trying<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.340> get<00:01:47.490> around

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
dropping one off trying to get around

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.830 
dropping one off trying to get around
him<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.060> best<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.329> can

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
him as best we can

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.359 
him as best we can
then<00:01:49.140> they've<00:01:49.320> got<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> spear<00:01:49.710> midfield<00:01:50.130> player

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
then they've got a spear midfield player

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.179 
then they've got a spear midfield player
this<00:01:51.180> system<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.750> been<00:01:51.960> an<00:01:52.079> acid<00:01:52.500> worked<00:01:52.799> they

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
this system was been an acid worked they

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.130 
this system was been an acid worked they
passed<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.729> ball<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.689> difficult

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
passed the ball and it's a difficult

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.719 
passed the ball and it's a difficult
system<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.530> play<00:01:55.799> against<00:01:56.130> we've<00:01:56.310> seen

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
system to play against we've seen

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.730 
system to play against we've seen
Chelsea<00:01:57.149> play<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.600> way<00:01:57.719> over<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> few<00:01:58.530> years

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
Chelsea play that way over the few years

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.800 
Chelsea play that way over the few years
it's<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.430> difficult<00:01:59.759> system<00:02:00.299> because<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.659> get

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
it's a difficult system because you get

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.230 
it's a difficult system because you get
out

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
out

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.030 
out
in<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.420> middle<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.750> park<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.229> they<00:02:02.680> did<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.009> so

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
in the middle of park and they did it so

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.340 
in the middle of park and they did it so
well<00:02:03.460> today<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.479> was<00:02:04.600> too<00:02:04.780> well<00:02:05.049> class

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
well today and it was too well class

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.990 
well today and it was too well class
performances<00:02:06.009> I<00:02:06.130> felt<00:02:06.399> from<00:02:06.549> their<00:02:06.729> players

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
performances I felt from their players

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.880 
performances I felt from their players
they<00:02:07.240> were<00:02:07.630> different<00:02:07.960> class<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.440> know<00:02:08.679> it's

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
they were different class I know it's

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.889 
they were different class I know it's
easy<00:02:09.039> in<00:02:09.220> hindsight<00:02:09.340> Harry<00:02:09.910> but<00:02:10.149> is<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:10.780> it

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
easy in hindsight Harry but is that it

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.990 
easy in hindsight Harry but is that it
should<00:02:11.739> England<00:02:12.130> play<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> system<00:02:12.790> more

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
should England play a system more

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.670 
should England play a system more
flexible<00:02:13.150> like<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:13.959> like<00:02:14.020> Chelsea<00:02:14.349> play

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
flexible like that and like Chelsea play

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.589 
flexible like that and like Chelsea play
like<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:14.920> Manchester<00:02:15.580> United<00:02:16.000> like<00:02:16.180> play

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
like that Manchester United like play

like that and that's what they're

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.580 
like that and that's what they're

players it's you know you've really we
we<00:02:44.709> were<00:02:44.860> stretched<00:02:45.220> playing<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.120> system<00:02:46.450> we

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
we were stretched playing the system we

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.970 
we were stretched playing the system we
played<00:02:46.840> our<00:02:47.019> felt<00:02:47.260> today<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:47.890> was

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
played our felt today and it was

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.430 
played our felt today and it was
difficult<00:02:48.160> but<00:02:48.610> as<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:49.540> say<00:02:49.690> full<00:02:49.930> credit<00:02:50.319> to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
difficult but as I say full credit to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.870 
difficult but as I say full credit to
them<00:02:50.560> they<00:02:50.709> really<00:02:50.950> were<00:02:51.220> good<00:02:51.489> there<00:02:51.640> was<00:02:51.700> no

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
them they really were good there was no

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.309 
them they really were good there was no
lack<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.120> effort<00:02:52.510> from<00:02:52.600> our<00:02:52.720> players<00:02:53.080> they

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
lack of effort from our players they

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.740 
lack of effort from our players they
gave<00:02:53.560> everything<00:02:53.980> but<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.519> just<00:02:54.850> felt<00:02:55.330> apart

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
gave everything but I just felt apart

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.080 
gave everything but I just felt apart
and<00:02:55.959> probably<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.260> 20<00:02:56.620> 20<00:02:56.980> 20<00:02:57.370> minutes<00:02:57.819> bill

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
and probably a 20 20 20 minutes bill

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.140 
and probably a 20 20 20 minutes bill
they<00:02:58.840> were<00:02:58.900> much<00:02:59.200> much<00:02:59.410> better<00:02:59.640> Harry

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
they were much much better Harry

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.940

Schweinsteiger<00:03:36.850> did<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.329> I<00:03:37.660> think<00:03:37.840> we've<00:03:37.959> got

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
Schweinsteiger did and I think we've got

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:39.449 
Schweinsteiger did and I think we've got
to<00:03:38.170> pass<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.590> ball<00:03:38.739> better<00:03:38.920> than<00:03:39.040> what<00:03:39.250> we<00:03:39.340> did

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
to pass the ball better than what we did

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
we've got to work on that and we've got

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.979 
we've got to work on that and we've got
to<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:40.870> think<00:03:41.200> that's<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.829> way<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:41.980> play<00:03:42.989> Harry

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989
