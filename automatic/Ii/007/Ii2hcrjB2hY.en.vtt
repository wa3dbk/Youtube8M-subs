00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
for the noise isolation it's a maximum

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.660 
for the noise isolation it's a maximum
of<00:02:15.500> under<00:02:16.500> 30<00:02:17.040> decibels<00:02:17.340> oh<00:02:19.400> one<00:02:20.400> thing<00:02:20.430> I

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
of under 30 decibels oh one thing I

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.490 
of under 30 decibels oh one thing I
forgot<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.910> mention<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.750> thing<00:02:22.050> isn't<00:02:22.319> just

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
wired in it's also wireless so it has a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.320 
wired in it's also wireless so it has a
battery<00:02:25.380> life<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.770> up<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.160> 40<00:02:26.670> hours<00:02:26.700> which<00:02:27.180> is

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
battery life of up to 40 hours which is

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.840 
battery life of up to 40 hours which is
actually<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.690> very<00:02:27.959> nice<00:02:28.230> life<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.430> battery

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
from a this zip up it's pretty hard to

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.800 
from a this zip up it's pretty hard to
get<00:03:12.480> say<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> hard<00:03:13.680> foam<00:03:14.100> but<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.519> it's<00:03:15.450> really

get say a hard foam but it it's really

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.990 
get say a hard foam but it it's really
tough<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.620> then<00:03:17.280> we<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.549> headset<00:03:17.730> all

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
tough and then we have the headset all

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.509 
tough and then we have the headset all
folded<00:03:18.359> up<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:19.470> if<00:03:19.650> we<00:03:19.799> go<00:03:19.950> ahead<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.310> pull

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
folded up so if we go ahead and pull

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.670 
folded up so if we go ahead and pull
this<00:03:20.670> oh<00:03:23.600> yeah<00:03:24.600> it's<00:03:24.750> not<00:03:24.900> Lisa<00:03:25.109> six<00:03:25.470> foot

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
this oh yeah it's not Lisa six foot

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.890 
this oh yeah it's not Lisa six foot
cable<00:03:26.060> it's<00:03:27.060> probably<00:03:27.329> even<00:03:27.450> more<00:03:27.660> it

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
cable it's probably even more it

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.569 
cable it's probably even more it
strapped<00:03:28.230> up<00:03:28.440> right<00:03:28.680> now<00:03:28.799> into<00:03:29.040> sputter<00:03:29.400> and

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
strapped up right now into sputter and

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.060 
strapped up right now into sputter and
on<00:03:29.880> one<00:03:30.120> spot<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:31.019> already<00:03:31.620> spanning

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
on one spot and it's already spanning

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.120 
on one spot and it's already spanning
almost<00:03:32.190> 6<00:03:32.519> feet<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:32.880> maybe<00:03:33.209> an<00:03:33.269> 8<00:03:33.390> foot<00:03:33.570> cable

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
almost 6 feet so maybe an 8 foot cable

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.430 
almost 6 feet so maybe an 8 foot cable
so<00:03:35.130> BAM<00:03:35.310> that's<00:03:35.519> how<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:35.700> unfold<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.350> folds<00:03:37.350> up

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
so BAM that's how you unfold it folds up

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.780 
so BAM that's how you unfold it folds up
like<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:39.299> fits<00:03:39.510> in<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.900> case<00:03:40.829> as<00:03:41.700> you

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
like that that fits in the case as you

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.479 
like that that fits in the case as you
can<00:03:41.940> see<00:03:42.060> it's<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.209> same<00:03:42.239> shape<00:03:46.160> okay<00:03:47.160> so<00:03:47.220> we

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
can see it's the same shape okay so we

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.580 
can see it's the same shape okay so we
also<00:03:47.609> have<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.940> microphone<00:03:48.450> which<00:03:49.230> is

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
also have the microphone which is

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.390 
also have the microphone which is
optional<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:51.859> unfold<00:03:52.859> our<00:03:52.980> headset<00:03:53.310> here<00:03:54.170> as
