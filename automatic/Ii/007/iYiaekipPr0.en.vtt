00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:05.230 
so the left hand is B flat and f-sharp

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:21.420 
so the left hand is B flat and f-sharp
does<00:00:05.710> these<00:00:05.950> two<00:00:06.189> keys<00:00:06.460> and<00:00:06.790> it's<00:00:07.060> just

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.710 

so<00:00:22.430> the<00:00:22.610> right<00:00:23.210> hand<00:00:23.240> after<00:00:23.810> you<00:00:24.440> go

I've<00:00:28.320> added<00:00:33.740> let's<00:00:34.740> be<00:00:34.980> flat

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.280 

and<00:00:40.020> then<00:00:40.770> C<00:00:41.280> sharp<00:00:42.110> see

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.790 

and<00:00:46.250> then<00:00:46.430> B<00:00:47.090> flat<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:50.210> then<00:00:50.270> these<00:00:50.870> two<00:00:51.200> so<00:00:51.560> C

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
and then B flat and then these two so C

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:05.130 
and then B flat and then these two so C
sharp<00:00:52.040> and<00:00:52.160> B<00:00:52.340> flat<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:56.750> then<00:00:56.809> C<00:00:57.559> sharp<00:00:57.950> and<00:00:58.309> F

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:14.830 

and<00:01:06.140> then<00:01:06.860> e<00:01:07.190> flat<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.450> B<00:01:11.800> twice<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.850> then

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
and then e flat and B twice and then

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.950 
and then e flat and B twice and then
back<00:01:15.050> to<00:01:16.180> B<00:01:17.180> flat<00:01:17.360> C<00:01:17.660> sharp<00:01:17.899> and<00:01:19.240> then<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:20.660> right

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
back to B flat C sharp and then so right

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:35.470 
back to B flat C sharp and then so right
now<00:01:21.110> we've<00:01:21.259> got

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.230 

and<00:01:36.480> while<00:01:36.660> holding<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:37.170> thumb<00:01:38.060> must<00:01:39.060> be

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and while holding your thumb must be

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.240 
and while holding your thumb must be
flat<00:01:39.450> with<00:01:39.690> your<00:01:39.720> thumb<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:41.370> to<00:01:41.550> this<00:01:41.730> one

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:54.640 

so<00:01:47.090> that's<00:01:47.300> appearance<00:01:48.640> b-flat<00:01:50.860> a-flat<00:01:53.650> F

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
so that's appearance b-flat a-flat F

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:05.230 
so that's appearance b-flat a-flat F
sharp

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.670 

she<00:02:06.170> got<00:02:06.380> twice<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:07.600> then<00:02:08.600> it<00:02:08.840> repeats<00:02:09.670> and

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
she got twice and then it repeats and

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.790 
she got twice and then it repeats and
then<00:02:12.680> for<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.220> part<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:15.050> other<00:02:15.110> part<00:02:15.230> yeah

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
then for the part the other part yeah

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.350 
then for the part the other part yeah
but<00:02:16.220> your<00:02:16.370> right<00:02:16.550> hand<00:02:16.850> is<00:02:16.940> playing<00:02:17.150> octaves

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
but your right hand is playing octaves

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.910 
but your right hand is playing octaves
so<00:02:17.810> it's<00:02:18.140> like<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.290> goes<00:02:24.470> b-flat

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
so it's like this so it goes b-flat

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.340 
so it's like this so it goes b-flat
octave<00:02:25.280> a-flat<00:02:25.640> octave<00:02:26.030> f-sharp<00:02:26.239> octave<00:02:27.080> E

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
octave a-flat octave f-sharp octave E

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:36.430 
octave a-flat octave f-sharp octave E
flat<00:02:27.739> octave<00:02:28.130> so<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:35.420> then<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.900> left<00:02:36.080> hand<00:02:36.290> is

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
flat octave so and then the left hand is

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.960 
flat octave so and then the left hand is
just<00:02:36.620> playing<00:02:36.830> five<00:02:37.069> notes

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.600 

and<00:02:43.970> all<00:02:44.300> together
