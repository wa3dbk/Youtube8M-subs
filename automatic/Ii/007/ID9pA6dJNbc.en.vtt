00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.269
 how about friends of the good medium well in 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.219
 this time we had to evaluate the 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.470
 motorola atrix ht de nextel and motorola and 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.820
 before showing them quickly what is 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.529
 what they have inside one of the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.230
 most interesting functions like how 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.420
 it's always the top part we have the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.670
 Connector for hearing aids 2.5 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.250
 millimeter the mini usb connector to the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.800
 computer that connects the current 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.070
 alternate and a mini hdmi connector for 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.079
 good to pass the videos or the images or 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 even the things that are seeing a 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.129
 high definition screen on the side 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.920
 then the upload button lower volume 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.710
 block the computer and from this other side 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.219
 has the slot for the both for the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.219
 zinc as for the expansion of the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.960
 memory card life card microsd in 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.870
 this moment the team has a memory 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.870
 internal of 8 gb and as I talked to them is 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.330
 a team that is distributed with an excel 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.850
 this one that is attributed with excel and that 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.100
 evidently uses micros and in the part 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.040
 front is gorilla glass has a thickness 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.650
 8.4 mm and in the back 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.259
 that has this little girl I marry 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.030
 remove this material is kevlar 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.490
 It is obviously much more resistant 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.470
 that any other device the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.729
 battery is not extract them fixed as already the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.350
 Most smartphones are 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.180
 coming but good is a team 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.759
 quite tough and pretty good 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.070
 designed on the outside then it's nothing 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.119
 clogging good the team is like 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.009
 any other 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.360
 good as they were distributed from the andres 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.429
 what emotions of the android we have 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.910
 evaluated lately runs with the 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.610
 Android version 4.2 and removes up 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.470
 the moment basically has all the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.690
 functions that we show you in versions 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.550
 previous are other equipment that comes 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.710
 being for the android widgets the 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.300
 possibility to create applications when 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.569
 will add applications like google 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.280
 now for good to see the information of 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.259
 your preferences or your content in 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.509
 real time what is being fed with 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.750
 your content or google applications 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.390
 has an 8 megapixel camera 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.400
 who records in full hd or take pictures 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.770
 Capture photos or record video in full HD 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.320
 and it has a 1.3 front camera 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.390
 megapixels for the subject of video calls 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.510
 the difference of this one is that it runs with 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:28.320
 a 1.5-GHz dual-core processor 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.930
 has a 4.5 inch screen is not 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:36.060
 full hd like I said in some other video 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.580
 hd of 720p by 1280 and good in addition to 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.680
 everything normal no bluetooth wi-fi gps 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.970
 integrated as you can see the truth is 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.130
 that applications run a lot 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.830
 well we got off the trigger that is one 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.630
 of the games that use our taste are 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.000
 free and send you a large amount 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.800
 of graphical system resources and now 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.440
 that they see it running they will see that the game 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.239
 run without any without any problem without 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.739
 no larreal there to a couple of 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.920
 strange movements when one moves the 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.870
 screen that manages to see is not like that is because 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.370
 him as the graphic offset but 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.830
 well do not notice at the time of being 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.660
 playing then let's make a 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.840
 small mission quickly so that they see 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.740
 how the team reacts and processing 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.319
 graphics 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.680
 very well, we are already playing 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.370
 as has been discussed 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.730
 if you notice the truth is that the game 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.980
 it reacts quite well there is no there is not a 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.890
 lag in the details there is a small 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.810
 movement like shading but still 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.989
 so it's almost imperceptible for the player 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:41.120
 the audio is pretty good the horns 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.120
 of the boys are pretty good 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.890
 obviously its hd screen 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.870
 and it makes the application now without 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.799
 no problem 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.079
 interesting in this team that does not have 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.209
 obviously many other android is the 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.859
 part of the pri that is an application in 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.439
 software developed by motorola 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.480
 precisely to run in the network of 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.829
 nextel that is not something else and surely 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.510
 they saw it with the phone that flew 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:14.170
 gabriel a few days ago that is not another 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.239
 thing but the nextel radio is 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.669
 say here one can have now yes that 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.949
 your number the free in excel to be able 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.250
 make calls with other users 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:26.050
 this without any problem doing the 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.090
 tap to be called like any other 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.070
 in excel where you press the button 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.440
 of the call there was first the buttons of 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.419
 go up and down volume and it's obviously 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.340
 communication via radio already with any 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.750
 nextel user through the 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.210
 print application and the other application 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.130
 that I add nextel also to the system is 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.800
 applying good season 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.780
 basically it's a one internet page 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.759
 where you can download applications or 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.380
 additional functionalities for 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.930
 users and how to see direct contents 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.599
 of his services the store a little bit of 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.740
 music videos 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:00.639
 basically it's all that the 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.599
 motorola equipment atrix hd de motorola 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.599
 with nextel
