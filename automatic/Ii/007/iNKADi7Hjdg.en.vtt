00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
anyone builds really a format i mean

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.699 
anyone builds really a format i mean
maybe<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.269> goblin<00:02:40.720> slide<00:02:40.989> deck<00:02:41.230> where<00:02:41.530> there's

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
maybe a goblin slide deck where there's

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.890 
maybe a goblin slide deck where there's
no<00:02:41.829> crew<00:02:42.010> nominee<00:02:42.340> creatures<00:02:42.730> but<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.750> most

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
no crew nominee creatures but the most

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.539 
no crew nominee creatures but the most
part<00:02:44.110> there's<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.319> sensitive<00:02:44.739> outcast<00:02:45.190> always

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
part there's a sensitive outcast always

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.800 
part there's a sensitive outcast always
doing<00:02:45.760> good<00:02:45.940> work<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:47.099> our<00:02:48.099> air<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:49.150> ghastly

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
doing good work and our air is a ghastly

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.729 
doing good work and our air is a ghastly
conscription<00:02:50.470> mythic<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:52.379> then<00:02:53.379> we've<00:02:53.530> got<00:02:53.560> a

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
conscription mythic and then we've got a

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.319 
conscription mythic and then we've got a
bun<00:02:54.040> file<00:02:54.220> cases<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.730> lion<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.120> i<00:02:55.150> guess<00:02:55.299> a

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
bun file cases the lion so i guess a

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.900 
bun file cases the lion so i guess a
conscription<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.200> my<00:02:57.129> stance<00:02:57.400> on<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:57.640> card

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
conscription and my stance on that card

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.110 
conscription and my stance on that card
is<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.560> wish<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.709> did<00:02:59.859> all<00:03:00.069> graveyards<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.819> not

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
is I wish it did all graveyards and not

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.240 
is I wish it did all graveyards and not
just<00:03:01.390> you'll<00:03:01.750> got<00:03:02.079> just<00:03:02.319> one<00:03:02.560> grade<00:03:02.950> or<00:03:03.220> I

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
just you'll got just one grade or I

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.039 
just you'll got just one grade or I
wished<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.849> all<00:03:04.000> cards<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.540> mean<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:04.750> can<00:03:04.930> have

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
wished it all cards I mean you can have

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.750 
wished it all cards I mean you can have
manifest<00:03:05.530> cards<00:03:05.859> that<00:03:05.980> aren't<00:03:06.099> creatures<00:03:06.519> so

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
manifest cards that aren't creatures so

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.270 
manifest cards that aren't creatures so
I<00:03:06.819> don't<00:03:07.000> know<00:03:07.090> why<00:03:07.269> they<00:03:08.200> didn't<00:03:08.530> do<00:03:08.829> that<00:03:09.010> for

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
I don't know why they didn't do that for

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.110 
I don't know why they didn't do that for
that<00:03:09.430> particular<00:03:10.560> card<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.769> mean<00:03:12.129> it<00:03:13.000> would

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
that particular card I mean it would

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.280 
that particular card I mean it would
just<00:03:13.239> be<00:03:13.390> another<00:03:13.480> niche<00:03:13.840> showing<00:03:14.170> how

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
just be another niche showing how

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.410 
just be another niche showing how
manifest<00:03:14.739> works<00:03:15.040> with<00:03:15.370> non<00:03:15.640> creatures<00:03:16.180> but

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
manifest works with non creatures but

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.809 
manifest works with non creatures but
hey<00:03:16.540> I'm<00:03:17.440> not<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:17.799> game<00:03:18.010> designer<00:03:18.340> maybe<00:03:18.639> they

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
hey I'm not a game designer maybe they

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.250 
hey I'm not a game designer maybe they
had<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.209> way<00:03:19.359> one<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:19.750> those<00:03:19.840> two<00:03:20.109> A's

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
had it that way one of those two A's

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.259 
had it that way one of those two A's
before<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.010> they<00:03:21.430> do<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.730> was<00:03:21.849> too<00:03:22.090> powerful

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
before and they do it was too powerful

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.809 
before and they do it was too powerful
oh<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.989> guess<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.440> mean<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.620> might<00:03:24.069> try<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.609> and

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
oh I guess I mean I might try it and

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.879 
oh I guess I mean I might try it and
draft<00:03:25.090> but<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.750> would<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.440> don't<00:03:26.650> have<00:03:26.769> to

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
draft but it would you don't have to

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.129 
draft but it would you don't have to
build<00:03:27.069> around<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.519> little<00:03:27.669> bit<00:03:27.930> maybe<00:03:28.930> with

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
build around a little bit maybe with

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.800 
build around a little bit maybe with
some<00:03:29.169> dealt<00:03:30.160> with<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.430> not<00:03:30.910> delve<00:03:31.180> self<00:03:31.540> mill

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
some dealt with a not delve self mill

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.099 
some dealt with a not delve self mill
and<00:03:32.440> then<00:03:32.620> target<00:03:32.950> yourself<00:03:33.480> rare<00:03:34.480> is<00:03:34.510> flame

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
and then target yourself rare is flame

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.150 
and then target yourself rare is flame
rush<00:03:35.319> writer<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.650> then<00:03:38.799> we've<00:03:38.980> got<00:03:39.010> a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
rush writer and then we've got a

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.900 
rush writer and then we've got a
tranquil<00:03:39.639> coat<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.510> plain<00:03:41.169> rush<00:03:41.319> rider<00:03:41.560> is

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
tranquil coat so plain rush rider is

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.449 
tranquil coat so plain rush rider is
okay<00:03:42.910> also<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.239> mean<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:44.500> cost<00:03:45.750> it's<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.840> 3<00:03:47.019> 3<00:03:47.049> 4<00:03:47.530> 5

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
okay also I mean it cost it's a 3 3 4 5

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.530 
okay also I mean it cost it's a 3 3 4 5
or<00:03:48.849> 4<00:03:49.030> 4<00:03:49.329> so<00:03:49.750> could<00:03:50.470> be<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.650> little<00:03:50.829> weak<00:03:51.010> but

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
or 4 4 so could be a little weak but

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.009 
or 4 4 so could be a little weak but
anyway<00:03:52.540> um<00:03:53.790> seems<00:03:54.790> like<00:03:54.940> your<00:03:55.060> average<00:03:55.180> set<00:03:55.900> of

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
anyway um seems like your average set of

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.180 
anyway um seems like your average set of
rares<00:03:56.349> for<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.829> set<00:03:57.099> and<00:03:58.980> that's<00:03:59.980> about<00:04:00.099> all

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
rares for the set and that's about all

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.430 
rares for the set and that's about all
you<00:04:00.459> can<00:04:00.489> ask<00:04:00.639> for<00:04:00.790> nothing<00:04:00.940> worth<00:04:01.510> anything

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
you can ask for nothing worth anything

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.659 
you can ask for nothing worth anything
