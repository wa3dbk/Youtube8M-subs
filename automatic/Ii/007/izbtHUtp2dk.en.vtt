00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.540
 Hello everyone, we will consider today 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.420
 wonderful inexpensive 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.480
 gaming optical mouse from the company 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.160
 log house 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.740
 In general, let's have a great mouse 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.859
 let's start with the box and then go through 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.050
 main characteristics and main 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.279
 chips called model g100s 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.410
 Here is such a wonderful box 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.500
 it opens very interestingly you can 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.040
 I donâ€™t immediately open the habit 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.350
 the main box but there are a lot of descriptions 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.840
 barcodes all sorts then we all watch not 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.840
 let's open it right away 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:01:02.789
 pull out actually this here 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:06.590
 the package is the mouse itself 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:13.080
 she pulled out quite simply 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:16.310
 take and look at the mouse here is such a 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:21.689
 she is beautiful and interesting design 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.820
 interesting coating very durable very 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.150
 interesting design legs made they 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.400
 really big really 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.990
 you can see that this gaming mouse when working 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.659
 she does not glow 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.490
 displays works here on such here 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.250
 work surface over ripple clean 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.850
 rug work on other rugs then 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.549
 There is no problem 5 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.159
 that liked thin but at the same time 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:52.229
 soft cord is very good plus he 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.570
 long there is here from the control 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.420
 as you can see there are no buttons on the sides 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.100
 there is both left and right there is a wheel which 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.950
 pressed and there is a toggle button 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.060
 permissions button it helps to change 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.489
 resolution and for 250 to 2500 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.310
 dots per inch is very very good 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.500
 This is really a game chip 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.950
 eat and generally this muscle is 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.080
 heir to the famous g1 gaming mouse 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.450
 and g-100 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.390
 but there is already a new optical 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.849
 a sensor called delta zero 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.150
 It provides high accuracy but 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.760
 let's go through the characteristics 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.590
 also this mouse stands 20 million 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.000
 clicks each button in the same 20 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.810
 million it really is calculated 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.959
 on games and I think that this is very, very 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.120
 Well, how did I like that? 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.140
 now if we talk about clicks if we talk 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.819
 about clicks she's a mouse this is small but when 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.060
 This is despite the fact that I have a big hand 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.620
 me my mouse rick 7 old she 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.049
 of course it will be bigger and heavier 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.410
 Nevertheless, the mouse is convenient and about 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.920
 clicks clicks and quiet and clear short 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.989
 button stroke liked it very much 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.330
 I also liked the material 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.099
 in general it often happens when very 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.140
 Do you play for a long time? 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.420
 computer a little bit and 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.130
 hot hand is sweating somehow uncomfortable 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.070
 uncomfortable especially when muscles 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.230
 somehow rubberized here such 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.989
 no chips here material is very good 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.079
 it is water repellent 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:34.829
 he is very nice matte to the touch 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.230
 gritty again is also very good 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.630
 leg is completely symmetrical as you can see 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.260
 that is, it is suitable for both left-handed and 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.380
 right handed is also very comfortable while she 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:49.620
 anatomical 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:52.100
 and the hand does not get tired comfortable work also 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.950
 this mouse is warranted for 3 years 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.910
 just on here these legs is given here 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.260
 250 km warranty that is here and 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.579
 here and there you will fiddle it two hundred 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.329
 five kilometers to roll and then 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.920
 It is impossible to erase well, and the main chip 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.799
 which really need again 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.030
 I repeat this permission switching 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.690
 permission to switch during the game 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.229
 that is, if you need to move very 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.680
 quickly 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:22.349
 put the cursor in high resolution 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.939
 if you need precision, do not set 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.129
 for this you need to install a special 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:30.180
 logitech application 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:33.719
 software I do not remember how it is called there but 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.150
 in fact it's worth it and she is very 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:38.280
 functional well and here is such a mouse 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.490
 I think there is nothing special to tell 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.159
 still it is a budget gaming mouse 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.409
 but for those who are not looking for someone there 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:49.080
 super duper perversion for those who do not 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:51.090
 bothers here with mice 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.949
 which are 10 buttons that hang there 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.319
 by kilogram or some 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.449
 Is there anything else wireless ? 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.699
 let's go run comfortable again 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.250
 the materials are not comfortable by themselves 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.039
 light not very heavy comfortable soft 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.689
 wire which is very important for gaming 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.039
 mice 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:12.439
 good surface very clear quiet and 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.759
 short screams 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:15.210
 resolution switching and optical 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.819
 sensor 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.539
 plus work on different surfaces too 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:23.729
 what is important here is such a mouse 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.199
 g100s hope the company is already 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.060
 will provide some more mice and 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.969
 keyboards and therefore we will consider 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.199
 Good luck to everyone and do not forget to subscribe 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.199
 bye bye bye
