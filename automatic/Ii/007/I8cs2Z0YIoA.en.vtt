00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the end of the video and it has three

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.220 
the end of the video and it has three
modes<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.590> ABCs<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.910> letter<00:00:33.420> sounds<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.740 
modes the ABCs the letter sounds and
colors<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.640> doesn't<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> music<00:00:36.540> mode

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
colors so it doesn't have a music mode

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.080 
colors so it doesn't have a music mode
but<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.350> plays<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> fun<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.280> ditty<00:00:38.610> when<00:00:38.940> it

and it's a fun alphabet learning toy and

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.700 
and it's a fun alphabet learning toy and
let's<00:01:25.650> go<00:01:25.740> ahead<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.040> letter<00:01:26.340> sounds

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710

communication he says that tickles and
on<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> other<00:01:43.049> side<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.920> all<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.640> other

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
on the other side you have all the other

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.310 
on the other side you have all the other
letters<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.680> their<00:01:47.369> sounds<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:51.320> sometimes

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
letters and their sounds and sometimes

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.830 
letters and their sounds and sometimes
the<00:01:52.860> way<00:01:53.009> he<00:01:53.280> turns<00:01:53.640> his<00:01:53.909> body<00:01:54.030> turns<00:01:54.420> his<00:01:54.630> feet

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the way he turns his body turns his feet

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.260 
the way he turns his body turns his feet
press<00:01:55.110> up<00:01:55.290> against<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> ground<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.280> it's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
press up against the ground and it's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.639 
press up against the ground and it's
hard<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.659> press<00:01:57.899> them<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.350> actually<00:01:58.439> have

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
hard to press them and you actually have

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.039 
hard to press them and you actually have
to<00:01:58.740> roll<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.189> backwards<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.570> that's<00:02:00.750> something

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
to roll in backwards so that's something

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.200 
to roll in backwards so that's something
that's<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.530> downside<00:02:01.979> for<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.369> one<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:03.060> they

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
that's a downside for this one that they

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.929 
that's a downside for this one that they
improved<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> new<00:02:04.469> ones<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.100> then

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
improved on in the new ones and then

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.710 
improved on in the new ones and then
this<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.329> low<00:02:06.509> volume<00:02:08.330> put<00:02:09.330> him<00:02:09.420> back<00:02:09.509> on

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
this is the low volume put him back on

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.380 
this is the low volume put him back on
high<00:02:09.959> his<00:02:10.649> head<00:02:10.679> swivels

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
high his head swivels

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.550 
high his head swivels
and<00:02:13.080> he<00:02:13.290> says<00:02:13.470> alphabet<00:02:14.040> pal<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.790> front

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:40.280 

and<00:02:19.560> let's<00:02:19.950> put<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.910> on<00:02:21.060> color<00:02:21.960> mode<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.900> that

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
and let's put it on color mode and that

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.990 
and let's put it on color mode and that
is<00:02:40.500> one<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.890> fun<00:02:41.100> little<00:02:41.400> ditties<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.760> it
