power here in this relationship I think

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.310 
power here in this relationship I think
it<00:00:55.649> goes<00:00:55.860> back<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.570> years<00:00:57.570> ago<00:00:57.899> when<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it goes back to years ago when the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.099 
it goes back to years ago when the

OEMs<00:01:01.680> would<00:01:01.829> come<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.460> sell<00:01:03.059> directly<00:01:03.420> to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
OEMs would come in and sell directly to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.260 
OEMs would come in and sell directly to
consumers<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.880> cut<00:01:05.880> into<00:01:06.119> their

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
consumers and then cut into their

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
consumers and then cut into their
margins<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.170> they<00:01:07.770> were<00:01:07.830> sort<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
margins and so they were sort of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.800 
margins and so they were sort of

basically<00:04:53.840> if<00:04:54.020> you<00:04:54.140> look<00:04:54.320> at<00:04:54.470> what<00:04:54.590> Apple<00:04:55.010> did

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
basically if you look at what Apple did

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.540 
basically if you look at what Apple did
ten<00:04:55.910> twelve<00:04:56.210> years<00:04:56.330> ago<00:04:56.840> at<00:04:57.740> that<00:04:57.800> time<00:04:58.040> and

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
ten twelve years ago at that time and

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.010 
ten twelve years ago at that time and
it's<00:04:58.640> hard<00:04:58.910> to<00:04:59.090> remember<00:04:59.240> now<00:04:59.540> but<00:04:59.900> at<00:04:59.990> that

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
it's hard to remember now but at that

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.870 
it's hard to remember now but at that
time<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:00.770> only<00:05:00.980> time<00:05:01.190> where<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:01.640> could<00:05:01.790> buy

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
time the only time where you could buy

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.940 
time the only time where you could buy
an<00:05:02.000> Apple<00:05:02.300> product<00:05:02.540> was<00:05:02.900> if<00:05:03.500> you<00:05:03.650> went<00:05:03.770> into<00:05:03.860> a
