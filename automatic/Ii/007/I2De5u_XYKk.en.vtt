00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.560
 you 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.240
 I live the girls very good guys I am 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.139
 What are you waiting for? 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.630
 all very well 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.370
 today I tell you a story about 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.740
 the annexation and that is according to people 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.470
 influential generations sector 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.960
 coming will not last no more than five 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.970
 years but algarra that is the carrier of 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.340
 are and set up in teasdale in your 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.829
 division in the united kingdom has made a 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.020
 series of statements on duration 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.510
 of the next generation consoles 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.180
 specifically on on playstation 4 and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.430
 Xbox One 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.200
 there are enough reasons to believe that 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.630
 the prison cycle four will be more 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.000
 short especially in markets like kingdom 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.590
 united is probably a sign of what 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.870
 much that times have changed in 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.220
 these seven years the appetite and the 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.489
 will to renew our 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.200
 technological platforms have changed 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.180
 It must be said that the last generation 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.160
 the consoles had a life cycle 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.440
 almost 8 years old but according to fergal this goes 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.910
 to change from now on not only 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.100
 from the point of view of one's own 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.040
 sony but also for companies so 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.110
 important as electronic arts since 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.410
 also his vice president patrick 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.690
 soderlund exposed in several media that the 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.910
 current generation will be no more than 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.880
 five years and that the previous consoles 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.660
 they lasted longer than anyone in the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.119
 industry 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.340
 I wanted we have seen games like 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.680
 example the last of us or big picture 5 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.649
 at the end of a cycle that we did not expect 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.880
 a few years ago but now a 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.620
 period of 5 or 6 years is what 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.520
 project for the current generation and 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.520
 sorry 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.520
 phil harrison who is the vice president 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.679
 of xbox has considered that 8 years has not 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.860
 been a too long period but 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:55.530
 otherwise indicated for the xbox 360 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.140
 with these statements quite the contrary 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.659
 from your industry peers the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.020
 period of life indicated for xbox one 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.579
 also going to be the same so nothing 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.569
 guys, I hope you've been interested 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.000
 News 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:13.290
 I think from my point of view that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.440
 xbox 360 and playstation 3 could still 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.049
 explode if a little more but good not 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.500
 I know who to say I simply say one 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.269
 opinion is vain and gives me opinion so 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.950
 nothing guys I do not know what you think about that 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.110
 I want you to tell me a little kiss 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.790
 everyone and see you in other languages of 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.790
 this channel until the next
