00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.960 
a huge contract I mean Peyton Manning if
he<00:01:43.590> becomes<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.920> Miami<00:01:44.220> Dolphin<00:01:44.250> he<00:01:44.850> will

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
he becomes a Miami Dolphin he will

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.359 
he becomes a Miami Dolphin he will
probably<00:01:45.270> getting<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.899> very<00:01:46.409> very<00:01:46.799> very<00:01:46.920> large

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
probably getting a very very very large

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.710 
probably getting a very very very large
contract<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.240> know<00:01:48.329> what<00:01:48.479> they're<00:01:48.630> gonna

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
contract and you know what they're gonna

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.230 
contract and you know what they're gonna
be<00:01:48.869> taking<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.170> huge<00:01:49.409> risk<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.700> Peyton

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
be taking a huge risk because if Peyton

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.700 
be taking a huge risk because if Peyton
Manning<00:01:51.509> isn't<00:01:51.659> healthy<00:01:51.990> obviously<00:01:52.619> he's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
Manning isn't healthy obviously he's

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.200 
Manning isn't healthy obviously he's
been<00:01:52.829> cleared<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.100> play<00:01:53.280> if<00:01:53.579> Peyton<00:01:53.970> Manning

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
been cleared to play if Peyton Manning

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.609 
been cleared to play if Peyton Manning
can't<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> Peyton<00:01:54.810> Manning<00:01:55.079> he<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.380> two

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
