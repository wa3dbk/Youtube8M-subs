00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.820
 Good afternoon, Yaroslav Brin is now 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.870
 we will sort out such an exercise as 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.060
 squatting with a wide dumbbell 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.150
 leg exercise is aimed at 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:22.080
 development of the gluteus and internal 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.910
 thigh surfaces are exactly the very 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.520
 weak areas of the female body which 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.890
 require constant work specifics 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.230
 this exercise is what we feet 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.810
 we put on the stand thus 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.329
 increase the amplitude of the movement than 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.410
 the greater the amplitude of the movement the greater 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.469
 muscle group works and the better it is 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.660
 being worked out plus we can take in 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.269
 dumbbell arms and this dumbbell will not 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.129
 to limit the course of movement will not 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.250
 limit our amplitude and this is us 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.980
 let the best I work our 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.960
 gluteus and posterior internal 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.440
 thigh surface I would call it 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.820
 exercise plei squats on a stand 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:14.010
 and so the initial position of the foot set on 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:16.650
 stand steel legs put on 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.890
 wetsuit socks 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.390
 inside 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.180
 back straight to keep 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.220
 back constantly straight look to the far 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.350
 top corner in front of you even when 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.300
 do a squat always look into the farthest 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.980
 the top corner in front of you is 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.780
 allow anatomically correct to keep 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.640
 spine 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.740
 squatting starting me by flexing 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.690
 knees that is how we usually sit on 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.720
 toilet bowl due to lead 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.100
 hip joint that is try 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.840
 Tass buttocks take 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.630
 and due to this will occur 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.590
 squats let's try get up 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.600
 everything 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.979
 highlights emphasis on heels 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.140
 the golden rule of all squats when you 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.359
 crouch your knee should not go beyond 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.609
 sock but if you put your feet 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:08.610
 wide enough in such a technique 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:11.280
 performing the knee well he is difficult to get out 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.519
 per sock that is control the width of 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.930
 stand let's sit down that is here 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:23.700
 knee lack all squat you need 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:26.130
 lower parallel that is sit down angle 90 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.860
 degrees and you should try as low as possible 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.680
 lower the lower you crouch the more in 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.430
 work joins gluteus and internal 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.790
 thigh surface then amplitude 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:43.049
 movement down we go down as much as possible 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.420
 lower up we fall not to the end in 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.970
 top knee point like this not 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.519
 unbend that is, do not remove the load with 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.890
 gluteus and back of thigh not 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.860
 distribute the load throughout the body and not 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.630
 arching our joints ie do not create 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.850
 load joints knees always 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.150
 slightly bent the top point and 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.620
 the top point we have no rest that is 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.310
 at the top we do not rest we 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.160
 crouch sit down top 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.569
 and immediately went down not arching 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.630
 knees that is a person wants after 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.769
 exercise exercise stand straighten 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.709
 leg thereby relax your muscles and 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.180
 do not have to do this rest 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.810
 consciously keep your knees a little bit 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.260
 bent 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.200
 do not remove the load from the target muscle 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.970
 groups and so with dumbbell you can or 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.069
 need to rest with a dumbbell dumbbell 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.799
 holding hold on arms outstretched no need 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.329
 raise her to yourself in any way and not twist 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.680
 it is necessary just on outstretched arms 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:52.889
 relaxed as close as possible and crouch 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.750
 as your legs are raised on 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.700
 dumbbell supports they limit 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.010
 amplitude of movement and can be lowered 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.959
 how can 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:07.510
 below, in principle, the main nuances 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.510
 doing this exercise finished
