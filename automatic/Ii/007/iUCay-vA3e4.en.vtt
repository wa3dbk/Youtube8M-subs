00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.279
 Today's look is very very noble and 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.639
 He makes your eyes wonderful at night 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.630
 radiant without being overcharged 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:11.730
 I have a love better 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.559
 applied and now I start with 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.240
 a black kohl the border 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.400
 emerge my mac serves kajal 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.740
 as a primer with it the make-up later 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.930
 really nice dark and black 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.119
 and you do not really have to 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.720
 do it properly because we are exactly 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.050
 Now start the black material 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.510
 I can blind you completely 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.190
 just perfect the shape and that 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.940
 whole program too soft 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.860
 A bit of tuxedo bleeds around it 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.680
 make something a little more glamorous 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.860
 coincidentally a black sparkle 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.039
 Eyeshadow above and fainter 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.039
 the 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.450
 in the next step I want with my 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.550
 finger a really nice tip 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.930
 champagne coloring on the medium of a 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.360
 song and also a bit in the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.250
 angle and I use that has none 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.690
 brush because the finger is the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.570
 pigmentation just a bit higher 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.940
 And the champagne factors come a lot 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.710
 much nicer 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.630
 and today my beloved comes to her 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.930
 palette to use again and I take 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.870
 From it a glittering medium to 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.900
 dark blue the part and wear it on 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.610
 lower eyelash on around in the outside 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.210
 angle to a smooth gradient 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.729
 create 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.110
 I'll go over the black one 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.450
 sparkling eyeshadow I too 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.460
 already used at the beginning 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.800
 I grab again to the rough tone 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.780
 to your palette and enter 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.160
 a bit of it on the upper lid in the 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.970
 Angle outside and blinded 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.360
 champagne colored eyeshadow is still coming 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.550
 to use and so I set 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.710
 Highlight in the development 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.290
 a bit of what I distribute as well 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.290
 in the first third of the company plans 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.570
 now it's about the eye contour 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.179
 lend and for that I use one 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.030
 black eyeliner and here an eyeliner 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.310
 strictly as close as possible to the upper edge 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.709
 what works best by me 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.480
 small dots or strokes possible 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.260
 sit close to the upper lash line 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.269
 and then connecting them together 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.900
 Outside angle I draw a small one 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.430
 wing as quickly as possible and straight 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.470
 then I compete the lower part 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.540
 my eye as I a black 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.540
 kajal apply on my water-less 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.600
 connect with my black eyeliner 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.870
 I put the two lines in the angle of the 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.950
 eye to each other 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.170
 Of course, the highlight is still missing 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.630
 under the eyebrow and for that I wear 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.640
 today a white eyeliner under the 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.640
 eyebrow up and stay with them 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.080
 then with your finger through the 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.900
 heat my singers lets that me 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.370
 pass well 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.270
 if you had the feeling that yours has 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.860
 a little more swimmer 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.300
 you can take it easy 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.160
 champagne eyeshadows from 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.020
 start and meet him about it 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.660
 I have false eyelashes now 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.480
 glued on and this also deceived and 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.100
 Now I hope a bit glitter 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.380
 glue on my upper lash line 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.180
 I had the then small pc 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.620
 bought because I wanted to try it 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.160
 and you can just as well lipgloss here 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.900
 The associations with lip gloss keep that 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.300
 Glitter me as well and now 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.430
 we take I me a hairpin and 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.080
 apply the glitter with the hairpin 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.850
 because they are allowed to lead and I can 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.850
 work so precisely with it 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.590
 That's it from me again 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.299
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.700
 the copy and we then 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.659
 next time shoot at rick perry 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.659
 before the
