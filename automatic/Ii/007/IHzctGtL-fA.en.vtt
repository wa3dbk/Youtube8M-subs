which<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:00.939> the<00:03:01.030> mesomorph<00:03:01.389> which<00:03:02.109> I<00:03:02.349> am<00:03:02.739> which

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
which is the mesomorph which I am which

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.500 
which is the mesomorph which I am which
I<00:03:03.069> told<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.370> last<00:03:03.519> time<00:03:03.700> I'm<00:03:04.090> mainly<00:03:04.299> on

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
I told you last time I'm mainly on

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.360 
I told you last time I'm mainly on
mesomorph<00:03:04.810> which<00:03:05.169> means<00:03:05.439> I<00:03:05.650> put<00:03:06.099> on<00:03:06.189> muscle

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
mesomorph which means I put on muscle

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.599 
mesomorph which means I put on muscle
fairly<00:03:06.909> easy<00:03:07.180> um<00:03:08.109> it<00:03:08.799> doesn't<00:03:09.069> take<00:03:09.250> me<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.459> long

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
fairly easy um it doesn't take me a long

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.869 
fairly easy um it doesn't take me a long
time<00:03:09.879> to<00:03:09.939> see<00:03:10.419> results<00:03:10.810> from<00:03:10.930> weight<00:03:11.169> training

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
time to see results from weight training

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.429 
time to see results from weight training
also<00:03:12.879> I<00:03:13.510> tend<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.319> put<00:03:14.530> on<00:03:14.650> fat<00:03:15.840> easy<00:03:16.840> as<00:03:17.200> well

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 
also I tend to put on fat easy as well

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.439 
also I tend to put on fat easy as well
but<00:03:17.829> I<00:03:17.889> can<00:03:18.129> definitely<00:03:18.280> mass<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.090> bulk<00:03:19.209> up

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:19.449 
but I can definitely mass and bulk up

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.899 
but I can definitely mass and bulk up
really<00:03:19.780> easy<00:03:20.049> now<00:03:20.409> if<00:03:20.680> your<00:03:20.889> goal<00:03:21.129> is<00:03:21.159> to<00:03:21.519> be

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
really easy now if your goal is to be

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.530 
really easy now if your goal is to be
smaller<00:03:22.440> then<00:03:23.440> what<00:03:24.190> you<00:03:24.400> need<00:03:24.549> to<00:03:24.669> do<00:03:24.819> is<00:03:25.090> work

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
smaller then what you need to do is work

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.750 
smaller then what you need to do is work
out<00:03:25.750> what<00:03:26.049> mainly<00:03:26.500> body<00:03:26.829> weight<00:03:27.159> type<00:03:27.579> of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
out what mainly body weight type of

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.059 
out what mainly body weight type of
training<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.959> reason<00:03:29.260> why<00:03:29.379> is<00:03:29.409> to<00:03:29.709> do<00:03:29.859> too

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
training the reason why is to do too

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.949 
training the reason why is to do too
much<00:03:30.220> weight<00:03:30.489> lifting<00:03:30.909> trying<00:03:31.239> to<00:03:31.329> bulk<00:03:31.510> up<00:03:31.689> I

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
much weight lifting trying to bulk up I

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.349 
much weight lifting trying to bulk up I
know<00:03:32.290> studies<00:03:32.889> say<00:03:33.069> that<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.939> know<00:03:33.970> bulking

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
know studies say that you know bulking

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.360 
know studies say that you know bulking
up<00:03:34.659> is<00:03:34.810> impossible<00:03:35.319> for<00:03:35.500> women<00:03:35.650> but<00:03:35.979> if<00:03:36.159> your

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
up is impossible for women but if your

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.689 
up is impossible for women but if your
genetics<00:03:36.849> has<00:03:37.479> that<00:03:38.340> mesomorph<00:03:39.340> type

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
genetics has that mesomorph type

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.179 
genetics has that mesomorph type
capability<00:03:40.479> it<00:03:40.659> is<00:03:41.109> easy<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.560> bulk<00:03:41.829> up<00:03:41.979> and

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
capability it is easy to bulk up and

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.030 
capability it is easy to bulk up and
have<00:03:42.400> your<00:03:42.549> muscles<00:03:43.150> above<00:03:43.389> bulging<00:03:44.079> if<00:03:44.859> you

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
have your muscles above bulging if you

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.740 
have your muscles above bulging if you
are<00:03:45.220> using<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.669> weight<00:03:45.819> you<00:03:46.269> just<00:03:46.449> want<00:03:46.629> to<00:03:46.659> use

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
are using a weight you just want to use

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.140 
are using a weight you just want to use
them<00:03:47.049> for<00:03:47.259> cardio<00:03:47.739> based<00:03:48.040> type<00:03:48.280> training<00:03:48.609> but

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
them for cardio based type training but

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.629 
them for cardio based type training but
mainly<00:03:49.389> all<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:49.930> need<00:03:50.079> is<00:03:50.199> body<00:03:50.439> weight<00:03:50.709> also

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
mainly all you need is body weight also

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.360 
mainly all you need is body weight also
