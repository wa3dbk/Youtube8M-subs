00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
now I'm going to bring you a game that

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.320 
now I'm going to bring you a game that
we<00:00:03.720> created<00:00:04.080> called<00:00:04.350> for<00:00:04.740> in<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.950> row<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:06.060> board

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
we created called for in a row the board

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.750 
we created called for in a row the board
looks<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.870> way<00:00:06.960> it<00:00:06.990> does<00:00:07.429> it's<00:00:08.429> windy<00:00:08.730> out

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
looks the way it does it's windy out

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.549 
looks the way it does it's windy out
here<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.660> board<00:00:09.900> looks<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.290> way<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.410> does

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
here the board looks the way it does

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.530 
here the board looks the way it does
because<00:00:10.920> we<00:00:11.250> use<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.610> board<00:00:11.820> for<00:00:12.059> other<00:00:12.300> games

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
because we use the board for other games

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.160 
because we use the board for other games
also<00:00:12.960> but<00:00:13.889> really<00:00:14.759> all<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:15.089> need<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> five<00:00:15.960> by

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
also but really all we need is a five by

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.910 
also but really all we need is a five by
five<00:00:16.379> grid<00:00:17.810> you<00:00:18.810> need<00:00:18.960> six<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:20.689> two<00:00:21.689> things<00:00:22.199> so

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
five grid you need six of two things so

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.519 
five grid you need six of two things so
I'm<00:00:23.189> using<00:00:23.430> quarters<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.150> pennies<00:00:24.300> those<00:00:25.289> are

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
I'm using quarters and pennies those are

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.769 
I'm using quarters and pennies those are
easy<00:00:25.740> because<00:00:26.369> most<00:00:26.880> people<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.180> some<00:00:27.599> sort

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
easy because most people have some sort

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.210 
easy because most people have some sort
of<00:00:27.869> change<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.380> them<00:00:28.590> or<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.830> their<00:00:28.980> car

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
of change on them or in their car

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.339 
of change on them or in their car
somewhere<00:00:29.820> else<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.050> as

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
somewhere else but you can just as

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.590 
somewhere else but you can just as
easily<00:00:31.470> use<00:00:31.859> buttons<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.910> kind<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.360> like

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
easily use buttons it's kind of like

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.500 
easily use buttons it's kind of like
tic-tac-toe<00:00:34.340> it<00:00:35.340> starts<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.120> anywhere

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
tic-tac-toe it starts like that anywhere

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.940 
tic-tac-toe it starts like that anywhere
anyway<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:39.050> waiting<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.170> Rays<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.590> die<00:00:40.739> down

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
anyway so waiting the Rays to die down

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.670 
anyway so waiting the Rays to die down
say<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> quarters<00:00:41.790> go<00:00:41.940> first<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:43.440> put<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
say the quarters go first I can put the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.880 
say the quarters go first I can put the
quarter<00:00:44.010> anywhere<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:45.660> then<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.590> works<00:00:46.770> just

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
quarter anywhere and then it works just

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590 
quarter anywhere and then it works just
like<00:00:47.070> tic-tac-toe<00:00:47.520> were<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.059> trying<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> get

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
like tic-tac-toe were you trying to get

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:58.140 
like tic-tac-toe were you trying to get
four<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> row<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.059> we'll<00:00:51.449> block<00:00:51.660> them

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.049 

and<00:00:59.150> then<00:01:00.020> once<00:01:01.300> I've<00:01:02.300> got<00:01:03.250> them<00:01:04.250> all<00:01:04.610> on<00:01:04.909> the

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
and then once I've got them all on the

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:12.320 
and then once I've got them all on the
board

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.480 

and<00:01:12.570> clearly<00:01:13.500> don't<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.010> four<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.670> row

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
and clearly don't have four in a row

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.260 
and clearly don't have four in a row
then<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.910> get<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.300> move<00:01:18.690> things<00:01:19.160> so<00:01:20.270> quarters

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
then I get to move things so quarters

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.640 
then I get to move things so quarters
went<00:01:21.510> first<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:23.930> basically<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.050> can<00:01:25.380> move<00:01:25.530> in

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
went first and basically I can move in

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.860 
went first and basically I can move in
any<00:01:25.860> direction<00:01:25.980> I<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:27.060> can't<00:01:27.270> jump<00:01:27.630> anything

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
any direction I just can't jump anything

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.040 
any direction I just can't jump anything
and<00:01:28.260> I<00:01:28.710> can't<00:01:28.770> capture<00:01:29.190> anything<00:01:29.870> so<00:01:30.870> if

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
and I can't capture anything so if

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.760 
and I can't capture anything so if
quarters<00:01:31.440> goes<00:01:31.680> first<00:01:32.250> let<00:01:33.090> me<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:35.300> let's<00:01:36.770> go

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
quarters goes first let me see let's go

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.960 
quarters goes first let me see let's go
there<00:01:38.580> I<00:01:40.160> could<00:01:41.160> you<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.610> move<00:01:41.760> more<00:01:41.910> than

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
there I could you I can move more than

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.850 
there I could you I can move more than
one<00:01:42.240> space<00:01:42.480> i<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.780> move<00:01:42.870> as<00:01:42.990> many<00:01:43.080> spaces<00:01:43.440> as<00:01:43.740> I

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
one space i can move as many spaces as I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.790 
one space i can move as many spaces as I
want<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.280> long<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.700> nobody's<00:01:45.120> in<00:01:45.300> my<00:01:45.479> way<00:01:45.800> so

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
want as long as nobody's in my way so

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.060 
want as long as nobody's in my way so
obviously<00:01:47.400> doing<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:49.380> penny<00:01:49.620> wants<00:01:49.830> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
obviously doing that the penny wants to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.700 
obviously doing that the penny wants to
block<00:01:50.250> me<00:01:50.490> there<00:01:50.810> then<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.960> quarters<00:01:52.470> turn

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
block me there then it's quarters turn

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.030 
block me there then it's quarters turn
again<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.460> guess<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:53.940> I<00:01:54.270> win<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.620> I<00:01:55.800> can

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
again but guess what I win because I can

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280 
again but guess what I win because I can
go<00:01:56.160> there<00:01:56.420> this<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:57.840> quick<00:01:58.080> version

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
go there this was a really quick version

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.050 
go there this was a really quick version
and<00:01:58.590> I'm<00:01:58.650> playing<00:01:58.830> myself<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.760> that's

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
and I'm playing myself but that's

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.700 
and I'm playing myself but that's
basically<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.110> games<00:02:01.320> don't<00:02:01.590> usually

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
basically it the games don't usually

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.760 
basically it the games don't usually
take<00:02:02.010> more<00:02:02.220> than<00:02:02.340> 10<00:02:02.520> minutes<00:02:02.900> there's<00:02:03.900> you

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
take more than 10 minutes there's you

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.859 
take more than 10 minutes there's you
can<00:02:04.920> move<00:02:05.040> one<00:02:05.160> space<00:02:05.340> 2<00:02:05.670> space<00:02:05.700> 3<00:02:06.210> space<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.780> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
can move one space 2 space 3 space up to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.419 
can move one space 2 space 3 space up to
five<00:02:07.080> spaces<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.680> course<00:02:07.920> because<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
five spaces of course because it's a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.570 
five spaces of course because it's a
five<00:02:08.580> by<00:02:08.760> five<00:02:08.970> grid<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.890> then<00:02:10.890> whoever<00:02:11.400> ends

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
five by five grid and then whoever ends

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.880 
five by five grid and then whoever ends
up<00:02:11.700> with<00:02:11.760> four<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> row<00:02:12.209> wins<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.890> just

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
up with four in a row wins and just

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.110 
up with four in a row wins and just
remember<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.370> use<00:02:14.490> anything<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.880> want
