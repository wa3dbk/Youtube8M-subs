i<00:01:35.430> really<00:01:36.180> think<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.689> performance

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
i really think that this performance

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.520 
i really think that this performance
should<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.799> higher<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.009> 72<00:01:38.579> an<00:01:38.640> ATM<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
should be higher on 72 an ATM because a

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.940 
should be higher on 72 an ATM because a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.100 
single center ATM house around 33 frames
so<00:01:44.700> 33<00:01:45.270> times<00:01:45.659> 2<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.170> not<00:01:46.880> 5366<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.930> see

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
so 33 times 2 is not 5366 so we can see

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.020 
so 33 times 2 is not 5366 so we can see
