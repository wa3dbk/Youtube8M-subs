few of the hot functions of the tool and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.740 
few of the hot functions of the tool and
we'll<00:00:32.550> go<00:00:32.640> through<00:00:32.850> some<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> hotkeys<00:00:33.510> as

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
we'll go through some of the hotkeys as

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.360 
we'll go through some of the hotkeys as
well<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.260> go<00:00:34.290> through<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> data<00:00:34.800> display

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
well as we go through the data display

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.799 
well as we go through the data display
and<00:00:35.730> kind<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:35.940> how<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.059> manipulate<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
and kind of how to manipulate the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.810 
and kind of how to manipulate the
display<00:00:37.200> itself<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:38.340> we're<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> go<00:00:38.700> back

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820

display itself so we're going to go back
to<00:00:38.879> powertrain<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:40.739> we're<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.010> select

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
to powertrain and we're going to select

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.360 
to powertrain and we're going to select
our<00:00:42.390> engine<00:00:42.750> which<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.899> an<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.460> Nancy

our engine which is an is in Nancy

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.000 
our engine which is an is in Nancy
and<00:00:46.670> we're<00:00:46.820> gonna<00:00:46.910> go<00:00:47.120> to<00:00:47.150> data<00:00:47.420> display<00:00:48.010> and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
and we're gonna go to data display and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.569 
and we're gonna go to data display and
we'll<00:00:49.160> select<00:00:49.370> engine<00:00:50.060> data

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
we'll select engine data

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.599 
we'll select engine data
and<00:00:51.670> I<00:00:52.120> will<00:00:52.329> do<00:00:52.510> Engine<00:00:53.020> 1

data lists with 30 40 and 50 data
parameters<00:01:46.619> jump<00:01:47.190> very<00:01:47.399> quickly<00:01:47.700> amongst

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
parameters jump very quickly amongst

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.149 
parameters jump very quickly amongst
screens<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.080> take<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.289> quick<00:01:49.590> glance<00:01:49.619> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
screens you can take a quick glance and

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:50.940 
screens you can take a quick glance and
see<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.340> anything

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
see if anything

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.570 
see if anything
out<00:01:51.039> of<00:01:51.189> the<00:01:51.280> ordinary

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.440 

so<00:01:54.090> our<00:01:54.180> two<00:01:54.450> sensors<00:01:54.870> are<00:01:55.020> switching<00:01:55.380> well

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
so our two sensors are switching well

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.850 
so our two sensors are switching well
long-term<00:01:57.450> fuels

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.280 

now<00:02:00.400> you'll<00:02:00.760> notice<00:02:00.970> hotkeys<00:02:01.600> on<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.900> bottom

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
now you'll notice hotkeys on the bottom

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.550 
now you'll notice hotkeys on the bottom
here<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:03.430> first<00:02:03.670> item<00:02:04.060> says<00:02:04.300> select<00:02:05.080> items

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
here the first item says select items

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.790 
here the first item says select items
this<00:02:06.160> allows<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.760> to<00:02:06.940> customize<00:02:07.540> a<00:02:07.570> list<00:02:08.020> from

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
this allows you to customize a list from

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.070 
this allows you to customize a list from
the<00:02:09.040> items<00:02:09.399> out<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.610> 47<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.570> can<00:02:10.750> take<00:02:10.899> any

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
the items out of 47 you can take any

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.410 
the items out of 47 you can take any
three<00:02:11.410> items<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:11.950> pull<00:02:12.460> them<00:02:12.670> up<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.030> create

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
three items and pull them up and create

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.110 
three items and pull them up and create
a<00:02:13.480> separate<00:02:13.900> list<00:02:14.140> for<00:02:14.440> them<00:02:14.620> atom<00:02:15.250> 47<00:02:15.970> I'll

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
a separate list for them atom 47 I'll

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.790 
a separate list for them atom 47 I'll
show<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.330> how<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.540> works<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.500> let's<00:02:17.620> say

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
show you how that works so let's say

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.560 
show you how that works so let's say
you're<00:02:17.980> working<00:02:18.190> on<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.430> particular<00:02:18.580> problem

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
you're working on a particular problem

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.540 
you're working on a particular problem
and<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:20.140> wanted<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.530> look<00:02:20.650> at<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:20.950> maybe<00:02:21.190> three

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
and you wanted to look at it maybe three

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.240 
and you wanted to look at it maybe three
items<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.560> aren't<00:02:23.560> really<00:02:23.740> is<00:02:23.830> concerned

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
items and aren't really is concerned

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.650 
items and aren't really is concerned
with<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.490> rest<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.850> them<00:02:24.940> we<00:02:25.360> can<00:02:25.510> go<00:02:25.600> to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
with the rest of them we can go to

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.080 
with the rest of them we can go to
select<00:02:26.080> items<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.800> it<00:02:27.670> will<00:02:27.790> give<00:02:27.910> us<00:02:27.940> that

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
select items and it will give us that

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.660 
select items and it will give us that
list<00:02:28.510> with<00:02:28.780> no<00:02:29.050> data<00:02:29.400> fluctuating<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.550> is

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
list with no data fluctuating this is

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.270 
list with no data fluctuating this is
essentially<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.300> data<00:02:31.750> parameter<00:02:32.320> list<00:02:32.590> so

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
essentially the data parameter list so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.330 
essentially the data parameter list so
I'm<00:02:33.370> going<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.610> select<00:02:34.290> engine<00:02:35.290> speed<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:36.280> you

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
I'm going to select engine speed so you

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.710 
I'm going to select engine speed so you
highlight<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.880> item<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.300> you<00:02:37.360> hit<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.570> enter

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
highlight the item and you hit the enter

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.190 
highlight the item and you hit the enter
key<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.080> it'll<00:02:38.290> put<00:02:38.440> an<00:02:38.530> asterisk<00:02:38.980> next<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.310> it

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
key and it'll put an asterisk next to it

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.580 
key and it'll put an asterisk next to it
and<00:02:41.200> we'll<00:02:41.380> go<00:02:41.500> down<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.920> mass<00:02:42.760> airflow<00:02:43.030> sensor

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.860 

the<00:02:48.860> one<00:02:49.220> of<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.400> front<00:02:49.670> oxygen<00:02:50.150> sensors<00:02:50.600> and

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
the one of the front oxygen sensors and

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.810 
the one of the front oxygen sensors and
then<00:02:51.140> we're<00:02:51.230> going<00:02:51.320> to<00:02:51.410> clip<00:02:51.620> hit<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:52.610> button

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
then we're going to clip hit the button

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.059 
then we're going to clip hit the button
is's<00:02:53.060> accept

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
is's accept

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.250 
is's accept
now<00:02:55.610> you'll<00:02:55.819> notice<00:02:56.030> what<00:02:56.329> it<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.599> it<00:02:56.810> took<00:02:56.930> it

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
now you'll notice what it is it took it

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.720 
now you'll notice what it is it took it
took<00:02:57.290> those<00:02:57.620> three<00:02:57.860> parameters<00:02:58.459> out<00:02:58.579> of<00:02:58.670> the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
took those three parameters out of the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.670 
took those three parameters out of the
list<00:02:58.879> and<00:02:59.060> put<00:02:59.150> them<00:02:59.329> up<00:02:59.480> on<00:02:59.629> the<00:02:59.719> top<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.530> they

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
list and put them up on the top so they

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.140 
list and put them up on the top so they
will<00:03:00.890> remain<00:03:01.189> up<00:03:01.370> there<00:03:01.579> all<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.879> time

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
will remain up there all the time

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.300 
will remain up there all the time
you<00:03:02.959> can<00:03:03.140> then<00:03:03.290> jump<00:03:03.590> through<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.980> rest<00:03:04.159> of

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
you can then jump through the rest of

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.589 
you can then jump through the rest of
the<00:03:04.400> list<00:03:04.549> and<00:03:04.730> keep<00:03:04.879> those<00:03:05.060> other<00:03:05.269> three

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
the list and keep those other three

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.839 
the list and keep those other three
active<00:03:05.980> simultaneously<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.340> allows<00:03:07.609> you<00:03:07.760> to

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
active simultaneously so allows you to

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.610 
active simultaneously so allows you to
pull<00:03:08.060> out<00:03:08.090> parameters<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.319> you<00:03:09.469> may<00:03:09.590> use

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
pull out parameters that you may use

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:34.159 
move to the misfire data list and then

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:36.460 
move to the misfire data list and then
do<00:04:34.310> it<00:04:34.430> accordingly<00:04:34.880> in<00:04:35.840> fact<00:04:36.080> that's<00:04:36.199> a<00:04:36.320> good

misfire on this vehicle I wanted to show
you<00:04:40.310> how<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.550> we<00:04:40.760> show<00:04:40.970> up<00:04:41.120> in<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.300> data<00:04:41.479> list

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
you how that we show up in the data list

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.110 
you how that we show up in the data list
so<00:04:42.409> rather<00:04:42.620> than<00:04:42.889> having<00:04:43.130> to<00:04:43.340> exit<00:04:43.729> out<00:04:43.820> back

now<00:05:16.150> you'll<00:05:16.330> notice<00:05:16.570> we<00:05:16.870> have<00:05:16.900> misfire

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
now you'll notice we have misfire

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.890 
now you'll notice we have misfire

fire it's also interesting here notice

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.620 
fire it's also interesting here notice
that<00:05:27.130> I'm<00:05:27.250> cylinder<00:05:27.700> one<00:05:27.910> is<00:05:28.060> showing<00:05:28.240> up<00:05:28.480> his

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
that I'm cylinder one is showing up his

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.080 
that I'm cylinder one is showing up his
misfire<00:05:29.110> and<00:05:29.470> we'll<00:05:30.310> talk<00:05:30.490> about<00:05:30.640> that<00:05:30.880> in<00:05:31.030> a

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
misfire and we'll talk about that in a

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.869 
misfire and we'll talk about that in a
second

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:34.879 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.089 

it'll<00:05:35.479> also<00:05:35.629> give<00:05:35.959> you<00:05:36.110> history<00:05:36.439> per<00:05:36.889> cylinder

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
it'll also give you history per cylinder

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.820 
it'll also give you history per cylinder
here<00:05:37.639> and<00:05:38.419> in<00:05:38.809> this<00:05:38.929> case<00:05:38.990> were<00:05:39.289> showing<00:05:39.319> up

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
here and in this case were showing up

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.040 
here and in this case were showing up
history<00:05:40.729> of<00:05:40.899> 1481<00:05:41.899> misfires<00:05:42.589> on<00:05:42.889> number<00:05:43.249> 1<00:05:43.490> and

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
history of 1481 misfires on number 1 and

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.299 
history of 1481 misfires on number 1 and
2800<00:05:45.050> on<00:05:45.169> cylinder<00:05:45.469> number<00:05:45.589> 3<00:05:47.919> so<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:49.039> rest<00:05:49.219> of

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:49.309 
2800 on cylinder number 3 so the rest of

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:50.760 
2800 on cylinder number 3 so the rest of
the<00:05:49.399> parameters<00:05:49.610> look<00:05:50.059> reasonably<00:05:50.509> normal

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
the parameters look reasonably normal

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.439 
the parameters look reasonably normal
now<00:05:51.770> I<00:05:52.069> could<00:05:52.490> at<00:05:52.610> this<00:05:52.699> point<00:05:52.789> if<00:05:53.029> I<00:05:53.119> wanted<00:05:53.360> to

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
now I could at this point if I wanted to

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.389 
now I could at this point if I wanted to
graph<00:05:53.719> this<00:05:53.990> data<00:05:54.319> I'm<00:05:54.740> gonna<00:05:54.949> select<00:05:55.219> the

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:55.399 
graph this data I'm gonna select the

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:57.570 
graph this data I'm gonna select the
more<00:05:55.610> key

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
more key

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.700 
more key
and<00:05:57.970> I'm<00:05:58.180> gonna<00:05:58.300> go<00:05:58.630> to<00:05:58.690> live<00:05:58.990> flock

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.640 

now<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.310> life<00:06:02.610> plot<00:06:03.000> is<00:06:03.240> going<00:06:03.539> to<00:06:03.750> plot<00:06:04.410> the

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
now the life plot is going to plot the

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.650 
now the life plot is going to plot the
parameters<00:06:05.220> that<00:06:05.310> I<00:06:05.460> had<00:06:05.639> selected<00:06:05.970> in<00:06:06.270> the

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
parameters that I had selected in the

parameters that I had selected in the
Select<00:06:07.440> list<00:06:07.680> earlier<00:06:08.070> I'm<00:06:08.400> going<00:06:08.639> to<00:06:08.699> go<00:06:08.759> back

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
Select list earlier I'm going to go back

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.550 
Select list earlier I'm going to go back
and<00:06:09.060> modify<00:06:09.210> that<00:06:09.660> because<00:06:09.930> in<00:06:10.050> this<00:06:10.139> case<00:06:10.350> I

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
and modify that because in this case I

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.540 
and modify that because in this case I
want<00:06:10.740> to<00:06:10.860> live<00:06:11.009> plot<00:06:11.340> my<00:06:11.850> misfire<00:06:12.449> graphic<00:06:13.550> so

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
want to live plot my misfire graphic so

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.000 
want to live plot my misfire graphic so
I'm<00:06:15.210> going<00:06:15.419> to<00:06:15.449> select<00:06:15.660> more

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.920 

and<00:06:20.340> I'm<00:06:20.610> going<00:06:20.730> to<00:06:20.760> go<00:06:20.880> back<00:06:21.030> to<00:06:21.060> select<00:06:21.540> items

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
and I'm going to go back to select items

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.330 
and I'm going to go back to select items
and<00:06:22.920> I'm<00:06:23.100> going<00:06:23.370> to<00:06:24.440> I'll<00:06:25.440> leave<00:06:25.740> engine<00:06:26.070> speed

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
and I'm going to I'll leave engine speed

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.980 
and I'm going to I'll leave engine speed
there<00:06:26.580> I'm<00:06:26.640> going<00:06:26.760> to<00:06:26.820> select<00:06:27.030> cylinder<00:06:27.750> one

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
there I'm going to select cylinder one

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.140 
there I'm going to select cylinder one
because<00:06:28.680> that<00:06:28.710> we<00:06:28.980> saw<00:06:29.190> a<00:06:29.220> misfire<00:06:29.730> on<00:06:29.760> there

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
because that we saw a misfire on there

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.340 
because that we saw a misfire on there
and<00:06:30.270> so<00:06:30.450> under<00:06:30.660> three

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.650 

we<00:06:33.830> clear<00:06:34.070> the<00:06:34.220> other<00:06:34.340> one

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.450 

it<00:06:39.170> will<00:06:39.320> only<00:06:39.380> allow<00:06:39.590> you<00:06:39.770> to<00:06:39.920> select<00:06:40.220> three

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
it will only allow you to select three

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.400 
it will only allow you to select three
total<00:06:41.350> so<00:06:42.350> I<00:06:42.410> had<00:06:42.530> to<00:06:42.590> go<00:06:42.710> clear<00:06:42.950> the<00:06:43.100> other<00:06:43.220> one

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
total so I had to go clear the other one

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.720 
total so I had to go clear the other one
and<00:06:44.500> then<00:06:44.650> we'll<00:06:44.800> click<00:06:44.980> accept<00:06:45.460> so<00:06:45.610> it's

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
and then we'll click accept so it's

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.880 
and then we'll click accept so it's
going<00:06:45.820> to<00:06:45.940> take<00:06:46.150> the<00:06:46.690> engine<00:06:46.960> speed<00:06:47.230> cylinder

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
going to take the engine speed cylinder

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.029 
going to take the engine speed cylinder
1<00:06:48.100> and<00:06:48.370> cylinder<00:06:48.850> number<00:06:49.000> 3

okay
now<00:07:33.590> we<00:07:33.650> should<00:07:33.889> have<00:07:33.919> all<00:07:34.129> three<00:07:34.370> graphed

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:34.940 
now we should have all three graphed

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.230 
now we should have all three graphed
there<00:07:35.300> we<00:07:35.389> go<00:07:36.370> so<00:07:37.370> we<00:07:37.460> have<00:07:37.490> the<00:07:37.729> thick<00:07:37.970> solid

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 
there we go so we have the thick solid

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.839 
there we go so we have the thick solid
line<00:07:38.599> is<00:07:38.629> the<00:07:38.930> engine<00:07:39.259> speed<00:07:39.560> the<00:07:40.250> thin<00:07:40.550> solid

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:40.849 
line is the engine speed the thin solid

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:42.999 
line is the engine speed the thin solid
line<00:07:41.150> is<00:07:41.180> cylinder<00:07:41.690> number<00:07:41.840> three<00:07:41.990> and<00:07:42.500> the

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:43.009 
line is cylinder number three and the

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:44.800 
line is cylinder number three and the
the<00:07:43.310> dotted<00:07:43.849> line<00:07:44.030> is<00:07:44.180> going<00:07:44.300> to<00:07:44.360> be<00:07:44.419> cylinder

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:44.810 
the dotted line is going to be cylinder

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:45.460 
the dotted line is going to be cylinder
number<00:07:45.080> one

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:45.470 
number one

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.070 
number one
and<00:07:46.150> you'll<00:07:47.150> notice<00:07:47.330> cylinder<00:07:47.810> number<00:07:47.960> three

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 
and you'll notice cylinder number three

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.080 
and you'll notice cylinder number three
misfires<00:07:48.800> climbing<00:07:49.430> a<00:07:49.490> lot<00:07:49.669> higher<00:07:49.879> than

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.090 
misfires climbing a lot higher than

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.930 
misfires climbing a lot higher than
cylinder<00:07:50.449> number<00:07:50.599> one
