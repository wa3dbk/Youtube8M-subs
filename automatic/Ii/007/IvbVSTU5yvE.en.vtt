pulled myself together I got really
angry<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.840> myself<00:00:31.410> my<00:00:31.830> best<00:00:32.040> friend<00:00:32.219> Michael

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
angry so myself my best friend Michael

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.639 
angry so myself my best friend Michael
and<00:00:32.820> Peter<00:00:33.059> arrived<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.899> an<00:00:33.960> isolated<00:00:34.079> beach

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
and Peter arrived at an isolated beach

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.100 
and Peter arrived at an isolated beach
to<00:00:34.980> take<00:00:35.160> up<00:00:35.340> my<00:00:35.489> aggression<00:00:36.090> using<00:00:36.480> science

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
to take up my aggression using science

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.260 
to take up my aggression using science
now<00:00:37.739> I'm<00:00:37.829> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.010> use<00:00:38.160> thermite<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.940> destroy

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
now I'm going to use thermite to destroy

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.540 
now I'm going to use thermite to destroy
this<00:00:39.450> piece<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.899> faulty<00:00:40.379> technology<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.309> for

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
this piece of faulty technology and for

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.650 
this piece of faulty technology and for
those<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.850> out<00:00:42.000> there<00:00:42.180> who<00:00:42.300> don't<00:00:42.420> know<00:00:42.510> what

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
those you out there who don't know what

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.600 
those you out there who don't know what
it<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:43.140> simply<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.559> two-tone<00:00:44.160> mixture<00:00:44.550> of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
it is it's simply a two-tone mixture of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 
it is it's simply a two-tone mixture of
a<00:00:44.700> metal<00:00:44.910> oxide<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.570> case<00:00:45.780> iron<00:00:46.260> 3<00:00:46.559> oxide

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
a metal oxide in this case iron 3 oxide

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.470 
a metal oxide in this case iron 3 oxide
and<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.250> metal<00:00:47.489> powder<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.270> case

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
and a metal powder in this case

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.360 
and a metal powder in this case
aluminium<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.350> I'm<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.100> ignite<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
aluminium and I'm going to ignite it

aluminium and I'm going to ignite it
using<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> magnesium<00:00:51.239> fuse<00:00:51.690> Direction<00:00:52.590> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
using a magnesium fuse Direction is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.610 
using a magnesium fuse Direction is
extremely<00:00:53.219> exothermic<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.030> hits<00:00:54.210> about<00:00:54.620> 2500

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
extremely exothermic and hits about 2500

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.439 
extremely exothermic and hits about 2500
degrees<00:00:55.860> Celsius<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.820> also<00:00:56.969> has<00:00:57.210> its<00:00:57.360> own

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
degrees Celsius it also has its own

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.880 
degrees Celsius it also has its own
oxygen<00:00:57.809> source<00:00:58.109> which<00:00:58.320> means<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.739> near

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
oxygen source which means it's near

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.010 
oxygen source which means it's near
impossible<00:00:59.489> control<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> lot<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.809> thought

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
impossible control so a lot of thought

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.389 
impossible control so a lot of thought
went<00:01:01.170> into<00:01:01.289> safety<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.340> if

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
went into safety and what to do if

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.399 
went into safety and what to do if
something<00:01:02.699> were<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.910> happen<00:01:03.090> however<00:01:03.930> one

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
something were to happen however one

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.840 
something were to happen however one
thing<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:04.860> didn't<00:01:05.100> count<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
thing that we didn't count on was a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:34.069 
thing that we didn't count on was a
faulty<00:01:06.299> blowtorch<00:01:32.659> now<00:01:33.659> let's<00:01:33.840> see<00:01:33.990> this

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
faulty blowtorch now let's see this

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:44.929 
faulty blowtorch now let's see this
closer

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:02:16.410 

directly<00:01:45.939> so<00:01:46.240> right<00:02:14.940> now<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.209> what<00:02:16.390> I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
directly so right now that is what I

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.110 
directly so right now that is what I
call<00:02:16.660> one<00:02:16.959> destroyed<00:02:17.500> Xbox<00:02:18.010> well<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:18.880> have<00:02:19.000> to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
call one destroyed Xbox well I have to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.970 
call one destroyed Xbox well I have to
say<00:02:19.269> apart<00:02:19.599> from<00:02:19.750> faulty<00:02:20.110> blowtorches<00:02:20.709> today

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
say apart from faulty blowtorches today

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.530 
say apart from faulty blowtorches today
was<00:02:21.130> complete<00:02:21.519> success<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:22.329> have<00:02:22.420> to

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
was complete success and I have to

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.940 
was complete success and I have to
remind<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.900> guys<00:02:22.930> not<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.530> try<00:02:23.709> this<00:02:23.769> at<00:02:23.890> home

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
remind you guys not to try this at home

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.819 
remind you guys not to try this at home
it's<00:02:24.700> extremely<00:02:25.390> dangerous<00:02:25.530> anyway<00:02:26.530> that's

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
it's extremely dangerous anyway that's

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:27.930 
it's extremely dangerous anyway that's
the<00:02:26.890> end<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.069> this<00:02:27.160> one<00:02:27.340> remember<00:02:27.700> to

the end of this one remember to

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.509 
the end of this one remember to
subscribe<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.810> science<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.680> write<00:02:30.400> in

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
subscribe the science and write in

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.700 
subscribe the science and write in
comment<00:02:30.849> alright<00:02:31.480> bye<00:02:31.810> guys
