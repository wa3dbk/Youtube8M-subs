come here yeah and that's it sounds out
of<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:53.010> factory<00:02:53.370> here<00:02:53.580> yeah<00:02:54.210> this<00:02:54.540> way<00:02:54.690> the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
of this factory here yeah this way the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.830 
of this factory here yeah this way the
factory<00:02:55.170> right<00:02:55.620> here<00:02:56.090> for<00:02:57.090> much<00:02:57.240> so<00:02:57.660> we're

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
factory right here for much so we're

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.150 
factory right here for much so we're
going<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.020> go<00:02:58.080> fill<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> factory<00:02:58.830> right

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
going to go fill in the factory right

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.250 
going to go fill in the factory right
now<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.520> can<00:02:59.670> check<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.030> factory<00:03:00.540> which<00:03:01.080> is

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
now you can check the factory which is

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.810 
now you can check the factory which is
the<00:03:01.410> home<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.800> factory<00:03:02.220> home<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.030> factory

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
the home that factory home that factory

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.760 
the home that factory home that factory
so<00:03:05.820> here's<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.440> box<00:03:07.440> chip<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.950> 13<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.740> a

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
so here's a box chip a 13 this is a

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.090 
so here's a box chip a 13 this is a
simplified<00:03:11.460> and<00:03:11.820> cheaper<00:03:12.270> motherboard<00:03:13.100> if

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
simplified and cheaper motherboard if

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.480 
simplified and cheaper motherboard if
i'll<00:03:14.550> have<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.730> library<00:03:15.270> is<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.570> very<00:03:16.140> cool

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
i'll have that library is the very cool

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:27.020 
i'll have that library is the very cool
big<00:03:17.490> battery<00:03:20.510> 2600<00:03:21.510> media<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:23.960> screen<00:03:26.030> what

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
big battery 2600 media and screen what

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.840 
big battery 2600 media and screen what
is<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.240> connector<00:03:28.640> little<00:03:29.640> better

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
is this connector little better

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.530 
is this connector little better
something<00:03:31.280> this<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.430> well<00:03:32.670> if<00:03:33.000> i<00:03:33.180> just<00:03:33.209> had

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
something this is well if i just had

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.949 
something this is well if i just had
those<00:03:33.770> so<00:03:35.060> just<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.180> save<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.450> little<00:03:36.660> bit<00:03:36.750> than

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
those so just to save a little bit than

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.600 
those so just to save a little bit than
the<00:03:37.020> hdmi<00:03:37.500> port<00:03:39.470> but<00:03:40.470> i<00:03:40.500> cannot<00:03:40.739> think<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.340> the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
the hdmi port but i cannot think of the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.300 
the hdmi port but i cannot think of the
other<00:03:42.330> parts<00:03:42.690> could<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.930> be<00:03:43.080> all<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:43.590> there

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
other parts could it be all so there

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.340 
other parts could it be all so there
might<00:03:44.430> be<00:03:44.489> something<00:03:45.060> else<00:03:45.330> is<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.870> same<00:03:46.050> ram

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
might be something else is the same ram

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:55.140 
might be something else is the same ram
same<00:03:47.010> cpu<00:03:47.400> same<00:03:48.180> GPU<00:03:49.080> yeah

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.530
