00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
 Welcome to Adygio's kitchen 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.480
 today we make the strawberry cake with strawberry flavor 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.900
 we will need 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.440
 300 grams of strawberry pudding powder 

00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:14.136
 200 g of melted butter 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.760
 250 g of sugar 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.600
 9 whites 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.540
 a liter of warm milk 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.500
 9 yolks 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.240
 a pinch of salt 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.580
 and 10 ml of vanilla essence 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.640
 I'll mix yolks with sugar 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.284
 until they become creamy 

00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:32.717
 and will open up 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.040
 I will add the melted butter and mix again 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.960
 I will add the essence of vanilla 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.980
 I will gradually add one tablespoon of the pudding powder 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.626
 until I finish it 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.220
 I will add the milk gradually until I finish it 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.760
 I will beat the egg whites with a salt of salt 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.500
 we'll beat them until we get a hard foam 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.340
 we will also incorporate whiskey foam into the composition 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.580
 I will do this operation with the mixer 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.860
 because the hook behaves like a spatula 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.040
 you can incorporate the white foam in the composition 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.080
 with a spatula with large upward movements 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.400
 the composition for the smart cake is ready 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.337
 and put it in a tray 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.620
 with dimensions of 20/30 cm 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.860
 which I have taped with baking paper 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.400
 I'll tie the tray to the pre-sintered oven at 160C 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.459
 for 60/70 minutes 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.160
 I took the cake from the oven 

00:03:42.508 --> 00:03:44.508
 we will let it cool 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.380
 after which it can be cut and served 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.980
 I hope you like it and you will try it 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.920
 thank you for your attention 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.340
 all good until the next recipe 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.283
 Bye Bye !!!
