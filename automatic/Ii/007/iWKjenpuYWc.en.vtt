00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.269
 hello people here again europe today 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.059
 there is again a video to call of duty 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.190
 in other words, in addition, extension mode 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.870
 and call of duty cost and I want you 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.000
 show in this video today like that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.070
 Level system in exchange mode 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.960
 this works differently 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.720
 actually not that much of that 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.730
 level system in the multiplayer of call of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.500
 the ghost but on what I want 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.840
 Show you exactly in the video I would 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.390
 say how many levels there are and off 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.870
 when its the prestige mode goes and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.280
 I also want to show what the relics in 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.260
 Extension mode have to do 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.200
 Well, let's start with that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.739
 level system and how many levels 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.390
 There are a total of 30 levels and there are 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.910
 you can simply ascend in which her 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.910
 nests barbian destroyed when the aliens 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.649
 kills and gets quite a lot of points 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.180
 her if she escapes in a game 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.219
 that means you have to escape 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.800
 and then there's the extra bonus 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.750
 and also gets an extra bonus again 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.460
 if you have a relic but active too 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.280
 those who come left as we said 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.320
 Good later, there are 30 levels 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.340
 always rises at the end of the game or 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.080
 in the middle of the game 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.090
 and yes then if we are 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.220
 climbed all over the screen and 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.689
 because he knows he is rising and yes it is 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.270
 actually such a simple level system 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.520
 like multiple already and if so 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.350
 it now has the level you reach 30 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.580
 then you have it only accomplish 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.979
 and that's actually here now 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.350
 somehow 100,000 points or 200,000 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.750
 points and these are already 1 examples 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.610
 with flight and yes if you have that full 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.590
 then you go automatically in that 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.090
 prestige mode that means we have to 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.840
 not only then press somewhere 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.579
 to press 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.860
 and now get a new one 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.750
 prestige emblem and that you keep 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.490
 again until the next prestige 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.920
 reaches level 30 again 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.570
 as there are 30 levels and if thats you 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.340
 thirtieth level full then you go 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.020
 you automatically in the next press 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.360
 and so you had to play it there 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.240
 a total of five procedures and at 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.299
 fifth prestige it goes to level 31 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.920
 and then he shows through completely and me 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.899
 actually find the fifth prestige 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.259
 bliem really cool looks really nice 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.610
 out 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.319
 I can see if I can 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.780
 somehow you can fade in the video 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.590
 but like me yes I think it's really going on 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.239
 and pulls right too 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.879
 good from good , we come to the 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.140
 Delicts yes the relics were 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.000
 actually for me in the beginning already one 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.590
 funny thing i knew exactly i got 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.599
 not even the successes is carried at 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.670
 call of duty big and there was something 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.069
 she escapes with five relics or with 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.569
 a hearing lies and after that receives that 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.819
 can only mean something good 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.019
 and then I looked 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.340
 also a few pages and then I have 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.900
 actually read or only means 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.360
 bad yes now I'm in the first 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.160
 prestige and I do not really know 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.160
 to be in such a hurry 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.019
 why it actually only brings one 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.110
 more disadvantages than advantages 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:52.590
 every fixed relic there are 500 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.630
 put one always gets a relict place 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.880
 for a passive so at the first price 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.670
 get the one is the 5 3 victory 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.680
 the five relics can be cleaned up and that 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.269
 the only other good thing that can happen is 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.670
 I already say you get in 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.860
 multiplayer titles and emblems that is 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.840
 actually really cool and you 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.030
 as I said before, already the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.879
 Relic bonus is an extra bonus 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.190
 where he ends up already 100,000 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.840
 has more points than her colleagues 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.299
 that's why it's already one 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.739
 Well , bonuses to leveling are better 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.780
 That's why I always would 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.500
 Relics and now we come to the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.989
 disadvantages 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.000
 the disadvantages are the first delict there 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.829
 less harm so you can aliens 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.380
 Do less harm then there is still 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.870
 sometimes that is more harm of the 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.819
 aliens then gets the next relic 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.410
 is that now you play with the pistol 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.930
 that means you can not have weapons 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.329
 buy that it stupid if it were the 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.519
 challenge has that specifically with eg 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.859
 then kill the assault guns is the 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.750
 Challenge already failed then there is 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.370
 Another relic that you can not class 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.530
 Can not choose that can mean no 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.870
 Paramedics are not a technician 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.120
 Panzer not a specialist that you can 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.680
 do not pick everything and the last one is 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.930
 that you get less money 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.639
 or all halves that 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.709
 If you have six from the inventory 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.109
 you can only have 3000 and 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.239
 from the island itself the actually 90 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.599
 you only get points 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.099
 still 45 so everything is half past 40 and therefore 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.440
 rather difficult to get away to the 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:22.169
 escape and yes that's all 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.969
 what to add to the level system in the accenture 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.630
 mode to can yes yes I can only 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:27.150
 little exactly 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.280
 at the first level of 130 switches 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.199
 you always have something free so protected 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.000
 everything is like multiplayer im 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.100
 multiplayer you would weapons perks and 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.460
 so on here unlock one switches 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.620
 the equipments free of 130 g and the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.789
 the cool sven drastically back then 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.220
 you do not have to do it all again 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:46.620
 Unlock everything you have until the end 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.880
 So once you have level 30 time 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.590
 you always have all the equipment 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.720
 unlocked that's pretty cool 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.759
 and that's why it's easier with 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.660
 Relics according to the precision 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.580
 escape 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.710
 yes i think i hope i could 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.199
 you the levelsystem in the exhibition mode 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.639
 explain well and he would therefore have 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.150
 I say I hope you have the video 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.229
 like 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.229
 Until next time
