00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.570
 ah yes 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.010
 hi everyone is phoenix pay 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.060
 today I am happy to you 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.830
 find for a new video 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.599
 commented on call of duty modern strong 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.789
 of vaulion will end up for my 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.650
 first nuclear bomb on xbox 360 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.820
 as you can see I buy 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.529
 an xbox 360 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.090
 so first of all I want to say that 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.699
 I did not let go that I did not sell my 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.739
 ps3 as far as I keep it because I 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.660
 have to have about 30 games on it and 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.920
 honestly even though I had sold it I 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.470
 did not win much because 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.360
 in fact this is the first ps3 that I have 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.860
 I bought them the year of its release and 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.500
 she's getting a little old 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.170
 as much at level 2 of the time she puts 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.670
 to light up at the level of its state 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.620
 because she has a lot of 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.600
 dust in the fan I was able 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.520
 see this when I when I host 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.780
 and that I installed the xbox instead 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.350
 clearly there is a lot of dust 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.660
 behind 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.860
 and for three to four months she was putting 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.270
 a lot of time to light up it's up to 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.130
 to say that I put at least a quarter 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.720
 of time to light it actually I had fled 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.070
 on the button she salutes my three 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.600
 seconds they go off and I press 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.390
 on the celine button 3 seconds and so 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.550
 right away it's really boring because 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.960
 listen when you come back the evenings that 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.490
 you want to make a good 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.450
 little playes you already have not 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.520
 a lot of time because you have 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.869
 homework or so you left 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.270
 late he did not necessarily want 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.340
 to go to spend your evening on 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.200
 the console just story to relax a 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.579
 little bit and you 're already putting a quarter 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.680
 of time to him but I must confess it's 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.810
 still pretty boring so that's for 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.210
 that I want to dismount it I'm going to make a 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.409
 little bit sorting in there because at 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.150
 my opinion he must have a lot of 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.890
 junk dust you do not know what 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.360
 I put a little bit of cloth after that 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.920
 we'll see if she even a little less 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.869
 of time to light any case if there is 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.280
 people who have had sabam and 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.990
 witness in the comments what you 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280
 did that for that 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.479
 walk back normally because I have to 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.430
 wants that makes me a little shit 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.130
 so at the level of my xbox I have them 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.930
 purchased for the moment at the level of 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.189
 connection 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.469
 honestly I do not see a big fat 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.729
 change even though the gameplay 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.990
 you will see you while I have 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.729
 four bars of qu at the beginning 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.959
 in fact I had a little bit of 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.400
 mouth with my brother because he 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.959
 was on the computer loading videos on 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.160
 youtube and would be when you have 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.660
 someone who is looking for videos on 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.450
 youtube while you are in the process 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.940
 to not necessarily play that 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.769
 these bad especially as you say 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.870
 often in me caused me a lack of 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.280
 big shit so that will carry in 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.780
 parties with two connecting bars 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.200
 end it was really great 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.849
 what 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.349
 then I'll stop you and 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.019
 of course my first nuclear bomb 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.130
 story of finally proposing a new 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.599
 video because it's true that there I 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.340
 went on vacation and then my 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.569
 during the holidays like a lot of 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.250
 nobody wants to do 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.230
 videos like I'm telling you this is going 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.680
 to be back I will enjoy it for 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.790
 put me to the bottom so now I 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.069
 am a little bit tell you why 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.060
 I bought this xbox 360 because it 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.799
 would be that since the beginning of the video 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.930
 I speak a lot about my connection 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.370
 but it's not the connection that made me 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.840
 buy an xbox 360 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.099
 because what you need to know is that 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.019
 I am not a player who passes 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.099
 a lot of time on the console for 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.230
 tell you from the beginning of the holidays 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.060
 I may have spent 8 to 9 hours 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.069
 played call of duty or other games 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.840
 really that's not what made me 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.410
 buy this console it's really 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.599
 reasons that are much more important 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.130
 in my eyes and that concerns you and who 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.540
 also concerns me because it 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.310
 regards the future of my youtube channel 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.739
 and so the future of my youtube channel 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.350
 also concerns you as you 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.200
 know zachary 78 with whom I have a series 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.079
 h tennis box 360 two months ago 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.180
 I believe and we had just launched a 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.700
 small series wholesale we made 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.079
 double kantari queues live and on his 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.370
 double files pontarion there it is down 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.440
 agreements and nuclear bombs on 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.359
 classes you gave us 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.799
 unfortunately can not continue this 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.290
 series since we were not on the same 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.940
 console it seems quite logical and for 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.700
 continue this series by a cottage is 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.049
 obliged to buy nicox 360 but that's 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.310
 true that this series in addition she had 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.230
 you really like to look we had 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.850
 already made some videos announcement there 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.310
 had a lot of I like a lot of sight 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.569
 and we too with zachary 78 we were 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.390
 really motivated to make you this 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.220
 series and 5 we had a little bit 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.500
 we will say a stand by on this series 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.360
 considering that it was there on xbox 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.430
 360 and that today I am 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.790
 certain to be able to continue this series 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.170
 with him and already I think that's 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.070
 still a reason that is enough 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.630
 important to me 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.310
 and that's why I could buy some 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.530
 this xbox 360 we will say that it is 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.270
 still 50% of my purchase 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.710
 otherwise regarding the gameplay 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.300
 watch just come out of my 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.500
 gunner the ico unfortunately I 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.990
 not had my little nuclear bomb 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.690
 I still have 7 fraga to do because I 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.980
 am at 18.0 I have more trouble in my 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.360
 women at this game I must admit that 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.950
 I was a little bit in the shit but 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.690
 luckily on skype and in the party 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.070
 is accompanied by my justin savior 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.290
 company of a youtuber colleague who 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.780
 escarra 45 and 55 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.130
 he will kill himself to come and give me 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.930
 ammunition I think it was 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.780
 ammunition of a camp 47 it must be that 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.460
 here he is they kill themselves and here I am 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.660
 pick up my little ak-47 silently who 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.020
 will allow me to get my bomb 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.610
 nuclear 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.100
 so frankly a big thank you to you 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.260
 because without health ammunition I would have 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.680
 failed to get my little bomb 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.870
 nuclear 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.700
 then at the level of the patterns there are some 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.900
 two others that are important we will 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.190
 to say that there I really quote you the 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.050
 three most important reasons I 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.600
 already mentioned 1 is the series with 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.030
 those who laugh and the next reason is 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.520
 that he must have at least 80% of the friends 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.460
 which are on xbox 360 while there are some 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.960
 only 26 have on the playstation 3 and 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.870
 5 in recent months I have not hurt myself 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.160
 shit on on the ps3 even though i have 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.180
 still played a lot with the team and 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.620
 we honestly thank them 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.690
 because the stalemate really of very 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.340
 good times with devil bats morning and 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.360
 all this but inevitably does not happen to 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.860
 connect at the same time we do not arrive 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.720
 to capture at the same time and at the end of a 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.890
 moment not to play alone that that 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.249
 tired a little bit and I was a little 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.269
 just dismissed it all 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:43.259
 that's why it's 

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:45.419
 behind me you do not know much 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.589
 of videos is here with my return on 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.989
 xbox 360 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:51.119
 I could play with friends rl because 

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:52.559
 I have a lot of real friends on xbox 360 

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:54.269
 I played more with colleagues 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.369
 youtuber and find old ones 

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:57.689
 knowledge that was on ps3 before he 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:59.609
 must admit that it really made me 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.019
 greatest pleasure that was it was 

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:02.189
 really the second reason there was 

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:03.659
 reason that is important to me 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.819
 because it would be that when you play 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.379
 and you get tired playing yourself alone 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:09.329
 you will have who can without motivation one 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.649
 will say that you play to play without 

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:12.749
 really take great pleasure with 

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:14.879
 your friends not necessarily behind you 

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:16.110
 not necessarily beautiful parts and 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:18.269
 that in fact not beautiful parts can be 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.159
 not to live is why that 

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:22.229
 it's really very very important is 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.569
 the third reason is the dlc 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:27.329
 because as you know the dlc so 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.610
 months ahead of time on xbox 360 and would 

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:31.739
 that it was a bit disgusted to me to see 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.659
 maps arrive a month later because 

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:35.489
 when youtube hours necessarily want 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:37.229
 to make videos discovered the 

00:06:35.489 --> 00:06:38.669
 discover the map with you and even 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.169
 when he had the zombie map that 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.069
 was coming out on call of duty black ops there 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.929
 had the secrets that they were 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:45.779
 discovered before the map came out on 

00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:47.009
 ps3 so after that it's really that 

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:48.929
 loses interest there is more really 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:51.509
 surprise and I was pretty much struggling 

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:53.309
 and that too on his black ops with w3 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:53.729
 here I am developing my little bomb 

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:54.899
 nuclear 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:56.249
 you see that I pick up at 

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:58.229
 intervention parterre young a small 

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.939
 little shit on the final crips end 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.860
 their buddies can be said because I 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:03.839
 play in sensitivity 3 you I played 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.309
 with a weapon other than the sniper and 

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:07.439
 when I play sniper generally 

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:09.899
 playing sensitivity 7 on that I put 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:11.939
 more time to turn my sights here 

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:13.469
 anyway I know that 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:15.029
 people you are a little bit disappointed I 

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:17.189
 know that I'm starting as early as June doc goes 

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:18.839
 to see dislike but despite that I do not 

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:21.029
 do not loose the ps3 because I bought 

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:22.739
 only modern warfare 2 and black ops 

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:24.209
 on the xbox ie when I 

00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:26.909
 want or popo offer you videos 

00:07:24.209 --> 00:07:28.799
 of mw3 I will have to come back that I 

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:30.569
 come back on the ps3 and I count well 

00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:32.879
 go replay with my knowledge of 

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:34.019
 ps3 that's why I keep it 

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:36.059
 and then my I still have a 

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:38.039
 thirty games on it and I 

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:39.839
 really do not intend to let go of this 

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:41.669
 console anyway that's I hope that 

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:43.979
 you will have passed a good in my company 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.329
 thought to put a little like if 

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:47.159
 you enjoy working you have 

00:07:45.329 --> 00:07:48.479
 enjoyed this video despite the fact that 

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:50.489
 I can disappoint some people 

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:52.409
 honestly I think that along 

00:07:50.489 --> 00:07:53.630
 term it allows me to do more than 

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:56.360
 videos 

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.710
 previously to have this xbox on this I 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.450
 wish you all a happy new year 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.280
 do not stress too much it's okay 

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.360
 go see it must it must be 

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.470
 put back in the bath and then after we 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.770
 is gone 1 that's how each 

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.360
 year 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.050
 this is taking care of yourself and at the 

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.050
 next go ciao
