00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
look at all these images and there's an

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.370 
look at all these images and there's an
incredible<00:01:26.100> amount<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.700> energy<00:01:27.380> incredible

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
incredible amount of energy incredible

incredible amount of energy incredible
amount<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.650> energy<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.840> energy<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.020> very

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
amount of energy and energy is very

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.300 
amount of energy and energy is very
energy<00:01:32.190> as<00:01:32.250> an<00:01:32.430> optimistic<00:01:33.020> quality<00:01:34.160> so<00:01:35.160> it's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
energy as an optimistic quality so it's

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.469 
energy as an optimistic quality so it's
not<00:01:35.430> only<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.090> color<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:37.650> passion<00:01:38.190> the

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
not only the color the passion the

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.090 
not only the color the passion the
sentiment<00:01:39.479> that's<00:01:39.720> that's<00:01:40.110> derived<00:01:40.740> from

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
sentiment that's that's derived from

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.520 
sentiment that's that's derived from
looking<00:01:41.670> at<00:01:41.700> these<00:01:41.880> pictures<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.660> think<00:01:43.440> is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
looking at these pictures I think is

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.120 
looking at these pictures I think is
also<00:01:43.770> them<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.580> sense<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.360> nothing<00:01:46.130> nothing

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
also them the sense that nothing nothing

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.120 
also them the sense that nothing nothing
stops<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.790> nothing<00:01:48.150> is<00:01:48.270> impossible<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
stops and nothing is impossible and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.800 
stops and nothing is impossible and
there's<00:01:50.130> always<00:01:50.280> another<00:01:50.640> horizon<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.720> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
there's always another horizon it's a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.770 
there's always another horizon it's a
very<00:01:51.990> optimistic<00:01:52.560> thought
