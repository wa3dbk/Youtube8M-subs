00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.740
 Today I bring you the recipe for sponge cake 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.740
 moist and fluffy chocolate 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.849
 and for this we are going to use 100 grams 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.690
 chocolate powder 50 ml coffee 2 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.550
 eggs 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.460
 10 grams of yeast powder 100 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.670
 milliliters of sunflower oil 240 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:28.010
 grams of flour 150 milliliters of milk 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:32.239
 and 400 grams of sugar and we already have 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.780
 ready the flour the sugar the milk the 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.989
 oil the eggs the cocoa powder the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.850
 coffee and yeast to start we're going to 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.969
 separate the whites from the yolks of the 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.969
 eggs 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.220
 once separated with the help of a 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.489
 rod blender we are going to take it to 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.950
 snow point once we can do 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.020
 peaks we are going to incorporate the sugar 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.020
 little by little until you get meringue 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.180
 as you see this texture is what we 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.860
 must be of the meringue 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.350
 now we take the two yolks and the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:52.039
 we incorporate the meringue one at a time and 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:54.020
 we keep beating once we have it 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:58.119
 we take the flour and with the help of a 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.119
 sieve the masters sieve over the meringue 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:10.700
 and this step will help us to 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.450
 our cake is much more 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.450
 spongy 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.770
 Once we have it, we will move it with 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:29.510
 spatula help with movements 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:32.020
 envelopes we take the yeast and 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.020
 we add also 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.799
 now we incorporate the milk little by little 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.799
 while stirring 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:12.560
 and now we take chocolate powder and 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.560
 sieve masters over the mixture 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.050
 once we have it, we are going to remove it 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.050
 with enveloping movements 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.909
 we will be leaving a mixture like this 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.239
 we also incorporate coffee 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.200
 and finally the oil now we are going to 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.800
 stir well has to be all right 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.800
 integrated 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.740
 As you can see, we should stay there for 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.230
 this recipe I will use the mold 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.750
 lékué silicon glass 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.730
 now we take the cake dough and the 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.470
 let's dump in our mold in the 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.060

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.690
 see the state of our sponge cake in 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.690
 every moment 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.810
 We preheat the oven to 200 degrees but 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:48.990
 we're going to bake it for an hour and 40 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:50.819
 minutes at 175 degrees a median more than 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.310
 we see with the mold let's proceed to 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.530
 dismantle it I have picked up a plate and 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:00.750
 I have turned around and as you can see 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:02.610
 unmolds very easily and finally I 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.530
 I'm going to take icing sugar and I'm going to 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.530
