00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
to do with message timestamps I'm a

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.759 
to do with message timestamps I'm a
surgeon<00:02:46.129> keyword<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.760> I'm<00:02:47.540> trying<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.930> do

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
surgeon keyword that I'm trying to do

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.110 
surgeon keyword that I'm trying to do
like<00:02:49.010> time<00:02:49.220> stopped

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.880 

so<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.180> search<00:02:53.360> timestamp<00:02:54.049> and<00:02:54.260> there's<00:02:54.799> a

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
so I search timestamp and there's a

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.729 
so I search timestamp and there's a
bunch<00:02:55.099> of<00:02:55.190> different<00:02:55.370> ones<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:56.739> include

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
bunch of different ones that include

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.030 
bunch of different ones that include
time<00:02:57.950> stamping<00:02:58.400> let's<00:02:59.090> see<00:02:59.359> and<00:02:59.859> then<00:03:00.859> this

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
time stamping let's see and then this

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.369 
time stamping let's see and then this
one<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.370> says<00:03:01.489> should<00:03:01.819> show<00:03:02.150> timestamp<00:03:03.049> for

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
one that says should show timestamp for

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.349 
one that says should show timestamp for
date<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:04.400> we're<00:03:04.519> go<00:03:04.700> ahead<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:04.940> check<00:03:05.329> that
