in<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> 1950s<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:48.000> know<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.420> technology

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
in the 1950s you know the technology

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.619 
in the 1950s you know the technology
just<00:00:49.800> started<00:00:50.100> increasing<00:00:50.340> advanced<00:00:51.120> Lee<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
just started increasing advanced Lee and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
just started increasing advanced Lee and
we<00:00:52.350> ended<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.860> war<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.219> China<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
we ended up in a war with China and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.400 
we ended up in a war with China and
within<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.079> war<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.469> China<00:00:56.539> it<00:00:57.539> ended<00:00:58.079> by

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
within this war with China it ended by

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.920 
within this war with China it ended by
having<00:00:58.859> tons<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.579> nuclear<00:01:00.030> bombs<00:01:00.359> hit

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
having tons of nuclear bombs hit

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.799 
having tons of nuclear bombs hit
everyone<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.430> was<00:01:02.699> basically<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.210> nuclear

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
everyone so it was basically a nuclear

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.130 
everyone so it was basically a nuclear
holocaust<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.710> then<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:08.479> 2277<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:09.990> where

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
holocaust and then in 2277 this is where

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.280 
holocaust and then in 2277 this is where

this is what's left of Washington DC
after<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.470> nuclear<00:01:22.650> war<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.990> game<00:01:25.229> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470

you have a horse and when you start up
all<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.240> locations<00:01:45.600> already<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.409> map<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
all the locations already on your map to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.010 
all the locations already on your map to
teleport<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.700> fall<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.840> to

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
teleport to and fall out you have to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.990 
teleport to and fall out you have to
find<00:01:49.290> all<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.680> locations<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.850> have

nothing<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.720> feet<00:01:51.920> making<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.100> gain<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
nothing but your feet making the gain a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.120 
nothing but your feet making the gain a
lot<00:01:53.520> slower<00:01:53.820> pace<00:01:54.270> than<00:01:54.299> Olivia<00:01:56.119> now<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.890> game

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
lot slower pace than Olivia now the game

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.550 
lot slower pace than Olivia now the game
still<00:01:59.430> stays<00:01:59.969> true<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.840> original<00:02:00.869> fallout

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
still stays true to the original fallout

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.399 
still stays true to the original fallout
in<00:02:01.950> some<00:02:02.219> ways<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.850> VAT<00:02:03.060> system<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.780> very<00:02:04.200> very

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
in some ways the VAT system is very very

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.920 
in some ways the VAT system is very very
similar<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.280> targeting<00:02:05.850> system<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
similar to the targeting system on the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.850 
similar to the targeting system on the
original<00:02:07.409> games<00:02:07.680> with<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> turn-based<00:02:08.629> style

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
original games with the turn-based style

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.860 
original games with the turn-based style
so<00:02:10.860> there's<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.730> thing

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
so there's one thing

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.140 
so there's one thing
and<00:02:13.019> teleporting<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:13.860> very<00:02:14.129> very<00:02:14.430> easy<00:02:14.790> all

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
and teleporting is very very easy all

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.420 
and teleporting is very very easy all
you<00:02:15.360> have<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.659> do<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.930> click<00:02:16.170> on<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.379> map<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.010> bam

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
you have to do is click on a map and bam

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.380 
you have to do is click on a map and bam
you're<00:02:17.790> there<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.980> game<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.459> brilliantly
