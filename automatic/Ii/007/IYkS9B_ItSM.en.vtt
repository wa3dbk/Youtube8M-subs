00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.510 
little prediction kind of give away if
you<00:02:53.450> guys<00:02:53.630> can<00:02:53.870> predict<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.380> bang<00:02:54.950> on<00:02:55.190> the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
you guys can predict that bang on the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.340 
you guys can predict that bang on the
scarf<00:02:55.850> bang<00:02:56.180> on<00:02:56.330> I'll<00:02:56.570> give<00:02:56.720> you<00:02:56.780> ten<00:02:56.990> k<00:02:57.170> each

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
scarf bang on I'll give you ten k each

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.540 
scarf bang on I'll give you ten k each
because<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.650> think<00:02:57.710> it's<00:02:57.980> gonna<00:02:58.100> be<00:02:58.250> quite<00:02:58.400> an

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
because I think it's gonna be quite an

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.610 
because I think it's gonna be quite an
easy<00:02:58.670> game<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:58.970> predict<00:02:59.420> Manchester<00:03:00.290> United

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
easy game to predict Manchester United

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.750 
easy game to predict Manchester United
should<00:03:00.800> smash<00:03:01.130> them<00:03:01.310> so<00:03:01.460> that's<00:03:01.610> what<00:03:01.700> were

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
should smash them so that's what were

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.790 
should smash them so that's what were
going<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:01.940> go<00:03:02.030> for<00:03:02.300> their<00:03:02.510> leave<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.380> game<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:03.680> of

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
going to go for their leave a game is of

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.360 
going to go for their leave a game is of
course<00:03:03.950> everton<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:04.820> spurs<00:03:05.410> in<00:03:06.410> fact<00:03:06.800> should

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
course everton and spurs in fact should

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.280 
course everton and spurs in fact should
we<00:03:07.490> should<00:03:07.820> make<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.030> interesting<00:03:08.390> should<00:03:09.170> we

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
we should make it interesting should we

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.610 
we should make it interesting should we
go<00:03:09.470> if<00:03:09.830> you<00:03:10.010> can<00:03:10.190> predict<00:03:10.460> both<00:03:10.730> games<00:03:11.410> bang<00:03:12.410> on

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
go if you can predict both games bang on

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.710 
go if you can predict both games bang on
so<00:03:13.010> if<00:03:13.340> it's<00:03:13.550> for<00:03:13.850> example<00:03:14.240> you're<00:03:14.540> guessing

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
so if it's for example you're guessing

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.900 
so if it's for example you're guessing
11<00:03:15.260> /<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.650> then<00:03:15.800> to<00:03:16.130> nil<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.520> Manchester

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
11 / and then to nil to Manchester

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.240 
11 / and then to nil to Manchester
United<00:03:17.300> if<00:03:17.450> you<00:03:17.840> get<00:03:18.050> them<00:03:18.200> bang<00:03:18.410> on<00:03:18.590> i<00:03:18.800> will

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
United if you get them bang on i will

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.870 
United if you get them bang on i will
give<00:03:19.520> you<00:03:20.500> 30<00:03:21.500> k<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.070> we're<00:03:22.430> raising<00:03:22.610> the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
give you 30 k so we're raising the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.580 
give you 30 k so we're raising the
stakes<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.270> bit<00:03:23.390> now<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:24.200> that's<00:03:24.380> what<00:03:24.500> I'm
