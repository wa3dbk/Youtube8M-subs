00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.390
 I would like to introduce the directionality of things with few homes 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.600
 I will explain the developer 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.409
 First of all 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.969
 This type switch 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.399
 Here's a normal chorus 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:15.709
 When multicore soars 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.179
 From these three types 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.050
 Can be selected 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.189
 Next this mode switch 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.470
 I think here circle mode 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.930
 Another 2 billion yuan 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.819
 However 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:27.640
 Wintering 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.930
 There will be people involved in responding to Mandarin education 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.050
 how is it 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.080
 This lamp mode is 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.550
 For those who talk about effects only during this bypass 1 episode 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.490
 There is 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.260
 And with this backrest, this is the first speed of eight schools 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.400
 Do and decide 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.970
 In mix-chanami 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.210
 Ikoko small mix good I will continue 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.640
 And this middle of this narrow but 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.060
 If the receiving lamp mode is already selected, go to 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.460
 When a person of power is chosen, the pitch develops above 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.530
 It also takes effects 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.530
 Adjustment delay is forbidden 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.310
 root 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.660
 I said that this is Koichiro Overwintering 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.950
 I will do this 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.090
 Chase at the end 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.730
 Here is the depth of eco-life 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.600
 Decide 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.600
 Please listen to the sound actually 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 Yearly 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.510
 Rice 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.490
 this time
