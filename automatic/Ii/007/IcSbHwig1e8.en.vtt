trees and I'm here today to talk to you
about<00:00:12.959> pruning<00:00:14.030> in<00:00:15.030> particular<00:00:15.299> we're<00:00:15.749> going

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
about pruning in particular we're going

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.380 
about pruning in particular we're going
to<00:00:15.900> focus<00:00:16.110> on<00:00:16.440> younger<00:00:16.890> trees<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.610> how<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.210> can

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
to focus on younger trees and how we can

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.570 
to focus on younger trees and how we can
prune<00:00:18.599> them<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.199> encourage<00:00:19.830> their<00:00:20.099> vigorous

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
prune them to encourage their vigorous

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.550 
prune them to encourage their vigorous
and<00:00:20.849> healthy<00:00:21.029> growth<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.420> sound<00:00:22.230> structure

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
and healthy growth and sound structure

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.210 
and healthy growth and sound structure
as<00:00:22.830> they<00:00:22.980> grow<00:00:23.130> larger<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.939> taller<00:00:25.130> there<00:00:26.130> are

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
as they grow larger and taller there are

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.009 
as they grow larger and taller there are
many<00:00:26.339> reasons<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:27.060> people<00:00:27.419> might<00:00:27.749> prune

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
many reasons that people might prune

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.929 
many reasons that people might prune
trees<00:00:28.320> sometimes<00:00:28.710> it's<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.490> aesthetics

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
trees sometimes it's for aesthetics

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.690 
trees sometimes it's for aesthetics
sometimes<00:00:30.839> we<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.169> like<00:00:31.410> trees<00:00:32.310> to<00:00:32.460> look<00:00:32.610> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
sometimes we just like trees to look a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.860 
sometimes we just like trees to look a
certain<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.240> have<00:00:33.390> certain<00:00:33.630> expectations

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
certain way we have certain expectations

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.990 
certain way we have certain expectations
and<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.710> kind<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.010> motivates<00:00:35.460> our<00:00:35.610> pruning

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and that kind of motivates our pruning

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.660 
and that kind of motivates our pruning
other<00:00:36.960> times<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.590> because<00:00:37.920> someone<00:00:38.550> might

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
other times it's because someone might

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.280 
other times it's because someone might
have<00:00:38.760> planted<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.240> wrong<00:00:39.420> tree<00:00:39.810> in<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> wrong

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
have planted the wrong tree in the wrong

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.860 
have planted the wrong tree in the wrong
place<00:00:40.590> or<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:41.330> coincidence<00:00:42.330> makes<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.780> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
place or just coincidence makes it the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.480 
place or just coincidence makes it the
wrong<00:00:43.050> tree<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.410> wrong<00:00:43.560> place<00:00:43.830> you<00:00:44.160> think

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 
wrong tree in the wrong place you think

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.430 
wrong tree in the wrong place you think
of<00:00:44.670> maybe<00:00:44.970> some<00:00:45.210> big<00:00:45.390> trees<00:00:45.660> under<00:00:45.960> utility

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
of maybe some big trees under utility

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.890 
of maybe some big trees under utility
lines<00:00:46.820> those<00:00:47.820> go<00:00:48.030> through<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.240> lot<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.540> pruning

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
lines those go through a lot of pruning

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.130 
lines those go through a lot of pruning
by<00:00:49.380> your<00:00:49.770> local<00:00:49.980> utility<00:00:50.460> company<00:00:50.790> perhaps

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
by your local utility company perhaps

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.810 
by your local utility company perhaps
but<00:00:52.140> we're<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> focus<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:53.130> maybe<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
but we're going to focus on maybe the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:04.399 
but we're going to focus on maybe the
last<00:00:54.000> two<00:00:54.240> reasons<00:00:54.660> health<00:00:55.650> and<00:00:55.950> structure

with you when you're doing any kind of
pruning<00:01:11.240> is<00:01:11.480> the<00:01:11.750> proper<00:01:12.080> equipment<00:01:12.400> here<00:01:13.400> we

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
pruning is the proper equipment here we

tool<00:01:35.060> you'll<00:01:35.330> use<00:01:35.360> in<00:01:35.690> pruning<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.380> hand

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
tool you'll use in pruning is the hand

pruners<00:01:37.750> this<00:01:38.750> pair<00:01:38.990> here<00:01:39.260> is<00:01:39.470> kind<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.280> fancy

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
pruners this pair here is kind of fancy

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.250 
pruners this pair here is kind of fancy
it<00:01:40.820> has<00:01:40.940> a<00:01:40.970> nice<00:01:41.210> ergonomic<00:01:41.810> handle<00:01:42.140> and

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
it has a nice ergonomic handle and

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.740 
it has a nice ergonomic handle and
spring<00:01:42.590> on<00:01:42.800> it<00:01:42.950> but<00:01:43.490> basically<00:01:43.790> if<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:44.270> get<00:01:44.720> a

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
spring on it but basically if you get a

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.080 
spring on it but basically if you get a
decent<00:01:44.960> pair<00:01:45.350> keep<00:01:45.800> it<00:01:45.920> sharpened<00:01:46.370> keep<00:01:46.970> it

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
decent pair keep it sharpened keep it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.090 
decent pair keep it sharpened keep it
well<00:01:47.210> maintained<00:01:47.690> it'll<00:01:48.320> do<00:01:48.410> the<00:01:48.500> job<00:01:48.530> for<00:01:48.950> you

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
well maintained it'll do the job for you

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.490 
well maintained it'll do the job for you
this<00:01:49.850> will<00:01:50.030> cut<00:01:50.210> anything<00:01:50.600> probably<00:01:51.260> up<00:01:51.470> to

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
this will cut anything probably up to

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.219 
this will cut anything probably up to
about<00:01:51.620> 3/4<00:01:52.370> of<00:01:52.400> an<00:01:52.580> inch<00:01:52.640> in<00:01:52.970> diameter<00:01:53.229> so

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
about 3/4 of an inch in diameter so

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.810 
about 3/4 of an inch in diameter so

the<00:02:07.010> pole<00:02:07.280> action<00:02:07.760> it's<00:02:08.360> very<00:02:08.660> efficient<00:02:09.170> and

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
the pole action it's very efficient and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.699 
the pole action it's very efficient and
if<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:09.890> keep<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.399> fresh<00:02:10.610> blade<00:02:10.930> in<00:02:11.930> your<00:02:11.989> saw

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
if you keep a fresh blade in your saw

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.850 
if you keep a fresh blade in your saw
then<00:02:13.340> you'll<00:02:13.520> get<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.730> nice<00:02:13.910> cut<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:15.500> will<00:02:15.680> cut

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
then you'll get a nice cut this will cut

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.040 
then you'll get a nice cut this will cut
up<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.430> any<00:02:16.700> size<00:02:16.970> that<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.540> can<00:02:17.660> handle

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
up to any size that you can handle

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.600 
up to any size that you can handle
basically<00:02:18.410> as<00:02:18.739> long<00:02:18.950> as<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.130> can<00:02:19.280> cut<00:02:19.430> through

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
basically as long as you can cut through

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.940 
basically as long as you can cut through
the<00:02:19.730> branch<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.230> last<00:02:21.440> cutting<00:02:21.800> tool

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
the branch in the last cutting tool

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.100 
the branch in the last cutting tool
