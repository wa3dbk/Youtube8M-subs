it's<00:01:56.570> um<00:01:56.950> still<00:01:57.950> like<00:01:58.490> his<00:01:58.990> thumb<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.290> kind<00:02:00.530> of

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
it's um still like his thumb is kind of

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.529 
it's um still like his thumb is kind of
facing<00:02:00.979> back<00:02:01.189> I<00:02:01.579> mean<00:02:01.790> when<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:02.090> put<00:02:02.240> your<00:02:02.270> arm

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
facing back I mean when you put your arm

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.789 
facing back I mean when you put your arm
in<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.750> position<00:02:02.869> it's<00:02:03.259> just<00:02:03.500> kind<00:02:03.680> of<00:02:03.740> weird

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
in that position it's just kind of weird

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.889 
in that position it's just kind of weird
i<00:02:04.219> don't<00:02:04.700> know<00:02:04.909> i<00:02:05.119> guess<00:02:05.149> i<00:02:05.450> didn't<00:02:05.689> want<00:02:05.840> to

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.690 
i don't know i guess i didn't want to
change<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.320> because<00:02:06.409> it's<00:02:06.680> just<00:02:06.860> too<00:02:07.670> much

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
change it because it's just too much

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.880 
change it because it's just too much
work<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:08.869> just<00:02:08.899> wanted<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.350> hurry<00:02:09.649> up<00:02:09.710> and

trouble i don't know why although in

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.520 
trouble i don't know why although in
this<00:02:37.269> animation<00:02:37.599> i<00:02:37.750> did<00:02:37.900> get<00:02:38.049> a<00:02:38.109> chance<00:02:38.170> to

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
this animation i did get a chance to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.369 
this animation i did get a chance to
practice<00:02:39.219> animating<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.239> figures<00:02:41.200> without

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
practice animating like figures without

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.709 
practice animating like figures without
outlines<00:02:42.099> like<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.609> zombie<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.150> skeleton

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:43.719 
outlines like that zombie and skeleton

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.020 
outlines like that zombie and skeleton
is<00:02:44.290> kind<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.950> was<00:02:45.069> kind<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.310> weird<00:02:45.549> and<00:02:45.790> a

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
is kind of it was kind of weird and a

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.920 
is kind of it was kind of weird and a
little<00:02:46.060> difficult<00:02:46.980> because<00:02:48.209> we<00:02:49.209> had<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:49.540> like

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
little difficult because we had the like

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.050 
little difficult because we had the like
position<00:02:50.560> in<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.919> way<00:02:51.069> so<00:02:51.129> that<00:02:51.489> things<00:02:51.939> don't

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
position in a way so that things don't

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.289 
position in a way so that things don't
overlap<00:02:52.930> too<00:02:53.169> much<00:02:53.439> and<00:02:54.219> they<00:02:54.579> just<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:55.060> kind

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
overlap too much and they just like kind

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.420 
overlap too much and they just like kind
of<00:02:55.389> like<00:02:55.450> merge<00:02:56.049> into<00:02:56.290> one<00:02:56.409> giant<00:02:56.859> blob<00:02:57.400> of

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
of like merge into one giant blob of

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.939 
of like merge into one giant blob of
color<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:59.049> was<00:02:59.109> kind<00:02:59.319> of<00:02:59.349> fun<00:02:59.530> working<00:02:59.769> with

00:02:59.939 --> 00:02:59.949 
color it was kind of fun working with

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:01.860 
color it was kind of fun working with
something<00:03:00.159> different<00:03:00.609> even<00:03:01.419> though<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.569> was<00:03:01.840> a

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
something different even though it was a

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.909 
something different even though it was a
lot<00:03:02.079> more<00:03:02.199> work<00:03:02.439> than<00:03:02.469> doing<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.430> with<00:03:03.549> lines

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919 
lot more work than doing it with lines

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.709 
lot more work than doing it with lines
but<00:03:05.919> it<00:03:06.010> does<00:03:06.159> kind<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.459> have<00:03:06.579> this<00:03:06.730> nice<00:03:07.269> look

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
but it does kind of have this nice look

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.050 
but it does kind of have this nice look
to<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.379> don't<00:03:09.310> think<00:03:09.459> I'm<00:03:09.519> ever<00:03:09.639> gonna<00:03:09.760> do<00:03:09.969> it

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
to it I don't think I'm ever gonna do it

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.240 
to it I don't think I'm ever gonna do it
again<00:03:10.150> though<00:03:10.419> probably<00:03:10.959> not<00:03:11.139> I<00:03:11.980> just

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
again though probably not I just

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.949 
again though probably not I just
probably<00:03:12.879> i'll<00:03:13.090> probably<00:03:13.329> only<00:03:13.540> do<00:03:13.750> that<00:03:13.840> for

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
probably i'll probably only do that for

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.830 
probably i'll probably only do that for
like<00:03:14.049> backgrounds<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:14.889> stuff<00:03:15.040> like<00:03:15.370> that

that<00:04:06.389> or<00:04:07.469> they're<00:04:08.469> from<00:04:08.620> clothes<00:04:08.859> to<00:04:09.040> like<00:04:09.489> the

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:09.729 
that or they're from clothes to like the

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:13.610 
that or they're from clothes to like the
way<00:04:09.759> they<00:04:10.120> shuffle<00:04:10.569> or<00:04:10.739> bend<00:04:11.739> when<00:04:12.009> you<00:04:12.159> move

way they shuffle or bend when you move

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.680 
way they shuffle or bend when you move
but<00:04:14.620> my<00:04:15.250> animations<00:04:15.699> aren't<00:04:16.000> really<00:04:16.329> that

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
but my animations aren't really that

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.289 
but my animations aren't really that
animated<00:04:17.349> to<00:04:17.799> tell<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.099> truth<00:04:18.310> it's<00:04:18.969> mostly

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
animated to tell the truth it's mostly

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.969 
animated to tell the truth it's mostly
just<00:04:19.389> like<00:04:19.630> two<00:04:19.810> pictures<00:04:20.079> that<00:04:20.229> squish<00:04:20.769> down

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
just like two pictures that squish down

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.550 
just like two pictures that squish down
a<00:04:21.039> lot<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:21.400> then<00:04:21.609> stretch<00:04:22.030> out<00:04:22.270> like<00:04:23.020> really

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
a lot and then stretch out like really

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.890 
a lot and then stretch out like really
far<00:04:23.710> up<00:04:23.849> just<00:04:24.849> to<00:04:24.969> like<00:04:25.120> kind<00:04:25.389> of<00:04:25.449> create<00:04:25.719> the

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
far up just to like kind of create the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.170 
far up just to like kind of create the
illusion<00:04:26.080> that<00:04:26.289> they're<00:04:27.000> actually<00:04:28.000> moving

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
illusion that they're actually moving

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.480 
illusion that they're actually moving
but<00:04:28.659> it's<00:04:28.870> really<00:04:29.020> just<00:04:29.110> two<00:04:29.409> pictures<00:04:29.680> but

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
but it's really just two pictures but

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.250 
but it's really just two pictures but
it's<00:04:30.699> how<00:04:30.849> I

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
it's how I

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.280 
it's how I
these<00:04:31.470> out<00:04:31.650> done<00:04:32.030> faster<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.240> do<00:04:33.510> prefer<00:04:33.810> frame

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
these out done faster I do prefer frame

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.080 
these out done faster I do prefer frame
by<00:04:34.500> frame<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:35.070> makes<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.370> animation<00:04:35.730> look<00:04:35.880> so

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
by frame it makes the animation look so

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.020 
by frame it makes the animation look so
much<00:04:36.270> smooth<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:37.050> fluid<00:04:37.260> but<00:04:38.010> it's<00:04:38.190> like<00:04:38.400> 10

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
much smooth and fluid but it's like 10

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.660 
much smooth and fluid but it's like 10
times<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.540> work<00:04:40.130> 10<00:04:41.130> times<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.430> work<00:04:41.550> and

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
times the work 10 times the work and

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.270 
times the work 10 times the work and
it's<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.090> much<00:04:42.240> longer<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.830> have<00:04:44.040> to<00:04:44.160> like

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
it's so much longer and I have to like

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.740 
it's so much longer and I have to like
get<00:04:44.400> these<00:04:44.580> out<00:04:44.730> in<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.210> timely<00:04:45.390> manner

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
get these out in a timely manner

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.890 
get these out in a timely manner
especially<00:04:45.990> for<00:04:46.440> Nova<00:04:46.790> um<00:04:49.100> yeah<00:04:50.100> I<00:04:50.600> think<00:04:51.600> my

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
especially for Nova um yeah I think my

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.240 
especially for Nova um yeah I think my
favorite<00:04:52.140> part<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.590> this<00:04:52.710> animation<00:04:53.070> is

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
favorite part of this animation is

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.300 
favorite part of this animation is
probably<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.640> credits<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.330> do<00:04:54.720> hope<00:04:55.080> that<00:04:55.410> you

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
probably the credits I do hope that you

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.120 
probably the credits I do hope that you
guys<00:04:56.610> do<00:04:57.060> watch<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:57.930> till<00:04:58.140> the<00:04:58.290> very<00:04:58.500> very<00:04:58.830> end

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160

although i would sooo most of you should
know<00:05:03.600> that<00:05:03.630> considering<00:05:04.350> that<00:05:04.380> i<00:05:04.620> always<00:05:04.800> add

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
know that considering that i always add

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.410 
know that considering that i always add
something<00:05:05.280> at<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.580> end<00:05:05.760> of<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:05.970> nova

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
something at the end of the nova

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
animations but uh it starting to think

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.810 
animations but uh it starting to think
that<00:05:10.200> might<00:05:10.410> be<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.590> main<00:05:11.100> reason<00:05:11.520> I<00:05:11.610> did<00:05:11.790> this
