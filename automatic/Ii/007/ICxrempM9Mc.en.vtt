art<00:00:51.910> into<00:00:52.329> water<00:00:52.540> these<00:00:52.780> days<00:00:52.840> exactly<00:00:53.320> what

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
art into water these days exactly what

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.200 
art into water these days exactly what
are<00:00:53.650> you<00:00:53.740> experiencing<00:00:54.220> with<00:00:54.370> it<00:00:54.490> well<00:00:54.970> the

are you experiencing with it well the
thing<00:00:55.360> is<00:00:55.510> for<00:00:55.720> us<00:00:55.840> using<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.560> water<00:00:56.739> I<00:00:56.860> mean<00:00:57.010> a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
thing is for us using the water I mean a

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.590 
thing is for us using the water I mean a
lot<00:00:57.220> of<00:00:57.250> misconception<00:00:57.940> is<00:00:58.030> can<00:00:58.180> you<00:00:58.270> still<00:00:58.480> do

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
lot of misconception is can you still do

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.090 
lot of misconception is can you still do
the<00:00:58.720> same<00:00:58.900> custom<00:00:59.440> stuff<00:00:59.650> that<00:00:59.800> you<00:00:59.860> can<00:01:00.010> do

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
the same custom stuff that you can do

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.370 
the same custom stuff that you can do
with<00:01:00.220> solvent<00:01:00.579> with<00:01:00.730> water<00:01:00.940> absolutely<00:01:01.750> I

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
with solvent with water absolutely I

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.690 
with solvent with water absolutely I
mean<00:01:02.560> if<00:01:02.620> you<00:01:02.710> look<00:01:02.890> around<00:01:03.190> you<00:01:03.399> see<00:01:03.430> all<00:01:03.670> of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
mean if you look around you see all of

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.850 
mean if you look around you see all of
the<00:01:03.880> paintings<00:01:04.270> it's<00:01:04.960> proof<00:01:05.229> because<00:01:05.710> it's

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
the paintings it's proof because it's

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.320 
the paintings it's proof because it's
all<00:01:06.009> done<00:01:06.190> with<00:01:06.369> with<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.850> water<00:01:07.030> with<00:01:07.210> these

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
all done with with the water with these

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.969 
all done with with the water with these
Larabee's<00:01:07.720> a<00:01:07.869> little<00:01:08.140> more<00:01:08.320> these<00:01:08.500> days<00:01:08.560> with

the<00:01:20.920> third<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.369> thickness<00:01:21.670> of<00:01:21.850> solvent<00:01:22.510> you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
the third the thickness of solvent you

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.780 
the third the thickness of solvent you
know<00:01:23.440> so<00:01:23.680> for<00:01:23.979> like<00:01:24.159> when<00:01:24.280> we're<00:01:24.430> doing<00:01:24.520> wood

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
know so for like when we're doing wood

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.640 
know so for like when we're doing wood
graining<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:26.080> know<00:01:26.140> cuz<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.320> lot<00:01:26.470> of<00:01:26.560> the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
graining you know cuz a lot of the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.870 
graining you know cuz a lot of the
thirties<00:01:26.950> vintage<00:01:27.190> cars<00:01:27.430> would<00:01:27.610> have<00:01:27.640> wood

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
thirties vintage cars would have wood

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.610 
thirties vintage cars would have wood
grain<00:01:28.090> dashes<00:01:28.479> so<00:01:28.690> you<00:01:29.170> know<00:01:29.229> whether<00:01:29.409> we're

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
grain dashes so you know whether we're

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.990 
grain dashes so you know whether we're
custom<00:01:30.040> painting<00:01:30.340> with<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.490> wood<00:01:30.640> grain<00:01:30.790> or

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
custom painting with the wood grain or

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.969 
custom painting with the wood grain or
trying<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.510> copy<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.170> wood<00:01:32.290> grain<00:01:32.470> dashes<00:01:32.890> of

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
trying to copy the wood grain dashes of

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.880 
trying to copy the wood grain dashes of
the<00:01:33.190> 30s<00:01:33.549> the<00:01:34.299> old<00:01:34.780> steps<00:01:35.080> with<00:01:35.260> solvent<00:01:35.710> is

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
the 30s the old steps with solvent is

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.310 
the 30s the old steps with solvent is
you'd<00:01:36.220> have<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.490> clear<00:01:36.760> wet<00:01:37.270> sand<00:01:37.570> re-clear

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
you'd have to clear wet sand re-clear

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.680 
you'd have to clear wet sand re-clear
just<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.680> try<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:38.890> bury<00:01:39.100> that<00:01:39.220> edge<00:01:39.430> right<00:01:39.820> with

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
just to try to bury that edge right with

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.080 
just to try to bury that edge right with
the<00:01:40.810> water<00:01:40.990> three<00:01:41.799> coats<00:01:42.040> clear<00:01:42.340> you're<00:01:42.909> done

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
the water three coats clear you're done

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.820 
the water three coats clear you're done
right<00:01:43.479> everybody<00:01:43.900> edges<00:01:44.290> your<00:01:44.470> tape<00:01:44.650> edge

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
then all the tape companies have

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.390 
then all the tape companies have
developed<00:02:04.360> new<00:02:04.780> tapes<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:05.830> work<00:02:06.070> better

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
developed new tapes that work better

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.609 
developed new tapes that work better
have<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.759> it's<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.360> thinner<00:02:07.600> build<00:02:08.110> on<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.410> tape

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
have a it's a thinner build on the tape

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.830 
have a it's a thinner build on the tape
you<00:02:08.920> also<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.549> edges<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.420> keeps<00:02:10.660> nice

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
you also the edges and it keeps nice

you also the edges and it keeps nice
tight<00:02:11.260> crisp<00:02:11.709> edges<00:02:11.980> right<00:02:12.549> we<00:02:12.700> finally<00:02:12.940> got

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
tight crisp edges right we finally got

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.850
