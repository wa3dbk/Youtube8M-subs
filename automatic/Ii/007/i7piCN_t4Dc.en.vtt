00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.210 
done it sounds a lot like 28 days later
I<00:01:39.000> like<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.840> very<00:01:39.990> eerie<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> one

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
I like that it's very eerie but the one

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.950 
I like that it's very eerie but the one
thing<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.610> really<00:01:42.060> don't<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.540> about<00:01:42.689> this

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
thing I really don't like about this

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.690 
thing I really don't like about this
game<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.439> probably<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> only<00:01:44.130> thing<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.490> like

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
game and probably the only thing I like

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.609 
game and probably the only thing I like
about<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.939> game<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.570> fact<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
about this game is the fact that the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.280 
about this game is the fact that the
internet<00:01:46.890> purchases<00:01:47.520> are<00:01:47.670> unbalanced<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
internet purchases are unbalanced so it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.109 
internet purchases are unbalanced so it
makes<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:50.070> hard<00:01:50.189> for<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.909> get<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
makes it really hard for you to get a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.179 
makes it really hard for you to get a
weapon<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.600> decent<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.200> basically<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:53.070> you

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
weapon this decent and basically if you

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.639 
weapon this decent and basically if you
don't<00:01:53.399> buy<00:01:53.700> those<00:01:54.000> in-app<00:01:54.329> purchases<00:01:54.869> then

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
don't buy those in-app purchases then

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.859 
don't buy those in-app purchases then
you're<00:01:56.280> going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> play<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> levels<00:01:57.180> over<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
you're going to play the levels over and

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.480 
you're going to play the levels over and
over<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.320> over<00:01:58.619> again<00:01:58.799> until<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.369> have

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
over and over again until you have

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.280 
over and over again until you have
enough<00:01:59.549> money<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.090> buy<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.329> weapons<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:00.840> are

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
enough money to buy the weapons they are

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.899 
enough money to buy the weapons they are
decent<00:02:01.560> enough<00:02:01.979> for<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.399> complete<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
decent enough for you to complete the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.459 
decent enough for you to complete the
missions<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.750> go<00:02:03.899> through<00:02:04.140> and

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
missions if you have to go through and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.440 
missions if you have to go through and
overall<00:02:04.890> i'll<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> give<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.640> game<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.939> 4

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
overall i'll have to give this game a 4

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.779 
overall i'll have to give this game a 4
