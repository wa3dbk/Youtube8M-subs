speeds<00:01:09.360> were<00:01:09.510> from<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.990> also<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.439> course

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
speeds were from that we also of course

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.890 
speeds were from that we also of course
had<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.490> our<00:01:11.520> velocity<00:01:12.240> product<00:01:12.720> yesterday

more and can you tell that just by

more and can you tell that just by
looking<00:01:44.189> at<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> structure<00:01:44.939> sometimes<00:01:45.450> oh

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
looking at the structure sometimes oh

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.840 
looking at the structure sometimes oh
absolutely<00:01:46.200> absolutely<00:01:46.740> not<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:47.490> exactly

absolutely absolutely not that's exactly

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.490

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
what they do they go and they'll look at

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.440 
what they do they go and they'll look at
all<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.860> though<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.729> weather<00:01:50.850> service<00:01:51.119> does

all this though the weather service does

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.170 
all this though the weather service does
that<00:01:51.659> they<00:01:51.810> actually<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.320> special<00:01:52.799> teams

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
that they actually have special teams

that they actually have special teams
that<00:01:54.180> are<00:01:54.299> sent<00:01:54.540> out<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.259> team<00:01:55.439> i<00:01:55.530> believe

about 10 people brian peters is one of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.109 
about 10 people brian peters is one of
those<00:01:58.649> people<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.430> determine<00:01:59.880> whether<00:02:00.060> a

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
those people to determine whether a

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.260 
those people to determine whether a
tornado<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.689> an<00:02:00.810> ef-4<00:02:00.990> or<00:02:01.560> an<00:02:01.680> ef5<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:03.180> a

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
tornado was an ef-4 or an ef5 it's a

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.240 
tornado was an ef-4 or an ef5 it's a
very<00:02:03.450> specialized<00:02:04.170> group<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.680> people<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
very specialized group of people that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.940 
very specialized group of people that
goes<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:06.030> determine<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.229> was<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.380> strong

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
goes to determine if it was that strong

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.499 
goes to determine if it was that strong
of<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.190> tornado<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.300> that's

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
of a tornado and I really think that's

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.699 
of a tornado and I really think that's
what<00:02:09.690> we're<00:02:09.780> going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.050> dealing<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.379> here

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
what we're going to be dealing with here

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.190 
what we're going to be dealing with here
ef4<00:02:11.430> ef5<00:02:11.879> would<00:02:12.060> not<00:02:12.209> surprise<00:02:12.629> me

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
ef4 ef5 would not surprise me

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.410 
ef4 ef5 would not surprise me
in<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.530> least<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.730> know<00:02:14.879> it's<00:02:15.150> so

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
in the least you know it's so

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.059 
in the least you know it's so
devastating<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.470> it's<00:02:16.620> just<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:16.890> completely

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
devastating and it's just so completely

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.199 
devastating and it's just so completely
heartbreaking<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.060> see<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:19.849> well<00:02:20.849> not

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
heartbreaking to see this I well not

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.210 
heartbreaking to see this I well not
only<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.599> length<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.530> tornado<00:02:22.769> because

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
only the length of the tornado because

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.100 
only the length of the tornado because
this<00:02:23.400> thing<00:02:23.580> started<00:02:24.030> actually<00:02:24.300> back<00:02:24.900> into

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
this thing started actually back into

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.559 
this thing started actually back into
Mississippi<00:02:25.650> moved<00:02:26.430> all<00:02:26.730> across<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.300> state

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
Mississippi moved all across the state

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.080 
Mississippi moved all across the state
and<00:02:27.870> even<00:02:28.080> moved<00:02:28.379> it<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.650> Georgia<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:29.370> this

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
and even moved it to Georgia and this

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.089 
and even moved it to Georgia and this
was<00:02:30.239> not<00:02:30.390> one<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.349> they<00:02:31.590> continuously

was not one that it they continuously

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.910 
was not one that it they continuously
lifted<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.030> then<00:02:33.150> dropped<00:02:33.420> back<00:02:33.599> down<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:34.800> was

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
lifted and then dropped back down it was

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.070 
lifted and then dropped back down it was
very<00:02:34.980> consistent<00:02:35.970> in<00:02:36.120> its<00:02:36.569> path<00:02:36.870> of

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
very consistent in its path of

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.289 
very consistent in its path of
destruction<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.800> mean<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> was<00:02:38.880> looking<00:02:39.120> for

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
destruction I mean I was looking for

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.600 
destruction I mean I was looking for
some<00:02:39.510> reports<00:02:39.870> from<00:02:39.930> Bill<00:02:40.290> castle<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.920> him

just<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.400> just<00:03:02.670> amazing<00:03:03.120> that's<00:03:03.450> very

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
just just just amazing that's very

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.069 
just just just amazing that's very
unusual<00:03:04.130> for<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.160> tornado<00:03:05.549> isn't<00:03:05.940> it

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
unusual for a tornado isn't it

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.150 
unusual for a tornado isn't it
absolutely<00:03:07.079> and<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.349> know<00:03:07.739> I've<00:03:07.920> still<00:03:08.130> been

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
absolutely and you know I've still been

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.949 
absolutely and you know I've still been
sifting<00:03:08.640> through<00:03:08.849> reports<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:09.510> still

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
sifting through reports and still

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.559 
sifting through reports and still
looking<00:03:10.230> at<00:03:10.319> historical<00:03:10.799> data<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:11.280> morning

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
looking at historical data this morning

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.809 
looking at historical data this morning
but<00:03:12.569> this<00:03:12.780> will<00:03:13.019> likely<00:03:13.349> be<00:03:13.829> one<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
but this will likely be one of the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.259 
but this will likely be one of the
longest<00:03:15.540> if<00:03:16.230> not<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.920> longest<00:03:17.489> tornado

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
longest if not the longest tornado

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.870 
longest if not the longest tornado
