a video on Ginga seven years after metal
theory<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.230> zero-g<00:00:10.910> there's<00:00:11.910> also<00:00:12.150> been<00:00:12.330> Kenta

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
theory in zero-g there's also been Kenta

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.379 
theory in zero-g there's also been Kenta
seven<00:00:13.950> years<00:00:14.099> after<00:00:14.280> metal<00:00:14.759> fear<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.059> zero-g

seven years after metal fear in zero-g

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.160 
seven years after metal fear in zero-g
and<00:00:15.719> now<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.830> have<00:00:17.190> found<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.550> picture<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.170> helium

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
and now I have found a picture of helium

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.349 
and now I have found a picture of helium
in<00:00:19.410> zero-g<00:00:20.449> here<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:22.250> Julia<00:00:23.250> seven<00:00:24.180> years

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
in zero-g here is Julia seven years

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.960 
in zero-g here is Julia seven years
after<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.990> fact<00:00:25.140> was<00:00:25.350> nemesis<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.130> metal<00:00:26.849> fab

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
after the fact was nemesis in metal fab

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.950 
after the fact was nemesis in metal fab
a<00:00:27.090> lizard<00:00:27.449> II<00:00:28.250> notice<00:00:29.250> how<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.539> Ginga

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
a lizard II notice how just like Ginga

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.700 
a lizard II notice how just like Ginga
his<00:00:31.529> hair<00:00:31.830> has<00:00:32.070> grown<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.460> lot<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.719> his<00:00:34.140> outfit

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
his hair has grown a lot and his outfit

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.370 
his hair has grown a lot and his outfit
or<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:35.850> he's<00:00:35.940> wearing<00:00:36.149> looks<00:00:36.570> more<00:00:36.840> formal

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
or what he's wearing looks more formal

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.610 
or what he's wearing looks more formal
as<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:38.100> see<00:00:38.280> he's<00:00:38.550> wearing<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.910> tie<00:00:39.230> so<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.500> is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
as you see he's wearing a tie so this is

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.799 
as you see he's wearing a tie so this is
just<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.950> guess<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.460> maybe<00:00:41.879> he's<00:00:42.120> got<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> job<00:00:42.629> or

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
just a guess but maybe he's got a job or

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.260 
just a guess but maybe he's got a job or
something<00:00:43.140> though<00:00:43.829> no<00:00:44.250> wouldn't<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.059> make

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
something though no wouldn't really make

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.350 
something though no wouldn't really make
sense<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.719> guess<00:00:45.950> that's<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.280> how<00:00:47.430> Gilliam<00:00:48.059> is

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
sense I guess that's not how Gilliam is

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.700 
sense I guess that's not how Gilliam is
or<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> right<00:00:50.129> now<00:00:50.750> also<00:00:51.750> notice<00:00:52.440> how<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
or as a right now also notice how the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.520 
or as a right now also notice how the
picture<00:00:53.100> has<00:00:53.250> been<00:00:53.280> posed<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.760> ten<00:00:53.940> days<00:00:54.120> ago

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
picture has been posed to ten days ago

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.430 
picture has been posed to ten days ago
so<00:00:55.530> either<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.480> manga<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.079> has<00:00:58.199> just

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
so either one and the manga it has just

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.029 
so either one and the manga it has just
come<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.250> recently<00:01:00.230> because<00:01:01.230> korokoro

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
come out recently because korokoro

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.800 
come out recently because korokoro
