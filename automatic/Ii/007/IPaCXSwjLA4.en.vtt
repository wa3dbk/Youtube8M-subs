machine<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.020> small<00:00:37.410> scale<00:00:37.800> it

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
machine and on a small scale it

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.400 
machine and on a small scale it
illustrates<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> danger<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.719> water<00:00:40.020> flowing

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
illustrates the danger of water flowing

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.040 
illustrates the danger of water flowing
over<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> dam<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:42.059> hits<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> water<00:00:42.540> below<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
over a dam it hits the water below and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.290 
over a dam it hits the water below and
it<00:00:43.110> brings<00:00:43.320> water<00:00:43.590> back<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.040> top<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.430> itself<00:00:44.700> so

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it brings water back on top of itself so

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.590 
it brings water back on top of itself so
it<00:00:45.390> creates<00:00:45.750> what<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:45.989> call<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.520> hydraulic

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
it creates what we call a hydraulic

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.240 
it creates what we call a hydraulic
essentially<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.780> water<00:00:48.989> continues<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.890> spin

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
essentially the water continues to spin

essentially the water continues to spin
almost<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> washing<00:00:51.360> machine<00:00:51.629> making<00:00:52.410> it

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
almost like a washing machine making it

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.709 
almost like a washing machine making it
difficult<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.280> anything<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.180> continue

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
difficult for anything to continue

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.369 
difficult for anything to continue
downstream<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.430> see<00:00:56.809> it<00:00:57.809> gets<00:00:57.989> trapped

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
downstream you can see it gets trapped

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.130 
downstream you can see it gets trapped
and<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.399> impossible<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> escape<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.510> john

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140
