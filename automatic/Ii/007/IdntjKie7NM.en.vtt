can do a little bit more of your own and
if<00:01:49.310> your<00:01:49.610> eyes<00:01:49.760> start<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.480> water<00:01:50.600> as<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.290> put

if your eyes start to water as you put
on<00:01:51.470> your<00:01:51.620> eyeliner<00:01:52.280> I<00:01:52.550> suggest<00:01:53.270> maybe<00:01:53.420> holding

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
on your eyeliner I suggest maybe holding

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.280 
on your eyeliner I suggest maybe holding
your<00:01:53.870> breath

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
your breath

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.630 
your breath
as<00:01:54.410> you<00:01:54.560> put<00:01:54.710> on<00:01:54.770> your<00:01:54.860> eyeliner<00:01:55.220> maybe<00:01:55.430> that

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
as you put on your eyeliner maybe that

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.290 
as you put on your eyeliner maybe that
will<00:01:55.760> prevent<00:01:56.120> your<00:01:57.080> eyes<00:01:57.880> from<00:01:58.880> watering

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
will prevent your eyes from watering

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.560 
will prevent your eyes from watering
also<00:02:00.140> what<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.470> can<00:02:00.650> do<00:02:00.800> if<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:01.700> can<00:02:01.970> look<00:02:02.270> up

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
also what you can do if you can look up

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.540
