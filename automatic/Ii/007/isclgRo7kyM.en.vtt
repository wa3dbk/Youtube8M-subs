everything in their dust now this map

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.870 
everything in their dust now this map
will<00:01:22.530> take<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> look<00:01:22.950> around<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.369> map<00:01:23.580> here

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.499 
will take a look around the map here
this<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> fairly<00:01:24.930> large<00:01:25.290> map<00:01:25.680> there's<00:01:26.610> gold

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
this is a fairly large map there's gold

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.749 
this is a fairly large map there's gold
resources<00:01:28.020> at<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> three<00:01:29.340> o'clock<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
resources at the three o'clock in the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.060 
resources at the three o'clock in the
nine<00:01:29.970> o'clock<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> design

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
nine o'clock and it's actually a design

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.120 
nine o'clock and it's actually a design
for<00:01:32.280> four<00:01:32.520> players<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.710> kind<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
for four players so so it's kind of a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.249 
for four players so so it's kind of a
shot<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.270> dark<00:01:36.360> whether<00:01:36.840> or<00:01:36.990> not<00:01:37.079> you're

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
shot in the dark whether or not you're

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.569 
shot in the dark whether or not you're
going<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.470> find<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.799> opponent<00:01:38.220> quickly

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
going to find the opponent quickly

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.429 
going to find the opponent quickly
because<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.119> p<00:01:39.570> could<00:01:39.750> be<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:39.960> any<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.320> the

because you p could be at any of the

because you p could be at any of the
other<00:01:40.560> three<00:01:41.070> corners<00:01:41.100> from<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.060> just

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
other three corners from you I just

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.539 
other three corners from you I just
happen<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.259> very<00:01:43.560> lucky<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.250> time

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
happen to be very lucky and this time

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.030 
happen to be very lucky and this time
and<00:01:44.759> my<00:01:45.119> Overlord<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.750> headed<00:01:46.229> indirect<00:01:46.649> right

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
and my Overlord is headed indirect right

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.310 
and my Overlord is headed indirect right
direction<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.759> I'll<00:01:48.270> know<00:01:48.540> where<00:01:48.720> he<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:48.930> but

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
direction so I'll know where he is but

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.649

uh<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.790> flip<00:01:50.970> side<00:01:51.000> he'll<00:01:51.329> know<00:01:51.479> where<00:01:51.630> I

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
uh on the flip side he'll know where I

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.149 
uh on the flip side he'll know where I
am<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:52.020> well<00:01:52.229> since<00:01:52.500> he'll<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:52.860> where<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
am as well since he'll see where the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.499 
am as well since he'll see where the
Overlord<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.610> coming<00:01:53.970> from<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.299> he'll

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
Overlord is coming from and he'll

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.039 
Overlord is coming from and he'll
immediately<00:01:54.780> know<00:01:55.259> where<00:01:56.250> my<00:01:56.399> bases<00:01:56.899> so<00:01:57.899> here

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
immediately know where my bases so here

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.550 
immediately know where my bases so here
we<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.170> I've<00:01:58.439> got<00:01:59.810> got<00:02:00.810> my<00:02:00.930> base<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.439> this

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
we go I've got got my base going this

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.580 
we go I've got got my base going this
spawning<00:02:01.829> pool<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:03.240> don't<00:02:04.229> think<00:02:04.439> I've

spawning pool is up I don't think I've

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.550 
spawning pool is up I don't think I've
quite<00:02:04.890> optimized<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:05.790> build<00:02:06.090> yet<00:02:06.299> I'm<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
quite optimized this build yet I'm a

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.249 
quite optimized this build yet I'm a
little<00:02:07.649> slow<00:02:08.129> on<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.459> getting<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.270> the

little slow on the getting the the
upgrade<00:02:10.770> going<00:02:11.129> and

what<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:13.140> is<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> tent<00:02:13.590> pole<00:02:13.800> built<00:02:14.100> I'm

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
what this is a tent pole built I'm

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.060 
what this is a tent pole built I'm
thinking<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.780> go<00:02:15.930> for<00:02:16.140> speeding<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.830> might

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
thinking to go for speeding it might

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.480 
thinking to go for speeding it might
need<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.550> 13<00:02:18.090> pool<00:02:19.070> because<00:02:20.070> that's<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
need to be a 13 pool because that's the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.700 
need to be a 13 pool because that's the
only<00:02:20.520> way<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.750> enough<00:02:21.990> gas<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.530> still

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
only way I can get enough gas and still

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.770 
only way I can get enough gas and still
have<00:02:22.830> enough<00:02:22.860> economy<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.790> uh<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:24.570> start

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
have enough economy to uh to start

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.080 
have enough economy to uh to start
pumping<00:02:25.110> out<00:02:25.230> zerglings<00:02:25.710> very<00:02:25.890> quickly<00:02:26.160> now

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
pumping out zerglings very quickly now

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.550 
pumping out zerglings very quickly now
since<00:02:27.270> he's<00:02:27.450> Protoss<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> speedling<00:02:28.260> build<00:02:28.470> I

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
since he's Protoss the speedling build I

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.600 
since he's Protoss the speedling build I
don't<00:02:28.740> think<00:02:28.860> would<00:02:28.950> work<00:02:29.130> nearly<00:02:29.400> as<00:02:29.520> well

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
don't think would work nearly as well

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.870 
don't think would work nearly as well
I'm<00:02:29.910> not<00:02:30.110> Terran<00:02:31.110> because<00:02:31.590> Terrans<00:02:32.580> had<00:02:32.730> to

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
I'm not Terran because Terrans had to

they can't afford to since they can't

so<00:03:05.790> now<00:03:05.940> he<00:03:06.000> wanna<00:03:06.840> boost<00:03:07.050> his<00:03:07.290> own<00:03:07.380> Nexus<00:03:07.860> to

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
so now he wanna boost his own Nexus to

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.260 
so now he wanna boost his own Nexus to
get<00:03:08.370> out<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.670> these<00:03:09.600> probes<00:03:09.900> faster<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.910> here

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
get out the these probes faster so here

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.170 
get out the these probes faster so here
I<00:03:12.300> am<00:03:13.250> I've<00:03:14.250> got<00:03:14.720> my<00:03:16.310> metabolic<00:03:17.310> balik<00:03:17.970> boosts

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
my mineral income so that i can just

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.930 
my mineral income so that i can just
non-stop<00:03:23.750> crank<00:03:24.750> out<00:03:24.900> zerglings<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.710> my<00:03:26.670> goal

bit<00:03:42.209> demoralized<00:03:43.100> I'm<00:03:44.100> still<00:03:44.550> set<00:03:44.760> sending<00:03:45.540> on

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
bit demoralized I'm still set sending on

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.260 
bit demoralized I'm still set sending on
my<00:03:45.750> overlords<00:03:46.230> in<00:03:46.440> all<00:03:46.709> directions<00:03:47.150> just<00:03:48.150> so

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
my overlords in all directions just so

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.720 
my overlords in all directions just so
that<00:03:48.420> uh<00:03:48.450> if<00:03:48.900> he<00:03:49.620> happens<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.160> send<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.459> probe

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
that uh if he happens to send a probe

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.949 
that uh if he happens to send a probe
somewhere<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.209> start<00:03:51.360> building<00:03:51.540> something

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
somewhere and start building something

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.140 
somewhere and start building something
that<00:03:52.320> uh<00:03:52.350> another<00:03:53.250> base<00:03:53.490> or<00:03:53.670> expansion

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
that uh another base or expansion

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.110 
that uh another base or expansion
somewhere<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.570> uh<00:03:55.100> I'll<00:03:56.100> know<00:03:56.280> about<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.550> now

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
somewhere I uh I'll know about it now

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.150 
somewhere I uh I'll know about it now
this<00:03:57.420> is<00:03:57.600> another<00:03:58.140> thing<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.530> like<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.770> do<00:03:58.980> I'm

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
this is another thing I like to do I'm

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.970 
this is another thing I like to do I'm
not<00:03:59.220> sure<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.940> like<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:01.050> leave<00:04:01.170> my<00:04:01.230> overlords

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
not sure I like to leave my overlords

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.370 
not sure I like to leave my overlords
right<00:04:02.400> along<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.090> outside<00:04:03.300> edge<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:04.110> the

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
natural expansions and most of the time

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.170 
natural expansions and most of the time
he<00:04:07.470> will<00:04:07.650> not<00:04:07.830> be<00:04:08.040> noticed<00:04:08.430> by<00:04:08.490> anyone<00:04:08.610> and

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
he will not be noticed by anyone and

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.890 
he will not be noticed by anyone and
I'll<00:04:09.870> get<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.200> heads<00:04:10.500> up<00:04:10.709> on<00:04:10.920> any<00:04:11.540> if<00:04:12.540> he

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
I'll get a heads up on any if he

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.110 
I'll get a heads up on any if he
attempts<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.650> expand<00:04:14.100> on<00:04:14.310> this<00:04:14.430> case<00:04:14.670> since

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
attempts to expand on this case since

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.210 
attempts to expand on this case since
I'm<00:04:15.570> trying<00:04:16.080> to<00:04:16.170> control<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.620> map<00:04:16.770> anyway

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
I'm trying to control the map anyway

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.150 
I'm trying to control the map anyway
with<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.940> speedlings<00:04:18.660> I'm<00:04:19.040> they're<00:04:20.040> all

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
with the speedlings I'm they're all

and<00:04:22.440> see<00:04:23.430> this<00:04:23.580> probe<00:04:23.850> I'm<00:04:24.000> guessing<00:04:24.360> this

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
and see this probe I'm guessing this

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.700 
and see this probe I'm guessing this
probe<00:04:24.660> is<00:04:24.810> either<00:04:24.930> coming

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
probe is either coming

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.529 
probe is either coming
to<00:04:25.740> explore<00:04:26.100> my<00:04:26.130> base<00:04:26.460> or<00:04:27.560> going<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.680> set<00:04:28.860> up<00:04:28.949> a

to explore my base or going to set up a
proxy<00:04:30.539> base<00:04:30.690> somewhere<00:04:30.900> else<00:04:31.169> but<00:04:31.380> he<00:04:31.530> doesn't

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
proxy base somewhere else but he doesn't

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.710 
proxy base somewhere else but he doesn't
make<00:04:31.949> it<00:04:32.100> since<00:04:32.370> I've<00:04:32.550> just<00:04:33.000> got<00:04:33.210> zerglings

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
make it since I've just got zerglings

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.159 
make it since I've just got zerglings
coming<00:04:34.110> like<00:04:34.229> crazy<00:04:35.030> now<00:04:36.030> I've<00:04:36.270> put<00:04:36.900> Jones

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
coming like crazy now I've put Jones

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.740 
coming like crazy now I've put Jones
back<00:04:37.440> on<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.650> extractor<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.610> that's<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:39.599> that

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
back on the extractor and that's so that

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.469 
back on the extractor and that's so that
i<00:04:39.780> can<00:04:39.900> start<00:04:40.470> tacking<00:04:40.860> up<00:04:40.949> after<00:04:41.430> after<00:04:42.240> our

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
i can start tacking up after after our

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.650 
i can start tacking up after after our
punch<00:04:42.690> through<00:04:42.960> has<00:04:43.139> his<00:04:43.560> line<00:04:44.060> I've<00:04:45.060> got<00:04:45.300> the

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
punch through has his line I've got the

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.809 
punch through has his line I've got the
as<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.500> can<00:04:46.680> see<00:04:46.800> this<00:04:46.919> white<00:04:47.220> line<00:04:47.490> this

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
as you can see this white line this

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.460 
as you can see this white line this
means<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.300> hatchery<00:04:48.840> is<00:04:48.960> going<00:04:49.139> to<00:04:49.289> be

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
means that the hatchery is going to be

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.230 
means that the hatchery is going to be
sending<00:04:49.770> out<00:04:50.069> anything<00:04:50.520> up<00:04:50.759> and<00:04:50.970> here's<00:04:51.150> the

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
sending out anything up and here's the

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.600 
sending out anything up and here's the
attack<00:04:51.509> so<00:04:52.110> I'm<00:04:52.319> not<00:04:52.349> actually<00:04:52.740> attacking<00:04:52.979> the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
attack so I'm not actually attacking the

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.370 
attack so I'm not actually attacking the
zealots<00:04:54.120> here<00:04:54.330> I'm<00:04:54.479> just<00:04:54.539> trying<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:54.990> get<00:04:55.139> past

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
zealots here I'm just trying to get past

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.469 
zealots here I'm just trying to get past
now<00:04:55.620> I<00:04:55.830> only<00:04:56.190> actually<00:04:56.610> lose<00:04:56.880> like<00:04:57.150> three

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
now I only actually lose like three

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.219 
now I only actually lose like three
servants<00:04:57.990> I'm<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.289> Pythia<00:04:58.849> units<00:04:59.849> up<00:05:00.229> I've

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
servants I'm the Pythia units up I've

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.960 
servants I'm the Pythia units up I've
got<00:05:01.500> 20<00:05:01.800> servings<00:05:02.220> at<00:05:02.370> this<00:05:02.520> point<00:05:02.789> they're

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
got 20 servings at this point they're

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.520 
got 20 servings at this point they're
slowly<00:05:03.360> getting<00:05:03.660> killed<00:05:04.050> but<00:05:04.710> I<00:05:05.930> actually<00:05:06.930> did

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
slowly getting killed but I actually did

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.499 
slowly getting killed but I actually did
a<00:05:07.710> tremendous<00:05:07.979> amount<00:05:08.820> of<00:05:08.940> damage<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.360> a

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
a tremendous amount of damage to a

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.180 
a tremendous amount of damage to a
supply<00:05:09.930> line<00:05:10.169> he's<00:05:11.099> down<00:05:11.280> to<00:05:11.490> 11<00:05:11.970> ten<00:05:12.389> nine

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
supply line he's down to 11 ten nine

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.420 
supply line he's down to 11 ten nine
eight<00:05:14.190> seven<00:05:15.229> seven<00:05:16.229> probes<00:05:16.680> after<00:05:17.250> all<00:05:17.400> of

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
eight seven seven probes after all of

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.969 
eight seven seven probes after all of
this<00:05:17.639> was<00:05:17.849> said<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.210> done<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.630> I'm<00:05:19.139> at<00:05:19.289> 21<00:05:19.710> so

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
this was said and done and I'm at 21 so

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.710 
this was said and done and I'm at 21 so
my<00:05:20.130> income<00:05:20.580> at<00:05:20.759> this<00:05:20.909> point<00:05:21.150> is<00:05:21.270> going<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.599> be

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
my income at this point is going to be

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.510 
my income at this point is going to be
significantly<00:05:22.590> higher<00:05:22.860> now<00:05:23.130> if<00:05:23.190> you<00:05:23.340> notice

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
significantly higher now if you notice

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.749 
significantly higher now if you notice
while<00:05:24.270> I<00:05:24.300> was<00:05:24.479> going<00:05:24.750> on<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:25.460> decided<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.639> go

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
while I was going on I decided to go

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.960 
while I was going on I decided to go
expand<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.509> the<00:05:27.690> gold<00:05:28.349> this<00:05:29.310> is<00:05:29.460> a<00:05:29.490> bit<00:05:29.729> risky

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
expand to the gold this is a bit risky

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.300 
expand to the gold this is a bit risky
now<00:05:30.330> if<00:05:30.449> he's<00:05:30.630> got<00:05:30.840> good<00:05:31.349> Intel<00:05:31.770> he'll<00:05:32.039> be<00:05:32.220> able

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
now if he's got good Intel he'll be able

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.399 
now if he's got good Intel he'll be able
to<00:05:32.639> especially<00:05:33.599> since<00:05:33.720> I<00:05:33.840> wiped<00:05:34.110> out<00:05:34.259> my
