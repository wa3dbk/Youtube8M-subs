00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.670
 hi all guys back here i'm back at 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.730
 my gianmarco stacchini to stay 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.199
 tennis and in this video I want you 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.330
 talk about the focus on the legs for the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.000
 ghetto leg policy 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.289
 then how everything saw a good far 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.939
 friend and room 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.789
 maybe the volume will be even lower 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.560
 but I think that to do this kind of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.080
 shooting is better so you can 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.910
 you will not see me use this space to 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.100
 do when I do the movements if you 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.809
 ask for the item because it really is it 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.730
 really hard to take back all the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.219
 body with a camera of turn of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.250
 Sardinian that I know because a house of 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.780
 militia of the day and night plans 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.780
 the attic and register it in Sardinia 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.699
 nice big one apartment though with 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.980
 then we have advanced 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.870
 some of us like it better 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.489
 which is a little more on the legs of law 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.159
 in Puglia as well as width but so much for 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:12.740
 show you the racket 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:15.409
 so important in fact don't look at the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.250
 movement dealing with the arms because 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.310
 i will use continental handle that has 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.149
 shown in the def 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.640
 so it seems to me and could see the 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:31.700
 focus is on the legs for the right 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 here before leaving silva boys 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.369
 always a spritz step which is a hop 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.079
 on the spot we do when the the 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.119
 our opponent is just danger for 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.129
 strike so our opponent is 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.950
 for what I can't do for 

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:48.739
 talk guys sorry for a sad why 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.950
 it is not a very high jump 

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:56.420
 a childish dp activation to be able to 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.810
 reactivate with us we must now said 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.280
 then the first step diagonally 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.609
 guys maybe you were there first time 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.390
 clarifies he fears the agreements and so but it is 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.489
 mistaken 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.729
 if you want so your ace is not 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:13.700
 aligned and you must take the first step 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.200
 so for here and you can hit the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.139
 ball as it came under a wind 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.450
 decomposed that I am so composed 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:29.540
 therefore seen first step crossed in 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.840
 positive on the ball so sad 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.970
 past insist on the palm now 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.250
 placed on the flaw I can get there 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.880
 two ways or included or in or for 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.880
 positions 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.530
 then you have to learn the various glosses 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:53.430
 positions 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.730
 yes with the excuse of the star hotels 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:01.920
 I, too, have been playing for stress 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.850
 persistent insistence on perseverance 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:11.010
 you will have your right shoulder 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:13.860
 perpendicular to the network and when 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.620
 arrive where the weight on the right leg 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.739
 who loves right charge here where people 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.500
 in energy transfers from the leg 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:26.640
 right to the left leg hitting 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.890
 hit the proceeded only we have 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.910
 left we right has no weight e 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.190
 then download forward into the stand that 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.180
 is the first position you will need to use 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:43.200
 when it is meant to arrive you have the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.420
 center of gravity and just perfectly in 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.670
 correct position 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.700
 the feet are parallel to the line of 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.700
 background 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.310
 the left maybe a little bit more towards 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.000
 your opponent but not too much with 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.450
 always invests a parallelism of the body 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.250
 arrive for on the right leg past 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.579
 of weight while you open on the cream 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.890
 left impact on the leg 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:20.180
 right and left leg and sorry 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.310
 and right is pushing forward e 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.789
 exhaust bus the right leg the left 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.669
 has no more weight while if you want 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:33.969
 to arrive with a little for itself for maybe 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:36.069
 buy time because this is more 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:39.099
 to perform while open when 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:43.329
 you are running what you are ready 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:49.329
 so respect he wrote sordello steps 

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:50.499
 imported and then business height 

00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:54.039
 respect 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:57.759
 then cross the rebound 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:05:00.129
 ball I move no because you can see 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.499
 arrived on the ball spent all over the 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.049
 right the sisto was never anyway 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:06.879
 ahead of the boys but whoever asks 

00:05:05.049 --> 00:05:11.919
 decomposed worked with the arm does not go 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:14.289
 well on the right all right and left 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:19.360
 and discharge at this time that alcatel 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:23.049
 in theaters the passage of weight from 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.969
 right on the left pan and exhaust goes 

00:05:23.049 --> 00:05:30.189
 forward as we have seen before 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:35.429
 I show you the two openings the same 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:42.539
 first com.cai in the past shot excavations 

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:49.050
 open dance cross jump open 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:49.050
 cashed I open past weight and go 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:57.759
 this guys and they are the two based on 

00:05:55.239 --> 00:06:02.079
 legs you can have for a position 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:07.360
 klose or open in the next video 

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:09.399
 we'll talk about the reverse and then in the video 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.800
 ie after a clash we will focus 

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:16.620
 on the other part 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:19.550
 but the right and then later by hello to all 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.550
 and the next episode
