shouldn't have overloaded because you

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.569 
shouldn't have overloaded because you
don't<00:03:20.139> get<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.410> giant<00:03:20.859> stat<00:03:21.099> boost<00:03:21.370> those

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.319 
fights taking a lot longer i'm wasting a
lot<00:03:23.620> more<00:03:23.829> food<00:03:24.040> than<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.280> needed<00:03:24.579> to<00:03:24.730> so

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
lot more food than I needed to so

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:26.879

hopefully<00:03:25.450> overload<00:03:25.989> Wars<00:03:26.200> off<00:03:26.380> soon<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:26.650> I

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
hopefully overload Wars off soon so I

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:28.319 
hopefully overload Wars off soon so I
can<00:03:26.950> get<00:03:27.099> the<00:03:27.250> huge<00:03:27.459> stat<00:03:27.730> boost<00:03:27.970> like<00:03:28.180> my

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
can get the huge stat boost like my

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.539 
can get the huge stat boost like my
defense<00:03:28.690> has<00:03:28.900> I'm<00:03:29.680> such<00:03:29.950> an<00:03:30.099> idiot<00:03:30.190> they

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
defense has I'm such an idiot they

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.640 
defense has I'm such an idiot they
should<00:03:30.730> like<00:03:30.910> tell<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.389> about<00:03:31.569> that<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:32.620> I

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
should like tell you about that but I

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.080 
should like tell you about that but I
basically<00:03:32.889> made<00:03:33.099> this<00:03:33.310> boss<00:03:33.519> fight<00:03:33.549> harder

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
basically made this boss fight harder

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.400 
basically made this boss fight harder
than<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.269> needed<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.629> be<00:03:34.720> so<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.019> guess<00:03:35.200> that's

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
than it needed to be so I guess that's

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.379 
than it needed to be so I guess that's
kind<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.650> cool<00:03:35.799> stupid<00:03:36.459> dog<00:03:36.639> get<00:03:36.879> out<00:03:37.000> here<00:03:37.180> dog
