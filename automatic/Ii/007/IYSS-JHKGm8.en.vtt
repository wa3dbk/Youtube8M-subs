00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
Yoshio s zero six one oh I do oh and it

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.610 
Yoshio s zero six one oh I do oh and it
is<00:00:42.360> saying<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:43.730> only<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:45.300> cell<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:46.430> alive<00:00:47.430> so

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
is saying that only one cell is alive so

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.639 
is saying that only one cell is alive so
let's<00:00:49.620> try<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:51.079> voltage<00:00:52.079> test<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.949> main<00:00:53.239> and

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
let's try a voltage test of the main and

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:02.979 
let's try a voltage test of the main and
we<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:56.539> negative<00:00:58.789> right<00:00:59.789> here

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.270 

positive

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:16.520 

it's<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.759> nice<00:01:07.970> zero

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.830 

there<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:17.740> go<00:01:18.270> 3.01<00:01:20.940> skewing<00:01:21.940> us<00:01:22.140> three<00:01:23.140> votes

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
there you go 3.01 skewing us three votes

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.250 
there you go 3.01 skewing us three votes
now<00:01:25.840> let's<00:01:26.050> test<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.410> balancer<00:01:27.040> cable<00:01:27.730> and<00:01:28.420> my

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
now let's test the balancer cable and my

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.450 
now let's test the balancer cable and my
understanding<00:01:30.010> is<00:01:30.220> that<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:31.290> place<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
understanding is that you place the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:44.040 
understanding is that you place the
negative<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.800> black<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:40.410> then<00:01:43.050> I'll

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
negative on the black and then I'll

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.900 
negative on the black and then I'll
connect<00:01:44.440> this<00:01:44.590> after<00:01:44.950> that<00:01:45.130> our<00:01:45.430> for<00:01:45.730> each

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
connect this after that our for each

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.720 
connect this after that our for each
cell<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:46.960> can<00:01:47.140> confirm<00:01:47.530> that<00:01:47.560> by<00:01:47.920> looking

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
cell and I can confirm that by looking

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.660 
cell and I can confirm that by looking
at<00:01:49.000> these<00:01:49.240> solder<00:01:49.630> 's<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:50.370> that<00:01:51.370> is<00:01:51.460> indeed

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
at these solder 's and that is indeed

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.630 
at these solder 's and that is indeed
the<00:01:51.850> way<00:01:52.120> it<00:01:52.180> should<00:01:52.270> work<00:01:53.220> if<00:01:54.220> not<00:01:54.280> please

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
the way it should work if not please

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.400 
the way it should work if not please
place<00:01:55.120> a<00:01:55.150> comment<00:01:55.480> on<00:01:55.660> this<00:01:55.780> video<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.170> let<00:01:56.320> me

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
place a comment on this video and let me

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.750 
place a comment on this video and let me
know<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:58.060> we<00:01:58.360> go<00:01:58.480> with<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.720> red<00:01:58.870> one<00:01:59.050> first<00:01:59.760> we

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
know so we go with the red one first we

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.700 
know so we go with the red one first we
get<00:02:01.530> 3.01

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
get 3.01

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.880 
get 3.01
same<00:02:03.640> as<00:02:03.910> the<00:02:04.720> voltage<00:02:04.930> we<00:02:05.230> got<00:02:05.410> from<00:02:05.650> the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
same as the voltage we got from the

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.760 
same as the voltage we got from the
mains<00:02:07.350> go<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.590> blue<00:02:09.030> cable<00:02:10.470> then<00:02:11.470> we<00:02:11.590> got

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
mains go to the blue cable then we got

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.090 
mains go to the blue cable then we got
two<00:02:12.100> point<00:02:12.490> ninety<00:02:12.790> eight<00:02:13.090> ninety<00:02:14.100> seven

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
two point ninety eight ninety seven

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.190 
two point ninety eight ninety seven
flickering<00:02:15.580> between<00:02:15.850> 1997<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.430> yellow

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
flickering between 1997 and I the yellow

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.520 
flickering between 1997 and I the yellow
two<00:02:20.200> point<00:02:20.560> ninety<00:02:20.739> eight<00:02:20.950> ninety<00:02:20.980> seven<00:02:22.530> so

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
two point ninety eight ninety seven so

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.960 
two point ninety eight ninety seven so
there<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.510> seems<00:02:25.780> like<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:29.970> like

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
there it is so seems like this is like

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.970 
there it is so seems like this is like
this<00:02:31.620> balancer<00:02:33.150> cables<00:02:34.150> our<00:02:34.330> solder<00:02:35.320> properly

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
this balancer cables our solder properly

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.500 
this balancer cables our solder properly
and<00:02:36.130> they're<00:02:36.280> making<00:02:36.520> proper<00:02:37.090> connection

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
and they're making proper connection

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.840 
and they're making proper connection
through<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.840> cells<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.370> cells<00:02:39.640> are

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
through the cells and the cells are

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.960 
through the cells and the cells are
actually<00:02:40.030> okay<00:02:41.280> those<00:02:42.280> two<00:02:42.489> salts<00:02:42.790> are<00:02:42.940> a

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
actually okay those two salts are a

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.290 
actually okay those two salts are a
little<00:02:43.090> bit<00:02:43.270> low<00:02:43.420> obviously<00:02:44.050> but<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:45.180> have<00:02:46.180> to

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
little bit low obviously but I have to

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.360 
little bit low obviously but I have to
believe<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.570> they<00:02:46.870> are<00:02:46.900> good<00:02:47.459> now<00:02:48.459> if<00:02:48.670> we<00:02:48.790> try

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
believe that they are good now if we try

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.290 
believe that they are good now if we try
if<00:02:51.370> we<00:02:51.489> try<00:02:51.700> for<00:02:51.910> example<00:02:52.000> test<00:02:52.840> them<00:02:53.170> by<00:02:54.300> this

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
if we try for example test them by this

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.400 
if we try for example test them by this
method<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:56.730> noise<00:02:57.730> yeah<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.270> whole<00:02:58.480> disp<00:02:58.870> axon

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
method of noise yeah the whole disp axon

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.760 
method of noise yeah the whole disp axon
hello<00:02:59.650> I<00:03:00.390> don't<00:03:01.390> know<00:03:01.870> how<00:03:02.110> I'm<00:03:02.260> going<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.560> do

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
hello I don't know how I'm going to do

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:12.300 
hello I don't know how I'm going to do

see<00:03:13.310> if<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.579> can<00:03:13.989> precariously<00:03:15.730> rig<00:03:16.730> something

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
see if I can precariously rig something

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.619 
see if I can precariously rig something
up<00:03:17.540> like<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:21.400> for<00:03:22.400> now<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:23.239> will<00:03:23.359> have<00:03:23.480> to

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
up like this for now that will have to

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.610 
up like this for now that will have to
do<00:03:24.760> okay

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
zero it flickers between point one and

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.560 
zero it flickers between point one and
point<00:04:04.490> three<00:04:04.940> there<00:04:05.150> goes<00:04:05.330> a<00:04:05.360> four<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:08.060> don't

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
point three there goes a four so I don't

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.140 
point three there goes a four so I don't
know<00:04:08.630> what<00:04:08.750> that<00:04:08.900> means<00:04:09.490> let's<00:04:10.490> go<00:04:10.730> back<00:04:10.970> again

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
know what that means let's go back again

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:24.550 
know what that means let's go back again
to<00:04:13.510> this<00:04:14.510> tab<00:04:15.550> which<00:04:16.550> is<00:04:16.580> a<00:04:17.150> negative<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:24.410> a

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
to this tab which is a negative and a

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.330 
to this tab which is a negative and a
positive

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:38.469 

I<00:04:30.400> see

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:47.180 

yes

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.400 

I<00:04:47.280> don't<00:04:47.940> know<00:04:48.060> if<00:04:48.120> this<00:04:48.300> tabs<00:04:48.750> are<00:04:48.990> coated

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
I don't know if this tabs are coated

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.800 
I don't know if this tabs are coated
with<00:04:49.440> some<00:04:49.740> kind<00:04:49.920> of<00:04:50.570> something<00:04:51.570> that<00:04:51.690> is

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
with some kind of something that is

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.510 
with some kind of something that is
keeping<00:04:52.170> them<00:04:52.350> from<00:04:54.920> that<00:04:55.920> doesn't<00:04:56.100> seem<00:04:56.400> to

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
keeping them from that doesn't seem to

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.600 
keeping them from that doesn't seem to
be<00:04:56.640> working<00:04:57.380> you<00:04:58.380> know<00:04:58.440> when<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.590> scratch<00:04:59.040> the

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
be working you know when I scratch the

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:09.370 
be working you know when I scratch the
tab<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:01.650> that's<00:05:02.040> it<00:05:02.610> on<00:05:03.090> now<00:05:03.570> is<00:05:03.900> dry<00:05:05.540> and<00:05:07.070> I

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
tab so that's it on now is dry and I

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.720 
tab so that's it on now is dry and I
hope<00:05:10.380> I<00:05:10.500> had<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.770> right<00:05:10.920> door<00:05:11.130> that<00:05:11.310> polarity

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
hope I had the right door that polarity

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.220 
hope I had the right door that polarity
on<00:05:11.940> that<00:05:12.270> one<00:05:12.980> so<00:05:13.980> he's<00:05:14.160> clearly<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:15.230> negative

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
on that one so he's clearly the negative

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:25.280 
on that one so he's clearly the negative
tab<00:05:20.180> and<00:05:21.180> positive<00:05:21.810> that's<00:05:23.240> not<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.510> put<00:05:24.750> 97

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
tab and positive that's not to put 97

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.280 
tab and positive that's not to put 97
this<00:05:25.440> one<00:05:25.650> uh<00:05:25.680> this<00:05:26.750> one<00:05:27.750> ourselves<00:05:27.840> we're
