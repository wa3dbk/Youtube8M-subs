 who saw such a point grand cherokee srt8 in 

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:06.080
 the atmosphere is not 450 horses 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.050
 the guys really liked the computer 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.170
 replaced to the electorate now the car gives out 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.700
 almost 600 horsepower so i know 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.730
 I realized that the car is worth an average of 26 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.949
 degrees 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.390
 here as an embarrassing roulette the trustee 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.249
 can so often the time as remaining 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.839
 talked he managed to overclock 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.609
 using your computer 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.609
 support for the shares prof he remembered 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.189
 not because the bill with 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.329
 boys he is not the speed more 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.660
 watch 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.660
 love 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.319
 in 4 games 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:41.269
 8 hectares 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.010
 so keep these characteristics for 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 games colin mcrae dirt 2 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.310
 This will require a very powerful system. 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.410
 thunder 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.210
 such a statement was made on 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.470
 computer system requirements 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.470
 venture them to your old cop 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.079
 about 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.440
 she is 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.570
 so what do you expect to save for 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.640
 new computer and a number of restrictions there 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.130
 consumer to help about it on tuesday 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.890
 foreground translates to 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.600
 English is just more in Chinese 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.500
 language it sounds like a boost 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.960
 component speeds 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.320
 computer on thursday grabbing egypt 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.690
 forced operation modes if 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.000
 earlier from the beginning of the legs 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.820
 they were engaged only in purpose collected 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.210
 he worked with him with a soldering iron now 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.440
 even schoolchildren can do this 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.790
 huge mistake buttons on the keyboard 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.210
 the basis for payment is overclocking 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.540
 central processor 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.570
 so much depends on its purity 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.210
 copy and archive speed 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.740
 data speed programs and 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.260
 Others most processors can 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.480
 overclock by 20 30 percent off 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.320
 factory figures here 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.780
 overclocking gets RAM 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.190
 graphics card you just need to build 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.049
 programs for overclocking for example kariva tuner 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.749
 quite convenient program even for 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:02.070
 newbie if you all do prime 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.580
 100 video card will become more 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.470
 productive 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.940
 and if we consider that the main application 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.940
 have your home computer this release 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.690
 today before 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.810
 to buy back the direct path to savings 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.789
 on city council accelerates 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.289
 computer so much 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:18.319
 No, of course, man 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.319
 that he produced just nothing 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.490
 offer in similar performance 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.419
 mup packing factories 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.079
 still happens in principle this amount is sad 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.999
 overclocking we buy start 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:31.969
 cheaper processors too 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.119
 and unwrapped the process 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.969
 birth for a thousand dollars 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.279
 most often 12 48 is 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:41.749
 per year goals 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.199
 to save 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.829
 people involved in a boycott in Kazakhstan 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.329
 about three hundred people 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.939
 but the most active developers 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.530
 people 10 maximum 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.770
 the thing is that it is then everyday 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.279
 about home and sports 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:57.969
 the tasks of the settlements in the coming summer all up 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.969
 last megahertz annually in the world 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.429
 competitions are held on 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:03.579
 overclocking sales figures most 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.629
 tournaments are held online in the community 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.209
 defined form in Kazakhstan local 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.030
 paid 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.890
 located on the site are afraid of March 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.440
 parts of the world here you can get 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.260
 news reviews among such she forum 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.400
 You can ask questions to the team to bypass the Russian Federation 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.459
 get answers find out when will 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.410
 take another tournament back all this 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.610
 my time started doing this morning 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.669
 on hands 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.669
 in 2008 at the beginning of it 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:31.419
 n we started all involved 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.149
 in the first competition in 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:36.309
 overclock project total war Koch began to participate 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:38.879
 in the competitions arranged 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.469
 at the international airport vnukovo 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.789
 will be points 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.849
 didn't get enough rub 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.359
 greatest success 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.779
 us in both these directions 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.889
 so percentage collection point who is total it 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.859
 the fruit of our team after repair dates 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.959
 not ranked second if 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.699
 talk about performances on anyone 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.579
 year then take into account a few case 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.089
 kazakhstan overclockers 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:05.849
 we have now led the country into deficit 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.949
 fifth in the world, our team is 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.249
 today s.Martynov size 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:13.569
 right was the best of times 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.919
 reach until about the seventieth 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.019
 eightieth place in the team competition and 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.879
 the country was on camera 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.189
 financially secured by hockey spend 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:23.879
 big money to buy in powerful 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:24.650
 components 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.320
 among the positive cooling systems so 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.830
 at minimal liquid consumption 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.520
 nitrogen needs about a thousand dollars already 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.360
 after that because firstly it 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.020
 will fail you can argue iron can 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.539
 interrupt it will determine the court 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.210
 why the second goal 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.620
 the second thing we can determine for 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.370
 what exactly accelerates i.e. 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.590
 possibility of development of memory processors 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.439
 video card 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:49.519
 suppose to somehow speed up 

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:51.419
 the work of the child subsystem that is 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.370
 you need to decide what to overclock 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.750
 in the third it will be possible to talk to share 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.310
 how to overclock how to overclock a few 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.370
 Greek from all sorts of problems 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.960
 subsequent that is overheating reproaches 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.809
 computer fire 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:07.689
 and after that already begins its work 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:09.279
 tried this time 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.319
 such kids just don't miss 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.709
 more materials on this 

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:15.810
 the topic on our site is Anatoly Chita's taste 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:17.739
 from computer park important than 

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:18.780
 A.Kinah 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.330
 success robbers enrique serezo to 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.500
 meeting
