Lee what we have here just some gameplay
and<00:00:07.069> this<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.280> actually<00:00:08.670> recorded<00:00:09.450> in<00:00:09.570> a

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
and this is actually recorded in a

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.120 
and this is actually recorded in a
different<00:00:10.019> way<00:00:10.110> usually<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.710> record<00:00:11.040> my

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
different way usually I record my

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.060 
different way usually I record my
gameplays<00:00:11.519> on<00:00:11.670> goals<00:00:11.910> with<00:00:12.210> my<00:00:12.360> HD<00:00:12.660> PVR<00:00:13.070> the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
gameplays on goals with my HD PVR the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.980 
gameplays on goals with my HD PVR the
internal<00:00:14.490> one<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.880> had<00:00:15.089> but<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.389> decided<00:00:15.809> to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
internal one that I had but I decided to

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.320 
internal one that I had but I decided to
use<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.170> new<00:00:16.440> method<00:00:16.800> called<00:00:17.130> OBS<00:00:17.670> open

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
use a new method called OBS open

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.480 
use a new method called OBS open
broadcast<00:00:18.779> software<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.410> now<00:00:19.980> there's<00:00:20.310> one

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
broadcast software so now there's one

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.160 
broadcast software so now there's one
thing<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.820> would<00:00:20.880> mainly<00:00:21.300> recommend<00:00:21.840> about<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
thing I would mainly recommend about the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.230 
thing I would mainly recommend about the
software<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:23.070> doesn't<00:00:23.430> drop<00:00:23.580> your<00:00:23.760> FPS<00:00:23.880> at

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
software is it doesn't drop your FPS at

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.279 
software is it doesn't drop your FPS at
all<00:00:24.359> if<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> correct<00:00:25.019> settings

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
all if you have the correct settings

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.650 
all if you have the correct settings
based<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.519> your<00:00:26.730> hardware<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.269> stuff<00:00:27.539> like

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
based on your hardware and stuff like

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.359 
based on your hardware and stuff like
that<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.289> thing<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:28.650> about<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.189> you

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
that so the thing I like about it is you

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.710 
that so the thing I like about it is you
could<00:00:29.490> live<00:00:29.670> stream<00:00:29.910> from<00:00:30.090> an<00:00:30.240> end<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.570> could

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
could live stream from an end you could

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.990 
could live stream from an end you could
record<00:00:30.960> from<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.740> why<00:00:32.369> did<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.610> decide<00:00:32.730> to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
record from it so why did I decide to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.549 
record from it so why did I decide to
use<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.390> first<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.690> all<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.870> HD<00:00:34.110> PVR<00:00:34.140> will

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
use this first of all the HD PVR will

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.750 
use this first of all the HD PVR will
give<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.829> no<00:00:34.980> longer<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.370> you're<00:00:35.489> recording

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
give you no longer if you're recording

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.299 
give you no longer if you're recording
but<00:00:36.360> here's<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.630> thing<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:37.290> HD<00:00:37.620> PVR<00:00:37.800> out<00:00:38.160> how

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
but here's the thing with HD PVR out how

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.760 
but here's the thing with HD PVR out how
to<00:00:38.370> play<00:00:38.610> an<00:00:38.730> open<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.600> would<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.320> play<00:00:40.500> in

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
to play an open I would have to play in

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.549 
to play an open I would have to play in
like<00:00:41.579> what<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.210> called<00:00:42.360> window<00:00:43.290> no

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
like what is that called window no

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.319 
like what is that called window no
border<00:00:43.980> there<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.280> go<00:00:44.399> windowed<00:00:44.789> no<00:00:44.940> border

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
border there you go windowed no border

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.889 
border there you go windowed no border
and<00:00:45.950> it<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.309> annoying<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.570> goals

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and it was really annoying on goals

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.540 
and it was really annoying on goals
because<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.379> noticed<00:00:49.770> something<00:00:50.010> about<00:00:50.129> ghosts

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
because I noticed something about ghosts

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.860 
because I noticed something about ghosts
if<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.760> play<00:00:50.940> them<00:00:51.090> full<00:00:51.329> screen<00:00:51.570> you'll<00:00:51.719> get

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
if you play them full screen you'll get

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.260 
if you play them full screen you'll get
much<00:00:52.050> more<00:00:52.260> FPS<00:00:52.440> then<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.550> were<00:00:53.760> playing

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
much more FPS then if you were playing

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.869 
much more FPS then if you were playing
it<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.780> windowed<00:00:55.140> no<00:00:55.289> border<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.699> this

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
it in windowed no border so in this

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029 
it in windowed no border so in this
gameplay<00:00:57.149> i<00:00:57.360> did<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.750> much<00:00:57.960> more<00:00:58.109> FPS<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:59.010> i

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
gameplay i did get much more FPS what i

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.760 
gameplay i did get much more FPS what i
was<00:00:59.190> recording<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.789> with<00:01:00.660> OBS<00:01:00.960> i<00:01:01.350> change<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
was recording with with OBS i change the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.959 
was recording with with OBS i change the
settings<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> little<00:01:02.370> bit<00:01:02.489> i<00:01:02.520> played<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.940> like

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
settings a little bit i played in like

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.660 
settings a little bit i played in like
13<00:01:04.250> 600<00:01:05.250> x<00:01:06.140> 768<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> resolution<00:01:08.520> i

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
13 600 x 768 and that was a resolution i

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.770 
13 600 x 768 and that was a resolution i
was<00:01:08.760> playing<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.270> i<00:01:09.330> didn't<00:01:09.540> want<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
was playing on because i didn't want to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.289 
was playing on because i didn't want to
play<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> higher<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:10.890> 1280<00:01:11.369> by<00:01:11.490> 720<00:01:11.850> p<00:01:12.150> for

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
play on a higher one 1280 by 720 p for

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.880 
play on a higher one 1280 by 720 p for
some<00:01:12.420> reason<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> aspect<00:01:13.049> ratio<00:01:13.080> goes<00:01:13.500> insane

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
some reason the aspect ratio goes insane

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.170 
some reason the aspect ratio goes insane
and<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.250> doesn't<00:01:14.490> fit<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.700> my<00:01:14.760> screen<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.150> i

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
and it doesn't fit on my screen so i

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.630 
and it doesn't fit on my screen so i
didn't<00:01:15.390> play<00:01:15.540> with<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.020> resolution<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.610> I

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
didn't play with that resolution so I

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.670 
didn't play with that resolution so I
played<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.180> resolution<00:01:18.990> i<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.320> mentioned

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
played with resolution i just mentioned

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.929 
played with resolution i just mentioned
and<00:01:20.100> i<00:01:20.869> recorded<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.020> 150<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.070> resolution<00:01:23.369> so

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
and i recorded in 150 that resolution so

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.880 
and i recorded in 150 that resolution so
it<00:01:24.210> recorded<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.810> little<00:01:25.020> bit<00:01:25.170> less<00:01:25.470> than<00:01:25.680> that

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
it recorded a little bit less than that

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.940 
it recorded a little bit less than that
resolution<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.909> well<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.720> 29<00:01:28.290> FPS<00:01:28.799> I

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
resolution as well as in 29 FPS I

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.890 
resolution as well as in 29 FPS I
couldn't<00:01:29.220> do<00:01:29.280> 29-point<00:01:29.939> 97<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.720> what<00:01:30.869> I

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
couldn't do 29-point 97 which is what I

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.870 
couldn't do 29-point 97 which is what I
usually<00:01:31.350> would<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.400> decided

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
usually would like but I decided

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.210 
usually would like but I decided
recording<00:01:33.450> 29<00:01:33.960> FPS<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.470> will<00:01:34.680> change<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.100> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
recording 29 FPS I will change that to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.100 
recording 29 FPS I will change that to
30<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.790> looking<00:01:36.030> at<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.299> gameplay<00:01:36.659> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
30 because looking at the gameplay that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.719 
30 because looking at the gameplay that
one<00:01:37.290> FPS<00:01:37.710> really<00:01:38.040> does<00:01:38.220> make<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> difference

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
one FPS really does make a difference

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.690 
one FPS really does make a difference
and<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.210> makes<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.479> look<00:01:39.570> slightly<00:01:40.380> lag<00:01:41.189> year

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and it makes it look slightly lag year

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.850 
and it makes it look slightly lag year
but<00:01:42.119> not<00:01:42.509> really<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.960> much<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.590> when<00:01:43.829> I

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
but not really that much and when I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.380 
but not really that much and when I
render<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.549> don't<00:01:44.909> think<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> will<00:01:45.240> look

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
render it out I don't think it will look

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.450 
render it out I don't think it will look
as<00:01:45.600> lucky<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.259> does<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.100> preview

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
as lucky as it does in the preview

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.130 
as lucky as it does in the preview
screen<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.030> whatever<00:01:48.299> well<00:01:48.630> my<00:01:48.780> previous

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
screen or whatever well my previous

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.749 
screen or whatever well my previous
screen<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.439> not<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.799> ever<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.520> mean

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
screen it's not like I ever so I mean

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.359 
screen it's not like I ever so I mean
and<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.390> might<00:01:51.570> look<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.810> little<00:01:51.960> bit<00:01:52.140> better<00:01:52.369> if

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
and it might look a little bit better if

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.359 
and it might look a little bit better if
i<00:01:53.579> would<00:01:53.729> have<00:01:53.759> recorded<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.450> 30<00:01:54.720> fps<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
i would have recorded it in 30 fps and

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.380 
i would have recorded it in 30 fps and
the<00:01:56.369> one<00:01:56.549> thing<00:01:56.700> i<00:01:56.790> also<00:01:56.880> liked<00:01:57.119> about<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the one thing i also liked about the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.389 
the one thing i also liked about the
software<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.350> could<00:01:58.560> choose<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
software is you could choose you know to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.530 
software is you could choose you know to
record<00:02:00.030> your<00:02:00.420> mic<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.560> record<00:02:01.950> your

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
record your mic and to record your

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.700 
record your mic and to record your
speakers<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.810> same<00:02:03.960> time<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.380> i<00:02:04.409> actually

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
speakers at the same time so i actually

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
speakers at the same time so i actually
were<00:02:05.430> was<00:02:05.820> recording<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.450> my<00:02:06.570> mic<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960

were was recording with my mic and
speakers<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:08.250> i<00:02:08.280> didn't<00:02:08.550> talk<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:08.789> if<00:02:09.090> i

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
speakers and but i didn't talk so if i

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.580 
speakers and but i didn't talk so if i

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
want to do a live stream I could have

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.190 
want to do a live stream I could have
done<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> live<00:02:10.920> stream<00:02:11.069> very<00:02:11.370> easily<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.879> pro

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
done a live stream very easily this pro

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.410 
done a live stream very easily this pro
a non-election<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:13.129> live<00:02:13.310> commentary<00:02:13.879> you<00:02:14.300> can

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
a non-election a live commentary you can

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.640 
a non-election a live commentary you can
also<00:02:14.540> do<00:02:14.780> live<00:02:14.959> strings<00:02:15.200> with<00:02:15.349> this<00:02:15.470> program

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
also do live strings with this program

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.009 
also do live strings with this program
it's<00:02:16.430> great<00:02:16.640> for<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:16.970> but<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:17.480> could<00:02:17.629> also<00:02:17.750> do

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
it's great for that but I could also do

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.110 
it's great for that but I could also do
a<00:02:18.050> live<00:02:18.379> commentary<00:02:18.980> with<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.489> that<00:02:19.970> would

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
a live commentary with it so that would

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.540 
a live commentary with it so that would
be<00:02:20.239> nice<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.800> future<00:02:21.920> if<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.250> plan<00:02:22.430> on

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
be nice so in the future if I plan on

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.130 
be nice so in the future if I plan on
doing<00:02:22.580> live<00:02:22.879> commentaries<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.569> could<00:02:23.780> do<00:02:23.900> with

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
doing live commentaries I could do with

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.589 
doing live commentaries I could do with
this<00:02:24.260> program<00:02:24.440> it's<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.129> very<00:02:25.340> good<00:02:25.519> program<00:02:25.700> it

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
this program it's a very good program it

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.119 
this program it's a very good program it
was<00:02:27.019> pretty<00:02:27.170> confusing<00:02:27.560> set<00:02:27.860> up<00:02:27.950> in<00:02:28.069> the

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
was pretty confusing set up in the

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.100 
was pretty confusing set up in the
beginning<00:02:28.489> but<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:28.640> watch<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:29.000> tutorial<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
beginning but I watch a tutorial and the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.540 
beginning but I watch a tutorial and the
torial<00:02:30.530> showed<00:02:30.680> me<00:02:30.830> everything<00:02:30.950> pretty<00:02:31.459> much

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
torial showed me everything pretty much

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.690 
torial showed me everything pretty much
and<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.239> was<00:02:32.390> just<00:02:32.630> fine<00:02:32.920> after<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.160> got<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.519> set

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
and it was just fine after I got it set

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.030 
and it was just fine after I got it set
up<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.720> worked<00:02:36.319> just<00:02:36.410> great<00:02:36.739> it's<00:02:36.860> much

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
up and it worked just great it's much

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.589 
up and it worked just great it's much
better<00:02:37.220> than<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.550> X<00:02:37.700> or<00:02:37.880> anything<00:02:38.299> else<00:02:38.480> I've

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
better than the X or anything else I've

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.940 
better than the X or anything else I've
ever<00:02:38.690> used<00:02:38.930> because<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.319> doesn't<00:02:39.680> drop<00:02:39.799> your

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
ever used because it doesn't drop your

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.100 
ever used because it doesn't drop your
FPS<00:02:40.069> one<00:02:40.640> bit<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:41.090> was<00:02:41.510> playing<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:41.870> game<00:02:42.049> I

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
FPS one bit I was playing this game I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.710 
FPS one bit I was playing this game I
was<00:02:42.410> between<00:02:42.709> 70<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.310> 90<00:02:43.640> FPS<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.150> whole<00:02:44.480> time

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
was between 70 to 90 FPS the whole time

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.259 
was between 70 to 90 FPS the whole time
which<00:02:45.319> is<00:02:45.500> like<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.890> record<00:02:46.220> for<00:02:46.459> ghosts<00:02:46.849> for<00:02:47.090> me

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
which is like a record for ghosts for me

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.360 
which is like a record for ghosts for me
because<00:02:48.080> I<00:02:48.110> could<00:02:48.530> barely<00:02:48.739> get<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.130> when<00:02:49.340> I

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
because I could barely get that when I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.009 
because I could barely get that when I
play<00:02:49.640> in<00:02:49.790> windowed<00:02:49.940> no<00:02:50.180> border<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.569> dropped

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
play in windowed no border I dropped

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.130 
play in windowed no border I dropped
below<00:02:51.200> 40<00:02:51.769> sometimes<00:02:52.370> if<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:53.360> look<00:02:53.540> out<00:02:53.720> into

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
below 40 sometimes if I look out into

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.809 
below 40 sometimes if I look out into
the<00:02:54.349> middle<00:02:54.440> of<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.680> map<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.130> remember<00:02:55.579> ghost

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
the middle of the map and remember ghost

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.160 
the middle of the map and remember ghost
is<00:02:55.970> fucked<00:02:56.209> up<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.599> I<00:02:56.720> thought<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:56.989> was<00:02:57.079> an

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
is fucked up and I thought that was an

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.500 
is fucked up and I thought that was an
enemy<00:02:57.290> ghost<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.010> fucked<00:02:58.250> up<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.730> it's<00:02:59.150> poorly

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
enemy ghost is fucked up and it's poorly

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.240 
enemy ghost is fucked up and it's poorly
optimized<00:03:00.140> so<00:03:00.349> that's<00:03:00.650> also<00:03:00.920> another<00:03:01.099> reason

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250

the<00:03:14.360> optimization<00:03:15.110> sucks<00:03:15.410> in<00:03:15.560> this<00:03:15.680> game<00:03:16.450> so

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
the optimization sucks in this game so

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.390 
the optimization sucks in this game so
what<00:03:17.750> I'm<00:03:17.840> here<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.049> talk<00:03:18.109> about<00:03:18.230> OBS<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.280> if

what I'm here to talk about OBS so if

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.009 
what I'm here to talk about OBS so if
you<00:03:19.489> guys<00:03:19.639> want<00:03:19.850> to<00:03:19.910> go<00:03:20.000> get<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.329> I'll<00:03:20.540> probably

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
you guys want to go get it I'll probably

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.809 
you guys want to go get it I'll probably
link<00:03:21.319> it<00:03:21.440> down<00:03:21.470> below<00:03:21.590> that's<00:03:22.459> what<00:03:22.579> I'm<00:03:22.670> using

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
link it down below that's what I'm using

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.270 
link it down below that's what I'm using

me to play in full screen which is which

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.059 
me to play in full screen which is which
is<00:03:29.150> very<00:03:29.480> important<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.079> gaining<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.590> most<00:03:30.769> FP

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
is very important to gaining the most FP

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.490 
is very important to gaining the most FP
as<00:03:31.190> possible<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:31.910> if<00:03:32.720> it<00:03:32.870> looks<00:03:33.019> like<00:03:33.170> laggy

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
as possible and if it looks like laggy

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.140 
as possible and if it looks like laggy
that's<00:03:33.739> because<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.190> my<00:03:34.220> settings<00:03:34.790> i<00:03:34.880> put<00:03:35.060> the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
that's because of my settings i put the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.800 
that's because of my settings i put the
FPS<00:03:35.510> at<00:03:36.160> 29<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.639> i<00:03:37.910> could<00:03:38.150> just<00:03:38.299> you<00:03:38.780> know

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
FPS at 29 and i could just you know

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.229 
FPS at 29 and i could just you know
change<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.290> at<00:03:39.410> 30<00:03:39.680> i<00:03:39.950> also<00:03:40.549> didn't<00:03:40.850> record<00:03:41.060> at

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
change it at 30 i also didn't record at

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.420 
change it at 30 i also didn't record at
full<00:03:41.510> resolution<00:03:41.900> i<00:03:42.230> didn't<00:03:42.440> record<00:03:42.620> at<00:03:42.769> 1360

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
full resolution i didn't record at 1360

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.490 
full resolution i didn't record at 1360
i<00:03:43.459> recorded<00:03:43.940> at<00:03:44.120> like<00:03:44.389> ten<00:03:44.840> thousand<00:03:45.260> forty

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
i recorded at like ten thousand forty

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.590 
i recorded at like ten thousand forty
four<00:03:45.709> by<00:03:45.920> six<00:03:46.280> eighty<00:03:46.549> or<00:03:46.880> something<00:03:47.480> like

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
four by six eighty or something like

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.599 
four by six eighty or something like
that<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:48.049> either<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:49.010> reason<00:03:49.280> why<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.430> did

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
that and either the reason why I did

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.759 
that and either the reason why I did
that<00:03:49.639> was<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.329> wanted<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.780> most<00:03:50.930> possible<00:03:51.170> FPS

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
that was I wanted the most possible FPS

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.949 
that was I wanted the most possible FPS
and<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.670> story<00:03:52.970> i<00:03:53.030> watch<00:03:53.329> really<00:03:53.540> helped<00:03:53.870> me

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
and the story i watch really helped me

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.330 
and the story i watch really helped me
out<00:03:53.989> because<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.440> taught<00:03:54.859> you<00:03:55.010> how<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.250> change

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
out because it taught you how to change

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.890 
out because it taught you how to change
the<00:03:55.579> aspect<00:03:55.730> ratios<00:03:56.299> and<00:03:56.450> stuff<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:56.780> could

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
the aspect ratios and stuff you could

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.020 
the aspect ratios and stuff you could
delete<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.440> black<00:03:57.650> bars<00:03:57.950> in<00:03:58.190> this<00:03:58.370> let's<00:03:58.910> say

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
delete the black bars in this let's say

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.920 
delete the black bars in this let's say
you're<00:03:59.150> playing<00:03:59.329> at<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.510> different<00:03:59.780> resolution

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
you're playing at a different resolution

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.629 
you're playing at a different resolution
than<00:04:00.349> your<00:04:00.470> monitor<00:04:00.829> and<00:04:00.859> it<00:04:01.370> would<00:04:01.489> usually

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
than your monitor and it would usually

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.550 
than your monitor and it would usually
cause<00:04:02.000> black<00:04:02.269> bars<00:04:02.569> it<00:04:03.049> can<00:04:03.200> show<00:04:03.349> you<00:04:03.410> how<00:04:03.530> to

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
cause black bars it can show you how to

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.050 
cause black bars it can show you how to
remove<00:04:03.769> them<00:04:04.069> automatically<00:04:04.609> without<00:04:04.880> you

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
remove them automatically without you

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.150 
remove them automatically without you
having<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.329> do<00:04:05.540> it<00:04:05.690> later<00:04:05.840> in<00:04:06.109> Vegas<00:04:06.470> so<00:04:06.920> I<00:04:06.950> like

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
having to do it later in Vegas so I like

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.710 
having to do it later in Vegas so I like
that<00:04:07.340> about<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:07.970> like<00:04:08.180> how<00:04:08.389> we<00:04:08.450> could

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
that about it and I like how we could

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.300 
that about it and I like how we could
record<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:09.049> microphone<00:04:09.919> and<00:04:10.099> the<00:04:10.190> other

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
record the microphone and the other

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.949 
record the microphone and the other
thing<00:04:10.370> I'm<00:04:10.669> sure<00:04:10.910> other<00:04:11.120> programs<00:04:11.540> can<00:04:11.780> as

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
thing I'm sure other programs can as

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.780 
thing I'm sure other programs can as
well<00:04:11.989> but<00:04:12.950> I<00:04:13.010> just<00:04:13.250> like<00:04:13.400> through<00:04:13.609> this

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
well but I just like through this

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.640 
well but I just like through this
program<00:04:14.269> I'll<00:04:14.510> probably<00:04:14.780> be<00:04:15.049> doing<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.380> lot<00:04:15.590> of

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
program I'll probably be doing a lot of

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.129 
program I'll probably be doing a lot of
live<00:04:16.130> concerts<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:16.970> stuff<00:04:17.120> like<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:17.359> with

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
live concerts and stuff like that with

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.409 
live concerts and stuff like that with
this<00:04:18.260> program<00:04:18.530> in<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.639> near<00:04:19.849> future<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:20.269> don't

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
this program in the near future I don't

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.759 
this program in the near future I don't
know<00:04:20.510> if<00:04:20.599> it's<00:04:20.690> going<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.900> be<00:04:20.989> for<00:04:21.140> ghosts<00:04:21.500> but

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
know if it's going to be for ghosts but

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.320 
know if it's going to be for ghosts but
it's<00:04:22.010> probably<00:04:22.220> going<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.490> be<00:04:22.550> for<00:04:23.210> other

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
it's probably going to be for other

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.660 
it's probably going to be for other
games<00:04:23.599> that<00:04:23.990> I<00:04:24.260> can

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
games that I can

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.480 
games that I can
much<00:04:24.820> more<00:04:25.060> FPS<00:04:25.240> on<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.680> what<00:04:27.040> I'm<00:04:27.160> planning<00:04:27.310> to

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
much more FPS on so what I'm planning to

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.780
