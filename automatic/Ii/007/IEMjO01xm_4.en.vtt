00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 You must have heard of rain already. 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.580
 acid than this kind of acid rain 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.719
 Can we watch a rain exercise? 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.870
 acid or not 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.599
 so today I'm going to make acid rain 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.189
 homemade here in front of you 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.140
 within this size but before you need 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.730
 give a break at the fair that goes from 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.440
 home to buy flowers though 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.440
 [Music] 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.720
 I need these flowers that they will 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.400
 help see the effect of acid rain 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.500
 the rain will be a chemical reaction happens 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.450
 every day in the city sky 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.540
 but we do not see 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.890
 [Music] 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:51.580
 while the rose has a discount for 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:55.630
 experience with her three by five 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.280
 closed now there are flowers I need 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.280
 the other ingredients to make this 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.940
 experience beyond the pot I'll use a 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:09.310
 spoon candle lighter adhesive tape 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.770
 a sulfur wire nail and indicator paper 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.200
 ph and paper is used to show if 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.840
 there is something is acid or basic it is 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.720
 optional in the experiment and the sulfur you 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.460
 find in any pharmacy 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.560
 I'll attach the ph indicator paper 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.360
 here in the pot and also put a 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.190
 Rosebud 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.070
 then I twist spoon forming a 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.240
 hook and drill the lid of the pot is power 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.940
 pass a wire that will hold the spoon 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.670
 I now place sulfur kim in the 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.190
 reap what I underneath until it begins 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.649
 to smoke like that at the time. 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.220
 I have to be quick and close the pot with 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.070
 pink and sulfur indicator within its 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:56.549
 abode in what will happen 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:06.819
 [Music] 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:09.819
 It's good to see this pole out there that is not 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.980
 good to smell the smoke no 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.099
 now let's compare rose that stayed in 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.670
 acid rain with the rose that did not stay in the 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.670
 barbecue 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.660
 [Music] 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.920
 Now let's take a look at the paper 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.750
 bh indicator 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.209
 here is a scale with several things 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.940
 start from zero ends at 7 o 0 either 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.459
 say very acid and the 7 means 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.230
 neutral so let's compare here with the 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.690
 mine had my ink more or less 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.900
 in paragraph 4 then it means that the environment 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.220
 inside was like this to know why 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.629
 all this has changed color 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.840
 I'll take a look in my book 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.840
 chemistry 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.440
 when I burned the sulfur there in the beginning 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.720
 of the experiment he reacted with gas 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.500
 oxygen from the air reported a gas that 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.500
 of sulfur oxide and sulfur dioxide. 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.440
 sulfur to react with water and gas 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.310
 oxygen and can form acidic 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.190
 sulfuric acid and sulfuric acid and was 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.170
 why the rose has lost color 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.480
 indicator paper showed that the 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.910
 there inside the pot was acid 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.400
 I think with this example you do not need 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.620
 nor to say that when these acids rains 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.019
 they do very badly for a lot of 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.000
 what we saw here is a 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.359
 demonstration of what happens in the 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.459
 real life nature when water falls 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.620
 it mixes with the carbon dioxide of 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.239
 atmosphere and was an acid called 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.280
 carbonic acid 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.739
 This means that any rain is 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.950
 naturally aids but what people 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.900
 flame of acid rain is when you have 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.819
 excessive acid in excessive rainfall 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.130
 happens when we have a lot of gas 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.609
 carbon dioxide or other pollutants as gases 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.519
 sulfur dioxide and these are gases 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.160
 that arise when people burn 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.080
 derived from petroleum or 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.440
 products that come from petroleum as per 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.720
 example diesel oil and that is why 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.930
 more acid rain in places that have 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.780
 car very much industry but 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.230
 acid experiences starts here you 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.840
 you find in the now manual you already know 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.090
 the harmful effects of acid rain 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.430
 It pays to also understand a business. 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.230
 which comes written a diesel oil on the hour 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.270
 What are you going to at a gas station? 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.570
 Look there always has a diesel oil with s 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.660
 something ahead is 50 s 10 that 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.850
 means that the good is if it is the symbol of 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.620
 sulfur on the periodic table I do not know 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.510
 if that's exactly it but it would be a 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.090
 very big coincidence 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.370
 the sulfur symbol indicates a churro 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.960
 but this is what happens when this 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.330
 ritual is if 50 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.560
 it means that if you have a 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.600
 ton of diesel oil toy 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.600
 That good and can of diesel oil will 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.090
 50 grams of sulfur, ie a 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.460
 truck and put a little more than a thousand 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.300
 liters of beer that the theologian neglects 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.900
 the ton 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.900
 will burn 50 grams of sulfur sulfur 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.200
 hell of s10 mean you have 10 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.200
 grams then the diesel is 10 and much less 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.710
 pollutant causes much less acid rain 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.600
 than the s-50 diesel and the trend is 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.700
 few people start using oil 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.400
 cleaner and cleaner diesel 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.919
 this index is whether the sulfur index 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.330
 decreasing 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.220
 I'm going to leave two days down here. 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.080
 that has to do with pollution on that side 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.540
 here leaving the video that shows what 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.700
 has inside the cigarette smoke 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.100
 and then you will understand why it does 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.419
 and here is a video that the 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.580
 people can see some of the pollution 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.630
 of water which is the video of the microscope 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:45.239
 House made
