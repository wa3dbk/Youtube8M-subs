00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:26.900
 Wind freezes to the north wind heart 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 A lonely flow of travel today 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 Tears fall on my guitar 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 A great whistling 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.427
 After all we are the ones who are comfortable 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 The stars are twinkling 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:42.900
 I have no regrets in my abandoned hometown 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:57.000
 Wake up to the dream of a cold nap 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.000
 Come and cry 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.800
 Itoshima Roshi the shadow of that girl 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:30.000
 The shadow is gone and this body is thin 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:40.800
 My heart's heart 

00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:53.200
 In the window of the bar of another country unknown 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.200
 If you play it 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.233
 Why the mind gets wet too
