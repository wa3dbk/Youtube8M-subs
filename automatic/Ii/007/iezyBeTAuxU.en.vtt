00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.920
 gran series of fault we're going to do like 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.390
 that even if broadband is forbidden 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.380

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.410
 description but just before on his 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.340
 alain site if you listen to what I have to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.560
 tell you no it's a small 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.420
 description let's say I gave you to 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.980
 about the story the beginning of 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.940
 the story since it's in English for 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.100
 people who do not understand English 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.690
 or like me who had a few 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.610
 difficulties in English but listen 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.050
 here I tell you a little history 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.180
 is right after I will offer you a 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.010
 question about the game gta 5 good big ones 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.250
 will embody the main character who 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.890
 will be nico bellec and of course we have 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.440
 played of course with gta iv we will find 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.640
 not on gta 5 short we do not care here 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.489
 it's really the short film that we 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.680
 interested in that bogus emancipating did this 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.129
 short film is so we will embody this 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.590
 character from the very beginning of the short show 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.189
 footage we're going to get a call he's going 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.810
 reply 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.119
 and since nobody was worth djerba 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.229
 listening he'll have to shock me that 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.640
 phone so thanks to the hair 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.720
 tinted does we congregate this way 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.220
 there since a small way we will say will 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.780
 to be conducted just because of a phone 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.909
 portable of course we do not know strictly 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.920
 nothing about the phone he does not say 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.240
 why apart at the end we will find 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.670
 something not everything to tell you 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.920
 also it's up to you to see after but in 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.799
 big so it's going to go into some sort of 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.079
 little fayt there on the bus or in a bus 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.189
 and then will call so this famous number 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.720
 phone to find because 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.670
 apparently it has been in this 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.189
 because in this bus are you who are worth they 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.149
 argue that in fact only ultimately 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.740
 finally the phone was not 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.119
 in very good hands since the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.890
 Hungarian boss pass one of his guards 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.659
 of the body that the bodyguard has 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.369
 accounted for banias on with the echo of 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.550
 the music that the other person so at the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.280
 end of the line 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.440
 was exactly in the hall 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.630
 piece since know the same music if 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.580
 you want to understand yourself and he's going 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.170
 suddenly push the person so 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.570
 he unfortunately saw basically the person that 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.310
 bellick who finally guides her peace so 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.990
 it was not very discreet for a 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.450
 times his share a year 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.800
 and then that's where everything starts and 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.960
 after threatening a chase 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.100
 No, I can not tell you everything 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.560
 just a little trick 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.700
 the pen it was really beautiful and 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.520
 we can see after he'll take a 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.510
 pen and then I have nothing to say after but 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.380
 frankly if we can do it badly 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.470
 new gta 5 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.480
 I really enjoyed this alone 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.610
 short film is the beauty of the plans 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.010
 picture quality and especially the band 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.690
 its that's what i love these kinds of 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.240
 of movies the soundtrack not simple if you 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.180
 take in the bmw in pursuit race 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.270
 or just before they see who is 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.130
 are enough then they are chased behind 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.220
 by a comedy who is who and on motorcycle 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.840
 Finally, even German it's him I think and 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.040
 this band are there that we find ourselves 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.150
 in the car and that we hear 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.620
 really or in the car 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.090
 that's little things but when I 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.800
 watch a movie like that, well I love 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.690
 it may sound stupid but I love 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.790
 I have a very small question for you 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.489
 apparently big towards photo 5 will come out 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.590
 on ps3 and on xbox 360 but will have 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.880
 delay on pc these are so far 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.650
 rumors but it's not official 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.850
 by rockstar anyway that's what 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.270
 slows down everywhere on the big 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.890
 websites 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.630
 so unfortunately just me I'm 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.830
 pc player and there I say to myself is what 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.900
 it's true what it's not true we 're going 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.670
 have to wait of course for this to be 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.200
 official by rockstar the thing that makes 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.630
 a little more scary it's mostly troc star 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.739
 pre orders are only on ps3 and 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.640
 xbox 360 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.780
 tell me what you think about it 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.190
 above us but not to shock the video 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.040
 the short film really know the 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.840
 hardly even if there are some small ones for 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.520
 we will say at the level of the race 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.400
 pursuit lent itself to October we see 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.780
 that the computer cfm may but 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.700
 frankly it's really worth it 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.140
 detour and really have to go it's a 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.820
