00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
eyes you're going to draw a circle where

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.649 
eyes you're going to draw a circle where
the<00:01:33.720> actual<00:01:34.470> eye<00:01:35.000> parts<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.329> this

the actual eye parts going to be this
parts<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.320> chopped<00:01:37.680> out<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.790> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
parts going to be chopped out what you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.380 
parts going to be chopped out what you
want<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> do<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.960> take<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.460> do

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
want to do with that is take this and do

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.749 
want to do with that is take this and do
it<00:01:42.540> exactly<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.680> same<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.490> were<00:01:44.579> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
it exactly the same so if you were to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.270 
it exactly the same so if you were to
flip<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.270> trace<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:46.380> would<00:01:46.619> look<00:01:46.649> this

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
flip it and trace it it would look this

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.069 
flip it and trace it it would look this
is<00:01:48.090> hard<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.770> lot<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.189> except<00:01:50.930> you<00:01:51.930> know

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
is hard a lot like this except you know

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.569 
is hard a lot like this except you know
the<00:01:52.590> same<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.399> looks<00:01:53.549> really<00:01:53.729> crappy<00:01:55.579> okay

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the same that looks really crappy okay

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.910 
the same that looks really crappy okay
so<00:01:57.299> what<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> want<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.200> cut<00:01:58.500> these<00:01:58.710> out

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so what you want to do is cut these out

so what you want to do is cut these out
and<00:01:59.250> also<00:01:59.790> when<00:02:00.240> you're<00:02:00.360> cutting<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.780> out

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
and also when you're cutting this out

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.249 
and also when you're cutting this out
take<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> flat<00:02:02.340> end<00:02:02.640> right<00:02:02.880> here<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.450> cut

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
take the flat end right here and cut

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.960 
take the flat end right here and cut
long<00:02:05.570> two<00:02:06.570> very<00:02:07.079> long<00:02:07.409> strips<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:08.819> give

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
long two very long strips this will give

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.460

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
whatever this is called the wireframe

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.480 
whatever this is called the wireframe
and<00:02:34.700> trace<00:02:35.700> where<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.510> eye<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.770> so<00:02:37.770> if<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.250> was

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
to pretend I'm tracing this because I

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.220 
to pretend I'm tracing this because I
have<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.350> hold<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.650> camera<00:02:41.690> so<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.720> traced<00:02:43.080> it

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
glue on the back of this so it sticks to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.630 
glue on the back of this so it sticks to
make<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:03.000> eye<00:03:03.270> part<00:03:04.100> finished<00:03:05.100> what<00:03:05.490> you

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
sharpie is going to give a lot of damage

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.150 
sharpie is going to give a lot of damage
to<00:03:10.770> things<00:03:11.480> take<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.840> hot<00:03:13.020> glue<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.890> just

the part that people can't see to be on

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.330 
the part that people can't see to be on
the<00:03:37.410> outer<00:03:37.590> edge<00:03:37.950> so<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.120> looks<00:03:39.300> neater<00:03:40.340> with

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
the outer edge so it looks neater with
