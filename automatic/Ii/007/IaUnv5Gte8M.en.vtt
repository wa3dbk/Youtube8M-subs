 I made a movie or sold to the company 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.560

 and so after waiting so much one day 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.050
 like any other I decided to succeed 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.190
 I decided not to wait for opportunities 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.739
 but I myself look for them I decided to see each 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.860
 problem as the opportunity to 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.110
 find a solution I decided to see each 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.800
 desert as the opportunity to 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.100
 find 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.100
 so I decided to see each night as a 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.930
 mystery to solve I decided to see every day 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.600
 as a new opportunity to be happy 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.750
 That day I discovered that my only rival was not 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.960
 they were more than my own weaknesses and 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.580
 that in these is the only and best way 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.940
 to improve ourselves 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.300
 that day stop fearing losing and 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.240
 I started to fear not winning, I discovered that 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.270
 I was not the best and maybe never 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.900
 I was left to care who won or 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.020
 I lost now I just care 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.660
 know me better than yesterday I learned that what 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.260
 It is not difficult to reach the top but 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.110
 never stop climbing that day stop 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.680
 be a reflection of my few triumphs 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:23.640
 past and I started making my own dim 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.940
 light of this present that day I decided 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.819
 change so many things that day 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.030
 I learned that dreams 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.819
 only to come true from 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:40.189
 That day I do not sleep to rest 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:42.530
 Now I just sleep to dream 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:46.120
 walt disney 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.060
 if there is the exit of the weak 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.600
 stress is the alternative to 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.600
 powerful
