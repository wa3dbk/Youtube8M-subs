be oil ii i find that the folk art paint

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.580 
be oil ii i find that the folk art paint
can<00:04:54.330> be<00:04:54.450> very<00:04:54.690> oily<00:04:55.020> when<00:04:55.860> you<00:04:56.010> use<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.520> and

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
can be very oily when you use it and

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.380 
can be very oily when you use it and
americana<00:04:58.590> paint<00:04:58.979> is<00:04:59.190> very<00:04:59.610> loose<00:04:59.940> so<00:05:00.270> if

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
americana paint is very loose so if

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.210 
americana paint is very loose so if
you're<00:05:00.540> just<00:05:00.570> starting<00:05:00.930> out<00:05:01.229> you<00:05:01.530> might<00:05:01.950> want

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
you're just starting out you might want

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.830 
you're just starting out you might want
to<00:05:02.310> try<00:05:02.490> that<00:05:02.700> and<00:05:03.000> paint<00:05:03.570> is<00:05:03.810> really

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
to try that and paint is really

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.969 
to try that and paint is really
inexpensive<00:05:04.800> it's<00:05:05.700> like<00:05:06.000> 88<00:05:06.479> cent<00:05:06.900> one<00:05:07.530> cell

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
inexpensive it's like 88 cent one cell

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.940 
inexpensive it's like 88 cent one cell
and<00:05:08.310> it's<00:05:09.030> really<00:05:09.390> like<00:05:09.570> $1<00:05:09.960> tube<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:10.800> it

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
and it's really like $1 tube and it

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.990 
and it's really like $1 tube and it
stretches<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:11.550> goes<00:05:11.729> a<00:05:11.760> long<00:05:12.120> way

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
stretches and goes a long way

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.530 
stretches and goes a long way
once<00:05:14.900> all<00:05:15.200> the<00:05:15.500> nails<00:05:15.770> are<00:05:16.010> dry<00:05:16.340> as<00:05:16.700> you<00:05:17.360> can
