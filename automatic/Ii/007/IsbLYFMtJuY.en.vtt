really<00:03:47.600> really<00:03:47.989> is<00:03:48.320> like<00:03:48.590> threading<00:03:48.950> a<00:03:49.250> needle

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
really really is like threading a needle

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.550 
really really is like threading a needle

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090

on the world automotive market for a car
like<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.260> Flying<00:04:25.470> Spur<00:04:25.860> but<00:04:26.430> it's<00:04:27.120> quite

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
like the Flying Spur but it's quite

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.390 
like the Flying Spur but it's quite
obvious<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.840> there<00:04:28.200> is<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.620> demand<00:04:29.070> for<00:04:29.160> cars

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
obvious that there is a demand for cars

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.640 
obvious that there is a demand for cars

like this and the proven that is right

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.480 
like this and the proven that is right
here<00:04:31.830> next<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.160> me

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
here next to me

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.790 
here next to me
interestingly<00:04:33.150> enough<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:33.960> British<00:04:34.500> brand

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
interestingly enough a British brand

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.710 
interestingly enough a British brand
owned<00:04:35.220> by<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.490> German<00:04:35.880> company<00:04:35.910> launching<00:04:36.660> a

owned by a German company launching a
kind<00:04:37.050> China<00:04:37.410> doesn't<00:04:37.740> really<00:04:37.890> make<00:04:38.040> that<00:04:38.160> much

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
kind China doesn't really make that much

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.930 
kind China doesn't really make that much
sense<00:04:38.370> either

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
sense either

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.730 
sense either
but<00:04:39.390> then<00:04:39.570> China<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:40.230> one<00:04:40.530> of<00:04:40.620> those

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
but then China is one of those

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.340 
but then China is one of those
burgeoning<00:04:41.310> markets<00:04:41.760> that<00:04:42.300> is<00:04:42.690> going<00:04:43.050> to<00:04:43.200> be
