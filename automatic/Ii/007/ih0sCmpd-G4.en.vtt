00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:03.255
Well, it's been said orgo is a difficult class

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.500
but I'm here to reduce those myths into something more substantial.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.050
So why don't you put on your diamond studded

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.011
lab goggles and enter...

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.630
Headin' up to Noco, fresh outta Hav'meyer

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.500
Ridin' on a Lion! Been under that hood forever.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.180
I'm the new Markovnikov, hyperconjugation dear,

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.016
I can't make it anywhere, carbocats need my peeps near.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.870
I used to like it primary, all of my substitu-homies

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.572
bound the BH3-way, actin like they didn't know me!

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:44.294
Or whipping cyclopropane, Zn(Cu) Iodide,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.700
Catch me in the lab with Simmons-Smith'in on the side

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:49.800
Just got my exam back! Didn't do my best-us

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.700
Lost a lot of points 'cuz all my carbons is from Texas!

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:54.054
Chair formation - 309,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.545
home of my boy Luis, writin on his blackboard,

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:58.183
showin' those reactions to me!

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.100
Quit pumpin' acetylides, it's time to get wise,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.690
base sitting courtside, til LGs give me high Pi's

00:01:03.856 --> 00:01:06.317
Girl, when she attack that, get alkene from a carbo-kitty

00:01:06.317 --> 00:01:09.653
Tell by solvent that it's E1 MOST DEFINITELY!

00:01:09.653 --> 00:01:12.573
Orgooooo!

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:16.535
They say that this class will destroy youuuu

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:19.538
those problems you can't doooo

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:24.042
But now you’re in ORRGOOOOOO

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:27.742
Synthesize yourself brand new

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.757
Campos will inspire youuu

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.926
Let's hear it for orgo,

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.250
orrgoo

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.348
ooorggooooooooooo

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.300
Solvent cage is binding, cations needs blinders

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:41.710
So nucs can step out of bounds,

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:43.400
Quick! Attack behinders

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.980
Alkyl halide casualty, it switches chirality,

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:48.900
opposing “enantiomers” appear as the halide leaves.

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:51.360
Got a free radical, things get magical!

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.280
You know “liberty for all”? Yeah, it ain’t hypothetical

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.700
When I stagger in, don’t e-clipse my vision

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.500
good bromines gone bad, my solution’s filled with them.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.790
Split two halogens, got myself initiation, propagation, termination

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.380
I’m in a halogen-Nation!

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:08.130
After that quiz, I’m feelin’ reduced like an alkyne,

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.730
sippin on Pd catalyst like a coffee,

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:11.090
BAM it's class time

00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:13.380
Like that damn Lindlar blocking alkene to alkane,

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:16.260
instead I’ve got these molecules poisoning my brain.

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:19.220
If mCPBA got you bindin some epoxides

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:22.120
dump on the strong acid to split into (trans!) hydroxides

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.670
Orgoooooo!

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.440
They say that this class will destroy youuu

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.640
Those problems you cannn't doooo!

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.610
But now you're in orrgooooo

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.400
Synthesize yourself brand new

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.500
Campos will inspire youuuu

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.940
Let's hear it for orgo

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.330
oorggoo

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.290
ooorggoooooooo

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.590
One chlorine in the air, chair sittin'

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.340
H next door, axi-all lookin’ pretty

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:57.970
No conformation in the world that can compare

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.640
PUT YOUR HALIDE IN THE AIIRR, EVERYBODY SAY YEAHHH!

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.800
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:08.980
Orgooooooo!

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:12.940
They say that this class will destroooy youu

00:03:12.943 --> 00:03:15.990
Those problems you cann'ttt dooooo

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.340
But now you're in orrgoooooo

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.010
Synthesize yourself braannd newww

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.840
Campos will inspiiiree youuuu

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.200
