00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
and I have to do some others this my fur

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.120 
and I have to do some others this my fur
my<00:00:22.230> gray<00:00:22.410> fur<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.740> my<00:00:22.920> booty<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:27.320> yeah<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.740> this

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
my gray fur on my booty and yeah so this

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.040 
my gray fur on my booty and yeah so this
is<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.369> easiest<00:00:29.789> way<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:29.970> remember<00:00:30.390> chromatic

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
is the easiest way to remember chromatic

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.799 
is the easiest way to remember chromatic
so<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.289> you're<00:00:31.410> doing<00:00:31.500> any<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:33.300> natural

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so if you're doing any the natural

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.380 
so if you're doing any the natural
always<00:00:34.410> becomes<00:00:34.710> blue<00:00:34.920> flat<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.910> then<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
always becomes blue flat and then the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.360 
always becomes blue flat and then the
sharp<00:00:36.690> always<00:00:37.140> no<00:00:37.790> no<00:00:38.790> me<00:00:38.879> saw<00:00:39.000> lie<00:00:39.090> again

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
sharp always no no me saw lie again

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.940 
sharp always no no me saw lie again
right<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.510> flap<00:00:42.840> always<00:00:43.469> comes<00:00:43.710> before

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
right then the flap always comes before

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.970 
right then the flap always comes before
the<00:00:44.309> natural<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.210> say<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.539> had<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.840> flat<00:00:46.110> B

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.100 

so<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.039> goes<00:00:50.190> D<00:00:51.170> Beneatha<00:00:52.280> Anthony<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:54.300> then

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
so it goes D Beneatha Anthony and then

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.450 
so it goes D Beneatha Anthony and then
if<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.500> these<00:00:55.590> shots<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.129> always<00:00:56.340> the

if you do these shots it's always the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.139 
if you do these shots it's always the
natural<00:00:56.789> faster<00:00:57.090> than<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> sharp<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.719> okay
