00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
out we've got a great drainage system

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.550

here<00:02:43.970> they<00:02:44.390> did<00:02:44.570> a<00:02:44.600> great<00:02:44.750> job<00:02:44.870> installing

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
here they did a great job installing

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.250 
here they did a great job installing
that<00:02:45.709> but<00:02:46.640> with<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.910> trees<00:02:47.209> literally<00:02:48.140> it

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
that but with the trees literally it

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.500 
that but with the trees literally it
takes<00:02:48.440> us<00:02:48.650> about<00:02:48.890> five<00:02:49.400> minutes<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:50.090> blow<00:02:50.299> the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
takes us about five minutes to blow the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.210 
takes us about five minutes to blow the
entire<00:02:50.810> court<00:02:51.140> off<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.560> we're<00:02:51.680> ready<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.980> play

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
entire court off and we're ready to play

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.060 
entire court off and we're ready to play
for<00:02:52.670> me<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.970> versa<00:02:53.299> Court<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:54.590> easier<00:02:55.010> to

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
for me the versa Court is easier to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.770 
for me the versa Court is easier to
clean<00:02:55.280> than<00:02:55.609> swimming<00:02:55.940> pool<00:02:56.239> in<00:02:56.359> my<00:02:56.390> pools

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
clean than swimming pool in my pools

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.479 
clean than swimming pool in my pools
probably<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.470> quarter<00:02:57.799> of<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:57.950> size<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.370> the

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
probably a quarter of the size of the

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.090 
probably a quarter of the size of the
court<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:59.380> definitely<00:03:00.380> would<00:03:00.470> recommend<00:03:00.500> first

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
court I definitely would recommend first

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.500 
court I definitely would recommend first
support<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.579> feel<00:03:01.820> like<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.299> best

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510
