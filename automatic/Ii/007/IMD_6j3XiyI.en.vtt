schizophrenia<00:00:05.480> is<00:00:05.660> a<00:00:05.780> disorder<00:00:06.230> of<00:00:06.410> brain

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
schizophrenia is a disorder of brain

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.629 
schizophrenia is a disorder of brain
development<00:00:07.100> and<00:00:08.110> we<00:00:09.110> our<00:00:09.889> research<00:00:10.250> tells<00:00:10.460> us

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
development and we our research tells us

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.619 
development and we our research tells us
that<00:00:10.910> it<00:00:11.330> is<00:00:11.450> primarily<00:00:13.090> there<00:00:14.090> is<00:00:14.180> a<00:00:14.209> genetic

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
that it is primarily there is a genetic

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.920 
that it is primarily there is a genetic
basis<00:00:15.080> to<00:00:15.379> schizophrenia<00:00:15.950> and<00:00:16.700> so<00:00:17.150> that<00:00:17.330> what

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
basis to schizophrenia and so that what

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.220 
basis to schizophrenia and so that what
we<00:00:18.050> know<00:00:18.230> is<00:00:18.440> if<00:00:19.220> you<00:00:19.490> have<00:00:19.789> an<00:00:20.600> identical<00:00:21.080> twin

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
we know is if you have an identical twin

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.130 
we know is if you have an identical twin
who<00:00:21.920> has<00:00:22.670> schizophrenia<00:00:22.880> then<00:00:23.570> your<00:00:23.750> chances

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
who has schizophrenia then your chances

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.240 
who has schizophrenia then your chances
of<00:00:24.170> developing<00:00:24.620> schizophrenia<00:00:25.160> are<00:00:26.320> 50%<00:00:27.320> so

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
of developing schizophrenia are 50% so

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.760 
of developing schizophrenia are 50% so
half<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:28.640> half<00:00:28.790> if<00:00:29.090> you<00:00:29.390> have<00:00:29.810> a<00:00:30.140> first-degree

who<00:00:35.360> has<00:00:36.050> schizophrenia<00:00:36.440> then<00:00:37.160> your<00:00:37.340> risk<00:00:37.579> is

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
who has schizophrenia then your risk is

who has schizophrenia then your risk is
10%<00:00:38.060> and<00:00:38.420> so<00:00:38.510> we<00:00:38.930> know<00:00:39.079> that<00:00:39.110> it's<00:00:39.410> an

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
don't know quite which genes are

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.060 
don't know quite which genes are

genes<00:00:49.610> but<00:00:49.850> we<00:00:49.970> have<00:00:50.149> a<00:00:50.180> few<00:00:50.920> genes<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:52.100> were

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.130 
genes but we have a few genes that were
specifically<00:00:52.850> focusing<00:00:53.420> on<00:00:53.540> with<00:00:53.750> research

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
specifically focusing on with research

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.639 
specifically focusing on with research
to<00:00:55.100> know<00:00:55.670> whether<00:00:55.880> they're<00:00:56.239> involved<00:00:57.140> in<00:00:57.350> in

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
to know whether they're involved in in

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:58.960 
to know whether they're involved in in
developing<00:00:58.070> schizophrenia<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.790> how<00:00:58.910> we

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
developing schizophrenia and how we

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.930 
developing schizophrenia and how we
might<00:00:59.210> address<00:00:59.360> that<00:00:59.860> so<00:01:00.860> genes<00:01:01.520> are<00:01:01.730> one

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
might address that so genes are one

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.049 
might address that so genes are one
thing<00:01:02.210> but<00:01:02.770> what<00:01:03.770> we<00:01:03.920> know<00:01:04.100> too<00:01:04.159> are<00:01:04.640> the

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
thing but what we know too are the

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.389 
thing but what we know too are the
things<00:01:05.329> that<00:01:05.540> develop<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.619> affect<00:01:07.130> brain

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
things that develop that affect brain

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.969 
things that develop that affect brain
development<00:01:08.060> will<00:01:08.990> affect<00:01:09.500> your<00:01:09.620> risk<00:01:09.770> of

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
development will affect your risk of

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.390 
development will affect your risk of
developing<00:01:10.430> schizophrenia<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:13.040> the

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
developing schizophrenia and so the the

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.399 
developing schizophrenia and so the the
perinatal<00:01:13.729> period<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.840> pregnancy

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
perinatal period the the pregnancy

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.200 
perinatal period the the pregnancy
period<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:16.040> just<00:01:16.250> after<00:01:16.430> pregnancy<00:01:17.060> is<00:01:17.180> a

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
period and just after pregnancy is a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.200 
period and just after pregnancy is a
delivery<00:01:18.110> period<00:01:18.440> is<00:01:18.740> really<00:01:18.979> an<00:01:19.760> important

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
delivery period is really an important

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.590 
delivery period is really an important
time<00:01:20.450> of<00:01:20.780> risk<00:01:21.110> for<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:22.970> fetus<00:01:23.180> or<00:01:23.390> baby

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
time of risk for the the fetus or baby

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.440 
time of risk for the the fetus or baby
to<00:01:23.900> develop<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:25.070> risk<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.400> her<00:01:25.760> schizophrenia

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
to develop the risk of her schizophrenia

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.330 
to develop the risk of her schizophrenia
and<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:27.080> having<00:01:27.290> low<00:01:27.590> birth<00:01:27.860> weight<00:01:28.159> or

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
and so having low birth weight or

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.859 
and so having low birth weight or
bleeding<00:01:28.760> during<00:01:29.150> pregnancy<00:01:29.690> has<00:01:29.840> been

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
bleeding during pregnancy has been

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.590 
bleeding during pregnancy has been
associated<00:01:30.320> with<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:32.180> onset<00:01:32.330> of

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
schizophrenia or the risk for

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.250 
to viruses or toxins or malnutrition
during<00:01:42.830> pregnancy<00:01:43.869> appear<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:44.960> be<00:01:45.049> risk

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
during pregnancy appear to be risk

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.050 
during pregnancy appear to be risk
factors<00:01:45.650> as<00:01:45.799> well<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:46.310> those<00:01:46.549> probably

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
factors as well and so those probably

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.090 
factors as well and so those probably
affect<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.780> development<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.500> brain<00:01:48.770> and

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
affect the development of the brain and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.780 
affect the development of the brain and
lead<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.000> onset<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.450> schizophrenia<00:01:51.790> some
