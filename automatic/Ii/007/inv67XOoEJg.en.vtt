00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.860
 of 71 we have come from within that not 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.020
 there were windows because it wasn't 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.130

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.129
 they said I can sell it if you do 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.309
 take that I started going in 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.320
 room to offer people after a couple of d 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.680
 hours I had finished this truffle that he 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.470
 but real breath and I went to get them 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.989

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.820

 embers of roasts in the second king 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:10.140
 truffle is a void at night because I try 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.810
 to precede the other seeker and the dog 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.899

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.520
 that one must go there anyway 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.719

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.369
 go find the truffles or mine 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:35.579
 passion is buying them, seeing them smell them 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.789
 he is always a white truffle, but each one 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.219
 has its own characteristics is second 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.530

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.340

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.380
 Romagna 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.560

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.930
 do many miles to be able to 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.750
