but they were in such good shape in come
I<00:01:29.070> guess<00:01:29.369> consideration<00:01:30.090> for<00:01:30.240> how<00:01:30.329> old<00:01:30.600> they

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720

considering<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.780> guess<00:01:57.990> again

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
considering I guess again

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.870 
considering I guess again
I<00:01:58.439> know<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:58.829> crease<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.310> know<00:01:59.430> it's<00:01:59.579> not<00:01:59.700> like

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
I know it's crease I know it's not like

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.609 
I know it's crease I know it's not like
perfectly<00:02:00.360> white<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:00.750> if<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.899> look<00:02:01.049> at<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
perfectly white but if you look at the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.679 
perfectly white but if you look at the
overall<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:02.490> shoes<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.329> old<00:02:03.540> this

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
overall like shoes of this old this

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.510 
overall like shoes of this old this
stuff<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.049> shredded<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.619> busted<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.130> pieces
