00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
and like we did before with the gray

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.979 
and like we did before with the gray
this<00:02:57.919> is<00:02:58.130> coming<00:02:58.459> out<00:02:58.579> of<00:02:58.699> the<00:02:58.790> right<00:02:59.000> side<00:02:59.030> so

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
this is coming out of the right side so

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.270 
this is coming out of the right side so
on<00:03:00.109> the<00:03:00.260> left<00:03:00.500> side<00:03:00.739> you<00:03:00.980> want

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.050 

and<00:03:07.990> this<00:03:08.990> will<00:03:09.319> help<00:03:09.560> also<00:03:10.370> close<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.850> hole

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
and this will help also close the hole

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.050 
and this will help also close the hole
the<00:03:11.390> gray<00:03:11.770> close<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:13.040> hole<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.580> begin<00:03:13.700> with

the gray close the hole to begin with

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.970 
the gray close the hole to begin with
but<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.540> blue<00:03:14.780> will<00:03:15.020> just<00:03:15.290> make<00:03:15.470> sure<00:03:15.709> that

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
but the blue will just make sure that

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.760
