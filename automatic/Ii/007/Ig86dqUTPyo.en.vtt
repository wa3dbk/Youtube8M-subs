00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
hi this is Taylor leach I'm a staff

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.210 
hi this is Taylor leach I'm a staff
artist<00:00:02.760> at<00:00:02.909> turbosquid<00:00:03.500> in<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:04.650> video<00:00:05.009> we'll

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
artist at turbosquid in this video we'll

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.759 
artist at turbosquid in this video we'll
be<00:00:05.250> going<00:00:05.580> over<00:00:05.730> clean<00:00:06.210> geometry<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:06.960> 3dsmax

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.100 

so<00:00:10.769> here<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.400> 3ds<00:00:11.730> max<00:00:12.030> we<00:00:12.300> have<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.630> car<00:00:12.900> body

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
so here in 3ds max we have this car body

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.690 
so here in 3ds max we have this car body
and<00:00:13.440> we're<00:00:13.830> going<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.009> be<00:00:14.070> looking<00:00:14.190> at<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.460> few

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
and we're going to be looking at a few

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.840 
and we're going to be looking at a few
issues<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.269> has<00:00:16.250> so<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.340> first<00:00:17.550> thing<00:00:17.760> you

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
issues it has so the first thing you

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.550 
issues it has so the first thing you
want<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.060> look<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.420> when<00:00:18.660> you're<00:00:18.779> cleaning<00:00:19.410> up

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
want to look for when you're cleaning up

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.340 
want to look for when you're cleaning up
your<00:00:19.770> mesh<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.930> overlapping<00:00:21.949> faces<00:00:23.510> so<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.930> can

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
your mesh is overlapping faces so we can

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.660 
your mesh is overlapping faces so we can
look<00:00:25.710> around<00:00:25.859> match<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.640> rotate<00:00:27.449> around<00:00:27.539> it

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
look around match and rotate around it

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.920 
look around match and rotate around it
they<00:00:29.670> usually<00:00:29.820> show<00:00:30.210> up<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.960> banding<00:00:31.529> or

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
they usually show up with banding or

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.869 
they usually show up with banding or
kind<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.020> flickering<00:00:35.630> quality<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.879> sometimes

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
kind of flickering quality and sometimes

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.020 
kind of flickering quality and sometimes
they're<00:00:39.270> hard<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.809> spot<00:00:40.280> but<00:00:41.280> other<00:00:41.790> areas

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
they're hard to spot but other areas

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.799 
they're hard to spot but other areas
that<00:00:42.629> are<00:00:42.809> tight<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:44.120> may<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
that are tight like this may be the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.279 
that are tight like this may be the
culprit<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> find<00:00:48.450> these<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.660> later

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
culprit so to find these in later

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
culprit so to find these in later
versions<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.829> max<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.670> go<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> X<00:00:51.329> View<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
versions of max you can go to X View and

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.779 
versions of max you can go to X View and
go<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.370> overlapping<00:00:54.149> faces<00:00:55.399> make<00:00:56.399> sure<00:00:56.640> you

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
go to overlapping faces make sure you

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.319 
go to overlapping faces make sure you
have<00:00:56.969> face<00:00:57.329> mode<00:00:57.570> selected<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.640> go<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.699> select

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
have face mode selected and go to select

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.460 
have face mode selected and go to select
results<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:02.600> already<00:01:03.600> says<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.140> five

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
results I already says we have five

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.280 
results I already says we have five
faces<00:01:04.949> before<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.369> select<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> results<00:01:06.420> but

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
faces before we select the results but

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.550 
faces before we select the results but
once<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.979> select<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> results<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.270> press

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
once we select the results we can press

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.960 
once we select the results we can press
Z<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:11.040> zoom<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:12.439> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.950> find<00:01:14.310> where<00:01:14.820> these

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
Z for zoom and you can find where these

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.660 
Z for zoom and you can find where these
problem<00:01:15.330> areas<00:01:15.450> are<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.860> easiest<00:01:17.220> way<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.460> get

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
problem areas are the easiest way to get

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.609 
problem areas are the easiest way to get
rid<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.880> these<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.720> move<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.170> geometry

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
rid of these is to move the geometry

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.950 
rid of these is to move the geometry
around<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:21.990> move<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.470> over<00:01:24.740> and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
around so you can move this over and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.950 
around so you can move this over and
already<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.890> come<00:01:29.159> down<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.340> three<00:01:29.700> faces<00:01:30.180> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
already it's come down to three faces so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.530 
already it's come down to three faces so
we<00:01:30.990> know<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.350> has<00:01:31.560> been<00:01:31.590> eliminated<00:01:32.540> I'm

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
we know this has been eliminated I'm

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.050 
we know this has been eliminated I'm
going<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.780> go<00:01:34.049> back<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.259> polygon<00:01:34.740> mode<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.220> do

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
going to go back to polygon mode and do

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.830 
going to go back to polygon mode and do
select<00:01:36.600> results<00:01:37.850> press<00:01:38.850> Z<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.119> zoom<00:01:39.450> into<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
select results press Z to zoom into the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.380 
select results press Z to zoom into the
problem<00:01:40.290> area<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.790> then<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.119> another

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
problem area and then we have another

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.929 
problem area and then we have another
area<00:01:42.630> right<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.380> where<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.340> fix

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
area right here we where we can fix

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.139 
area right here we where we can fix
these<00:01:45.270> overlapping<00:01:45.840> faces<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.399> also<00:01:47.549> see<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
these overlapping faces you also see it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.609 
these overlapping faces you also see it
will<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.630> green<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.470> X<00:01:50.430> view<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:55.350> I'm<00:01:55.409> just

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
will be in green in X view so I'm just

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.590 
will be in green in X view so I'm just
going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.799> move<00:01:55.950> these<00:01:56.159> over<00:01:56.329> another<00:01:57.329> way<00:01:57.540> to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
going to move these over another way to

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
going to move these over another way to
do<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.649> delete<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> whole<00:01:59.159> area<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
do this is to delete the whole area and

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.630 
do this is to delete the whole area and
kind<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> start<00:02:00.450> again<00:02:00.770> but<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.460> lot

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
kind of start again but it's a lot

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.959 
kind of start again but it's a lot
easier<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.600> move<00:02:03.840> these<00:02:04.939> so<00:02:05.939> that

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
easier to just move these so that

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.010 
easier to just move these so that
they're<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:06.390> overlapping

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.590 

so<00:02:12.020> now<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:12.200> have<00:02:12.440> zero<00:02:12.800> faces<00:02:13.310> down<00:02:13.460> here<00:02:13.700> we

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
so now we have zero faces down here we

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.730 
so now we have zero faces down here we
can<00:02:14.810> go<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.230> next<00:02:15.470> issue<00:02:15.950> on<00:02:16.340> this<00:02:16.490> mesh

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.990 

so<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.830> next<00:02:22.130> thing<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.870> isolated<00:02:23.870> vertices

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
so the next thing is isolated vertices

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.460 
so the next thing is isolated vertices
now<00:02:26.000> one<00:02:26.210> thing<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.450> can<00:02:26.780> happen<00:02:26.960> is<00:02:27.410> when

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
now one thing that can happen is when

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.060 
now one thing that can happen is when
you<00:02:27.980> cut<00:02:28.490> through<00:02:28.700> your<00:02:28.850> mesh<00:02:29.560> then<00:02:30.560> maybe<00:02:30.860> you

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
you cut through your mesh then maybe you

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.810 
you cut through your mesh then maybe you
decide<00:02:31.460> that<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:32.540> edge<00:02:32.870> shouldn't<00:02:33.380> be<00:02:33.470> here

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
decide that this edge shouldn't be here

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.620 
decide that this edge shouldn't be here
so<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:34.880> can<00:02:35.030> remove<00:02:35.270> it

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
so you can remove it

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.570 
so you can remove it
sometimes<00:02:36.470> vertices<00:02:37.040> will<00:02:37.220> be<00:02:37.250> left<00:02:37.520> behind

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
sometimes vertices will be left behind

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.790 
sometimes vertices will be left behind
so<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:41.120> remove<00:02:41.360> these<00:02:41.510> vertices<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:44.120> can

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
so to remove these vertices you can

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.010 
so to remove these vertices you can
press<00:02:45.800> backspace<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.600> will<00:02:47.750> remove

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
press backspace and that will remove

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.480 
press backspace and that will remove
them<00:02:48.230> now<00:02:49.450> if<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.540> want<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.780> remove<00:02:51.650> vertices

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
them now if you want to remove vertices

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.990 
them now if you want to remove vertices
and<00:02:52.790> edges<00:02:53.000> all<00:02:53.420> together<00:02:53.810> at<00:02:54.230> once<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:55.760> can

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
and edges all together at once you can

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.560 
and edges all together at once you can
select<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.750> edge<00:02:57.230> loop<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.970> press<00:02:58.970> ctrl

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
select that edge loop and press ctrl

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.410 
select that edge loop and press ctrl
backspace<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:01.430> will<00:03:01.550> remove<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.240> edge

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
backspace and that will remove the edge

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.480 
backspace and that will remove the edge
edges<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.890> verts<00:03:04.100> at<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.730> same<00:03:04.910> time

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
edges and the verts at the same time

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.030 
edges and the verts at the same time
well<00:03:07.490> another<00:03:08.150> thing<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.860> isolated<00:03:09.860> vertices

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
well another thing is isolated vertices

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.780 
well another thing is isolated vertices
that<00:03:10.340> are<00:03:11.950> copied<00:03:12.950> outside<00:03:13.520> of<00:03:13.580> your<00:03:13.670> mesh<00:03:15.790> so

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
that are copied outside of your mesh so

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.150 
that are copied outside of your mesh so
we<00:03:16.880> have<00:03:17.120> one<00:03:17.780> right<00:03:17.989> here<00:03:18.500> let's<00:03:19.040> make

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
we have one right here let's make

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.840 
we have one right here let's make
another<00:03:19.900> right<00:03:20.900> one<00:03:21.320> right<00:03:21.470> here<00:03:21.770> this<00:03:22.459> could

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
another right one right here this could

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.390 
another right one right here this could
come<00:03:23.209> about<00:03:23.450> if<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.959> delete<00:03:24.470> geometry<00:03:25.040> in<00:03:25.310> a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
come about if you delete geometry in a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.840 
come about if you delete geometry in a
certain<00:03:25.670> way<00:03:25.790> or<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.800> accidently<00:03:27.800> shift<00:03:28.489> drag

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
certain way or you accidently shift drag

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.890 
certain way or you accidently shift drag
with<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.810> move<00:03:30.050> tool<00:03:30.320> active<00:03:31.330> and<00:03:32.330> that<00:03:32.570> will

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
with the move tool active and that will

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.410 
with the move tool active and that will
create<00:03:33.170> these<00:03:33.860> isolated<00:03:34.489> vertices<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:35.239> can

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
create these isolated vertices you can

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.090 
create these isolated vertices you can
just<00:03:35.630> press<00:03:35.810> Delete<00:03:36.020> on<00:03:36.380> these<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.890> it<00:03:36.980> will

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
just press Delete on these and it will

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.420 
just press Delete on these and it will
remove<00:03:37.400> them<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:38.170> also<00:03:39.170> in<00:03:39.560> X<00:03:39.830> view<00:03:40.070> we<00:03:40.220> have

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
remove them and also in X view we have

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.780 
remove them and also in X view we have
isolated<00:03:41.060> vertices<00:03:41.620> as<00:03:42.620> an<00:03:43.100> option<00:03:43.430> here<00:03:43.670> so

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
isolated vertices as an option here so

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.280 
isolated vertices as an option here so
you<00:03:44.060> can<00:03:44.530> see<00:03:45.530> where<00:03:45.680> those<00:03:45.830> are<00:03:46.070> and<00:03:47.110> also<00:03:48.110> do

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
you can see where those are and also do

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.540 
you can see where those are and also do
select<00:03:48.920> results<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.670> delete<00:03:54.070> one<00:03:55.070> last<00:03:55.310> thing

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
select results and delete one last thing

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.880 
select results and delete one last thing
is<00:03:55.989> when<00:03:56.989> you're<00:03:57.080> working<00:03:57.230> with<00:03:57.440> your<00:03:57.680> mesh

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
is when you're working with your mesh

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.640 
is when you're working with your mesh
you<00:03:58.100> want<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.310> make<00:03:58.430> sure<00:03:58.790> that<00:03:59.630> your<00:03:59.959> geometry

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
you want to make sure that your geometry

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.050 
you want to make sure that your geometry
is<00:04:01.030> even<00:04:02.030> as<00:04:02.600> far<00:04:02.810> as<00:04:02.959> topology<00:04:03.500> goes<00:04:03.970> so<00:04:04.970> if

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
is even as far as topology goes so if

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.120 
is even as far as topology goes so if
you<00:04:05.180> have<00:04:05.300> any<00:04:05.540> long<00:04:05.870> stretch<00:04:06.260> faces<00:04:06.830> you<00:04:06.980> want

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
you have any long stretch faces you want

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.630 
you have any long stretch faces you want
to<00:04:07.190> make<00:04:07.340> sure<00:04:07.370> those<00:04:07.880> are<00:04:08.769> cut<00:04:09.769> so<00:04:10.610> that

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
to make sure those are cut so that

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.400 
to make sure those are cut so that
they're<00:04:11.060> more<00:04:11.320> like<00:04:12.320> square<00:04:12.709> squares<00:04:14.380> so<00:04:15.380> I

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
they're more like square squares so I

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.590 
they're more like square squares so I
can<00:04:15.590> use<00:04:15.860> something<00:04:16.370> like<00:04:16.400> float<00:04:16.850> connect<00:04:17.180> if

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
can use something like float connect if

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:32.530 
can use something like float connect if
that<00:04:17.780> doesn't<00:04:18.080> work<00:04:18.260> just<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:19.880> regular<00:04:20.590> cut

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.600 

you

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.669 

you
