00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.370
 good to everyone today after another new 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.950
 defeat of manchester united this time to 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.330
 hands of the everton the eminent manchester 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.990
 loses the two games against 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.630
 everton for the first time since 1970 I think 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.910
 that is a fact that continues to reveal what 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.199
 that make a lousy season but 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.990
 Going full to the game worries 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.269
 each match the team ends without soul 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.070
 the team ends without idea the last 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:39.250
 25 minutes without shots to the goal 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.190
 practically the everton wins walking 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.520
 the match a penalty 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.980
 simply childish of phil jones that 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.070
 ends in the first goal of the everton and 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.960
 the second goal unmarked unusual 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.180
 kevin look at phil jones and jonny evans 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.680
 match to match show that no 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.510
 are trained to do the defense 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.820
 head of manchester united 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.890
 we do not need defense that reigns 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.080
 party and five parties not only that 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.149
 we need defense that all 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.690
 parties reign to the maximum at least 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.880
 that you see that desire 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.920
 of going to win the game of going to fight 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.010
 each ball and that simply has not been 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.710
 noticed we even saw rooney today 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.960
 erratic without ideas practically lost 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.510
 on the court as well as all the others 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.030
 players of manchester united is 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.480
 worrying is sad what is lived 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.610
 not only by results but by the 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.680
 attitude that shows the team I think that 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.840
 beyond that you can not match 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.210
 with which davis moix should not continue in the 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.580
 manchester united you have to be clear 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.160
 that players have a share of 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.320
 pretty big responsibility it shows 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.260
 players walking the court for 90 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.909
 minutes as if they did not care about 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.829
 true that 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.499
 during the next transfer market 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.509
 beyond see who is going to bring 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.859
 there are a lot of players that must 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.259
 end up leaving manchester united 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.090
 we do not need players who are 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.609
 running the 90 minutes that are 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.259
 walking the 90 minutes we do not need 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:11.330
 players who do not intend to 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.239
 out to win a match beyond 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.790
 difficulties we need players like 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.470
 roy keane we need players like rio 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.200
 ferdinand at the time as nemanja 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.819
 beach to leave everything on the court and 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.440
 that they simply understand at once 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.190
 for all who are playing for the 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.020
 manchester united 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.230
 I hope to be with you a new 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.070
 opportunity analyzing a victory of 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.080
 manchester united remember to subscribe 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.450
 I like the video and especially very 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.030
 important to leave your comments which one 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.990
 do you consider that it has been the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.270
 player that within all this this 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.450
 now so bad about this 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.180
 party has stood out a little to leave a 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.090
 little of that so disappointing mold 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.190
 in terms of individual performance 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.500
 each one of the players and they believe 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.300
 you who should be davis moix in the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.260
 four games remaining with respect 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.910
 to the eleven holder to try to take the 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.060
 three points in each of these 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.010
 matches and in that way try to look 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.820
 a place in the europa league next 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.820
 season
