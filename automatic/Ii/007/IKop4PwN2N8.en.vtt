00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.479 
I thought with support education and
obviously<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.440> never-ending<00:00:49.920> funding<00:00:50.399> of

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
obviously the never-ending funding of

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.279 
obviously the never-ending funding of
research<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:50.910> needs<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.719> be<00:00:51.840> helped<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.260> well

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289
