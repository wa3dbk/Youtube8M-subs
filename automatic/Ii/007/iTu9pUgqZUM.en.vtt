00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
this I recommend a 3 sensitivity for

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
this I recommend a 3 sensitivity for
this<00:00:42.570> game<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.469> really<00:00:43.920> fluent<00:00:44.430> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
this game it's just really fluent and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.420

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
tactical and what that does is it

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.709 
tactical and what that does is it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.270 
benefit is say you have a high recoil
weapon<00:01:27.180> such<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.009> isn't

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
weapon such as this like if this isn't

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.950 
weapon such as this like if this isn't
the<00:01:29.310> real<00:01:29.490> recoil<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:30.750> high

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the real recoil but if it was high

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.600 
the real recoil but if it was high
recoil<00:01:31.409> when<00:01:32.009> you're<00:01:32.159> dropping<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
recoil when you're dropping to the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.980 
recoil when you're dropping to the
ground<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> recoil<00:01:33.479> up<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> his

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
ground it's going to recoil up to his

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.510 
ground it's going to recoil up to his
chest<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.590> that's<00:01:34.710> another<00:01:34.979> great<00:01:35.189> tip<00:01:35.460> for

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
chest and that's another great tip for

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.140 
chest and that's another great tip for
you<00:01:35.729> guys<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:37.079> only<00:01:37.229> downside<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.189> plan

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
you guys and the only downside to plan

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.270 
you guys and the only downside to plan
on<00:01:39.329> tactical<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.320> cannot<00:01:40.680> panic<00:01:40.979> knife

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
on tactical is you cannot panic knife

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.249 
on tactical is you cannot panic knife
you<00:01:41.970> got<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> make<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> decision<00:01:42.390> when<00:01:43.170> you're

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
you got to make a decision when you're

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.749 
you got to make a decision when you're
running<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.710> person<00:01:44.070> say<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.729> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
running up to a person say this is a

running up to a person say this is a
person<00:01:45.119> I'm<00:01:45.240> sorry<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.659> had<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:45.990> this

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
person I'm sorry that I had to do this

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.420 
person I'm sorry that I had to do this
in<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.290> private<00:01:46.500> match<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.040> didn't<00:01:47.250> really

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
in a private match but I didn't really

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
in a private match but I didn't really
have<00:01:47.549> any<00:01:47.729> friends<00:01:47.759> online<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.930> say<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.409> a

have any friends online so say this is a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.170 
have any friends online so say this is a
person<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.159> you're<00:01:50.579> running<00:01:50.700> towards<00:01:51.090> each

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
person and you're running towards each

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.149 
person and you're running towards each
other<00:01:51.299> instead<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.259> panic<00:01:52.740> knifing<00:01:53.130> i

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
other instead of just panic knifing i

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.520 
other instead of just panic knifing i
just<00:01:53.520> press<00:01:53.670> b<00:01:53.909> by<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> way<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.960> instead<00:01:55.470> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
just press b by the way so instead of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.990 
just press b by the way so instead of
panic<00:01:55.890> i<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.250> can't<00:01:56.490> do<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.850> anymore

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
panic i think you can't do that anymore

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.550 
panic i think you can't do that anymore
because<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.630> can't<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.960> clench<00:01:58.200> down<00:01:58.290> on

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
because you can't just clench down on

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560 
because you can't just clench down on
your<00:01:58.649> controller<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.640> would<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.000> switch

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
your controller you would have to switch

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.600 
your controller you would have to switch
over<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.930> your<00:02:01.560> b<00:02:01.799> button<00:02:02.040> instead<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> just

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
over to your b button instead of just

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.550 
over to your b button instead of just
pressing<00:02:02.969> down<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.299> right<00:02:03.390> thumbstick<00:02:03.689> so

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
pressing down on the right thumbstick so

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.929 
pressing down on the right thumbstick so
you<00:02:04.649> got<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.890> make<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> decision<00:02:05.070> whether<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
you got to make a decision whether to

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.960 
you got to make a decision whether to
strafe<00:02:06.540> over<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> B<00:02:07.170> button<00:02:07.350> or<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:08.550> drop

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
strafe over to the B button or to drop

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.420 
strafe over to the B button or to drop
shot<00:02:09.300> now<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.989> prefer<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.649> drop<00:02:10.950> shot<00:02:11.220> when<00:02:11.370> I

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
shot now I prefer to drop shot when I

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.490 
shot now I prefer to drop shot when I
get<00:02:11.580> into<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.819> close<00:02:12.060> encounter<00:02:12.270> because
