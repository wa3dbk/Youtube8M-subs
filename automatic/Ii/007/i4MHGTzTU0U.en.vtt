tool is a give command generator I will
put<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> link<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.480> generator<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
put a link to the generator in the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.810 
put a link to the generator in the
description<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.070> make<00:00:23.250> sure<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.580> check<00:00:23.760> that

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
important and then we add data tags

important and then we add data tags
data<00:01:07.650> tags<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> way<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:09.210> customize

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
data tags are the way that we customize

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.630

the items basically what data tags are
is<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> way<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.570> minecraft<00:01:15.840> keeps

attributes<00:04:00.120> attributes<00:04:00.600> are<00:04:01.230> probably<00:04:01.590> my

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
attributes attributes are probably my

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.320 
attributes attributes are probably my
favorite<00:04:01.920> way<00:04:02.820> of<00:04:03.090> making<00:04:03.540> custom<00:04:03.989> items

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
favorite way of making custom items

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.570 
favorite way of making custom items
attributes<00:04:06.330> are<00:04:06.650> things<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.769> modify<00:04:08.549> the

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
attributes are things that modify the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.479 
attributes are things that modify the
item<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:10.320> abilities<00:04:10.769> that<00:04:10.799> it<00:04:11.100> gives<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
item and the abilities that it gives the

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.949 
item and the abilities that it gives the
player<00:04:12.079> so<00:04:13.079> one<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.739> those<00:04:13.950> attributes<00:04:14.579> is

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
player so one of those attributes is

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.250 
player so one of those attributes is
speed<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.260> another<00:04:17.010> one<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.430> attack<00:04:17.880> damage

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
speed and another one is attack damage

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.810 
speed and another one is attack damage
so<00:04:19.260> how<00:04:19.440> you<00:04:19.500> add<00:04:19.739> this<00:04:19.950> is<00:04:20.190> with<00:04:20.579> the

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
so how you add this is with the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.400 
so how you add this is with the
attribute<00:04:21.510> modifiers<00:04:22.380> tag<00:04:23.720> then<00:04:24.720> we<00:04:24.930> have<00:04:25.110> a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
attribute modifiers tag then we have a

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
attribute modifiers tag then we have a
list<00:04:25.800> of<00:04:26.070> all<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.610> attributes

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
list of all of the attributes

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.180 
list of all of the attributes
that<00:04:27.669> we<00:04:27.789> want<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.150> have<00:04:28.240> on<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.660> item<00:04:29.190> the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
that we want to have on the item the

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.830 
that we want to have on the item the
first<00:04:30.430> attribute<00:04:30.669> that<00:04:31.060> I<00:04:31.120> have<00:04:31.330> on<00:04:31.479> this<00:04:31.600> item

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
first attribute that I have on this item

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.100 
first attribute that I have on this item
is<00:04:32.430> generic<00:04:33.430> attack<00:04:33.850> damage<00:04:34.120> so<00:04:34.720> this<00:04:34.930> will

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
is generic attack damage so this will

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.710 
is generic attack damage so this will
increase<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.620> attack<00:04:36.130> damage<00:04:36.400> or<00:04:36.759> one

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
increase the attack damage or one

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.570 
increase the attack damage or one
increase<00:04:38.110> it<00:04:38.289> will<00:04:38.320> affect<00:04:38.949> the<00:04:39.280> attack

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
increase it will affect the attack

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.320 
increase it will affect the attack
damage<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:41.979> we<00:04:42.340> specify<00:04:42.850> this<00:04:43.030> by

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
damage so you we specify this by

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.230 
damage so you we specify this by
specifying<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.020> attribute<00:04:44.590> name<00:04:45.090> then<00:04:46.090> we

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
specifying the attribute name then we

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.390 
specifying the attribute name then we
give<00:04:46.419> that<00:04:46.600> attribute<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.289> specific<00:04:47.949> name<00:04:48.130> I

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
give that attribute a specific name I

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.879 
give that attribute a specific name I
have<00:04:49.210> again<00:04:49.660> named<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:50.050> generic<00:04:50.590> attack

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
have again named it generic attack

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.279 
have again named it generic attack
damage<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.460> then<00:04:52.300> we<00:04:52.419> specify<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.960> amount

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
damage and then we specify the amount

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.580 
damage and then we specify the amount
and<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.729> operation<00:04:54.729> the<00:04:55.479> amount<00:04:55.780> is<00:04:55.990> just<00:04:56.020> how

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
and the operation the amount is just how

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.860 
and the operation the amount is just how
much<00:04:56.800> we<00:04:57.160> want<00:04:57.370> it<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.699> change<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.630> the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
much we want it to change and the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.730 
much we want it to change and the
operation<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.680> how<00:05:00.310> we<00:05:00.370> want<00:05:00.759> it<00:05:00.849> to<00:05:01.000> change

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
operation is how we want it to change

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.029 
operation is how we want it to change
operation<00:05:02.740> zero<00:05:03.070> is<00:05:03.990> adding<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.289> base<00:05:05.590> amount

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
operation zero is adding the base amount

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.390 
operation zero is adding the base amount
so<00:05:06.509> this<00:05:07.509> is<00:05:07.690> addition<00:05:08.229> and<00:05:08.410> or<00:05:08.650> subtraction

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
so this is addition and or subtraction

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.360 
so this is addition and or subtraction
so<00:05:10.180> because<00:05:10.449> this<00:05:10.599> is<00:05:10.720> 30<00:05:10.990> it<00:05:11.320> will<00:05:11.530> add<00:05:11.740> 30

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
so because this is 30 it will add 30

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.230 
so because this is 30 it will add 30
attack<00:05:13.090> damage<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.690> this<00:05:13.810> item<00:05:14.820> operation<00:05:15.820> 1

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
attack damage to this item operation 1

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.719 
attack damage to this item operation 1
and<00:05:16.539> 2<00:05:16.900> are<00:05:17.169> both<00:05:17.199> percentages<00:05:18.160> 1<00:05:18.580> is

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
and 2 are both percentages 1 is

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.240 
and 2 are both percentages 1 is
multiplicative<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.930> other<00:05:20.080> is<00:05:20.349> additive

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
multiplicative and the other is additive

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.320 
multiplicative and the other is additive
then<00:05:22.210> we<00:05:22.330> also<00:05:22.479> specify<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.370> UUID<00:05:24.370> most<00:05:25.060> and

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
then we also specify the UUID most and

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.260 
then we also specify the UUID most and
least<00:05:25.720> these<00:05:26.650> are<00:05:26.919> just<00:05:27.160> random<00:05:27.430> numbers<00:05:28.000> that

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
least these are just random numbers that

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.540 
least these are just random numbers that
are<00:05:28.479> generated<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.199> ensure<00:05:30.099> that<00:05:30.130> this

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
are generated to ensure that this

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.680 
are generated to ensure that this
specific<00:05:31.620> attribute<00:05:32.620> is<00:05:33.000> unique<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.300> does

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
specific attribute is unique and does

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.589 
specific attribute is unique and does
not<00:05:34.840> get<00:05:35.020> applied<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.800> the<00:05:35.919> same<00:05:36.159> person

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
not get applied to the same person

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.029 
not get applied to the same person
multiple<00:05:37.599> times<00:05:37.870> to<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.590> same<00:05:38.620> player

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
multiple times to the same player

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.570 
multiple times to the same player
multiple<00:05:39.520> times<00:05:40.409> we<00:05:41.409> get<00:05:41.560> a<00:05:41.770> then<00:05:42.039> have<00:05:42.340> the

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
multiple times we get a then have the

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.990 
multiple times we get a then have the
second<00:05:43.180> attribute<00:05:43.389> on<00:05:43.960> my<00:05:44.320> list<00:05:44.729> this<00:05:45.729> time

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
second attribute on my list this time

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.839 
second attribute on my list this time
the<00:05:46.360> attribute<00:05:46.810> name<00:05:46.990> is<00:05:47.289> generic<00:05:48.099> movement

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
the attribute name is generic movement

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.540 
the attribute name is generic movement
speed<00:05:49.150> this<00:05:49.570> will<00:05:49.810> affect<00:05:50.199> the<00:05:50.440> speed<00:05:50.800> of<00:05:51.010> the

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
speed this will affect the speed of the

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.000 
speed this will affect the speed of the
player<00:05:51.789> and<00:05:52.229> then<00:05:53.229> I<00:05:53.260> gave<00:05:53.650> it<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:53.800> name

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
player and then I gave it the name

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.879 
player and then I gave it the name
generic<00:05:54.490> movement<00:05:54.849> speed<00:05:55.120> and<00:05:55.330> I<00:05:56.320> specify<00:05:56.830> the

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
generic movement speed and I specify the

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.790 
generic movement speed and I specify the
amount<00:05:57.190> of<00:05:57.490> point<00:05:58.270> 2<00:05:58.750> and<00:05:58.990> because<00:05:59.620> its

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
amount of point 2 and because its

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.760 
amount of point 2 and because its
operation<00:06:00.340> 1<00:06:00.580> this<00:06:01.030> will<00:06:01.240> be<00:06:01.389> a<00:06:01.630> percentage<00:06:02.289> so

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
operation 1 this will be a percentage so

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.320 
operation 1 this will be a percentage so
it<00:06:02.949> will<00:06:03.159> be<00:06:03.340> plus<00:06:03.639> 20%<00:06:05.159> movement<00:06:06.159> speed<00:06:06.430> then

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
it will be plus 20% movement speed then

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.379 
it will be plus 20% movement speed then
again<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:07.930> UUID<00:06:08.289> most<00:06:08.919> and<00:06:09.190> least<00:06:09.580> these<00:06:10.210> are

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
again the UUID most and least these are

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.200 
again the UUID most and least these are
just<00:06:10.570> randomly<00:06:10.930> generated<00:06:11.620> and<00:06:12.030> so<00:06:13.030> when<00:06:13.180> I

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
just randomly generated and so when I

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.149 
just randomly generated and so when I
give<00:06:13.419> myself<00:06:13.599> this<00:06:14.020> item<00:06:14.349> you'll<00:06:14.740> see<00:06:14.889> that<00:06:15.009> my

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
give myself this item you'll see that my

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:16.710 
give myself this item you'll see that my
field<00:06:15.490> of<00:06:15.610> view<00:06:15.789> does<00:06:16.000> increase<00:06:16.300> a<00:06:16.360> little<00:06:16.509> bit

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
field of view does increase a little bit

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.589 
field of view does increase a little bit
that's<00:06:17.680> because<00:06:18.099> this<00:06:18.310> item<00:06:18.699> has<00:06:18.909> plus<00:06:19.330> 30

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
that's because this item has plus 30

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:21.899 
that's because this item has plus 30
attack<00:06:19.870> damage<00:06:20.080> and<00:06:20.380> plus<00:06:20.740> 20<00:06:21.220> percent<00:06:21.610> speed

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:21.909 
attack damage and plus 20 percent speed

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.279 
attack damage and plus 20 percent speed
so<00:06:22.900> when<00:06:23.080> I<00:06:23.110> hold<00:06:23.440> this<00:06:23.620> item<00:06:23.889> in<00:06:24.159> my<00:06:24.190> hand<00:06:24.669> I

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
so when I hold this item in my hand I

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.890 
so when I hold this item in my hand I
will<00:06:26.289> be<00:06:26.409> given<00:06:26.770> a<00:06:26.949> speed<00:06:27.310> boost<00:06:27.580> and<00:06:27.909> an

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
will be given a speed boost and an

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.460 
will be given a speed boost and an
attack<00:06:29.409> damage<00:06:29.770> boost<00:06:30.509> these<00:06:31.509> can<00:06:31.840> be<00:06:31.990> changed

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
attack damage boost these can be changed

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.219 
attack damage boost these can be changed
and<00:06:32.680> modified<00:06:32.830> to<00:06:33.460> suit<00:06:34.120> your<00:06:34.300> needs<00:06:34.539> in<00:06:34.870> any

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
and modified to suit your needs in any

way that you like now when you combine

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:41.310 
way that you like now when you combine
all<00:06:39.820> of<00:06:39.880> these<00:06:40.270> things<00:06:40.659> together

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
all of these things together

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.650 
all of these things together
on<00:06:41.470> the<00:06:41.650> same<00:06:41.860> item<00:06:42.220> that<00:06:42.820> is<00:06:43.000> when<00:06:43.210> you<00:06:43.450> get

on the same item that is when you get

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.190 
on the same item that is when you get
