00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 use 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.460
 or from all over the world trans here today 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.190
 I bring my first video of black box tops 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.400
 today I extract unite derek on the map of 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.859
 station transit mode and good 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.900
 the first thing is to go with the bus worth us 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.060
 we go up and just when we are 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.040
 seeing the lava there we have to throw 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.440
 there we see it is the third stop if not 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.270
 I remember nothing bad we got off and then 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.000
 here is not worth extending to here 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.860
 but here is how these commented 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.809
 maze of ears and out there do not 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.430
 you deserve it is behind that here they 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.780
 notice that the icon that the brain is 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.350
 so when I say it is worth installing 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.870
 ok I teach it well and we have to go 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.149
 towards this labyrinth of corn cobs the law 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.979
 we have to go straight everything straight 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.050
 as you are seeing it is very easy to 

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:55.229
 get there you see I'm going to the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.210
 left and then we go towards the 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.519
 right a very small passage that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.289
 you barely notice it 's out there I'm 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.209
 advertisers I say times for what is 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.440
 around here I'm seeing it and there we are 

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:06.440
 in no one 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.920
 we are here on the station map and already 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.380
 within this map is a part of a 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.420
 totem we can enter can not lend 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.310
 on the top floor only the one on the bottom 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.380
 We can not go down the stairs 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.270
 all covered up so I can not go 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.480
 we found some trick to do what 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.580
 let it be on this map or whatever it is I 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.750
 I will bring here you see that place that 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.840
 can do here but good is a 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.280
 interest so you can see how is this 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.160
 map you see that you can not rebuild 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.380
 barriers or anything and good in my opinion 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.930
 of this game is that I was pretty 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.700
 well done is a pass at the moment is 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.230
 what we say in all the games but 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.630
 good for the moment I'm liking 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.210
 I'm pretty good at what 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.450
 of the bus and everything went very brown and 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.220
 we already see that it is adri rc that is going to 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.290

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.450
