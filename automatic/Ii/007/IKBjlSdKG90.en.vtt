no what we're gonna do is hopefully that
cuts<00:01:58.259> off

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
cuts off

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.690 
cuts off
take<00:02:00.290> where<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:01.100> remember<00:02:01.490> her<00:02:01.610> wig<00:02:01.790> being

and try to flip it back on top no this
is<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.310> hardest<00:02:10.610> part<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:14.180> remembering<00:02:14.569> where

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
is the hardest part is remembering where

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.910

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
back where it was supposed to be okay

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.810 
back where it was supposed to be okay
that<00:02:24.560> looks<00:02:24.650> about<00:02:24.860> right<00:02:30.640> okay<00:02:31.640> I'm<00:02:31.700> gonna

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
that looks about right okay I'm gonna

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.240 
that looks about right okay I'm gonna
let<00:02:32.030> this<00:02:32.209> sit<00:02:32.480> for<00:02:32.510> just<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.959> second<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.590> then

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
let this sit for just a second and then
