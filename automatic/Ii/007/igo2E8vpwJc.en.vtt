you<00:02:28.520> must<00:02:28.730> yeah<00:02:29.680> well<00:02:30.760> making<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.909> whole<00:02:32.090> video

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
you must yeah well making a whole video

you must yeah well making a whole video
will<00:02:32.510> take<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> lot<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:32.989> production<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:33.620> but

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
will take a lot of production so but

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.100 
will take a lot of production so but
this<00:02:34.550> is<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.879> basics<00:02:35.330> of<00:02:35.450> how<00:02:35.510> we<00:02:35.690> actually<00:02:36.019> go

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
this is the basics of how we actually go

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.100 
this is the basics of how we actually go
about<00:02:36.260> doing<00:02:36.560> it

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
about doing it

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.170 
about doing it
so<00:02:37.290> you've<00:02:37.410> taken<00:02:37.620> your<00:02:37.800> footage<00:02:38.160> from<00:02:38.460> while

so you've taken your footage from while

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.510 
so you've taken your footage from while
model<00:02:39.540> via<00:02:39.690> awesome<00:02:40.290> then<00:02:40.920> what<00:02:41.100> you<00:02:41.190> do<00:02:41.340> for

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
model via awesome then what you do for

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.100 
model via awesome then what you do for
example<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.210> you<00:02:42.420> light<00:02:42.570> up<00:02:42.600> your<00:02:42.810> game<00:02:42.960> of

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
example is you light up your game of

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.940 
example is you light up your game of
