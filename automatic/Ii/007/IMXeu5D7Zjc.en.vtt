00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
Fritos I think it's called flawless

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.630 
Fritos I think it's called flawless
curls<00:05:06.450> and<00:05:06.810> this<00:05:07.620> is<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.950> result<00:05:08.310> of<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:08.610> I

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
curls and this is the result of that I

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.820 
curls and this is the result of that I
did<00:05:08.940> a<00:05:08.970> little<00:05:09.270> bit<00:05:09.479> of<00:05:09.510> diffusing<00:05:10.140> and<00:05:10.500> I'll

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
did a little bit of diffusing and I'll

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.440 
did a little bit of diffusing and I'll
let<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.160> hair<00:05:11.370> air<00:05:11.550> dry<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.880> rest<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.300> way

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
let the hair air dry the rest of the way

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.650 
let the hair air dry the rest of the way
and<00:05:13.160> you<00:05:14.160> know<00:05:14.310> I<00:05:14.340> don't<00:05:14.580> really<00:05:14.970> notice<00:05:15.210> a

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
and you know I don't really notice a

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.620 
and you know I don't really notice a
difference<00:05:16.140> with<00:05:16.320> diffusing<00:05:16.890> and<00:05:16.979> air<00:05:17.130> drying

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
difference with diffusing and air drying

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.200 
difference with diffusing and air drying
honestly<00:05:18.630> I<00:05:18.810> mean<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.950> curls<00:05:20.280> are<00:05:20.580> I<00:05:20.669> guess<00:05:21.180> a

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
honestly I mean the curls are I guess a

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.370 
honestly I mean the curls are I guess a
little<00:05:21.630> bit<00:05:22.080> more<00:05:22.290> defined<00:05:22.550> but<00:05:23.550> I<00:05:24.380> mean

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
little bit more defined but I mean

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.200 
little bit more defined but I mean
actually<00:05:25.919> not<00:05:26.100> more<00:05:26.310> defined<00:05:26.729> but<00:05:27.000> they're<00:05:27.180> a

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
actually not more defined but they're a

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.810 
actually not more defined but they're a
little<00:05:27.330> bit<00:05:27.479> more<00:05:27.600> there's<00:05:28.380> like<00:05:29.010> more<00:05:29.220> fluffy

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
little bit more there's like more fluffy

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.000 
little bit more there's like more fluffy
and<00:05:30.000> with<00:05:30.150> diffusing<00:05:30.810> rather<00:05:31.530> than<00:05:31.770> air

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
and with diffusing rather than air

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.950 
and with diffusing rather than air
drying<00:05:32.310> so<00:05:33.240> that's<00:05:33.479> really<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.720> only

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
drying so that's really the only

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.930 
drying so that's really the only
difference<00:05:34.140> I<00:05:34.500> noticed<00:05:34.710> with<00:05:35.130> diffusing<00:05:35.820> and

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
difference I noticed with diffusing and

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.060 
difference I noticed with diffusing and
air<00:05:36.150> drying<00:05:37.729> that's<00:05:38.729> pretty<00:05:38.970> much<00:05:39.120> it<00:05:40.040> so<00:05:41.040> I

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
air drying that's pretty much it so I

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.860 
air drying that's pretty much it so I
couldn't<00:05:41.640> really<00:05:41.790> recommend<00:05:42.419> one<00:05:42.630> or<00:05:42.660> the

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
couldn't really recommend one or the

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.750 
couldn't really recommend one or the
other<00:05:43.050> it's<00:05:43.260> really<00:05:43.350> just<00:05:43.710> up<00:05:43.919> to<00:05:44.100> you<00:05:44.220> it's
