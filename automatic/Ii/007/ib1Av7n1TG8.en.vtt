reason I just wanted to really just

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.639 
reason I just wanted to really just
touch<00:01:31.420> base<00:01:31.689> because<00:01:32.110> I<00:01:32.170> haven't<00:01:32.409> put<00:01:32.500> any

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
touch base because I haven't put any

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.550 
touch base because I haven't put any
videos<00:01:33.040> on<00:01:33.070> YouTube<00:01:33.969> for<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.240> while<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.380> that's
