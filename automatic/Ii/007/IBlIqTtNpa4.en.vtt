00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:19.979 

well<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.180> think<00:03:19.299> once<00:03:19.569> The<00:03:19.689> Last<00:03:19.810> Airbender

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
well I think once The Last Airbender

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.300 
well I think once The Last Airbender
comes<00:03:20.439> out<00:03:20.590> people<00:03:20.860> are<00:03:20.950> all<00:03:21.099> gonna<00:03:21.250> be

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
comes out people are all gonna be

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.130 
comes out people are all gonna be
wondering<00:03:21.700> what<00:03:21.790> bending<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.480> it's<00:03:22.930> gonna<00:03:23.019> be

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
wondering what bending is it's gonna be

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.479 
wondering what bending is it's gonna be
a<00:03:23.170> word<00:03:23.349> it's<00:03:23.530> gonna<00:03:23.680> be<00:03:23.769> out<00:03:23.890> there<00:03:24.099> and<00:03:24.370> I

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
a word it's gonna be out there and I

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.880 
a word it's gonna be out there and I
think<00:03:24.840> bending<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.989> simplest<00:03:26.829> explanation

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
think bending the simplest explanation

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.520 
think bending the simplest explanation
is<00:03:27.549> to<00:03:27.970> bend<00:03:28.480> an<00:03:28.629> element<00:03:29.079> you<00:03:29.170> can<00:03:29.319> manipulate

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
is to bend an element you can manipulate

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.660 
is to bend an element you can manipulate
it<00:03:30.010> kind<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:31.799> through<00:03:32.799> through<00:03:33.129> meditation

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
it kind of through through meditation
