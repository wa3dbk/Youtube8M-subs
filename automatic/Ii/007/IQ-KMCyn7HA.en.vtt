00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
regular brush like okay so comparing

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.990 
regular brush like okay so comparing

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
this brush so this is like the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.809 
this brush so this is like the
lengthening<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.630> volumizing<00:02:07.729> compared<00:02:08.729> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
lengthening and volumizing compared it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.570 
lengthening and volumizing compared it
to<00:02:08.849> about<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.479> bad<00:02:09.720> gal<00:02:10.020> lash<00:02:10.229> which<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.950> like

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
to about a bad gal lash which is like

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.110 
to about a bad gal lash which is like
the<00:02:12.180> mascara<00:02:12.840> known<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.500> volumize<00:02:14.120> it's

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the mascara known to volumize it's

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.760 
the mascara known to volumize it's
pretty<00:02:15.480> crazy<00:02:16.430> like<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.960> so<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.200> one<00:02:19.350> on<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
pretty crazy like that so the one on the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.440 
pretty crazy like that so the one on the
left<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> bad<00:02:20.490> gal<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> one<00:02:21.240> on<00:02:21.270> the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.210 
left is the bad gal and the one on the
right<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> clearance<00:02:22.140> one<00:02:22.380> like<00:02:23.010> it's

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
right is a clearance one like it's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.220 
right is a clearance one like it's
pretty<00:02:23.400> small<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:23.820> this<00:02:24.120> thing<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.750> volume

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
pretty small but this thing can volume

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.300 
pretty small but this thing can volume
eyes<00:02:25.380> which<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.680> really<00:02:26.130> really<00:02:26.340> sick<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.050> I

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
eyes which is really really sick and I

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.950 
eyes which is really really sick and I
said<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.430> lengthens<00:02:30.090> also<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.480> if<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.780> get

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
said it lengthens also so if you get

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.500 
said it lengthens also so if you get
like<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.260> new<00:02:31.410> covergirl<00:02:31.760> LashBlast<00:02:32.760> lash

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
like the new covergirl LashBlast lash

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.890 
like the new covergirl LashBlast lash
blast<00:02:33.960> length<00:02:34.380> which<00:02:34.590> looks<00:02:34.890> like<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:35.900> looks

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
blast length which looks like this looks

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.720 
blast length which looks like this looks
like<00:02:37.020> this<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.770> compare<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
like this and compare it to the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.340 
like this and compare it to the
clearance<00:02:39.980> like<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.750> it's<00:02:42.750> pretty<00:02:43.050> good

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
clearance like this it's pretty good

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.870 
clearance like this it's pretty good
like<00:02:46.350> it's<00:02:46.590> pretty<00:02:46.830> long<00:02:47.220> too<00:02:47.520> which<00:02:47.730> is

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
like it's pretty long too which is

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.240 
like it's pretty long too which is
awesome<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.690> that's<00:02:49.260> where<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.530> lengthening

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
awesome so that's where the lengthening

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.810 
awesome so that's where the lengthening
comes<00:02:50.460> in<00:02:51.770> when<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:52.860> goes<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.160> your<00:02:53.280> lashes<00:02:53.430> it

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
comes in when it goes on your lashes it

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.550 
comes in when it goes on your lashes it
goes<00:02:53.940> really<00:02:54.240> nicely<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.900> have<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.350> right

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
goes really nicely I have it on right

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.650 
goes really nicely I have it on right
now<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.220> looks<00:02:56.400> like<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:59.480> really<00:03:00.480> when<00:03:00.630> I

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
now so it looks like so really when I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.950 
now so it looks like so really when I
wear<00:03:00.930> mascaras<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.800> like<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.100> put<00:03:02.960> lengthening

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
wear mascaras I like to put lengthening

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.050 
wear mascaras I like to put lengthening
then<00:03:04.500> volumizing<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.490> then<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.610> want<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.850> put<00:03:05.940> a

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.610 
then volumizing and then I want to put a
little<00:03:06.300> softer<00:03:06.630> one<00:03:06.780> because<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.320> bottom

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
little softer one because the bottom

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.590 
little softer one because the bottom
lashes<00:03:07.800> are<00:03:08.100> pretty<00:03:08.640> delicate<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.210> harder<00:03:09.480> to

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
lashes are pretty delicate and harder to

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.800 
lashes are pretty delicate and harder to
get<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:11.280> one<00:03:11.520> I<00:03:11.730> forget<00:03:12.150> all<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.720> my

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810

lashes<00:03:13.020> I<00:03:13.260> could<00:03:13.410> get<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> top<00:03:13.860> lashes<00:03:14.160> I

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
lashes I could get the top lashes I

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.220

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
could get the bottom lashes really

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.020 
could get the bottom lashes really
really<00:03:16.620> really<00:03:17.010> great<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.489> quality<00:03:18.000> so

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
really really great in quality so

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.729 
really really great in quality so
basically<00:03:18.510> two<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.900> these<00:03:19.050> equals<00:03:19.470> one<00:03:19.620> of

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
basically two of these equals one of

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.070 
basically two of these equals one of
these<00:03:19.890> now<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.610> will<00:03:21.060> be<00:03:21.180> still<00:03:21.360> using<00:03:21.780> all<00:03:21.930> my

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
is awesome now my only only downfall

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.400 
is awesome now my only only downfall
this<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.720> my<00:03:27.840> only<00:03:28.290> downfall<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:30.410> you

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
this is my only downfall is that you

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.110 
this is my only downfall is that you
know<00:03:31.500> when<00:03:31.650> sometimes<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:32.130> do<00:03:32.280> mascara<00:03:32.489> and

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
know when sometimes you do mascara and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.840 
know when sometimes you do mascara and
you<00:03:33.870> get<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.080> bit<00:03:34.260> on<00:03:34.410> your<00:03:34.530> skin<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.790> can

you get a bit on your skin and you can

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.070 
you get a bit on your skin and you can
just<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.180> know<00:03:36.239> clean<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.690> off<00:03:36.810> right<00:03:37.020> away
