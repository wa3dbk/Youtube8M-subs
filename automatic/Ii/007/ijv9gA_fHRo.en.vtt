00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Just before Christmas, everyone is back 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.220
 shopping fever and it always will 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.359
 bought more online so we are looking 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.550
 take a closer look today 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.110
 what about the mail-order company Amazon shortly 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.360
 Before the festival is over, my name is 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.549
 arne and i have honor to you today 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.929
 at this information wonder tour 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.010
 then to take the hand 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.689
 what's going on in black now just before 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.279
 Christmas doubles the Amazon 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.590
 Employee numbers in Germany currently 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.599
 There are about 9,000 employees 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.400
 and now come another 12,000 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.720
 temporary staff to that is definitely 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.309
 a big logistical challenge 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.050
 so that everything goes smoothly 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.880
 works controlled the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.530
 Shippers exactly where the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.059
 were just nothing 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.710
 Lost is all goods are with it 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.329
 has a bar code provided as well 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.160
 every employee also has an ID card 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.809
 barcode with which he is at the entrance 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.430
 a log thereby becomes the working time of the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.620
 employee records the warehouses of 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.760
 amazon would be called fulfillment center 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.590
 this concept shows how 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.239
 Customer oriented is the mail order company 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.070
 Namely, fulfillment has of the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.960
 word meaning cell phones with a stock 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.550
 full of goods to do but with one 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.170
 place at the tasks and above all 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.000
 wishes to be fulfilled everywhere in the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.890
 warehouses are hung on cameras 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 to monitor the work processes and order 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.760
 to control the employees in 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.409
 a hall full of great vacherin is 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.580
 they just try big 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.960
 what to bring one 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.909
 Safety lock at the entrance must 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.950
 the employees, therefore, you too 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.810
 register private phone the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.000
 employees who collect the true ones 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.860
 if pippa called the staff the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.479
 packaging the items is called brecker 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.070
 so that can be controlled how 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.689
 efficiently the employees work 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.850
 need the pizza for each item 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.240
 First of all, your own staff course 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.680
 know 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.110
 then register with the scanner 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.420
 the goods the shelf so the system knows 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.310
 who or what, when and where is this 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.350
 Success principle of modern warehouse home 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.850
 based among other things on that were 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.409
 just put somewhere in the shelf 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.630
 so there will not be a shelf with it 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.040
 dvds and one with shoes or something 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.869
 Amazon is the tablet computer for 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.640
 example next to the down jacket on the shelf 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.229
 as soon as a place becomes available 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.369
 new goods will be refilled by it 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.780
 saves the company the order 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.579
 sorting the articles by the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.250
 continuous scanning knows the computer system 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.780
 Exactly where what lies at the same time 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.399
 this system allows a pretty much 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.170
 blatant supervision of the employees 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.000
 That is why many employees call in the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.630
 scanner georgi based on the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.640
 book author german the famous 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.140
 1984 has written in this book 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.150
 It is a completely supervised 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.530
 Strongly had the works council of Amazon 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.750
 repeatedly criticized in the past 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.790
 that the data collection for the control of 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.710
 Employees and they are involved 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.420
 be counted faster to work that 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.980
 is the mac namely exactly when one 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.720
 Employees for too long the scanner is not 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.700
 used and then can another 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.320
 Employee at the end after looking where not 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.090
 Amazon is denied but denies 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.960
 vehemently the employees to faster 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.370
 to force work 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.410
 the company is more about the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.970
 Reduction of errors through feedback 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.250
 Talks should not be exercised 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.260
 but be checked if the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.240
 Employees are properly trained this 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.380
 There is a principle of process optimization 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.480
 but also operated in many others 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.860
 not only with Amazon even more 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.870
 orders in even less time 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.220
 but it will not work 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.320
 only set up for employee training 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.180
 In early 2012, Amazon has in 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.640
 robot maker keyword by now 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.590
 are at amazon in the usa 15,000 of these 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.570
 small robots on the go the little ones 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.760
 mini helfer ride under the shelves 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.110
 The true ones lift these and drive 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.850
 then with the shelf to the human 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.470
 then pack the items 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.820
 pack and make it ready to ship 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.620
 the employees do not have to work like that anymore 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.480
 far run without the robot places a 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.460
 pickers daily a distance of 10 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.470
 up to 15 kilometers back the robots 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.060
 can transport up to 1200 kilos 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.620
 when the baker the goods 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.540
 has taken out the shelf 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.220
 automatically back through this can 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.080
 be worked much faster 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.760
 so far, Amazon denies that it plans 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.780
 Gives all human workers 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.370
 replace robot 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.080
 they should only do the work for the 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.730
 People also take it easier 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.530
 also the mass of the converted goods 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.090
 always on to more and more people 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.980
 Buy online a robot should 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.550
 This will help you to get more done 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.600
 deal with 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.250
 so at Amazon you can do his 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.080
 Order Christmas presents online and 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.340
 if mom happens to be a cucumber 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.930
 then you should maybe 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.850
 you pay attention here because vegetables 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.660
 Zalando is always there too 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.820
 again criticism of the 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.350
 Working conditions That's what it's about here 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.550
 this balances with you bought her 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.160
 your christmas presents only online 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.750
 or he prefers to go directly to the store and 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.040
 what would you actually give me 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.390
 I'm interested in any case 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.530
 write your opinion in the comments 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.530
 and now a nice weekend
