a total scared away too high of a total

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.980 
a total scared away too high of a total
but<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.909> see<00:02:00.030> lots<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.479> points<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.869> this

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
but I just see lots of points in this

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.630 
but I just see lots of points in this
game<00:02:01.079> neither<00:02:01.500> team<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.070> really<00:02:02.340> run<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
game neither team can really run the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.209 
game neither team can really run the
ball<00:02:02.820> effectively<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.290> really<00:02:04.680> see<00:02:04.890> lots

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
ball effectively and I really see lots

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.580 
ball effectively and I really see lots
of<00:02:05.460> passing<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.210> back<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.600> forth<00:02:06.899> once

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
of passing going back and forth once

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.040 
of passing going back and forth once
that<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.099> really<00:02:08.280> jumps<00:02:08.819> out<00:02:08.970> at<00:02:09.209> me<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.629> that

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
that that really jumps out at me is that

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.330 
that that really jumps out at me is that
the<00:02:10.200> fact<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.830> Packers<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.000> 31st

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
the fact that the Packers have the 31st

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.479 
the fact that the Packers have the 31st
worst<00:02:13.989> pass<00:02:14.989> defense<00:02:15.019> in<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.739> NFL<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.190> they're

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
worst pass defense in the NFL so they're

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.910 
worst pass defense in the NFL so they're
giving<00:02:16.760> out<00:02:16.879> just<00:02:17.180> under<00:02:17.360> 2<00:02:17.660> 90<00:02:18.110> in<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.769> air

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
giving out just under 2 90 in the air

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.160 
giving out just under 2 90 in the air
per<00:02:19.310> game<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:19.849> think<00:02:20.060> Detroit<00:02:20.569> you<00:02:21.140> know

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
per game and I think Detroit you know

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.660 
per game and I think Detroit you know
their<00:02:21.440> bread<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.709> butter<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:22.160> passing<00:02:22.610> the

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
their bread and butter is passing the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.790 
their bread and butter is passing the
ball<00:02:22.849> so<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.090> see<00:02:23.330> lots<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:24.050> passing<00:02:24.560> in<00:02:24.650> this

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
ball so I see lots of passing in this

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.890 
ball so I see lots of passing in this
game<00:02:24.980> lots<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.430> points<00:02:25.610> John<00:02:26.390> Ryan<00:02:26.599> what<00:02:26.810> do

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
game lots of points John Ryan what do

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.630 
game lots of points John Ryan what do
you<00:02:26.959> think<00:02:27.170> you<00:02:27.260> think<00:02:27.290> either<00:02:27.800> side<00:02:28.280> on<00:02:28.489> the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
you think you think either side on the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.070 
you think you think either side on the
over/under<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.420> good<00:02:29.660> here<00:02:29.840> what<00:02:29.959> do<00:02:30.019> you

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
over/under is good here what do you

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.070 
over/under is good here what do you
think<00:02:30.200> about<00:02:30.230> Green<00:02:30.500> Bay<00:02:30.650> minus<00:02:30.980> 6<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:32.080> think

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
think about Green Bay minus 6 I think

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.220 
think about Green Bay minus 6 I think
this<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.379> where<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.650> Green<00:02:34.400> Bay<00:02:34.430> run<00:02:34.879> ends<00:02:35.390> I

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
this is where a Green Bay run ends I

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.630 
this is where a Green Bay run ends I
mean<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.650> think<00:02:36.680> we<00:02:36.860> all<00:02:36.890> remember<00:02:37.459> at<00:02:37.519> least

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
mean I think we all remember at least

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.880 
mean I think we all remember at least
when<00:02:37.849> I<00:02:37.910> was<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.120> kid<00:02:38.150> growing<00:02:38.660> up<00:02:39.440> you'd<00:02:39.680> watch

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
when I was a kid growing up you'd watch

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.400 
when I was a kid growing up you'd watch
detroit<00:02:40.400> on<00:02:40.819> thanksgiving<00:02:41.420> day<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.870> they

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
detroit on thanksgiving day and they

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.430 
detroit on thanksgiving day and they
could<00:02:42.620> be<00:02:42.799> two<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.519> A<00:02:43.700> two<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.090> ten<00:02:44.510> didn't

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
could be two and A two and ten didn't

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.780 
could be two and A two and ten didn't
matter<00:02:45.560> what<00:02:45.739> their<00:02:45.860> record<00:02:46.190> was<00:02:46.370> but<00:02:46.610> if<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
matter what their record was but if the

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.210 
matter what their record was but if the
Super<00:02:47.150> Bowl<00:02:47.180> was<00:02:47.450> held<00:02:47.660> on<00:02:47.780> Thanksgiving<00:02:48.530> they

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
Super Bowl was held on Thanksgiving they

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.470 
Super Bowl was held on Thanksgiving they
would<00:02:49.370> have<00:02:49.489> more<00:02:49.640> championships<00:02:50.269> in<00:02:50.420> the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
would have more championships in the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.449 
would have more championships in the
green<00:02:50.690> bay<00:02:50.810> packers<00:02:50.840> or<00:02:51.440> anybody<00:02:51.769> else<00:02:51.980> right

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
green bay packers or anybody else right

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.750 
green bay packers or anybody else right
so<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.030> think<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.360> tradition<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:55.069> factor<00:02:55.670> in

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
so I think that tradition is a factor in

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.839 
so I think that tradition is a factor in
this<00:02:55.880> game<00:02:56.019> they<00:02:57.019> are<00:02:57.049> playing<00:02:57.200> at<00:02:57.650> home<00:02:57.849> they

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
this game they are playing at home they

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.490 
this game they are playing at home they
have<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.000> chance<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.420> knock<00:02:59.599> off<00:02:59.840> arguably<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
have a chance to knock off arguably the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.619 
have a chance to knock off arguably the
best<00:03:00.650> team<00:03:00.950> in<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.220> NFL<00:03:01.610> as<00:03:01.910> Dave<00:03:02.599> mentioned

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
best team in the NFL as Dave mentioned

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.110 
best team in the NFL as Dave mentioned
and<00:03:03.349> we<00:03:03.980> have<00:03:04.160> mentioned<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.519> time<00:03:04.849> and<00:03:05.000> time

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
and we have mentioned this time and time

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.920 
and we have mentioned this time and time
again<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.480> secondary<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.470> suspect<00:03:06.769> since

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
again that secondary is suspect since

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.729 
again that secondary is suspect since
going<00:03:08.930> into<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.290> week<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:12.170> just<00:03:12.470> shapes

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
going into this week so it just shapes

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.830 
going into this week so it just shapes
up<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.160> this<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.519> play<00:03:14.299> that<00:03:14.329> I<00:03:14.540> think

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
up that this is a play that I think

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.949 
up that this is a play that I think
Detroit<00:03:15.260> not<00:03:15.709> only<00:03:15.920> covers<00:03:16.370> but<00:03:16.519> can<00:03:16.700> win<00:03:16.959> the

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
Detroit not only covers but can win the

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.539 
Detroit not only covers but can win the
money<00:03:18.139> line<00:03:18.380> is<00:03:18.500> going<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.709> be<00:03:18.799> attractive<00:03:19.370> you

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
money line is going to be attractive you

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.840 
money line is going to be attractive you
know<00:03:19.639> at<00:03:19.970> this<00:03:20.450> six<00:03:20.810> or<00:03:20.989> seven<00:03:21.290> point<00:03:21.530> level<00:03:21.850> I

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
know at this six or seven point level I

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.030 
know at this six or seven point level I
do<00:03:23.090> think<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.600> line<00:03:23.840> will<00:03:24.109> go<00:03:24.319> up<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.680> six<00:03:24.889> and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
do think the line will go up to six and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.309 
do think the line will go up to six and
a<00:03:25.069> half<00:03:25.130> seven<00:03:25.760> by<00:03:26.060> Thanksgiving<00:03:27.019> so<00:03:27.200> I<00:03:27.230> think

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
a half seven by Thanksgiving so I think

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.860 
a half seven by Thanksgiving so I think
if<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.650> want<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:27.889> play<00:03:28.040> Detroit<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.639> wait

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
if you want to play Detroit you wait

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.940 
if you want to play Detroit you wait
you're<00:03:29.870> probably<00:03:30.019> gonna<00:03:30.200> be<00:03:30.319> rewarding<00:03:30.799> and

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
you're probably gonna be rewarding and

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.759 
you're probably gonna be rewarding and
doing<00:03:31.220> so<00:03:31.900> lastly<00:03:32.900> there's<00:03:33.109> one<00:03:33.290> system

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
doing so lastly there's one system

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.979 
doing so lastly there's one system
already<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.280> hear<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:34.970> playing<00:03:35.840> on

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
have covered by seven or more points so

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.970 
have covered by seven or more points so
with<00:03:59.239> I<00:03:59.419> said<00:03:59.750> that<00:03:59.930> you're<00:04:00.169> playing<00:04:00.349> on<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.560> dog

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
with I said that you're playing on a dog

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.280 
with I said that you're playing on a dog
that<00:04:01.310> is<00:04:01.370> already<00:04:01.940> scoring<00:04:02.569> a<00:04:02.630> lot<00:04:02.660> of<00:04:02.900> points

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
that is already scoring a lot of points

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.159 
that is already scoring a lot of points
and<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:04.130> defense<00:04:04.609> that<00:04:04.819> obviously<00:04:05.209> is<00:04:05.480> helping

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
and a defense that obviously is helping

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.470 
and a defense that obviously is helping
the<00:04:06.290> totals<00:04:06.650> go<00:04:06.769> over<00:04:07.130> by<00:04:07.430> 28<00:04:07.849> points<00:04:08.299> so<00:04:08.450> it

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
the totals go over by 28 points so it

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.240 
the totals go over by 28 points so it
stands<00:04:08.810> to<00:04:08.900> reason<00:04:08.989> that<00:04:09.380> would<00:04:09.680> green<00:04:10.040> baize

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
stands to reason that would green baize

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.490 
stands to reason that would green baize
all<00:04:10.519> offense<00:04:10.900> Detroit's<00:04:11.900> all<00:04:12.109> offense<00:04:12.349> this

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
all offense Detroit's all offense this

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.900 
all offense Detroit's all offense this
could<00:04:12.709> be<00:04:12.799> a<00:04:12.829> game<00:04:13.069> that<00:04:13.220> placed<00:04:13.489> over<00:04:13.760> the

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
could be a game that placed over the

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.630 
could be a game that placed over the
total<00:04:14.180> as<00:04:14.419> well
