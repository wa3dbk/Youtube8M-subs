me just make it a little simpler if

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.510 
me just make it a little simpler if
you're<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> key<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.679> C<00:00:31.980> you're<00:00:32.189> basing

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you're in the key of C you're basing

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.190 
you're in the key of C you're basing
your<00:00:32.550> playing<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:33.030> words<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> scale<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.840> C

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
your playing of words on the scale of C

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.310 
your playing of words on the scale of C
so<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> one<00:00:35.130> chord<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.790> C<00:00:36.149> chord<00:00:36.320> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
so the one chord is the C chord the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.510 
so the one chord is the C chord the
sixth<00:00:37.680> chord<00:00:38.719> six<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.050> six<00:00:40.410> notes<00:00:40.680> higher<00:00:41.040> that

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
sixth chord six is six notes higher that

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.770 
sixth chord six is six notes higher that
would<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.030> any<00:00:42.930> kind<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.340> minor

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
would be a any kind of a I like a minor

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.869 
would be a any kind of a I like a minor
because<00:00:45.780> that's<00:00:45.960> indigenous<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.860> C<00:00:47.070> scale

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
because that's indigenous to the C scale

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.700 
because that's indigenous to the C scale
followed<00:00:50.879> by<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> two<00:00:51.270> chord<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.989> two<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
followed by the two chord one two that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.950 
followed by the two chord one two that
would<00:00:52.860> go<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.219> any<00:00:53.550> kind<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.879> D<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.329> playing<00:00:54.780> D

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
would go to any kind of D I playing D

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.110 
would go to any kind of D I playing D
minor<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.949> then<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> five<00:00:56.430> chord<00:00:58.850> we<00:00:59.850> used<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
minor and then the five chord we used to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.819 
minor and then the five chord we used to
usually<00:01:00.420> put<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> seventh<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.289> those<00:01:01.440> some<00:01:01.800> of

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
usually put a seventh in those some of

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.369 
usually put a seventh in those some of
those<00:01:01.949> chords<00:01:02.399> but<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.539> bare<00:01:03.750> bones<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.350> that

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
those chords but the bare bones of that

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.390 
those chords but the bare bones of that
progression<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:07.010> fun

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
progression is one fun

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:18.990 
progression is one fun
as<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.729> kid<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.090> may<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.450> played<00:01:09.630> it

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.720 

right<00:01:19.870> it<00:01:20.350> comes<00:01:20.560> in<00:01:20.710> all<00:01:20.830> kind<00:01:21.160> of<00:01:21.250> variations

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
right it comes in all kind of variations

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:48.139 
right it comes in all kind of variations
let<00:01:21.850> me<00:01:21.940> just<00:01:22.120> play<00:01:22.300> blue<00:01:23.230> moon

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.120 

okay<00:01:49.149> and<00:01:49.659> there's<00:01:49.929> many<00:01:50.229> many<00:01:50.439> many<00:01:50.710> songs

okay and there's many many many songs
that<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:52.420> use<00:01:53.020> that<00:01:53.229> progression<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:54.039> in<00:01:54.609> the

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
that that use that progression so in the

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:01.679 
that that use that progression so in the
key<00:01:54.939> of<00:01:54.969> C<00:01:55.270> it's<00:01:55.810> C<00:01:58.649> G<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.939> first<00:02:01.149> chords<00:02:01.450> major

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
key of C it's C G the first chords major

okay<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:07.270> let's<00:02:07.450> try<00:02:07.659> let's<00:02:08.110> transpose<00:02:08.799> that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
okay so let's try let's transpose that

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.190 
okay so let's try let's transpose that
into<00:02:09.250> some<00:02:09.429> other<00:02:09.549> key<00:02:09.759> let's<00:02:09.940> try<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.090> flat<00:02:10.539> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
into some other key let's try a flat the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.930 
into some other key let's try a flat the
scale<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.650> each<00:02:11.739> one<00:02:12.040> like<00:02:12.640> that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
scale of each one like that

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.630 
scale of each one like that
step<00:02:13.420> three<00:02:13.660> flats<00:02:13.959> alone<00:02:14.200> apart<00:02:14.769> is<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.220> flat

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
step three flats alone apart is a flat

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.729 
step three flats alone apart is a flat
the<00:02:16.480> sixth<00:02:16.840> chord<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.440> C<00:02:18.510> minor<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:20.170> two<00:02:20.410> chord

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
the sixth chord is C minor the two chord

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:28.520 
the sixth chord is C minor the two chord
is<00:02:21.010> f<00:02:21.250> minor<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.970> five<00:02:22.180> chord<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.599> B<00:02:22.780> flats

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.349 

in<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.769> key<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:29.980> G<00:02:30.310> or<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:30.730> key<00:02:30.879> of<00:02:30.939> F<00:02:31.090> let's

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
in the key of G or the key of F let's

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:47.459 
in the key of G or the key of F let's
say<00:02:31.540> it's<00:02:32.349> one<00:02:43.920> five<00:02:44.920> okay<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:47.019> that<00:02:47.170> applies

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:47.469 
say it's one five okay and that applies

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.110 
say it's one five okay and that applies
