00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
ended up going to juvie nia who then

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.810 
ended up going to juvie nia who then
crossed<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> back<00:00:55.289> into<00:00:55.530> marchisio<00:00:56.250> who<00:00:56.670> then

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
crossed it back into marchisio who then

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.490 
crossed it back into marchisio who then
made<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.149> 2-1<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.660> us<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.020> had<00:00:58.170> our<00:00:58.199> lead

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
made it 2-1 for us and we had our lead

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.110 
made it 2-1 for us and we had our lead
back<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.160> guy<00:00:59.340> seemed<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.730> give<00:00:59.969> up

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
back and then this guy seemed to give up

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.849 
back and then this guy seemed to give up
i<00:01:00.300> guess<00:01:00.359> he<00:01:01.020> wasn't<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:01.620> playing

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
i guess he wasn't really playing

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.619 
i guess he wasn't really playing
probably<00:01:02.250> he<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.609> rushing<00:01:03.030> his<00:01:03.120> goalkeeper

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
probably he was rushing his goalkeeper

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.359 
probably he was rushing his goalkeeper
out<00:01:03.719> all<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.870> time<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:04.769> not<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> time

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
out all the time here was not the time

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.440 
out all the time here was not the time
to<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.549> bringing<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.030> goalie<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.420> i

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
to be bringing out you goalie and i

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.030 
to be bringing out you goalie and i
managed<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.720> give<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.960> across<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.290> Chamakh<00:01:07.650> who

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
managed to give it across to Chamakh who

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.530 
managed to give it across to Chamakh who
have<00:01:08.159> his<00:01:08.280> left<00:01:08.490> foot<00:01:08.670> hit<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.060> into<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.360> back

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
have his left foot hit it into the back

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.510 
have his left foot hit it into the back
of<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> net<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.500> game<00:01:10.770> i<00:01:11.010> really<00:01:11.340> don't

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
of the net and this game i really don't

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.609 
of the net and this game i really don't
think<00:01:11.580> I've<00:01:11.850> had<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.180> many<00:01:12.330> chances<00:01:12.630> with<00:01:13.110> just

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
think I've had as many chances with just

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.740 
think I've had as many chances with just
general<00:01:14.010> shooting<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.180> done<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.509> any

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
general shooting then I have done in any

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.270 
general shooting then I have done in any
other<00:01:15.930> game<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.380> had<00:01:16.650> about<00:01:16.799> seven<00:01:17.220> or

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
other game I think had about seven or

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.160 
other game I think had about seven or
eight<00:01:17.430> shots<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.030> didn't<00:01:18.360> go<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.049> I'd

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
eight shots that didn't go in that I'd

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.899 
eight shots that didn't go in that I'd
worked<00:01:19.439> really<00:01:19.740> nicely<00:01:19.830> with<00:01:20.220> Chamakh<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:20.759> as

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
worked really nicely with Chamakh but as

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.580 
worked really nicely with Chamakh but as
always<00:01:21.030> he<00:01:21.330> had<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> get<00:01:21.780> his<00:01:21.840> regular<00:01:22.380> header

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
always he had to get his regular header

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310 
always he had to get his regular header
on<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.189> 90th<00:01:23.670> minute<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:24.119> I've<00:01:24.900> been<00:01:25.080> trying

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
on the 90th minute now I've been trying

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.719 
on the 90th minute now I've been trying
to<00:01:25.350> score<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.619> few<00:01:25.830> less<00:01:26.070> headers<00:01:26.400> with<00:01:26.549> sure

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
to score a few less headers with sure

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.429 
to score a few less headers with sure
Mac<00:01:26.880> I've<00:01:27.150> been<00:01:27.420> trying<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.810> more<00:01:28.020> direct

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
and stuff and it's so hard to do because

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.859 
and stuff and it's so hard to do because
of<00:01:31.320> how<00:01:31.500> slow<00:01:31.770> he<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.820> how<00:01:33.390> suited

Syria<00:01:44.340> up<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.729> top<00:01:44.970> nice<00:01:45.270> little<00:01:45.630> hybrid<00:01:46.049> you

don't often see hybrids in other teams
which<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.899> nice<00:01:49.049> usually<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.619> prem<00:01:49.860> teams<00:01:50.070> or

which is nice usually see prem teams or
brazil<00:01:50.549> team<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:50.909> i<00:01:50.939> guess<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.299> good<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> see

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
brazil team so i guess it's good to see

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.530 
brazil team so i guess it's good to see

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
something a little bit different but

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.460 
something a little bit different but

going<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.149> whip<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:57.750> Shmack<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.170> go

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
going to whip it in for Shmack to go

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.230 
going to whip it in for Shmack to go
ahead<00:01:58.500> or<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.799> double<00:01:59.009> x<00:01:59.219> cross<00:01:59.549> very<00:01:59.939> very

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
ahead or a double x cross very very

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.819 
ahead or a double x cross very very
overpowered<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.110> does<00:02:01.320> look<00:02:01.350> pretty<00:02:01.649> much

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
overpowered but it does look pretty much

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.950 
overpowered but it does look pretty much
always<00:02:02.070> guarantee<00:02:02.610> she<00:02:02.820> make<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.149> cross<00:02:03.420> but

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
always guarantee she make a cross but

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.480 
always guarantee she make a cross but
then<00:02:04.079> shortly<00:02:04.350> after<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.590> he<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:05.009> got<00:02:05.310> one

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
then shortly after that he then got one

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
then shortly after that he then got one
back<00:02:05.729> with<00:02:05.909> Cahill<00:02:06.149> from<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.630> corner<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.140> that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
back with Cahill from a corner and that

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.660 
back with Cahill from a corner and that
was<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.770> little<00:02:07.860> bit<00:02:08.009> frustrated<00:02:08.520> because

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
was a little bit frustrated because

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.219 
was a little bit frustrated because
again<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.090> seemed<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.330> bit<00:02:09.360> against<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.959> run<00:02:10.200> of

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
again it seemed a bit against the run of

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.750 
again it seemed a bit against the run of
play<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.530> schmock<00:02:10.979> managed<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> very

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
play but schmock managed to get a very

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.000 
play but schmock managed to get a very
nice<00:02:12.000> Finn

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
nice Finn

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.380

played him in and that made it 2 1 4
half<00:02:16.640> times<00:02:16.939> she<00:02:17.180> might<00:02:17.329> get<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.629> both<00:02:17.750> the

Shmack was from go and I'm guaranteed of
the<00:02:23.689> fact<00:02:23.900> he<00:02:24.019> would<00:02:24.140> have<00:02:24.230> scored<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.650> but<00:02:24.860> he

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
the fact he would have scored it but he

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.460 
the fact he would have scored it but he
did<00:02:25.579> also<00:02:26.209> get<00:02:26.540> another<00:02:26.780> girl<00:02:26.989> which<00:02:27.140> made<00:02:27.349> it

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
to 0 and I was a bit worried because I
