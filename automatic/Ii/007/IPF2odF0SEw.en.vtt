00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.710
 yes 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.160
 hello everyone i'm alberto cp and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.619
 welcome to minecraft today I bring you the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:26.939
 revision in this way is called jordi 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.480
 kripper if I do not have a means I am a 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.470
 clip the truth 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:37.650
 you have listened and I can explode if 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.110
 below I will leave the link so that 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.320
 you can download but before you start 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.080
 teach it is to say that I do not know if it is already 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.730
 already gone already but this beta investment or 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.730
 at least I was doing a while 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.809
 and also in powder on the porn page 500 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.020
 which puts it in the file or a rhythm and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:10.259
 four downloads that is if you have the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.630
 player commons installed is not worth that 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.869
 according to that as it puts you that it does not 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.790
 works or that they have failed with the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.979
 player commons so to tell you that and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.670
 that you have it to download down like this 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.509
 let's start to see how the mod is 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.620
 and we go to the first time I see that 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.650
 hyper sleeping 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:41.340
 good you see this here that what 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.400
 will arrange impressions next no 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.820
 later and things like hands 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.270
 they are supposed to be down then not 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.610
 I know is that I believe there is realism like that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.830
 have things down 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.050
 well we will explain in what 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:04.790
 function as function this mode if everything 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:07.220
 is good in this mode with said does 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.580
 that is a clip and what the 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.140
 clippers explode but they always give 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.110
 like this warning and then 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.620
 I am 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.110
 well this is not all there are many more 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.280
 things 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.280
 let's take this away 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:41.300
 good for profit you can explode with 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.920
 giving the efe key but if you go to 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.440
 controls out go on next to the Arab side 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.150
 this sound 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:55.450
 as if I started some fruits and giving it 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.160
 efe already exploits the cloud only affection for 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.160
 tell us how you are going to 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:09.290
 good as you are going to explode 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.270
 and this is how weird good at something other than 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.560
 It includes 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:18.860
 is to know if the meetings are comfortable 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.069
 box are supposed to be the bad ones for 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.560
 all zombie archers are going to 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:29.000
 follow is not supposed to help you and you 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.940
 continue to fight against new and 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.860
 new knowledge the meetings are styps 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.860
 yes the blue team 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.980
 as gentlemen to see if we meet 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:49.370
 if it is not short then 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.370
 and until they are not there then I go back 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.320
 there does not seem to be so good 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.290
 when it is found we come back and good 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.700
 after being a while searching today 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.460
 has disappeared here I have found 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.570
 many together many ways together here 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.570
 is here 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.580
 if they attack us, you are going to see with a cake 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.580
 Let's see 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.620
 but this one 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.990
 Y 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.110
 for me 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.650
 you see 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.620
 and it 's this same sound when you touch a 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.160
 piper 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.160
 and 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:48.160
 one thing if you die 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.090
 so you're wrong minor 'assistant ok 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.630

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.630
 do not 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:00.610
 It is not less resistant and good 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:03.930
 the others are these here 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.930
 those who were 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.740
 these are the cowboys 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.650
 good archers sometimes when you kill us 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.710
 a san marcos sometimes swords depends 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:23.479
 in they take away enough damage 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:27.919
 this is very careful and already 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.919
 I'm going to teach before so you can see 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:36.780

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:43.920
 steve there so you can see how they attack us 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:52.080
 to see you see here they attack us if you are clear 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.080
 explode 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:09.690

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.690

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:21.650
 and I do not know if they released the tour 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:27.940

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.940

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.810

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:42.790

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.160

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.430
 come on I think I was at least 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.430
 a while ago I was 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.290

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:59.750
 so I say goodbye before an end of 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.120

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.360
 that has a story on the page 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:19.240

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.220
 minecraft forum that is how it has 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.190

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:30.729

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.920

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:41.960
