00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
I guess this is exactly like burning I

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.130 
I guess this is exactly like burning I
started<00:03:26.250> as<00:03:26.340> those<00:03:26.490> foils<00:03:26.910> do<00:03:27.060> not<00:03:27.300> burn<00:03:27.660> this

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
started as those foils do not burn this
