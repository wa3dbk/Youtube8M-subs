guys<00:00:38.890> so<00:00:39.400> I<00:00:39.430> thought<00:00:39.670> a<00:00:39.820> brow<00:00:40.060> routine<00:00:40.450> would

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
guys so I thought a brow routine would

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.780 
guys so I thought a brow routine would
be<00:00:40.660> great<00:00:40.990> just<00:00:41.020> because<00:00:41.530> I<00:00:41.770> sometimes<00:00:42.520> in

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
be great just because I sometimes in

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.400 
be great just because I sometimes in
videos<00:00:43.060> skip<00:00:43.480> that<00:00:43.600> part<00:00:43.660> because<00:00:44.170> it's<00:00:44.350> a

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
videos skip that part because it's a

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.710 
videos skip that part because it's a
little<00:00:44.560> time<00:00:44.740> consuming<00:00:44.920> or<00:00:45.400> quickly<00:00:46.090> go<00:00:46.330> over

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
little time consuming or quickly go over

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.780

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
bit better because brows are so

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.020 
bit better because brows are so
important<00:01:44.650> they<00:01:44.740> give<00:01:45.010> dimension<00:01:45.190> and

lifts it so that's a little trick that

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.809 
lifts it so that's a little trick that
I<00:04:28.050> always<00:04:28.650> tell<00:04:28.919> my<00:04:29.009> clients<00:04:29.069> is<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.639> fill

brow underneath I'm just going to be
doing<00:04:41.280> little<00:04:41.639> strokes<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.389> fill<00:04:42.419> in<00:04:42.930> that

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.749 
area and make it look a little fuller
remembering<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.740> always<00:04:47.039> brush<00:04:47.310> through<00:04:47.580> the

remembering to always brush through the

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:48.980 
remembering to always brush through the
product<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.240> put<00:04:48.389> on<00:04:48.509> so<00:04:48.720> that<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:48.960> doesn't

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
product you put on so that it doesn't

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.629 
product you put on so that it doesn't
get<00:04:49.289> too<00:04:49.470> heavy<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:50.009> you're<00:04:50.099> keeping<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.520> as

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
get too heavy and you're keeping it as

matter your face shape your bone
structure<00:05:05.000> there's<00:05:05.360> three<00:05:05.720> points<00:05:05.990> so<00:05:06.740> the

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
structure there's three points so the

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.130
