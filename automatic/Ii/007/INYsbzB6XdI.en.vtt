which means that you will be a six shot

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.370 
which means that you will be a six shot
kill<00:03:09.519> with<00:03:10.030> its<00:03:10.239> minimum<00:03:10.690> damage<00:03:10.959> output

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
kill with its minimum damage output

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.140 
kill with its minimum damage output
which<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:11.769> definitely<00:03:12.340> not<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.610> best<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.120> the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
which is definitely not the best and the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.090 
which is definitely not the best and the
second<00:03:13.840> con<00:03:13.989> service<00:03:14.320> weapon<00:03:14.650> is<00:03:14.769> that<00:03:14.950> the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
second con service weapon is that the

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.130 
second con service weapon is that the
range<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.670> decreased<00:03:16.209> by<00:03:16.390> eighteen<00:03:16.930> percent

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
range is decreased by eighteen percent

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.320 
range is decreased by eighteen percent
at<00:03:17.530> long<00:03:17.830> range<00:03:18.100> so<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:18.519> weapon<00:03:18.880> by<00:03:19.030> all

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
at long range so this weapon by all

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.690 
at long range so this weapon by all
means<00:03:19.750> is<00:03:19.959> definitely<00:03:20.800> not<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.070> weapon<00:03:21.310> you

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
means is definitely not a weapon you

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.699 
means is definitely not a weapon you
want<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.060> use<00:03:22.330> at<00:03:22.570> long<00:03:22.870> range<00:03:23.140> but<00:03:23.380> in<00:03:23.530> saying

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
want to use at long range but in saying

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.590 
want to use at long range but in saying
that<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.100> is<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.459> submachine<00:03:25.090> gun<00:03:25.269> you<00:03:25.420> got<00:03:25.480> to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
that it is a submachine gun you got to

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.780 
that it is a submachine gun you got to
get<00:03:25.720> close<00:03:26.019> and<00:03:26.200> personal<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:27.130> that's<00:03:27.549> where

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
get close and personal and that's where

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.940 
get close and personal and that's where
the<00:03:27.880> fire<00:03:28.150> 8<00:03:28.390> does<00:03:28.690> come<00:03:28.989> in<00:03:29.200> moving<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.860> the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
the fire 8 does come in moving to the

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.800 
the fire 8 does come in moving to the
ASM<00:03:30.459> ones<00:03:30.670> try<00:03:30.940> to<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.180> pros<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.690> the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
ASM ones try to the pros to the

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.509 
ASM ones try to the pros to the
straighter<00:03:32.079> is<00:03:32.320> that<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.860> minimum<00:03:33.130> amount<00:03:33.250> of

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
straighter is that the minimum amount of

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.180 
straighter is that the minimum amount of
damage<00:03:33.940> is<00:03:34.350> 20<00:03:35.350> so<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.650> means<00:03:35.980> if<00:03:36.100> you're

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
damage is 20 so that means if you're

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.259 
damage is 20 so that means if you're
going<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.340> be<00:03:36.459> killing<00:03:36.790> someone<00:03:37.120> at<00:03:37.239> close

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
going to be killing someone at close

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.539 
going to be killing someone at close
range<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.410> minimum<00:03:38.769> amount<00:03:38.950> of<00:03:39.040> damage<00:03:39.370> is

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
range the minimum amount of damage is

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.370 
range the minimum amount of damage is
going<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.030> be<00:03:40.120> 20<00:03:40.450> which<00:03:40.690> means<00:03:40.930> it's<00:03:41.110> going<00:03:41.200> to

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
going to be 20 which means it's going to

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.530 
going to be 20 which means it's going to
be<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.500> four-shot<00:03:42.310> kill<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:42.820> that's<00:03:43.209> where<00:03:43.420> the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
be a four-shot kill and that's where the

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.050 
be a four-shot kill and that's where the
+1<00:03:43.989> damage<00:03:44.650> does<00:03:44.980> come<00:03:45.310> in<00:03:45.459> which<00:03:45.610> makes<00:03:45.850> it<00:03:45.940> a

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
+1 damage does come in which makes it a

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.120 
+1 damage does come in which makes it a
total<00:03:46.299> beast<00:03:46.660> like<00:03:46.870> close<00:03:47.140> range<00:03:47.470> not<00:03:47.980> only

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
total beast like close range not only

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.740 
total beast like close range not only
that<00:03:48.220> but<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.640> second<00:03:48.970> Pro<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.180> this<00:03:49.420> weapon

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
that but the second Pro to this weapon

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.449 
that but the second Pro to this weapon
is<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.170> range<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.650> increased<00:03:51.310> by

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
is that the range is increased by

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.090 
is that the range is increased by
fifteen<00:03:52.239> percent<00:03:52.900> which<00:03:53.500> means<00:03:53.829> if<00:03:54.010> you're

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
fifteen percent which means if you're

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.199 
fifteen percent which means if you're
going<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.280> be<00:03:54.340> shooting<00:03:54.489> someone<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:54.910> long

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
going to be shooting someone a long

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.940 
going to be shooting someone a long
range<00:03:55.420> or<00:03:55.660> medium<00:03:56.049> range<00:03:56.230> this<00:03:56.560> is<00:03:56.769> the

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
range or medium range this is the

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.430 
range or medium range this is the
submachine<00:03:57.400> gun<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.940> go<00:03:58.239> because<00:03:58.989> the<00:03:59.170> range

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
submachine gun to go because the range

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.650 
submachine gun to go because the range
is<00:03:59.650> increased<00:04:00.459> with<00:04:00.730> this<00:04:00.910> weapon<00:04:01.180> moving

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
is increased with this weapon moving

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.539 
is increased with this weapon moving
over<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.049> con<00:04:02.290> on<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:03.010> stride<00:04:03.280> of<00:04:03.310> the

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
over to the con on the stride of the

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.610 
over to the con on the stride of the
biggest<00:04:04.000> con<00:04:04.269> and<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.630> only<00:04:04.870> con<00:04:05.320> to<00:04:05.470> this

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
biggest con and the only con to this

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.380 
biggest con and the only con to this
weapon<00:04:05.920> which<00:04:06.070> I<00:04:06.190> absolutely<00:04:06.370> hate<00:04:07.180> is<00:04:07.360> the

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
weapon which I absolutely hate is the

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.110 
weapon which I absolutely hate is the
minus<00:04:08.350> three<00:04:08.680> accuracy<00:04:09.100> now<00:04:09.459> what<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.760> minus

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
minus three accuracy now what the minus

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.150 
minus three accuracy now what the minus
three<00:04:10.329> accuracy<00:04:10.570> does<00:04:10.959> to<00:04:11.110> this<00:04:11.230> weapon<00:04:11.590> is<00:04:11.680> it

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
three accuracy does to this weapon is it

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.460 
three accuracy does to this weapon is it
gives<00:04:12.340> a<00:04:12.570> 30-percent<00:04:13.570> of<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:13.989> kick<00:04:14.230> or

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
gives a 30-percent of you kick or

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.009 
gives a 30-percent of you kick or
basically<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.100> adds<00:04:15.250> 30<00:04:15.670> percent<00:04:16.239> more<00:04:16.510> recall

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
basically it adds 30 percent more recall

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.300 
basically it adds 30 percent more recall
to<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.320> web<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.590> if<00:04:17.680> you<00:04:17.739> ever<00:04:17.769> use<00:04:18.039> this

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
to the web and if you ever use this

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.310 
to the web and if you ever use this
weapon<00:04:18.489> this<00:04:19.180> thing<00:04:19.390> as<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.539> ton<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.840> recoil

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
weapon this thing as a ton of recoil

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.529 
weapon this thing as a ton of recoil
imagine<00:04:20.919> this<00:04:21.039> weapon<00:04:21.459> without<00:04:21.579> recoil<00:04:22.330> it

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
imagine this weapon without recoil it

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.450 
imagine this weapon without recoil it
would<00:04:22.990> be<00:04:23.110> such<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.470> base<00:04:23.860> so<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.100> is<00:04:24.340> the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
would be such a base so that is the

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.820 
would be such a base so that is the
biggest<00:04:24.669> con<00:04:25.000> with<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.300> Strider<00:04:25.600> is

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
biggest con with the Strider is

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.529 
biggest con with the Strider is
definitely<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:27.039> recoil<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.789> the<00:04:27.940> minus<00:04:28.210> 3

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
definitely the recoil and the minus 3

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:30.510 
definitely the recoil and the minus 3
accuracy<00:04:29.080> that<00:04:29.229> kicks<00:04:29.590> in<00:04:29.800> with<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.130> weapon

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
accuracy that kicks in with the weapon

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.640 
accuracy that kicks in with the weapon
but<00:04:30.729> going<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.570> end<00:04:31.840> of<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.200> video<00:04:32.349> when<00:04:32.620> I

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
but going to the end of the video when I

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.239 
but going to the end of the video when I
be<00:04:32.830> telling

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:33.249 
be telling

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:35.219 
be telling
is<00:04:33.549> my<00:04:33.759> verdict<00:04:34.119> for<00:04:34.299> both<00:04:34.509> weapons<00:04:34.809> and<00:04:35.139> what

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
is my verdict for both weapons and what

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.899 
is my verdict for both weapons and what
I<00:04:35.259> will<00:04:35.499> say<00:04:35.529> is<00:04:35.919> that<00:04:36.009> it<00:04:36.369> comes<00:04:36.579> down<00:04:36.729> to

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909 
I will say is that it comes down to

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.579 
I will say is that it comes down to
personal<00:04:37.119> preference<00:04:37.629> if<00:04:37.959> you've<00:04:38.079> used<00:04:38.259> both

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:38.589 
personal preference if you've used both

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:39.929 
personal preference if you've used both
weapons<00:04:38.859> and<00:04:39.249> you<00:04:39.369> like<00:04:39.519> the<00:04:39.669> straighter

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:39.939 
weapons and you like the straighter

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:41.669 
weapons and you like the straighter
better<00:04:40.239> than<00:04:40.449> the<00:04:40.569> straighter<00:04:40.869> is<00:04:41.109> better<00:04:41.409> for

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:41.679 
better than the straighter is better for

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:43.859 
better than the straighter is better for
you<00:04:41.769> my<00:04:41.979> honest<00:04:42.339> opinion<00:04:42.789> I<00:04:42.939> like<00:04:43.689> the

00:04:43.859 --> 00:04:43.869 
you my honest opinion I like the

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:46.109 
you my honest opinion I like the
speakeasy<00:04:44.469> better<00:04:44.739> just<00:04:45.189> because<00:04:45.399> the<00:04:45.699> recoil

00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:46.119 
speakeasy better just because the recoil

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:49.019 
speakeasy better just because the recoil
isn't<00:04:46.569> as<00:04:46.749> high<00:04:47.079> and<00:04:47.379> even<00:04:48.159> though<00:04:48.339> it<00:04:48.579> takes<00:04:48.789> a

00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:49.029 
isn't as high and even though it takes a

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:50.939 
isn't as high and even though it takes a
little<00:04:49.299> bit<00:04:49.569> more<00:04:49.779> bullets<00:04:50.199> to<00:04:50.349> kill<00:04:50.379> someone

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
little bit more bullets to kill someone

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.559 
little bit more bullets to kill someone
at<00:04:51.069> close<00:04:51.099> range<00:04:51.609> the<00:04:51.849> rate<00:04:52.089> of<00:04:52.119> fire<00:04:52.539> is

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
at close range the rate of fire is

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.139 
at close range the rate of fire is
increased<00:04:53.349> which<00:04:53.829> means<00:04:54.159> there's<00:04:54.369> nothing<00:04:54.939> to

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:55.149 
increased which means there's nothing to

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:56.879 
increased which means there's nothing to
worry<00:04:55.449> about<00:04:55.569> the<00:04:55.929> damage<00:04:56.289> because<00:04:56.589> the<00:04:56.709> rate

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
worry about the damage because the rate

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.129 
worry about the damage because the rate
of<00:04:56.919> fire<00:04:57.219> is<00:04:57.249> so<00:04:57.759> fast<00:04:58.179> that<00:04:58.449> they're<00:04:58.899> dead

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
of fire is so fast that they're dead

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.989 
of fire is so fast that they're dead
within<00:04:59.349> a<00:04:59.529> second<00:04:59.949> as<00:05:00.009> you<00:05:00.129> guys<00:05:00.309> can<00:05:00.519> see<00:05:00.579> in

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:00.999 
within a second as you guys can see in

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.119 
within a second as you guys can see in
the<00:05:01.209> gameplay<00:05:01.719> and<00:05:01.959> if<00:05:02.439> you're<00:05:02.589> a<00:05:02.679> person<00:05:03.039> who

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129 
the gameplay and if you're a person who

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:05.039 
the gameplay and if you're a person who
likes<00:05:03.309> to<00:05:03.429> straight<00:05:03.729> up<00:05:03.759> by<00:05:03.999> all<00:05:04.239> means<00:05:04.509> use<00:05:04.869> it

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:05.049 
likes to straight up by all means use it

00:05:05.049 --> 00:05:07.139 
likes to straight up by all means use it
but<00:05:05.199> personally<00:05:05.679> I<00:05:05.739> cannot<00:05:06.339> stand<00:05:06.699> how<00:05:06.969> much

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:07.149 
but personally I cannot stand how much

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:09.149 
but personally I cannot stand how much
recoil<00:05:07.599> there<00:05:07.779> is<00:05:07.899> I<00:05:07.929> had<00:05:08.319> full<00:05:08.709> grip<00:05:08.889> and<00:05:09.069> all

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:09.159 
recoil there is I had full grip and all

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.429 
recoil there is I had full grip and all
that<00:05:09.309> stuff<00:05:09.429> it<00:05:09.759> does<00:05:10.239> nothing<00:05:10.509> for<00:05:10.899> me<00:05:10.929> it<00:05:11.229> is

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:11.439 
that stuff it does nothing for me it is

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:13.199 
that stuff it does nothing for me it is
super<00:05:12.069> good<00:05:12.279> at<00:05:12.429> close<00:05:12.669> range<00:05:12.969> that's

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:13.209 
super good at close range that's

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:14.909 
super good at close range that's
something<00:05:13.599> I'll<00:05:13.749> say<00:05:13.929> but<00:05:14.169> it<00:05:14.319> is<00:05:14.439> too<00:05:14.679> much

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
something I'll say but it is too much

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.279 
something I'll say but it is too much
