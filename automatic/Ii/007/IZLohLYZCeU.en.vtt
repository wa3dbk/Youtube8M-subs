00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.879
 in Samara in Samara on your screens are the most 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.340
 dangerous moments 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.720
 moments of today's meeting fragments from 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.369
 for the age of the first half when 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:10.749
 Spartak played 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:12.389
 pretty slow 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.849
 so and this is probably yes he was one of 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:15.799
 the main 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.740
 The main problems are few in Moscow 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.240
 teams in the first half that's why 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.329
 failed 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.419
 This included how to score although the moments were but 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.769
 a goal was scored one ball but it was canceled 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.039
 here we are with you 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.029
 for long shots that are obtained 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.960
 different ii degrees and unsuccessful style 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.460
 probably so 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.550
 it looks like a step can be said with him 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.750
 Sabitova such a blow was yes and Roma Kiev 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.470
 Robert is parallel to the gate from a distance 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.640
 it probably needs and briefly summarize 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640
 shura of today's game 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.440
 what we can but what we can say whole 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.450
 In conclusion, probably still Spartak 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.500
 he fulfilled the task to a certain extent 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.300
 won and that's how it probably is 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 but not so much 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.760
 as a rule, the team plays as it is 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.720
 wins 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.820
 especially 2 5 billion euros below 1 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.860
 I think that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.760
 mileage will be a new Polish expert 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.770
 in new parsing and 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.000
 outlines 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.610
 still not formed 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.610
 can you say what they say 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.280
 for example here such has a lot of problems 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.950
 which few are added to 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.950
 the owner 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.910
 and we will not forget we will not forget and 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.410
 what about 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.340
 also if he got injured in the game 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.119
 with the growth of the majority of subscribers, see from 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.690
 whom to choose itar tass 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.690
 how many young ones the farther away the more 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.620
 in various combinations yes with one 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.960
 hand it is of course good fresh blood 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.520
 it's always great but on the other hand 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.820
 need type of experience well well 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.390
 it was that 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.550
 good match with
