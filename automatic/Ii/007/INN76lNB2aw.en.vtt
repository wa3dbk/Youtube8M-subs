00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
was like I'm gonna shoot that a bright

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.429 
was like I'm gonna shoot that a bright
shining<00:01:37.799> star<00:01:37.890> over<00:01:38.340> there<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.900> I<00:01:39.900> shot<00:01:40.259> over

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
shining star over there and I shot over

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.280 
shining star over there and I shot over
there<00:01:40.560> got<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> nice<00:01:41.340> kill<00:01:41.670> um<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.990> don't<00:01:43.170> really

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
there got a nice kill um I don't really

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.200 
there got a nice kill um I don't really
like<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.710> Galil<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.159> much<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.670> lot<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.119> people

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
like the Galil that much a lot of people

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.600 
like the Galil that much a lot of people
use<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> lot<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.869> people<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:47.130> it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
use a lot of people like it but it it

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.310 
use a lot of people like it but it it
has<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.360> highest<00:01:48.509> damage<00:01:48.780> for<00:01:49.079> an<00:01:49.140> assault

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
has the highest damage for an assault

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.289 
has the highest damage for an assault
rifle<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.100> still<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.399> three<00:01:50.880> bullet<00:01:51.149> kill

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
rifle but it's still a three bullet kill

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.609 
rifle but it's still a three bullet kill
close<00:01:51.479> range<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:52.110> Bullock<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.439> long

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
close range and a for Bullock a long

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.870 
close range and a for Bullock a long
range<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.070> doesn't<00:01:53.250> really<00:01:53.340> affect<00:01:53.460> much

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
range so it doesn't really affect much

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.810 
range so it doesn't really affect much
unless<00:01:54.149> there's<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.540> bold<00:01:54.780> penetration<00:01:55.380> or

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
unless there's like bold penetration or

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.130 
unless there's like bold penetration or
like<00:01:56.820> someone's<00:01:57.420> assisting<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:57.990> that

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
like someone's assisting you in that

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170 
like someone's assisting you in that
kill<00:01:58.380> otherwise<00:01:59.070> other<00:01:59.310> than<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.490> then<00:01:59.790> the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
kill otherwise other than that then the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.429 
kill otherwise other than that then the
high<00:02:00.420> damage<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:00.990> isn't<00:02:01.140> gonna<00:02:01.229> make<00:02:01.380> a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
high damage really isn't gonna make a

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.440 
high damage really isn't gonna make a
difference<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.009> its<00:02:02.549> recoil<00:02:02.969> seems<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.360> little

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
difference and its recoil seems a little

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.859 
difference and its recoil seems a little
too<00:02:03.600> bouncy<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.549> what<00:02:05.549> else<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:06.630> fire

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
too bouncy and what else it's fire

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.930 
too bouncy and what else it's fire
rights<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.110> little<00:02:07.259> too<00:02:07.350> slow<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.009> I'd<00:02:08.610> prefer

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
rights a little too slow so I'd prefer

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.940 
rights a little too slow so I'd prefer
the<00:02:09.209> famas<00:02:09.810> which<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.590> burst<00:02:10.739> fire

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
the famas which you can burst fire

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.400 
the famas which you can burst fire
really<00:02:11.459> amazing

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
really amazing

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.290 
really amazing
well<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:13.100> has<00:02:13.250> such<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.580> high<00:02:13.820> fire<00:02:14.060> rate

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
well and it has such a high fire rate

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.360 
well and it has such a high fire rate
that<00:02:14.660> it's<00:02:15.260> basically<00:02:15.620> some<00:02:15.950> whooshing<00:02:16.190> in<00:02:16.310> a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
that it's basically some whooshing in a

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.460 
that it's basically some whooshing in a
close-range<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.780> can<00:02:17.930> burst<00:02:18.110> fire<00:02:18.320> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
close-range and you can burst fire the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.350 
close-range and you can burst fire the
thing<00:02:18.590> at<00:02:18.710> a<00:02:18.740> long<00:02:18.890> range<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.310> make<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.580> pretty

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
thing at a long range to make it pretty

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.690 
thing at a long range to make it pretty
good<00:02:20.420> too<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.020> I'd<00:02:21.710> rather<00:02:21.890> use<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.220> famas<00:02:22.520> in

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
good too so I'd rather use the famas in

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.200 
good too so I'd rather use the famas in
the<00:02:22.760> Galil<00:02:23.260> nine<00:02:24.260> times<00:02:24.590> out<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:24.800> ten<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:26.060> ten

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
the Galil nine times out of ten that ten

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.420 
the Galil nine times out of ten that ten
time<00:02:26.390> I'll<00:02:26.540> attend<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:27.020> when<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.380> don't<00:02:28.310> have

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
time I'll attend is when I don't have

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.910 
time I'll attend is when I don't have
any<00:02:28.580> ammo<00:02:28.820> my<00:02:29.000> famas<00:02:29.660> or<00:02:30.110> not<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.560> tent<00:02:30.800> I

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
any ammo my famas or not that tent I

any ammo my famas or not that tent I
medicine<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:32.150> one<00:02:32.360> time<00:02:32.510> out<00:02:32.570> of<00:02:32.810> 10<00:02:32.990> is<00:02:33.800> what

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
medicine that one time out of 10 is what

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.380 
medicine that one time out of 10 is what
I<00:02:34.010> have<00:02:34.160> no<00:02:34.280> ammo<00:02:34.460> left<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.000> need<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.240> pick<00:02:35.360> a

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
I have no ammo left and I need to pick a

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.690 
I have no ammo left and I need to pick a
playgirl<00:02:35.870> allele<00:02:36.140> which<00:02:36.830> is<00:02:37.100> basically<00:02:37.520> kind

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
playgirl allele which is basically kind

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.370 
playgirl allele which is basically kind
of<00:02:37.820> what<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:37.940> did<00:02:38.030> here's<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.080> part<00:02:39.260> of<00:02:39.320> the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
of what I did here's the part of the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.330 
of what I did here's the part of the
game<00:02:39.470> where<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.680> gonna<00:02:39.770> see<00:02:40.010> me<00:02:40.130> shooting

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
game where you gonna see me shooting

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.700 
game where you gonna see me shooting
tiny<00:02:40.880> red<00:02:41.120> diamonds<00:02:41.330> with<00:02:41.810> my<00:02:41.960> big<00:02:42.560> old

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
tiny red diamonds with my big old

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.800 
tiny red diamonds with my big old
chopper<00:02:42.980> gunner<00:02:43.330> this<00:02:44.330> parts<00:02:44.570> not<00:02:44.630> too

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
chopper gunner this parts not too

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.890 
chopper gunner this parts not too
exciting<00:02:45.230> but<00:02:45.260> i'm<00:02:45.740> using<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.900> blackbird

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
exciting but i'm using a blackbird

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.440 
exciting but i'm using a blackbird
attack<00:02:48.470> dogs<00:02:48.710> chopper<00:02:49.100> gunner<00:02:49.280> or<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.120> guess

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
attack dogs chopper gunner or I guess

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.660 
attack dogs chopper gunner or I guess
chopper<00:02:50.810> gunner<00:02:51.170> attack<00:02:51.440> dogs<00:02:51.680> because<00:02:52.040> why

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
chopper gunner attack dogs because why

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.540 
chopper gunner attack dogs because why
would<00:02:52.820> I<00:02:52.850> not<00:02:53.150> go<00:02:53.360> in<00:02:53.450> sequential<00:02:53.810> order<00:02:53.990> um

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
would I not go in sequential order um

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.380 
would I not go in sequential order um
but<00:02:55.550> basically<00:02:55.780> this<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.970> attack<00:02:59.210> dogs

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
but basically this is the attack dogs

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.520 
but basically this is the attack dogs
are<00:02:59.570> supposed<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.840> get<00:03:00.140> them<00:03:00.230> out<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.350> their

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
are supposed to get them out of their

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.350 
are supposed to get them out of their
camping<00:03:01.280> buildings<00:03:01.640> but<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:02.060> probably<00:03:02.210> won't

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
camping buildings but it probably won't

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.940 
camping buildings but it probably won't
since<00:03:02.720> they're<00:03:02.870> probably<00:03:03.050> sitting<00:03:03.770> in

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
since they're probably sitting in

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.200 
since they're probably sitting in
buildings<00:03:04.280> or<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.490> back<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.790> walls<00:03:04.940> waiting

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
buildings or the back to walls waiting

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.820 
buildings or the back to walls waiting
for<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.450> attack<00:03:05.690> dogs<00:03:05.900> but<00:03:06.230> that's<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.650> plan

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
for the attack dogs but that's the plan

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.320 
for the attack dogs but that's the plan
anyway<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.340> then<00:03:07.460> once<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.730> attack<00:03:07.940> dog<00:03:08.120> gets

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
anyway and then once the attack dog gets

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.140 
anyway and then once the attack dog gets
them<00:03:08.450> out<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.630> that<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:09.100> camp<00:03:10.100> building<00:03:10.460> then<00:03:10.730> my

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
them out of that a camp building then my

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.870 
them out of that a camp building then my
child<00:03:11.510> we're<00:03:11.600> gonna<00:03:11.690> spawn<00:03:12.520> destroys<00:03:13.520> and

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
child we're gonna spawn destroys and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.850 
child we're gonna spawn destroys and
which<00:03:14.270> it<00:03:14.660> kind<00:03:14.870> of<00:03:14.900> works<00:03:15.080> this<00:03:15.230> game<00:03:15.410> but<00:03:15.650> i

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
which it kind of works this game but i

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.770 
which it kind of works this game but i
feel<00:03:16.640> like<00:03:16.820> i'm<00:03:16.940> just<00:03:17.150> taking<00:03:17.390> kills<00:03:17.570> for<00:03:17.690> my

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
feel like i'm just taking kills for my

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.270 
feel like i'm just taking kills for my
attack<00:03:18.020> dogs<00:03:18.260> right<00:03:18.440> now<00:03:18.590> it's<00:03:18.980> kind<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.190> like

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
attack dogs right now it's kind of like

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.650 
attack dogs right now it's kind of like
calling<00:03:19.520> a<00:03:19.580> harrier<00:03:19.850> pavelow<00:03:19.940> at<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.510> same

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
calling a harrier pavelow at the same

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.910 
calling a harrier pavelow at the same
time<00:03:20.840> but<00:03:21.140> we're<00:03:21.290> not<00:03:21.320> gonna<00:03:21.530> make<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.680> mana

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
time but we're not gonna make a mana

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.370 
time but we're not gonna make a mana
warfare<00:03:22.280> two<00:03:22.400> analogy<00:03:23.030> because<00:03:23.690> that's<00:03:24.110> kind

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
warfare two analogy because that's kind

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.850 
warfare two analogy because that's kind
of<00:03:24.500> stupid<00:03:25.570> so<00:03:26.570> many<00:03:26.780> kills<00:03:27.050> people<00:03:27.470> refuse<00:03:27.830> to

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
of stupid so many kills people refuse to

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.770 
of stupid so many kills people refuse to
like<00:03:28.280> they<00:03:28.730> spawn<00:03:29.030> inside<00:03:29.420> buildings

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
like they spawn inside buildings

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.060 
like they spawn inside buildings
sometimes<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.320> like<00:03:30.440> I'm<00:03:30.590> gonna<00:03:30.680> walk<00:03:30.890> out<00:03:31.040> of

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
sometimes the like I'm gonna walk out of

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.140 
sometimes the like I'm gonna walk out of
this<00:03:31.190> building<00:03:31.370> cuz<00:03:31.640> it's<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:31.820> nice<00:03:31.970> day

luckily<00:03:38.440> luckily<00:03:39.440> for<00:03:39.709> me<00:03:39.830> there<00:03:40.040> on<00:03:40.340> the

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
luckily luckily for me there on the

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.890 
luckily luckily for me there on the
other<00:03:40.670> team<00:03:41.080> um<00:03:42.489> so<00:03:43.489> anyway<00:03:43.550> I<00:03:44.120> switched<00:03:44.720> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
other team um so anyway I switched the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.170 
other team um so anyway I switched the
aks-74u<00:03:45.500> at<00:03:45.950> close<00:03:46.160> range<00:03:46.459> is<00:03:46.670> because<00:03:46.910> I

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
aks-74u at close range is because I

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.970 
aks-74u at close range is because I
don't<00:03:47.720> know<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:48.110> famas<00:03:48.380> is<00:03:48.560> probably

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
don't know I the famas is probably

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.850 
don't know I the famas is probably
actually<00:03:49.130> better<00:03:49.459> had<00:03:49.880> a<00:03:50.350> close<00:03:51.350> range<00:03:51.620> in<00:03:51.770> the

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
actually better had a close range in the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.740 
actually better had a close range in the
70<00:03:52.160> for<00:03:52.310> you<00:03:52.489> that<00:03:53.150> guy<00:03:53.270> was<00:03:53.420> trying<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.600> walk

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
70 for you that guy was trying to walk

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.260 
70 for you that guy was trying to walk
through<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.020> wall<00:03:54.170> he<00:03:54.440> thought<00:03:54.620> he<00:03:54.709> was<00:03:54.739> a

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
through the wall he thought he was a

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.510 
through the wall he thought he was a
Patrick<00:03:56.270> Swayze<00:03:56.510> from<00:03:56.690> ghosts<00:03:56.989> he<00:03:57.560> was<00:03:57.709> trying

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
Patrick Swayze from ghosts he was trying

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.890 
Patrick Swayze from ghosts he was trying
to<00:03:58.550> use<00:03:58.670> his<00:03:58.760> force<00:03:59.090> powers<00:03:59.420> on<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.600> wall<00:03:59.750> not

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
to use his force powers on the wall not

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.320 
to use his force powers on the wall not
force<00:04:00.230> ghost<00:04:00.830> powers<00:04:01.040> I<00:04:01.250> guess<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:02.270> isn't

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
force ghost powers I guess this isn't

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.790 
force ghost powers I guess this isn't
Star<00:04:02.780> Wars<00:04:03.050> this<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.470> Patrick<00:04:04.220> Swayze<00:04:04.610> um<00:04:05.800> so

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
Star Wars this is Patrick Swayze um so

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.199 
Star Wars this is Patrick Swayze um so
