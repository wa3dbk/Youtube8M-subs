00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
kills in this game you have to do

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.490 
kills in this game you have to do
whichever<00:00:21.510> gun<00:00:21.779> you're<00:00:22.080> most<00:00:22.289> comfortable

whichever gun you're most comfortable
with<00:00:22.830> but<00:00:23.550> we<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.939> definitely<00:00:24.119> go<00:00:24.420> with

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
with but we can definitely go with

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.970 
with but we can definitely go with
secondaries<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.380> would<00:00:25.500> definitely<00:00:25.830> say

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
secondaries and I would definitely say

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.950 
secondaries and I would definitely say
the<00:00:26.189> best<00:00:26.430> secondary<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> run<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.570> terms<00:00:27.750> of

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
the best secondary to run in terms of

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.630 
the best secondary to run in terms of
getting<00:00:28.170> high<00:00:28.410> kill<00:00:28.710> Street<00:00:28.980> games<00:00:29.220> is

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
getting high kill Street games is

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.580 
getting high kill Street games is
actually<00:00:30.119> using<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.449> launcher<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.320> reason

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
actually using a launcher and the reason

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
actually using a launcher and the reason
for<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.160> getting<00:00:32.759> high<00:00:32.880> kill<00:00:33.180> streaks<00:00:33.420> in

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
for that is getting high kill streaks in

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.420 
for that is getting high kill streaks in
my<00:00:33.570> warfare<00:00:33.989> 3<00:00:34.200> they<00:00:34.559> use<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> point<00:00:35.160> streak

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
my warfare 3 they use a point streak

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.459 
my warfare 3 they use a point streak
system<00:00:35.910> shooting<00:00:36.540> down<00:00:36.690> air<00:00:36.870> support<00:00:37.290> can

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
system shooting down air support can

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.260 
system shooting down air support can
actually<00:00:37.860> get<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.190> points<00:00:38.610> towards<00:00:39.210> your

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
actually get you points towards your

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.970 
actually get you points towards your
kill<00:00:39.570> streak<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.290> if<00:00:40.379> you're<00:00:40.500> trying<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> get

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
kill streak so if you're trying to get

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920 
kill streak so if you're trying to get
your<00:00:41.190> kill<00:00:41.430> streak<00:00:41.700> rewards<00:00:42.030> shoot<00:00:42.570> down<00:00:42.750> air

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
your kill streak rewards shoot down air

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.810 
your kill streak rewards shoot down air
support<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.559> an<00:00:43.680> easy<00:00:43.920> way<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.579> does

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
support it's an easy way with that does

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.670 
support it's an easy way with that does
it<00:00:44.969> put<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.480> danger<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:46.320> your<00:00:46.469> kill

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
it put you in danger to get your kill

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.130 
it put you in danger to get your kill
streaks<00:00:46.980> even<00:00:47.430> faster<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.450> guys<00:00:48.570> also<00:00:48.989> need

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
streaks even faster you guys also need

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.510 
streaks even faster you guys also need
to<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.350> playing<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> objective<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:50.309> I'm<00:00:50.399> not

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
to be playing the objective now I'm not

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.670 
to be playing the objective now I'm not
saying<00:00:50.760> run<00:00:51.059> into<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> B<00:00:52.199> flag<00:00:52.469> like

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
saying run into you know the B flag like

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560 
saying run into you know the B flag like
a<00:00:52.739> madman<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.190> want<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> play<00:00:53.640> smart<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.510> you

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
a madman you want to play smart but you

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.090 
a madman you want to play smart but you
do<00:00:54.719> want<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.899> play<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.260> objective<00:00:55.350> because

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
do want to play the objective because

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.069 
do want to play the objective because
unlike<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.610> other<00:00:56.699> Call<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.030> Duty's<00:00:57.390> they<00:00:57.899> use

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
unlike in other Call of Duty's they use

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.750 
unlike in other Call of Duty's they use
a<00:00:58.109> point<00:00:58.500> streak<00:00:58.710> system<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.370> said<00:00:59.609> before

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
a point streak system like I said before

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.670 
a point streak system like I said before
so<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> more<00:01:00.420> points<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.989> regardless<00:01:01.530> of

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
so the more points you get regardless of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.380 
so the more points you get regardless of
whether<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> down<00:01:02.219> air<00:01:02.399> support<00:01:02.789> playing<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
whether to down air support playing the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.759 
whether to down air support playing the
objective<00:01:03.480> getting<00:01:04.080> kills<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.470> whatever

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
objective getting kills or whatever

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.649 
objective getting kills or whatever
that's<00:01:05.250> gonna<00:01:05.489> build<00:01:05.729> your<00:01:05.850> kill<00:01:06.060> streak<00:01:06.299> so

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
that's gonna build your kill streak so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.090 
that's gonna build your kill streak so
if<00:01:06.720> you're<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> good<00:01:07.140> objective<00:01:07.320> player<00:01:07.860> not

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
of game types I would definitely suggest

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.850 
of game types I would definitely suggest
playing<00:01:17.939> either<00:01:18.150> headquarters<00:01:18.869> domination

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
playing either headquarters domination

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.859 
playing either headquarters domination
or<00:01:20.040> demolition<00:01:20.400> all<00:01:21.210> pretty<00:01:21.479> much<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
or demolition all pretty much for the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
or demolition all pretty much for the
fact<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.229> they're<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.619> long<00:01:22.890> games<00:01:23.220> they're

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
fact that they're all long games they're

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.249
