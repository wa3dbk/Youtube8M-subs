game<00:05:05.330> we<00:05:05.780> can't<00:05:06.050> afford<00:05:06.200> all<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:07.070> games<00:05:07.340> in

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
game we can't afford all the games in

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.310 
game we can't afford all the games in
comparison<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.419> nearest<00:05:08.780> media<00:05:09.139> is<00:05:09.289> a

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
comparison the nearest media is a

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.710 
comparison the nearest media is a
blu-ray<00:05:09.919> and<00:05:10.190> games<00:05:10.580> are<00:05:10.789> double<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.240> cost<00:05:11.479> of

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
blu-ray and games are double the cost of

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.659 
blu-ray and games are double the cost of
this<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:12.050> so<00:05:12.380> realistically<00:05:13.070> we're<00:05:13.580> only

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
this and so realistically we're only

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.190 
this and so realistically we're only
gonna<00:05:13.820> buy<00:05:14.000> one<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.240> month<00:05:14.479> and<00:05:14.720> even<00:05:14.900> then

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
gonna buy one a month and even then

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.420 
gonna buy one a month and even then
we're<00:05:15.320> gonna<00:05:15.440> end<00:05:15.500> up<00:05:15.620> with<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.860> pile<00:05:16.070> of<00:05:16.190> shame

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
we're gonna end up with a pile of shame

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.890 
we're gonna end up with a pile of shame
of<00:05:16.820> all<00:05:16.940> those<00:05:17.150> games<00:05:17.360> we<00:05:17.539> haven't<00:05:17.720> enough

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
of all those games we haven't enough

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.810 
of all those games we haven't enough
time<00:05:18.139> to<00:05:18.320> play<00:05:18.560> so<00:05:19.220> the<00:05:19.460> gaming<00:05:19.729> industry

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
time to play so the gaming industry

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.400 
time to play so the gaming industry
