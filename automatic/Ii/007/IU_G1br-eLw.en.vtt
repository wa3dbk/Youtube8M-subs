show you the new 2011 prime disparate

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.780 
show you the new 2011 prime disparate
done<00:00:15.469> this<00:00:15.620> year<00:00:15.889> is<00:00:15.920> a<00:00:16.010> completely<00:00:16.550> new

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
done this year is a completely new

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.700 
done this year is a completely new
system<00:00:17.060> from<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:17.570> ground<00:00:17.600> up<00:00:18.050> so<00:00:18.260> a<00:00:18.500> new

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
system from the ground up so a new

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.089 
system from the ground up so a new
master<00:00:19.130> cylinder<00:00:19.580> is<00:00:19.790> new<00:00:20.390> caliber<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.890> main

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
master cylinder is new caliber the main

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:23.530 
master cylinder is new caliber the main
thing<00:00:22.310> with<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:22.550> prime<00:00:22.790> is<00:00:23.000> we<00:00:23.119> wanted<00:00:23.390> to<00:00:23.450> go

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
thing with the prime is we wanted to go

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.540 
thing with the prime is we wanted to go
after<00:00:23.930> a<00:00:23.990> few<00:00:24.260> key<00:00:24.439> things<00:00:24.470> that<00:00:25.010> being<00:00:25.189> power

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
after a few key things that being power

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.810 
after a few key things that being power
and<00:00:26.450> adjustability<00:00:27.130> so<00:00:28.130> up<00:00:28.279> at<00:00:28.430> the<00:00:28.520> master

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
and adjustability so up at the master

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.510 
and adjustability so up at the master
cylinder<00:00:29.119> you'll<00:00:29.449> see<00:00:29.630> two<00:00:29.930> anodized<00:00:30.740> levers

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
cylinder you'll see two anodized levers

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.350 
cylinder you'll see two anodized levers
here<00:00:31.699> the<00:00:31.850> first<00:00:32.119> one<00:00:32.360> is<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.199> 180<00:00:33.710> degree<00:00:34.010> dial

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
here the first one is a 180 degree dial

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.880 
here the first one is a 180 degree dial
and<00:00:35.360> change<00:00:35.720> is<00:00:35.870> stroke<00:00:36.170> adjust<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:36.650> allows

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
and change is stroke adjust it allows

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.280 
and change is stroke adjust it allows
the<00:00:37.100> rider<00:00:37.280> with<00:00:38.180> a<00:00:38.239> flick<00:00:38.570> of<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.720> finger<00:00:38.780> to

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
the rider with a flick of the finger to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.310 
the rider with a flick of the finger to
either<00:00:39.710> increase<00:00:40.570> or<00:00:41.570> decrease<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.230> amount

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
either increase or decrease the amount

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.049 
either increase or decrease the amount
of<00:00:42.530> stroke<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.070> they<00:00:43.190> have<00:00:43.340> in<00:00:43.519> their<00:00:43.640> system

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
of stroke that they have in their system

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.460 
of stroke that they have in their system
so<00:00:44.089> if<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:44.479> like<00:00:44.629> a<00:00:44.659> really<00:00:44.989> short<00:00:45.229> throw

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
so if you like a really short throw

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.829 
so if you like a really short throw
lever<00:00:45.739> you<00:00:45.949> set<00:00:46.190> it<00:00:46.309> on<00:00:46.400> man<00:00:46.640> if<00:00:47.479> you<00:00:47.629> like<00:00:47.809> a

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
lever you set it on man if you like a

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.479 
lever you set it on man if you like a
lot<00:00:48.080> of<00:00:48.229> stroke<00:00:48.500> before<00:00:48.739> you<00:00:48.979> get<00:00:49.100> into<00:00:49.250> your

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
lot of stroke before you get into your

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.420 
lot of stroke before you get into your
deep<00:00:49.970> braking<00:00:50.420> you<00:00:50.809> set<00:00:51.019> it<00:00:51.140> at<00:00:51.260> max<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:52.370> other

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
deep braking you set it at max the other

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.610 
deep braking you set it at max the other
feature<00:00:52.790> is<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.479> lever<00:00:53.720> home<00:00:53.989> position<00:00:54.500> or

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
feature is the lever home position or

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.520 
feature is the lever home position or
the<00:00:54.739> reach<00:00:54.920> adjust<00:00:55.570> we're<00:00:56.570> big<00:00:56.720> on<00:00:56.870> tool<00:00:57.260> free

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
the reach adjust we're big on tool free

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.469 
the reach adjust we're big on tool free
reach<00:00:57.739> just<00:00:58.040> we<00:00:58.280> think<00:00:58.460> it's<00:00:58.580> a<00:00:58.760> great<00:00:59.239> feature

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
reach just we think it's a great feature

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:01.060 
reach just we think it's a great feature
people<00:00:59.809> really<00:01:00.199> dig<00:01:00.739> it

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
people really dig it

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.700 
people really dig it
this<00:01:01.640> one<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:01.970> bigger<00:01:02.239> he<00:01:02.690> has<00:01:02.869> better<00:01:03.199> detent

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
this one is bigger he has better detent

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.100 
this one is bigger he has better detent
so<00:01:04.610> you've<00:01:04.729> got<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:04.879> really<00:01:05.150> positive<00:01:05.510> click

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
so you've got a really positive click

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.390 
so you've got a really positive click
here<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.890> set<00:01:07.100> your<00:01:07.190> lever<00:01:07.430> home<00:01:07.670> position

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
here to set your lever home position

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.260 
here to set your lever home position
position<00:01:09.120> to<00:01:09.210> reach

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
position to reach

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.330 
position to reach
down<00:01:10.840> at<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:10.990> caliper<00:01:11.500> end<00:01:11.680> we've<00:01:11.890> increased

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
down at the caliper end we've increased

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.580 
down at the caliper end we've increased
the<00:01:12.429> piston<00:01:12.939> diameter<00:01:13.479> which<00:01:14.170> basically

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
the piston diameter which basically

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.109 
the piston diameter which basically
gives<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.070> rider<00:01:15.219> more<00:01:15.549> power<00:01:15.820> we've

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
gives the rider more power we've

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.819 
gives the rider more power we've
increased<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.689> hydraulic<00:01:17.229> ratio<00:01:17.619> of<00:01:17.740> this

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
increased the hydraulic ratio of this

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.130 
increased the hydraulic ratio of this
brake<00:01:18.100> system<00:01:18.490> over<00:01:18.700> previous<00:01:19.149> systems<00:01:19.570> and

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
brake system over previous systems and

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.649 
brake system over previous systems and
what<00:01:20.289> that<00:01:20.469> means<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.950> for<00:01:21.729> a<00:01:21.789> given<00:01:22.030> input

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
what that means is for a given input

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.600 
what that means is for a given input
here<00:01:23.140> how<00:01:23.679> hard<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.039> squeeze<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.429> lever

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
here how hard you squeeze the lever

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.950 
here how hard you squeeze the lever
you're<00:01:24.880> going<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.060> get<00:01:25.210> more<00:01:25.359> clamping<00:01:25.840> force

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
you're going to get more clamping force

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.959 
you're going to get more clamping force
down<00:01:26.380> here<00:01:26.619> at<00:01:26.679> the<00:01:26.770> caliper<00:01:27.219> so<00:01:27.729> you<00:01:27.819> don't

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
down here at the caliper so you don't

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.399 
down here at the caliper so you don't
have<00:01:28.119> to<00:01:28.240> squeeze<00:01:28.420> as<00:01:28.659> hard<00:01:28.689> to<00:01:28.929> get<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.200> same

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
have to squeeze as hard to get the same

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.949 
have to squeeze as hard to get the same
amount<00:01:29.709> of<00:01:29.770> D<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:30.130> some<00:01:31.090> other<00:01:31.270> nice<00:01:31.509> things<00:01:31.810> is

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
amount of D so some other nice things is

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:36.080 
amount of D so some other nice things is
we<00:01:32.079> have<00:01:32.200> a<00:01:32.229> top-loading<00:01:32.770> pad<00:01:33.069> now<00:01:33.780> uses<00:01:34.780> a

prime<00:01:55.149> system<00:01:55.590> basically<00:01:56.590> what<00:01:56.830> you<00:01:56.920> get<00:01:57.070> here

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
prime system basically what you get here

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.580 
prime system basically what you get here
is<00:01:57.460> an<00:01:57.580> aluminum<00:01:58.090> center<00:01:58.600> section<00:01:59.020> or<00:01:59.140> carrier

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
is an aluminum center section or carrier

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.190 
is an aluminum center section or carrier
and<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.580> steel<00:02:00.909> stainless<00:02:01.450> steel<00:02:01.509> rubber<00:02:01.990> ring

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
and a steel stainless steel rubber ring

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.749 
and a steel stainless steel rubber ring
so<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.530> need<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.799> stainless<00:02:03.189> steel<00:02:03.399> out<00:02:03.580> here

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
so you need the stainless steel out here

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.609 
so you need the stainless steel out here
to<00:02:03.850> take<00:02:04.030> all<00:02:04.179> the<00:02:04.360> heat<00:02:04.539> and<00:02:04.780> dissipate<00:02:05.409> heat

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
to take all the heat and dissipate heat

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.800 
to take all the heat and dissipate heat
but<00:02:06.369> you're<00:02:06.490> able<00:02:06.700> to<00:02:06.759> take<00:02:07.000> weight<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.600> add

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
but you're able to take weight and add

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.540 
but you're able to take weight and add
stiffness<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.590> rotor<00:02:08.860> by<00:02:09.130> adding<00:02:09.429> all

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
stiffness to the rotor by adding all

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.820 
stiffness to the rotor by adding all
this<00:02:09.700> structure<00:02:10.030> in<00:02:10.300> here<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:10.750> by<00:02:11.410> making<00:02:11.590> it

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
this structure in here and by making it

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.160 
this structure in here and by making it
out<00:02:11.980> of<00:02:12.010> aluminum<00:02:12.549> you<00:02:12.790> reduce<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.660> weight<00:02:13.840> of

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
out of aluminum you reduce the weight of

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.870 
out of aluminum you reduce the weight of
the<00:02:14.410> steel<00:02:14.739> that's<00:02:14.920> usually<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.549> center

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
the steel that's usually in the center

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.820 
the steel that's usually in the center
section<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.750> can<00:02:16.840> also<00:02:16.959> anodized<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.739> to

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
section you can also anodized it to

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.090 
section you can also anodized it to
match<00:02:17.950> all<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.310> other<00:02:18.459> aluminum<00:02:18.910> bits
