really in the pocket in this one it's
just<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.530> grooving<00:00:44.280> they<00:00:44.879> were<00:00:44.940> really

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
just really grooving they were really

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.959 
just really grooving they were really
connected<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.960> each<00:00:46.109> other<00:00:46.319> so<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.190> my<00:00:47.370> solo

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
discuss a little more of these ideas

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.530 
discuss a little more of these ideas
okay<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.739> OneNote<00:03:17.129> idea<00:03:17.519> i<00:03:17.609> really<00:03:18.120> love<00:03:18.329> that

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
okay the OneNote idea i really love that

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.990 
okay the OneNote idea i really love that
concept<00:03:18.780> because<00:03:19.349> it<00:03:19.469> allows<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:20.099> to<00:03:20.370> forget

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
concept because it allows you to forget

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.300 
concept because it allows you to forget
about<00:03:21.060> all<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.780> theory<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.500> all<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.069> notes

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
about all the theory and all the notes

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.490 
about all the theory and all the notes
and<00:03:23.609> know<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.450> one<00:03:24.689> notes<00:03:24.959> going<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.290> work

and know that one notes going to work
and<00:03:25.709> it's<00:03:26.310> great<00:03:26.700> in<00:03:26.909> a<00:03:27.209> situation<00:03:27.480> when

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
rhythmic patterns with some expression

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.509 
rhythmic patterns with some expression
and<00:03:37.560> you'll<00:03:38.040> see<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:39.419> also<00:03:39.750> hear<00:03:40.439> a<00:03:40.590> great

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
excitement starts to happen because

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.990 
excitement starts to happen because
we're<00:03:46.409> locked<00:03:46.739> into<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.250> groove<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.819> that's

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
we're locked into the groove and that's

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
groove while thinking about a little

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.979 
groove while thinking about a little
theory<00:03:55.439> but<00:03:56.099> still<00:03:57.060> thinking<00:03:57.540> about<00:03:57.659> the

you start to notice the drummer in the

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.289 
you start to notice the drummer in the
bass<00:04:19.440> players<00:04:19.769> start<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.160> get<00:04:20.310> freer<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.910> that

bass players start to get freer and that
fills<00:04:21.630> nothing<00:04:22.109> wrong<00:04:22.289> with<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:22.770> some

fills nothing wrong with it and some

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.860 
fills nothing wrong with it and some
just<00:04:23.250> play<00:04:23.580> anything<00:04:23.850> kind<00:04:24.330> of<00:04:24.419> shredding

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
just play anything kind of shredding

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.930 
just play anything kind of shredding
stuff<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:27.650> know<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.860> sounds<00:04:29.009> crazy<00:04:29.370> but<00:04:29.610> when

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
stuff I know it sounds crazy but when

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.640 
stuff I know it sounds crazy but when
you're<00:04:30.060> in<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.330> moment<00:04:30.600> in<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.199> heat<00:04:31.410> it

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
you're in the moment in the heat it

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.740 
you're in the moment in the heat it
brings<00:04:31.919> a<00:04:32.070> lot<00:04:32.280> of<00:04:32.340> excitement<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.360> rise

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
brings a lot of excitement and a rise

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.170 
brings a lot of excitement and a rise
and<00:04:34.139> dynamics<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.889> music<00:04:35.070> then<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:36.000> could

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
and dynamics to the music then you could

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:55.879 
and dynamics to the music then you could
go<00:04:36.300> back<00:04:36.479> down<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:36.780> I<00:04:37.169> saw<00:04:54.289> Stanny<00:04:55.289> while<00:04:55.740> the

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
go back down and I saw Stanny while the

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:57.830 
go back down and I saw Stanny while the
groove<00:04:56.100> opens<00:04:56.490> up<00:04:56.669> again<00:04:56.820> let's<00:04:57.449> put<00:04:57.720> the

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
groove opens up again let's put the

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.000 
groove opens up again let's put the
track<00:04:58.110> on<00:04:58.320> again<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.740> we're<00:04:58.860> going<00:04:58.979> to

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
track on again and we're going to

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.700 
track on again and we're going to
discuss<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.699> major<00:05:00.180> six<00:05:00.810> than<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.080> minor<00:05:01.350> chord

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
discuss the major six than a minor chord

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.260 
discuss the major six than a minor chord
because<00:05:01.949> the<00:05:02.130> rhythm<00:05:02.430> players<00:05:02.669> were<00:05:02.910> doing

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
because the rhythm players were doing

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.180 
because the rhythm players were doing
that<00:05:03.449> major<00:05:04.020> sixth<00:05:04.590> which<00:05:04.770> is<00:05:04.889> kind<00:05:05.130> of

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
that major sixth which is kind of

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.279 
that major sixth which is kind of
reminiscent<00:05:05.639> of<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:05.880> Dorian<00:05:06.449> but<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:07.139> don't

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
reminiscent of the Dorian but I don't

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.629 
reminiscent of the Dorian but I don't
want<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:07.500> think<00:05:07.650> about<00:05:07.800> that<00:05:08.190> right<00:05:08.250> now<00:05:08.520> I

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
want to think about that right now I

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.219 
want to think about that right now I
just<00:05:08.760> wanted<00:05:09.120> to<00:05:09.180> concentrate<00:05:09.599> on<00:05:09.870> what<00:05:10.110> the

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
just wanted to concentrate on what the

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.749 
just wanted to concentrate on what the
tone<00:05:10.500> is<00:05:10.710> like<00:05:10.949> in<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:12.020> as<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.490> relates<00:05:14.490> to<00:05:14.610> the

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
tone is like in the as it relates to the

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.430 
tone is like in the as it relates to the
chord<00:05:15.030> progression<00:05:15.509> so<00:05:15.780> here's<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.169> major
