00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
have bought more it was for 94 yard I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.950 
have bought more it was for 94 yard I
believe<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.400> about<00:01:29.610> half<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.060> yard<00:01:30.240> which

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
believe and so about half a yard which

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.490 
believe and so about half a yard which
was<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.650> quite<00:01:31.890> 250<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:34.140> go<00:01:34.320> with

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
was like not quite 250 and to go with

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.859 
was like not quite 250 and to go with
that<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.100> decided<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.119> needed<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.659> some

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
that I decided that I needed to get some

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.870 
that I decided that I needed to get some
coordinating<00:01:37.409> solids<00:01:37.890> because<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.189> don't<00:01:38.579> have

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
coordinating solids because I don't have

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.719 
coordinating solids because I don't have
a<00:01:38.939> whole<00:01:39.240> lot<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> solids<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> thought<00:01:41.250> this

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
a whole lot of solids so I thought this

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.219 
a whole lot of solids so I thought this
would<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.119> perfect<00:01:42.540> time<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.869> pick<00:01:42.990> them<00:01:43.140> out

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
would be a perfect time to pick them out

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.530 
would be a perfect time to pick them out
since<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.820> said<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.119> my<00:01:45.270> favorite

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
colors so I'll be buying solids that are

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.719

available in my Etsy store but what I

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.890 
available in my Etsy store but what I
was<00:03:20.269> doing<00:03:20.660> was<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:21.110> was<00:03:22.360> putting<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.540> solid

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
was doing was I was putting a solid

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.870 
was doing was I was putting a solid
fabric<00:03:24.440> along<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:24.950> bottom<00:03:25.160> of<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.459> bag<00:03:25.640> and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
fabric along the bottom of the bag and

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.020 
fabric along the bottom of the bag and
then<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.810> coordinating<00:03:27.560> print<00:03:27.920> on<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.670> upper

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
then a coordinating print on the upper

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.550 
then a coordinating print on the upper
portion<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.570> bag<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.080> just<00:03:30.260> thought<00:03:30.380> it

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
portion of the bag and I just thought it

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.860 
portion of the bag and I just thought it
gave<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.160> really<00:03:31.550> cool<00:03:31.940> like<00:03:32.120> color-blocked

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
gave a really cool like color-blocked

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.590 
gave a really cool like color-blocked
look<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:34.250> just<00:03:34.459> looked<00:03:34.700> really<00:03:34.760> nice<00:03:35.150> and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
look and it just looked really nice and

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.370 
look and it just looked really nice and
just<00:03:36.500> extra<00:03:36.980> special<00:03:37.400> instead<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.269> a<00:03:38.600> just<00:03:39.260> a

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
just extra special instead of a just a

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.560 
just extra special instead of a just a
solid<00:03:39.800> fabric<00:03:40.280> for<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.519> whole<00:03:40.640> thing<00:03:40.820> so<00:03:41.450> I'll

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
solid fabric for the whole thing so I'll

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.910 
solid fabric for the whole thing so I'll
probably<00:03:41.660> make<00:03:41.900> a<00:03:41.959> few<00:03:42.049> more<00:03:42.320> like<00:03:42.500> that<00:03:42.680> out

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
probably make a few more like that out

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.590 
probably make a few more like that out
of<00:03:43.070> that<00:03:43.250> fabric<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:43.940> then<00:03:44.090> I'm<00:03:44.269> not<00:03:44.450> sure

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
of that fabric and then I'm not sure

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.539 
of that fabric and then I'm not sure
what<00:03:44.720> I'll<00:03:44.810> do<00:03:44.930> with<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:45.140> rest<00:03:45.320> but<00:03:45.620> whatever

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
what I'll do with the rest but whatever

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.690 
what I'll do with the rest but whatever
I<00:03:46.640> do<00:03:46.730> it'll<00:03:46.970> be<00:03:47.030> adorable<00:03:47.180> so<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:48.709> then<00:03:48.950> my

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
I do it'll be adorable so and then my

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.080 
I do it'll be adorable so and then my
biggest<00:03:50.090> thing<00:03:50.330> I<00:03:50.450> got<00:03:50.680> was<00:03:51.680> two<00:03:52.459> yards<00:03:52.940> of

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
biggest thing I got was two yards of

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
fabric moved and so they had all of

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.410 
fabric moved and so they had all of
their<00:04:31.770> patterns<00:04:32.220> were<00:04:32.520> four<00:04:33.000> for<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.330> dollar

their patterns were four for a dollar

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.740 
their patterns were four for a dollar
and<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.500> could<00:04:34.650> buy<00:04:34.800> up<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.190> twenty<00:04:35.700> so<00:04:36.390> of

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
and you could buy up to twenty so of

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.410 
and you could buy up to twenty so of
course<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.230> bought<00:04:37.380> twenty<00:04:37.740> and<00:04:38.220> this<00:04:38.940> is<00:04:39.180> one

course I bought twenty and this is one
of<00:04:39.450> them<00:04:40.070> but<00:04:41.070> they<00:04:41.820> had<00:04:42.180> like<00:04:42.360> limited<00:04:43.020> sizes

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
of them but they had like limited sizes

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.470 
of them but they had like limited sizes
on<00:04:43.800> them<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.220> I'm<00:04:44.730> like<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:44.970> size<00:04:46.160> like<00:04:47.160> 14<00:04:48.030> in

patterns<00:04:49.140> because<00:04:50.010> pattern<00:04:50.400> sizes<00:04:50.880> are

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
patterns because pattern sizes are

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.310 
patterns because pattern sizes are
different<00:04:51.810> than<00:04:52.490> actual<00:04:53.490> sizes<00:04:53.700> so<00:04:54.450> I<00:04:54.930> had<00:04:55.260> to

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320
