00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
out a groove in each side so that the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.590 
out a groove in each side so that the
tang<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.979> metal<00:01:29.310> would<00:01:29.460> fit<00:01:29.759> inside<00:01:30.000> of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
tang of the metal would fit inside of

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.840 
tang of the metal would fit inside of
the<00:01:30.750> wood<00:01:30.930> pieces<00:01:31.310> then<00:01:32.310> i<00:01:32.340> clamp<00:01:32.670> them

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the wood pieces then i clamp them

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.780 
the wood pieces then i clamp them
together<00:01:33.180> glued<00:01:33.540> them<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.079> then<00:01:34.670> carved<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
together glued them and then carved it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.520 
together glued them and then carved it
out<00:01:35.909> with<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> dremel<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> would

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
out with the dremel so that it would

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.249 
out with the dremel so that it would
have<00:01:37.680> these<00:01:37.920> nice<00:01:38.420> finger<00:01:39.420> notches<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.110> my

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
have these nice finger notches for my

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.980 
have these nice finger notches for my
hand<00:01:40.790> also<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.939> has<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.240> little<00:01:42.299> guard<00:01:42.780> right

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
hand also it has this little guard right

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.139 
hand also it has this little guard right
here<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.500> your<00:01:43.649> hand<00:01:43.979> has<00:01:44.220> trouble<00:01:44.790> trying<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
here so your hand has trouble trying to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.060 
here so your hand has trouble trying to
slip<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:45.960> wouldn't<00:01:46.079> cut<00:01:46.560> yourself<00:01:46.950> on

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
slip up so you wouldn't cut yourself on

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.980 
slip up so you wouldn't cut yourself on
the<00:01:47.189> blade<00:01:47.369> as<00:01:47.549> easily<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.570> best<00:01:48.720> woodworking

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the blade as easily the best woodworking

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.039 
the blade as easily the best woodworking
I've<00:01:49.409> ever<00:01:49.530> done<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.670> also<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> best<00:01:51.420> blade

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
I've ever done it is also the best blade

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.990 
I've ever done it is also the best blade
that<00:01:52.259> I've<00:01:52.380> ever<00:01:52.590> made<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.860> together<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
that I've ever made in together it's the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.899 
that I've ever made in together it's the
best<00:01:54.240> knife<00:01:54.479> I've<00:01:54.720> ever<00:01:54.930> made<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.880> now<00:01:56.880> I

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
best knife I've ever made and now I

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.030 
best knife I've ever made and now I
think<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.420> time<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.290> show<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.680> test

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
think it's time to show a little test

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.340 
think it's time to show a little test
we'll<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.670> how<00:02:00.000> well<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.600> cut<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.140> piece

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
we'll see how well I can cut this piece

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.100 
we'll see how well I can cut this piece
of<00:02:01.590> paper<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:01.890> my<00:02:02.040> knife

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
of paper with my knife

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.810 
of paper with my knife
I'm<00:02:04.110> pretty<00:02:04.350> sure<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.740> razor<00:02:05.100> sharp<00:02:05.250> so

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
I'm pretty sure this is razor sharp so

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.789 
I'm pretty sure this is razor sharp so
that<00:02:05.969> should<00:02:06.210> be<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.689> really<00:02:07.229> good<00:02:07.380> cut<00:02:07.619> right

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
that should be a really good cut right

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.690 
that should be a really good cut right
there<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.509> perfect<00:02:10.170> cut<00:02:10.380> there's<00:02:11.280> no

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
there and it's a perfect cut there's no
