and Vietnam has a great build up into

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.250 
and Vietnam has a great build up into
these<00:02:14.940> crunchy<00:02:15.540> sins<00:02:15.870> that

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
these crunchy sins that

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.330 
these crunchy sins that
to<00:02:16.349> sound<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.650> they<00:02:16.799> could<00:02:16.830> be<00:02:16.950> sound

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
to sound like they could be sound

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.490 
to sound like they could be sound
tracking<00:02:17.909> mad<00:02:18.150> max<00:02:18.540> or<00:02:18.870> something<00:02:19.290> like<00:02:19.439> that

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
tracking mad max or something like that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.710 
tracking mad max or something like that
but<00:02:20.129> I<00:02:20.159> didn't<00:02:20.459> like<00:02:20.579> every<00:02:20.849> track<00:02:21.150> which<00:02:21.480> was

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
but I didn't like every track which was

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.330 
but I didn't like every track which was
kind<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.079> disappointment<00:02:22.260> for<00:02:22.890> me<00:02:22.980> because

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
kind of a disappointment for me because

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.210 
kind of a disappointment for me because
that<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.549> how<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.030> felt<00:02:24.450> about<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.349> first<00:02:25.680> album

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
that is how I felt about the first album

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.770 
that is how I felt about the first album
for<00:02:26.430> me<00:02:26.579> the<00:02:26.730> opening<00:02:27.060> track<00:02:27.329> doesn't<00:02:27.569> bring

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
for me the opening track doesn't bring

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.569 
for me the opening track doesn't bring
anything<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.500> table<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.129> if<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.430> guys

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
persistent electronic glitch that every

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.539 
persistent electronic glitch that every

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
single time it plays it feels like I'm

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.750 
single time it plays it feels like I'm
getting<00:02:41.670> needles<00:02:42.180> shoved<00:02:43.140> into<00:02:43.500> my<00:02:44.040> eardrums

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760

getting needles shoved into my eardrums
over<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.750> over<00:02:46.319> but<00:02:47.040> still<00:02:47.189> I<00:02:47.340> have<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.640> give

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
over and over but still I have to give

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.490 
over and over but still I have to give
it<00:02:47.909> to<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.090> LP<00:02:48.510> for<00:02:48.780> creating<00:02:49.349> an

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
it to this LP for creating an

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.130 
it to this LP for creating an
interesting<00:02:50.269> electronic<00:02:51.269> atmosphere<00:02:51.930> and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
interesting electronic atmosphere and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.890 
interesting electronic atmosphere and
putting<00:02:52.890> together<00:02:53.069> at<00:02:53.459> least<00:02:53.609> 10<00:02:54.030> decent

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
putting together at least 10 decent

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.680 
putting together at least 10 decent
songs<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.530> my<00:02:55.769> eyes<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.250> my<00:02:56.310> eyes<00:02:56.790> however<00:02:57.480> the

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
songs in my eyes in my eyes however the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.680 
songs in my eyes in my eyes however the
new<00:02:57.840> songs<00:02:58.230> on<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.889> album<00:02:59.099> that<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.909> like<00:03:00.329> I

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
new songs on this album that I like I

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.410 
new songs on this album that I like I
feel<00:03:01.409> myself<00:03:01.620> kind<00:03:02.159> of<00:03:02.370> gravitating<00:03:03.150> toward

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
feel myself kind of gravitating toward

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.680 
feel myself kind of gravitating toward
them<00:03:03.599> because<00:03:03.900> they<00:03:04.079> sound<00:03:04.379> eerily<00:03:05.250> close<00:03:05.760> to

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
them because they sound eerily close to

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.440 
them because they sound eerily close to
songs<00:03:06.959> on<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.859> first<00:03:08.159> album<00:03:08.730> not<00:03:08.909> to<00:03:09.090> get<00:03:09.239> too

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
songs on the first album not to get too

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.509 
songs on the first album not to get too
deep<00:03:09.690> into<00:03:09.900> track<00:03:10.260> names<00:03:10.590> but<00:03:10.889> some<00:03:11.129> moments

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
deep into track names but some moments

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.490 
deep into track names but some moments
and<00:03:11.670> baptisms<00:03:12.420> sound<00:03:12.659> an<00:03:12.810> awful<00:03:12.930> lot<00:03:13.170> like<00:03:13.319> the

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
and baptisms sound an awful lot like the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.910 
and baptisms sound an awful lot like the
track<00:03:13.889> vanished<00:03:14.879> from<00:03:15.389> the<00:03:15.569> first<00:03:15.810> LP<00:03:16.379> and<00:03:16.590> the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
track vanished from the first LP and the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.039 
track vanished from the first LP and the
vocal<00:03:17.340> sampling<00:03:17.819> on<00:03:17.970> Europe<00:03:18.329> silence<00:03:18.780> sounds

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
vocal sampling on Europe silence sounds

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.319 
vocal sampling on Europe silence sounds
a<00:03:19.109> lot<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.680> vocal<00:03:20.220> sampling<00:03:20.730> on<00:03:20.879> Crystal

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
a lot like the vocal sampling on Crystal

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.629 
a lot like the vocal sampling on Crystal
Castles<00:03:21.510> health<00:03:22.049> remix<00:03:22.680> crime<00:03:23.069> wave<00:03:23.340> but

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
Castles health remix crime wave but

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.009 
Castles health remix crime wave but
there<00:03:23.790> are<00:03:23.910> still<00:03:24.150> moments<00:03:24.329> where<00:03:24.629> Crystal

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
there are still moments where Crystal

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.170 
there are still moments where Crystal
Castles<00:03:25.199> takes<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.980> opportunity<00:03:26.819> with<00:03:27.030> this

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
Castles takes the opportunity with this

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.140 
Castles takes the opportunity with this
album<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:28.019> experiment<00:03:28.859> outside<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.669> their

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150
