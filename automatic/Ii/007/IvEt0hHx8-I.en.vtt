00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.660 
comparison I wonder to also briefly talk
about<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.299> clinic<00:00:15.870> even<00:00:16.139> better<00:00:16.590> dark<00:00:17.460> spot

about the clinic even better dark spot
corrector<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:19.220> used<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:20.820> Clinique<00:00:21.300> product

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
corrector I used this Clinique product

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.660 
corrector I used this Clinique product
which<00:00:22.410> was<00:00:22.650> not<00:00:22.980> cheap<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:23.960> a<00:00:25.039> year<00:00:26.039> or<00:00:26.279> just

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
which was not cheap for a year or just

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.470 
which was not cheap for a year or just
over<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> year<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.019> saw<00:00:28.410> almost<00:00:29.480> no

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
over a year and I saw almost no

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.799 
over a year and I saw almost no
reduction<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.460> my<00:00:32.460> dark<00:00:32.669> spots<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.540> most

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
of my dark spots on this side of my face

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.549 
of my dark spots on this side of my face
very<00:00:37.710> little<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.340> side<00:00:38.719> I<00:00:39.719> use<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.320> for

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
very little on this side I use this for

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.139 
very little on this side I use this for
like<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.770> said<00:00:40.829> about<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.190> year<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.730> saw<00:00:41.910> my

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
like I said about a year I saw my

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.119 
like I said about a year I saw my
addiction<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> only<00:00:43.020> thing<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.320> did<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
addiction the only thing it did the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.490 
addiction the only thing it did the
worst<00:00:44.340> spot<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.059> right<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:46.140> sort

worst spot that was right here it sort

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.380 
worst spot that was right here it sort
of<00:00:46.590> exploded<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.700> now<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.149> bigger

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
of exploded it so that now it's bigger

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.510 
of exploded it so that now it's bigger
in<00:00:48.600> blotchy<00:00:48.870> air<00:00:49.110> in<00:00:49.469> contrast<00:00:50.129> where<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> used

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
in blotchy air in contrast where I used

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150 
in blotchy air in contrast where I used
this<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.730> over<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.180> year<00:00:51.600> I've<00:00:52.199> only<00:00:52.469> used<00:00:52.620> this

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
this for over a year I've only used this

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.959 
this for over a year I've only used this
for<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> couple<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.120> weeks<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:55.370> I<00:00:56.370> started<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
for a couple of weeks and I started to

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.830 
for a couple of weeks and I started to
see<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.590> difference<00:00:58.590> within<00:00:59.280> I<00:01:00.000> would<00:01:00.270> say<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
see a difference within I would say the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.690 
see a difference within I would say the
first<00:01:01.079> week<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:02.270> on<00:01:03.270> my<00:01:03.539> hand<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.339> have<00:01:05.339> two

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
first week I have on my hand I have two

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.460 
first week I have on my hand I have two
spots<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.540> right<00:01:06.720> next<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.110> each<00:01:07.290> other

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
spots that are right next to each other

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.109 
spots that are right next to each other
and<00:01:08.030> they<00:01:09.030> were<00:01:09.710> approximately<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:11.760> same

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
and they were approximately the same

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.870 
and they were approximately the same
darkness<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.680> same<00:01:13.950> size<00:01:14.960> this<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
darkness and the same size this one and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.810 
darkness and the same size this one and
this<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.950> I<00:01:19.950> don't<00:01:20.009> know<00:01:20.369> how<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.640> going

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
this one and I don't know how it's going

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.350 
this one and I don't know how it's going
to<00:01:20.909> appear<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.360> camera<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.409> one<00:01:22.740> is

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
to appear on camera but this one is

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.149 
to appear on camera but this one is
substantially<00:01:24.360> later<00:01:24.630> than<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.619> one<00:01:25.890> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
substantially later than this one and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.760 
substantially later than this one and
that's<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:26.990> that's<00:01:27.990> where<00:01:28.380> I've<00:01:28.530> been

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
that's because that's where I've been

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.469 
that's because that's where I've been
using<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.640> know<00:01:29.759> you're<00:01:29.939> supposed<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> put<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
using you know you're supposed to put a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.780 
using you know you're supposed to put a
couple<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.930> drops<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.500> your<00:01:31.650> hand<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.250> then

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
couple of drops on your hand and then

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.830 
couple of drops on your hand and then
apply<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.390> your<00:01:33.479> face

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
apply it to your face

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.319 
apply it to your face
and<00:01:34.200> that's<00:01:34.950> where<00:01:35.250> I've<00:01:35.369> been<00:01:35.400> choosing<00:01:36.180> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
and that's where I've been choosing to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.020 
and that's where I've been choosing to
put<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.590> see<00:01:37.860> if<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.220> could<00:01:38.520> then<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
put it to see if I could then see a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.480 
put it to see if I could then see a
difference<00:01:39.479> between<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.500> two<00:01:40.710> spots<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.369> I

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
difference between the two spots and I

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.719 
difference between the two spots and I
have<00:01:41.729> seen<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.270> huge<00:01:42.930> difference<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:44.340> here's

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
have seen a huge difference so here's

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.550 
have seen a huge difference so here's
what<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.000> looks<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:46.610> comes<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.090> little

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
what it looks like comes in a little

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.639 
what it looks like comes in a little
glass<00:01:50.479> dropper<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:53.479> it's<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.720> very<00:01:55.170> light

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
glass dropper and it's a very light

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.959 
glass dropper and it's a very light
texture<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.600> say<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.930> do<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.939> put<00:01:59.939> a

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
texture what they say to do is put a

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.660 
texture what they say to do is put a
couple<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.810> drops<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.680> think<00:02:01.890> they<00:02:02.009> said<00:02:02.280> three

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
couple of drops I think they said three

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.559 
couple of drops I think they said three
or<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.439> drops<00:02:05.329> it's<00:02:06.329> fairly<00:02:07.049> thin<00:02:08.209> it's<00:02:09.209> I

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
or so drops it's fairly thin it's I

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.770 
or so drops it's fairly thin it's I
would<00:02:09.840> say<00:02:10.080> thinner<00:02:10.500> than<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.250> average<00:02:11.730> serum

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
would say thinner than the average serum

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.970 
would say thinner than the average serum
very<00:02:14.620> easy<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.190> apply<00:02:15.430> does<00:02:16.420> not<00:02:16.750> bother<00:02:17.560> my

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
very easy to apply does not bother my

thing<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.419> Clinique<00:04:34.780> did<00:04:35.020> is<00:04:35.199> it<00:04:35.350> started<00:04:35.770> to

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
thing that Clinique did is it started to

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.510 
thing that Clinique did is it started to
break<00:04:36.010> it<00:04:36.280> up<00:04:36.690> so<00:04:37.690> yes<00:04:38.020> there<00:04:38.410> has<00:04:38.650> been<00:04:39.010> some

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
break it up so yes there has been some

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.030 
break it up so yes there has been some
improvement<00:04:39.870> this<00:04:40.870> side<00:04:41.200> where<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:41.740> spots

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
improvement this side where the spots

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.480 
improvement this side where the spots
are<00:04:42.280> much<00:04:42.490> smaller<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.419> much<00:04:43.630> less<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:45.010> the

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
are much smaller and much less the the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.460 
are much smaller and much less the the
Olay<00:04:45.790> has<00:04:46.120> really<00:04:46.479> done<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.690> nice<00:04:46.930> job<00:04:46.990> I'm

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
Olay has really done a nice job I'm

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.219 
Olay has really done a nice job I'm
hardly<00:04:48.040> noticing<00:04:48.700> those<00:04:48.880> now<00:04:49.180> even<00:04:50.020> when<00:04:50.200> I

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
hardly noticing those now even when I

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.550 
hardly noticing those now even when I
don't<00:04:50.410> have<00:04:50.860> any<00:04:51.310> powder<00:04:51.850> honor<00:04:52.210> or<00:04:52.600> concealer

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
don't have any powder honor or concealer

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.500 
don't have any powder honor or concealer
or<00:04:53.650> anything<00:04:53.979> I<00:04:54.130> hardly<00:04:54.400> noticed<00:04:54.910> them<00:04:55.090> but

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
or anything I hardly noticed them but

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.900 
or anything I hardly noticed them but
those<00:04:55.660> were<00:04:55.870> smaller<00:04:56.260> ones<00:04:56.620> these<00:04:57.280> are<00:04:57.639> all

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
those were smaller ones these are all

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.600 
those were smaller ones these are all
relatively<00:04:58.840> large<00:04:59.289> especially<00:04:59.830> this<00:05:00.400> one

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
relatively large especially this one

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.370 
relatively large especially this one
right<00:05:00.789> here

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
right here

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.469 
right here
and<00:05:02.380> so<00:05:02.950> what<00:05:03.160> I<00:05:03.190> do<00:05:03.340> is<00:05:03.880> supposed<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.180> be<00:05:04.300> used

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
and so what I do is supposed to be used

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.450 
and so what I do is supposed to be used
in<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.720> morning<00:05:04.990> in<00:05:05.199> the<00:05:05.320> evening<00:05:05.470> on<00:05:05.979> a<00:05:06.039> clean

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
in the morning in the evening on a clean

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.719 
in the morning in the evening on a clean
face<00:05:06.729> I<00:05:07.180> take<00:05:08.169> my<00:05:08.470> little<00:05:08.680> dab<00:05:09.010> down<00:05:09.340> here<00:05:09.639> on

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
face I take my little dab down here on

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.790 
face I take my little dab down here on
my<00:05:09.760> hand<00:05:10.300> I<00:05:10.800> dab<00:05:11.800> it<00:05:12.389> onto<00:05:13.389> my<00:05:13.720> spots<00:05:14.139> I<00:05:14.470> rub<00:05:14.680> it

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
my hand I dab it onto my spots I rub it

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.460 
my hand I dab it onto my spots I rub it
in<00:05:14.919> pretty<00:05:15.190> good<00:05:18.210> then<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.240> just<00:05:19.570> move<00:05:20.139> all<00:05:20.440> over

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
in pretty good then I just move all over

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.610 
in pretty good then I just move all over
my<00:05:20.889> face<00:05:21.160> doing<00:05:21.520> that<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.240> then<00:05:23.229> like<00:05:23.440> I<00:05:23.590> said

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
my face doing that and then like I said

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:31.650 
my face doing that and then like I said
I<00:05:23.889> try<00:05:24.340> to<00:05:24.900> let<00:05:25.900> it<00:05:25.930> dry<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:30.090> wait<00:05:31.090> a<00:05:31.120> minute<00:05:31.270> or

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
I try to let it dry and wait a minute or

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.620 
I try to let it dry and wait a minute or
so<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:31.930> think<00:05:32.139> that's<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.800> best<00:05:33.130> way<00:05:34.060> to<00:05:34.090> go<00:05:34.419> out

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
so I think that's the best way to go out

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.440 
so I think that's the best way to go out
it<00:05:34.930> is<00:05:35.020> to<00:05:35.289> wait<00:05:35.530> it's<00:05:35.889> wait<00:05:36.340> even<00:05:37.210> five

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
it is to wait it's wait even five

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.200 
it is to wait it's wait even five
minutes<00:05:37.479> if<00:05:38.080> you<00:05:38.200> can<00:05:38.610> between<00:05:39.610> the

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
minutes if you can between the

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.140 
minutes if you can between the
application<00:05:40.990> of<00:05:41.139> the<00:05:41.289> Olay<00:05:41.590> pro-x<00:05:41.620> and<00:05:42.490> the

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
application of the Olay pro-x and the

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.240 
application of the Olay pro-x and the
application<00:05:43.780> of<00:05:43.900> whatever<00:05:44.139> sunscreen<00:05:45.010> makeup

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
application of whatever sunscreen makeup

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.760 
application of whatever sunscreen makeup
or<00:05:45.610> whatever<00:05:45.729> you're<00:05:46.120> going<00:05:46.270> to<00:05:46.330> put<00:05:46.510> on

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
or whatever you're going to put on

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.680 
or whatever you're going to put on
afterwards

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
afterwards

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.150 
afterwards
because<00:05:49.690> I<00:05:49.720> really<00:05:50.260> think<00:05:50.289> that's<00:05:50.860> the

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
because I really think that's the

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.050 
because I really think that's the
difference<00:05:51.430> I<00:05:51.970> mean<00:05:52.150> my<00:05:52.330> hands<00:05:52.660> get<00:05:53.110> Sun<00:05:54.060> every

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
difference I mean my hands get Sun every

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.200 
difference I mean my hands get Sun every
day<00:05:55.090> without<00:05:55.750> sunscreen<00:05:56.080> and<00:05:56.620> my<00:05:57.610> face<00:05:57.880> gets

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
day without sunscreen and my face gets

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.029 
day without sunscreen and my face gets
sunny<00:05:58.419> every<00:05:58.630> day<00:05:58.660> with<00:05:59.080> sunscreen<00:05:59.530> so<00:05:59.860> that's

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
sunny every day with sunscreen so that's

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.010 
sunny every day with sunscreen so that's
why<00:06:00.190> I'm<00:06:00.310> not<00:06:00.460> understanding<00:06:00.789> why<00:06:01.660> it<00:06:01.720> seems

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
why I'm not understanding why it seems

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.870 
why I'm not understanding why it seems
to<00:06:02.080> be<00:06:02.169> working<00:06:02.380> so<00:06:02.830> much<00:06:02.979> better<00:06:03.250> on<00:06:03.400> my<00:06:03.580> hand

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
to be working so much better on my hand

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.790 
to be working so much better on my hand
that<00:06:04.150> on<00:06:04.630> my<00:06:04.780> face<00:06:05.070> so<00:06:06.690> I<00:06:07.690> really<00:06:08.320> really<00:06:08.470> like

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
that on my face so I really really like

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.580 
that on my face so I really really like
it<00:06:09.039> I<00:06:09.070> think<00:06:09.460> that<00:06:09.550> if<00:06:09.820> I<00:06:09.970> was<00:06:10.180> to<00:06:10.389> use<00:06:10.599> this<00:06:10.840> for

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
it I think that if I was to use this for

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.960 
it I think that if I was to use this for
a<00:06:11.620> year<00:06:12.130> or<00:06:12.310> more<00:06:12.340> like

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
a year or more like

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.780 
a year or more like
did<00:06:13.240> with<00:06:13.870> the<00:06:13.990> clinique<00:06:14.410> that<00:06:15.370> I<00:06:15.400> would

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
did with the clinique that I would

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.000 
did with the clinique that I would
definitely<00:06:16.390> be<00:06:16.570> seeing<00:06:16.870> some<00:06:17.350> you<00:06:17.890> know

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
definitely be seeing some you know

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.030 
definitely be seeing some you know
noticeable<00:06:18.790> results<00:06:19.020> right<00:06:20.020> now<00:06:20.260> I<00:06:20.620> can

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
noticeable results right now I can

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.910 
noticeable results right now I can
notice<00:06:21.250> a<00:06:21.550> huge<00:06:21.880> difference<00:06:22.480> on<00:06:22.750> these<00:06:23.590> two

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:23.920 
notice a huge difference on these two

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.250 
notice a huge difference on these two
spots<00:06:24.280> on<00:06:24.490> my<00:06:24.610> hand<00:06:24.880> one<00:06:25.240> treated<00:06:25.750> one<00:06:25.990> not

spots on my hand one treated one not
treated<00:06:27.720> on<00:06:28.720> my<00:06:29.050> face<00:06:29.380> I'm<00:06:29.800> seeing<00:06:30.310> some

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
treated on my face I'm seeing some

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.820 
treated on my face I'm seeing some
improvement<00:06:31.690> over<00:06:31.870> here<00:06:32.140> with<00:06:32.350> my<00:06:32.530> finer

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
improvement over here with my finer

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.670 
improvement over here with my finer
spots<00:06:33.330> not<00:06:34.330> so<00:06:34.660> much<00:06:34.900> over<00:06:35.170> here<00:06:35.320> with<00:06:35.500> my

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
spots not so much over here with my

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.050 
spots not so much over here with my
bigger<00:06:35.920> spots<00:06:36.370> but<00:06:37.090> it's<00:06:37.360> been<00:06:38.340> I'm<00:06:39.340> thinking

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
bigger spots but it's been I'm thinking

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.250 
bigger spots but it's been I'm thinking
3<00:06:40.570> 2<00:06:40.900> to<00:06:41.050> 3<00:06:41.290> weeks<00:06:41.320> that<00:06:42.220> I've<00:06:42.370> been<00:06:42.400> using<00:06:42.790> it

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
3 2 to 3 weeks that I've been using it

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.440 
3 2 to 3 weeks that I've been using it
so<00:06:44.260> you<00:06:44.740> know<00:06:44.830> that's<00:06:45.010> not<00:06:45.460> long<00:06:45.760> for<00:06:46.300> this

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450 
so you know that's not long for this

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 
my face and I thought that would be

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.610 
my face and I thought that would be
helping<00:07:54.040> the<00:07:54.520> process<00:07:54.790> along<00:07:55.360> but<00:07:55.810> I<00:07:56.080> don't

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:56.620 
helping the process along but I don't

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.800 
helping the process along but I don't
know<00:07:56.770> I<00:07:56.800> don't<00:07:56.980> ever<00:07:57.370> exfoliate<00:07:58.060> my<00:07:58.270> hand<00:07:58.570> and

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:58.810 
know I don't ever exfoliate my hand and

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.870 
know I don't ever exfoliate my hand and
yet<00:07:58.930> my<00:07:59.080> hand<00:07:59.320> is<00:07:59.470> the<00:07:59.500> thing<00:07:59.800> that's<00:08:00.010> fading

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:00.880 
yet my hand is the thing that's fading

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.720 
yet my hand is the thing that's fading
and<00:08:01.090> the<00:08:02.020> spots<00:08:02.410> on<00:08:02.560> my<00:08:02.650> face<00:08:02.860> are<00:08:03.040> not<00:08:03.220> so<00:08:03.490> much

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:03.730 
and the spots on my face are not so much

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.650 
and the spots on my face are not so much
so<00:08:04.300> that's<00:08:04.600> my<00:08:04.870> review<00:08:05.290> of<00:08:05.350> Olay<00:08:06.220> pro-x<00:08:06.660> spot
