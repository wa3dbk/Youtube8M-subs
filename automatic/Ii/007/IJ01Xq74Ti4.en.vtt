LaMotta am I correct yeah for me is a
very<00:00:41.370> interesting<00:00:41.670> project<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.510> think<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.260> all

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
very interesting project I think for all

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.200 
very interesting project I think for all
of<00:00:43.620> us<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.760> Motor<00:00:44.969> Company<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:47.460> will<00:00:48.000> be

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
of us the Motor Company and this will be

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.250 
of us the Motor Company and this will be
the<00:00:49.200> first<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:50.070> one<00:00:51.059> family<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.750> bike<00:00:52.020> it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the first one of one family of bike it

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.150 
the first one of one family of bike it
hit<00:00:52.440> with<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> supercharger<00:00:53.899> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
hit with the supercharger and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.150 
hit with the supercharger and
okay<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.590> our<00:00:58.620> first

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
okay here you can see our first

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.549 
okay here you can see our first
prototype<00:00:59.760> one<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.809> first<00:01:01.050> prototype

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
prototype one of the first prototype

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.609 
prototype one of the first prototype
that<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:02.010> use<00:01:02.449> every<00:01:03.449> day<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.600> make<00:01:04.110> tests<00:01:04.409> on

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that we use every day to make tests on

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.350 
that we use every day to make tests on
the<00:01:04.890> road<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:10.560> tell<00:01:11.040> me<00:01:11.220> about<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.000> why<00:01:12.180> did

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
the road and tell me about so why did

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.660 
the road and tell me about so why did
you<00:01:12.450> choose<00:01:12.630> compressor<00:01:13.380> instead<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.950> turbo

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
you choose compressor instead of turbo

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.960 
you choose compressor instead of turbo
for<00:01:14.909> example<00:01:15.360> Wow<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:16.619> sure<00:01:16.830> for<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.280> better

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
for example Wow for sure for a better

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:27.010 
for example Wow for sure for a better
drivability<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:19.259> better<00:01:23.810> because<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:26.340> is

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
drivability for better because it is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.620 
drivability for better because it is
mechanically<00:01:28.020> Drive<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:30.090> means<00:01:30.360> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
mechanically Drive and this means that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.910 
mechanically Drive and this means that
it<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.990> more<00:01:31.200> easy<00:01:31.890> from<00:01:33.170> some<00:01:34.170> technical

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
it is more easy from some technical

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.810 
it is more easy from some technical
aspect<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.640> installed<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.450> bike<00:01:37.259> engine

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
aspect to be installed on a bike engine

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.280 
aspect to be installed on a bike engine
instead<00:01:38.820> -<00:01:39.329> Oh<00:01:40.640> many<00:01:41.640> many<00:01:41.930> biking<00:01:42.930> -<00:01:43.079> just

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
instead - Oh many many biking - just

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.030 
instead - Oh many many biking - just
know<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:44.329> route<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.720> tool<00:01:46.110> butchered<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
know the route the tool butchered the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.530 
know the route the tool butchered the
bike<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.729> there<00:01:48.299> was<00:01:49.070> not<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.460> good<00:01:51.119> three<00:01:51.390> of

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
bike and there was not a good three of

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.620 
bike and there was not a good three of
the<00:01:51.659> forties<00:01:52.020> back<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.649> drivability<00:01:53.630> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the forties back for drivability the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.569 
the forties back for drivability the
first<00:01:54.869> aspect<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:55.530> tested<00:01:56.070> was<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
first aspect we tested was the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.600 
first aspect we tested was the
drivability<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> drivability<00:01:57.810> is

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
drivability and the drivability is

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.910 
drivability and the drivability is
perfectly<00:01:59.610> exactly<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.780> same<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.440> standard

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
perfectly exactly the same of a standard

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.310 
perfectly exactly the same of a standard
aspirated<00:02:02.550> engine<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.110> very

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
aspirated engine and this is the very

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.150 
aspirated engine and this is the very
first<00:02:04.950> big<00:02:05.400> result<00:02:06.150> for<00:02:06.480> our<00:02:06.510> 4b<00:02:07.140> Mountain<00:02:07.500> for

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
first big result for our 4b Mountain for

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.320 
first big result for our 4b Mountain for
sure<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.660> talk<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.050> me<00:02:10.440> about<00:02:10.710> horsepower<00:02:11.610> how

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
sure so talk to me about horsepower how

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.940 
sure so talk to me about horsepower how
much<00:02:12.570> have<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.780> increased<00:02:13.170> from<00:02:13.380> original

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
much have you increased from original

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.130 
much have you increased from original
who<00:02:14.250> okay<00:02:14.790> now<00:02:15.030> our<00:02:15.500> target<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.860> not<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.370> have

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
who okay now our target is not to have

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.650 
who okay now our target is not to have
weakened<00:02:19.140> ever<00:02:19.590> more<00:02:20.010> than<00:02:20.280> 200<00:02:21.270> horsepower

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
weakened ever more than 200 horsepower

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.930 
weakened ever more than 200 horsepower
for<00:02:22.200> sure<00:02:22.350> because<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:22.950> test<00:02:23.220> some<00:02:23.430> solution

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
for sure because we test some solution

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.490 
for sure because we test some solution
adjustments<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.140> our<00:02:25.560> intention<00:02:26.550> is<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.730> make

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
adjustments but our intention is to make

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.680 
adjustments but our intention is to make
something<00:02:28.500> like<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.890> kit<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:30.480> be

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
something like a kit that can be

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.230 
something like a kit that can be
installed<00:02:31.020> on<00:02:31.770> our<00:02:31.980> standard<00:02:32.580> bike<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.120> in

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
installed on our standard bike and in

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.840 
installed on our standard bike and in
particular<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.260> standard<00:02:34.709> engine<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.820> we

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
particular on the standard engine so we

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.960 
particular on the standard engine so we
are<00:02:36.360> testing<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.440> best<00:02:37.860> performance<00:02:38.610> with

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
are testing the best performance with

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.390 
are testing the best performance with
the<00:02:39.180> best<00:02:41.300> endurance<00:02:42.300> test<00:02:42.600> -<00:02:42.959> because<00:02:43.410> we

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
the best endurance test - because we

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.360 
the best endurance test - because we
will<00:02:45.090> change<00:02:45.590> for<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.709> moment<00:02:47.040> we<00:02:47.220> are<00:02:47.340> not

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
will change for the moment we are not

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.060 
will change for the moment we are not
changing<00:02:47.850> any<00:02:48.240> kind<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.870> pieces<00:02:49.440> inside<00:02:49.830> the

other kind of machinery on the standard
engine<00:03:09.690> we<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.650> stay<00:03:10.860> with<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.250> standard

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
engine we like to stay with the standard

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.490 
engine we like to stay with the standard
engine<00:03:12.030> for<00:03:12.180> sure<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.870> our<00:03:13.290> target<00:03:13.830> now<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.190> a

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
engine for sure and our target now is a

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.610 
engine for sure and our target now is a
hundred<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.620> ninety<00:03:17.570> 190<00:03:18.570> horsepower<00:03:18.810> that

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
hundred and ninety 190 horsepower that

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.460 
hundred and ninety 190 horsepower that
means<00:03:20.269> starting<00:03:21.269> from<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.660> Diavel<00:03:22.050> engine

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
means starting from the Diavel engine

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.120 
means starting from the Diavel engine
means<00:03:22.709> around<00:03:23.430> 25<00:03:24.390> 30<00:03:24.810> or<00:03:25.260> seized<00:03:25.560> power<00:03:25.769> more

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
means around 25 30 or seized power more

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.670 
means around 25 30 or seized power more
not<00:03:26.370> not<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:27.180> know<00:03:27.810> too<00:03:27.870> much<00:03:28.140> then<00:03:28.470> this

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
not not to know too much then this

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.210 
not not to know too much then this
probably<00:03:29.480> but<00:03:30.480> we<00:03:30.690> can<00:03:31.019> we<00:03:31.440> can<00:03:31.650> because<00:03:32.010> with

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
probably but we can we can because with

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.880 
probably but we can we can because with
a<00:03:32.250> supercharger<00:03:33.120> we<00:03:33.540> could<00:03:33.750> go<00:03:33.930> ahead<00:03:34.290> for

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
a supercharger we could go ahead for

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.810 
a supercharger we could go ahead for
sure<00:03:36.350> 210<00:03:37.350> 220<00:03:38.100> but<00:03:38.690> we<00:03:39.690> have<00:03:40.430> we<00:03:41.430> could<00:03:41.640> have

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
sure 210 220 but we have we could have

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.400 
sure 210 220 but we have we could have
tried<00:03:42.090> many<00:03:42.510> big<00:03:43.170> problem<00:03:43.890> with<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.220> engine

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
tried many big problem with the engine

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:53.180 
tried many big problem with the engine
okay<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:46.980> but<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:48.180> diabolos<00:03:48.630> 1098<00:03:51.860> engine<00:03:52.860> yes

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
not for the moment though we we will

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.690 
not for the moment though we we will
change<00:04:12.750> probably<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.530> suspension<00:04:14.310> we<00:04:14.489> will

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
change probably the suspension we will

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.900 
change probably the suspension we will
use<00:04:14.879> all<00:04:15.420> these<00:04:15.599> in<00:04:15.840> front<00:04:16.109> in<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.470> year

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
use all these in front in the year

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.509 
use all these in front in the year
probably<00:04:17.910> I<00:04:18.840> don't<00:04:19.229> know<00:04:19.350> how<00:04:19.979> will<00:04:20.310> be

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
probably I don't know how will be

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.879 
probably I don't know how will be
managed<00:04:20.910> if<00:04:21.209> will<00:04:21.449> be<00:04:21.630> an<00:04:21.870> optional<00:04:22.320> or<00:04:22.530> will

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
managed if will be an optional or will

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.540 
managed if will be an optional or will
be<00:04:23.150> production<00:04:24.150> serious<00:04:24.600> production<00:04:25.199> but<00:04:26.190> we

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
be production serious production but we

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.939 
be production serious production but we
are<00:04:26.789> testing<00:04:27.180> also<00:04:27.389> all<00:04:27.690> in<00:04:27.870> suspension<00:04:28.560> like

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
are testing also all in suspension like

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.529 
are testing also all in suspension like
the<00:04:29.190> bike<00:04:29.460> presented<00:04:30.389> on<00:04:30.539> 8<00:04:30.990> mature<00:04:31.410> last<00:04:32.070> year
