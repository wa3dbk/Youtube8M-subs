00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
know it's a very good bike challenge so

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.480 
know it's a very good bike challenge so
far<00:01:39.649> is<00:01:39.890> not<00:01:40.820> stopping<00:01:41.270> but<00:01:41.720> stopping<00:01:42.490> what

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
far is not stopping but stopping what
