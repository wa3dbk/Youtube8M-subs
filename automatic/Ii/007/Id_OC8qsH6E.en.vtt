and<00:00:05.549> it<00:00:05.970> usually<00:00:06.150> results<00:00:06.750> in<00:00:06.870> food<00:00:07.140> with<00:00:07.410> a

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
and it usually results in food with a

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.650 
and it usually results in food with a
dramatically<00:00:08.099> different<00:00:08.400> taste<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.179> texture

dramatically different taste and texture

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.959 
dramatically different taste and texture
but<00:00:10.650> there's<00:00:10.830> another<00:00:11.099> way<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.340> radically

below<00:00:27.570> zero<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.949> turns<00:00:29.310> into<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.730> liquid<00:00:30.029> and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
below zero it turns into a liquid and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.959 
below zero it turns into a liquid and
this<00:00:30.900> super<00:00:31.260> frigid<00:00:31.830> fluid<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.399> change<00:00:32.730> the

structure of food in an instant and that

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.330 
structure of food in an instant and that
means<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:36.030> can<00:00:36.239> shatter<00:00:36.719> fruit<00:00:37.140> grind<00:00:37.920> soft

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
means you can shatter fruit grind soft

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
but for cooking it you should use

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.950 
but for cooking it you should use
nitrogen<00:01:52.399> that's<00:01:52.670> certified<00:01:52.970> as<00:01:53.330> medical

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
this inventive mix can be used to season

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.610 
this inventive mix can be used to season
fish<00:04:24.010> or<00:04:24.310> a<00:04:24.370> salad<00:04:24.940> but<00:04:25.570> first<00:04:25.960> they<00:04:26.320> have<00:04:26.470> to

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
fish or a salad but first they have to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.370 
fish or a salad but first they have to
super<00:04:27.070> freeze<00:04:27.310> it<00:04:27.490> why<00:04:28.000> is<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.330> key<00:04:28.450> the

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
super freeze it why is that a key the

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.110 
super freeze it why is that a key the
reason<00:04:29.680> we<00:04:29.770> have<00:04:29.919> to<00:04:30.070> super<00:04:30.400> freeze<00:04:30.640> the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
reason we have to super freeze the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.180 
reason we have to super freeze the
ingredients<00:04:31.660> is<00:04:31.750> because<00:04:32.110> their<00:04:32.380> ingredients

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
ingredients is because their ingredients

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.190 
ingredients is because their ingredients
that<00:04:33.280> are<00:04:33.400> normally<00:04:33.700> high<00:04:33.880> in<00:04:34.030> fat<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:35.050> so

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
that are normally high in fat and so

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.320 
that are normally high in fat and so
when<00:04:35.350> you<00:04:35.470> grind<00:04:35.650> them<00:04:35.919> they<00:04:36.010> become<00:04:36.250> pasty<00:04:36.850> we

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
when you grind them they become pasty we

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.360 
when you grind them they become pasty we
want<00:04:37.540> them<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:37.690> be<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:37.900> beautiful<00:04:38.680> light<00:04:39.010> powder

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
want them to be a beautiful light powder

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.590 
want them to be a beautiful light powder
okay<00:04:40.030> okay<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:40.870> so<00:04:41.050> by<00:04:41.200> freezing<00:04:41.530> them<00:04:42.600> it

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
okay okay and so by freezing them it

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.000 
okay okay and so by freezing them it
will<00:04:43.720> allow<00:04:44.020> us<00:04:44.230> to<00:04:44.260> grind<00:04:44.650> them<00:04:44.830> without

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
will allow us to grind them without

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.500 
will allow us to grind them without
releasing<00:04:45.400> all<00:04:45.669> of<00:04:45.700> the<00:04:45.880> oils<00:04:46.240> in<00:04:46.419> the

pink<00:05:56.870> in<00:05:56.990> color<00:05:57.170> it<00:05:57.350> will<00:05:57.440> stay<00:05:57.650> bright<00:05:57.860> and

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.380 
pink in color it will stay bright and
white<00:05:58.250> so<00:05:58.490> let's<00:05:58.670> get<00:05:59.000> to<00:05:59.120> it

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390

now do we feel it all uncomfortable

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.860 
now do we feel it all uncomfortable
about<00:06:42.440> adding<00:06:42.980> nitrogen<00:06:43.790> to<00:06:44.240> our<00:06:44.450> ice<00:06:44.630> cream

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
about adding nitrogen to our ice cream

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.960 
about adding nitrogen to our ice cream
by<00:06:45.230> the<00:06:45.290> time<00:06:45.590> the<00:06:45.770> ice<00:06:46.100> cream<00:06:46.430> is<00:06:46.580> finished

by the time the ice cream is finished
all<00:06:47.240> the<00:06:47.450> nitrogen<00:06:47.600> will<00:06:47.990> have<00:06:48.110> evaporated

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
all the nitrogen will have evaporated

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.160 
all the nitrogen will have evaporated
out<00:06:48.860> of<00:06:48.980> it<00:06:49.130> oh<00:06:49.280> well<00:06:49.610> making<00:06:50.540> ice<00:06:50.720> cream<00:06:50.930> using

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.170 
out of it oh well making ice cream using

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.110 
out of it oh well making ice cream using
liquid<00:06:51.650> nitrogen<00:06:51.950> has<00:06:52.400> a<00:06:52.430> few<00:06:52.790> advantages

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
liquid nitrogen has a few advantages

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.690 
liquid nitrogen has a few advantages
over<00:06:53.570> the<00:06:53.690> traditional<00:06:53.810> method<00:06:54.650> not<00:06:55.280> only<00:06:55.340> is

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
over the traditional method not only is

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.790 
over the traditional method not only is
it<00:06:55.850> much<00:06:56.030> faster<00:06:56.300> but<00:06:56.930> the<00:06:57.050> quick<00:06:57.290> freezing

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
it much faster but the quick freezing

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.100 
it much faster but the quick freezing
makes<00:06:58.010> for<00:06:58.250> smaller<00:06:58.610> ice<00:06:58.940> crystals<00:06:58.970> and<00:06:59.690> that

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
makes for smaller ice crystals and that

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.110 
makes for smaller ice crystals and that
gives<00:07:00.410> the<00:07:00.560> ice<00:07:00.680> cream<00:07:01.040> a<00:07:01.190> creamier<00:07:01.640> texture

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
gives the ice cream a creamier texture

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.660 
gives the ice cream a creamier texture
this<00:07:02.960> means<00:07:03.260> you<00:07:03.530> can<00:07:03.680> get<00:07:03.800> the<00:07:03.950> same<00:07:04.190> creamy

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670 
this means you can get the same creamy

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.910 
this means you can get the same creamy
texture<00:07:05.120> using<00:07:05.540> less<00:07:05.870> milk<00:07:06.170> fat<00:07:06.470> than<00:07:06.770> you

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:06.920 
texture using less milk fat than you

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.740 
texture using less milk fat than you
would<00:07:07.070> need<00:07:07.250> for<00:07:07.580> traditionally<00:07:08.180> frozen<00:07:08.570> ice

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:08.750 
would need for traditionally frozen ice

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.450 
would need for traditionally frozen ice
cream<00:07:09.050> and<00:07:09.410> the<00:07:09.620> ice<00:07:09.740> cream<00:07:09.920> did<00:07:10.070> not<00:07:10.220> turn

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
cream and the ice cream did not turn

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.360 
cream and the ice cream did not turn
pink<00:07:10.700> it<00:07:11.270> has<00:07:11.300> that<00:07:11.570> pretty<00:07:11.840> white<00:07:12.050> color<00:07:12.370> and

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
pink it has that pretty white color and

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.680 
pink it has that pretty white color and
if<00:07:13.490> you<00:07:13.520> wanted<00:07:13.820> it<00:07:13.940> a<00:07:14.000> little<00:07:14.240> firmer<00:07:14.450> you

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
if you wanted it a little firmer you

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.210 
if you wanted it a little firmer you
could<00:07:14.870> add<00:07:14.990> more<00:07:15.020> nitrogen<00:07:15.500> but<00:07:15.800> we<00:07:15.890> like<00:07:16.070> our

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.220 
could add more nitrogen but we like our

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.070 
could add more nitrogen but we like our
ice<00:07:16.340> cream<00:07:16.550> soft<00:07:16.910> oh<00:07:17.240> this<00:07:17.660> looks<00:07:17.870> perfect
