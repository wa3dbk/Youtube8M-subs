00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.820
 roadbike at the eurobike demo day 2013 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.980
 I have a whole new race here 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.300
 And that is the haibike fair 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.400
 rx the holy felix is â€‹â€‹really whole 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.890
 new is even here 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.019
 a prototype and indeed this is a 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.330
 Marathon road bike with a marathon 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.880
 geometry so with a bit deeper 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.109
 front a racer on high 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.230
 Speeds for a long time 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.780
 is in this at the fr 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.570
 where the extra emphasis is placed on the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.960
 comfort for example, it has advice 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.539
 extra springy seat post this as 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.829
 Carbon support has a recess 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.200
 We should also be able to fail 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.879
 the bike also test drive and 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.719
 The bike is really nice too 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.090
 comfortable 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.210
 which further contributes to comfort 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.250
 are the thin seat aspire and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.230
 along with the stop in geometry 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.660
 form the seat aspire quasi a line 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.420
 with the top tube also a nice detail 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.479
 the brake was aimed at the seat 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.450
 taken down under the bottom bracket 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.369
 that makes a nice little optic and 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.540
 the brake underneath the bottom bracket the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.700
 works very well too 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.729
 So there is no functional 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.619
 smears also front on the front is it 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.770
 advice in addition to speed on 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.360
 comfort designed the fork is the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.630
 fork failure ends are extra 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.659
 set that there is a nice suspension 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.939
 quality at the front is another 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.369
 nice detail is the chain finger the 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.630
 attached directly to the frame is that the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.170
 chain does not fall down inside and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.509
 the carbon frame damages the carbon 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.540
 frame is also very easy 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.790
 it is not really a heavy wheel and yes 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.710
 so that's who mart and who drives 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.450
 long maligned long stretch up 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.520
 high speed drives for the is 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.520
 it sure is a great road bike
