00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.250

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.550
 I like to do business sorry for the rest 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.290
 I need to pay what the 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.150
 bud has stolen years from us 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.130

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.070
 time to change behavior is 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.660
 why are you kidding me but if 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.980
 so far you have done nothing but steal a 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.810
 this is not true 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.820
 I had taken all those jewels and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.470
 banished memories and as food to 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.510
 peasants had too much and could 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:44.219
 to do without 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:46.500
 we go to big sister to me is not right is 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.719

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.489
 master yes this guy is a 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.680
 shadow manipulator willing to 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.500
 teach a name evocative of shadows but 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:04.260
 not your teacher an evocative of shadows 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:08.630
 you have to tell him the aromas are enough now 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.630
 I'm sick of your tommy behavior 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.340
 What do you think of the sea with that 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.510
 and how dare you think about deceiving 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.460
 my brother 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:27.270
 you have a misplaced wheel in the middle 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:41.220
 in short, because you have it with me, come here 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:43.310
 I'll explain it to you like a rat in 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.310
 trap 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:02:05.940
 you are ready all right under there but you 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:07.979
 are you crying who is dealing with leon is 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.840
 was a manipulator just like 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.220
 you who brought us to our 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.380
 parents 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.459
 my brother and I were very young 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.459
 When did it happen 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.090
 if you oppose it you will be swept away 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.870
 but what is a shadow it is 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.870
 frightening 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.170
 [Music] 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.330
 something happened in the village I and 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.400
 your mother, let's go and see you stay here 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.090
 to sleep with your little brother the two of us 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.090
 will be back soon 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:08.360
 [Music] 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.360
 no 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.919
 [Music] 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.010
 the great realm that has come this far 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.130
 that's why you can't stand those like 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.290
 me but tommy remembers what it is 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.660
 success was very small then it is 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.050
 forgotten all this is a 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.900
 well 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.710
 and I wait but because he wants to become 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.470
 a manipulator 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:40.020
 last year the soldiers of the great king to me 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.940
 they returned and with them there were 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:58.740
 two manipulators of shadows aboard a 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:04:01.410
 tank manipulators of shadows 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.340
 those would be manipulators are 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.980
 really strong 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.300
 you don't know what you say since the 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.010
 village had been destroyed by 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.390
 we don't have shadow manipulators 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.250
 found the courage to challenge the 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.480
 attackers and we delivered them 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.220
 all the stocks that had fantastic i 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.890
 manipulators year the world at their feet 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.049
 totÃ² but when I grow up too 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:28.080
 I want to become one of them so not 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:30.570
 will have to work harder so much you get away with it 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.240
 so bad we do what we can to 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.430
 find the money but will not want to become 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.919
 a criminal these things he did not 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.750
 still understands too small 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.120
 thinks that the big breast manipulators 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.520
 heroes instead is not so 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.160
 I know they are war machines and me 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.460
 the war hates and I despise anyone 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.410
 take part in it 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.389
 so I do n't care where you stand 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.560
 even if you are a summoner I also hate 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.300
 you because I would only make you suffer not 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.050
 I will never allow tommy to become a 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:07.389
 summoner if I let him know 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:10.120
 that I would end up losing him myself 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.220
 like you I can't stand war but the 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.349
 big realm mitch forced to attack 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.840
 my village was no other 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.590
 choice that defend me well you have to find you 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.599
 an other place 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.360
 we don't want to have anything to do with 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.800
 you the village has finally found 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.690
 peace 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.520
 I'm sick of seeing broken families 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.490
 by violence I can't anymore 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.919
 to bear 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.780
 I am a simple blacksmith but I am 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.400
 proud of never having built 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.380
 weapons of war 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.889
 I only make tools for farmers and 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.889
 other items 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:45.400
 I understand why or there 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.020
 war and the manipulator of shadows but if 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.210
 he explains yes even to tommy maybe 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:54.490
 I would change attitude I have already tried 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:56.919
 talk to him some time ago but listen to me well 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.680
 I want to tell you something unfortunately 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.210
 mom and dad are no longer with us because 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.680
 a shadow manipulator attacked them 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.169
 Yeah, for sure 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.990
 12 to convince me to be a blacksmith like 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.210
 you sister but I have decided to become 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.699
 shadow manipulator I will not change my mind 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.940
 and stop inventing stories called non 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:17.319
 you're capable of waiting for me 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.759
 [Music] 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.470
 how could he think he was 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:23.229
 lying 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.449
 I would love to be able to help you wait 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:27.120
 you can do it instead because you do n't discourage it 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.800
 convince him not to follow your path 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:35.830
 as yourself 61 that governs 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:37.960
 shadows could dates listening has happened 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:43.690
 but terrible thing of the bandits have 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:46.389
 taken away topically let me leave you 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:49.240
 go even if that boy is defended 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:51.669
 I took my ruby back like it's not stuff 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.789
 your own that precious stone deviates it 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:57.490
 stolen you're right and it went 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.659
 consequently it has now become friendly but not 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.090
 you are all wrong 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:04.470
 this is our most lifestyle 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:08.490
 tempting than playing with a shadow 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.490
 [Laughs] 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:19.539
 let the shadow conjurer leave him 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:21.039
 go forget it, let's arrange it instead 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:25.650
 I think we suspect 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:25.650
 let's make it to the gardens
