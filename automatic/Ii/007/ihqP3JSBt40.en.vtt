00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.700

 time on the smartphone for the day such here 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.859
 plastic plastic and such a coating on 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.840
 which practically does not remain 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.580
 fingerprints they supposedly remain but 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.920
 then immediately disappear very much 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.460
 interesting such a material coating 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.330
 I like to also have 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.390

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.560
 original film headset and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.630
 actually charging usb cable which i 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.299
 I use to charge this smartphone 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 at the moment it means the smartphone itself 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.869
 we have a smartphone six inches 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.079
 display 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.119
 to look at the beauty of this 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.020
 Screen I'm wanted here this hall of hydrochloric 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.460
 film so you can see all the beauty 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.490
 This model means the front of us goes 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.439
 three touch buttons most likely a 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.079
 so here they are about a little bit visible 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.640
 means from left to right we have the menu button 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.390
 home and back 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.009
 at the top we have a camera speaker sensor 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.009
 illuminance proximity sensor 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.079
 then on the side of this side we have a model 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.020
 has a power button on the top connector 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.930
 under the headphones from this side we have 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.330
 rocker 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.550
 volume well and actually below us 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.950
 charging connector 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.500
 very some microphone behind us 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.500
 the cap has such a rubberized 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.080
 fingerprint structure principle 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.480
 It is left if 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.360
 appears immediately under sweat 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.020
 almost immediately after the original 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.400
 logo ass camera flash hole 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.920
 under the speaker let's see this model 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.420
 under the battery that we have with him 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.860
 some look how big 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.670
 battery battery we have on 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.590
 real 3000 milliamper hours i 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.570
 I will surely make a test which I 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.090
 doing with all smartphones sure 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.410
 that will be a very cool result in 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.080
 the zopo zp990 hotel will say that the model has 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.510
 version 32 gigabytes embedded and 1 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.880

 sim card one standard 1 micro-sim i 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.959
 surely slot for micro sd card and 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:13.980
 Finally, I want to say that the model has 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:17.350
 in detail as an enlarged copy of samsung 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.620
 s4 that is, it has almost everything 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.130
 the same frames here 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.010
 this is not a metal frame because i 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.010
 sure it is similar and as simple 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.290
 painted it made pretended that 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.060
 it's like a metal type but so 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.410
 actually like the model very much 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.940
 The screen is gorgeous so as not to miss the whole 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.190
