out<00:02:11.959> there<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.349> was<00:02:12.410> actually<00:02:12.830> felt<00:02:13.130> pretty

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
out there it was actually felt pretty

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.259 
out there it was actually felt pretty
good<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.849> I<00:02:14.030> was<00:02:14.209> going<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.930> go<00:02:15.110> with<00:02:15.670> TJ<00:02:16.670> on

weekend<00:02:17.690> but<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.080> was<00:02:18.290> my<00:02:18.470> racing<00:02:18.890> pretty<00:02:19.489> much

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
weekend but I was my racing pretty much

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.990 
weekend but I was my racing pretty much
like<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:22.150> 13-foot<00:02:23.150> wide<00:02:23.200> kid<00:02:24.200> or<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:24.620> with<00:02:25.099> 200

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
like a 13-foot wide kid or so with 200

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.020 
like a 13-foot wide kid or so with 200
feet<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.480> basically<00:02:27.440> just<00:02:27.769> mud<00:02:28.130> or<00:02:28.580> dirt

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
feet of basically just mud or dirt

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.830 
feet of basically just mud or dirt
sometimes<00:02:29.980> varying<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.569> basically<00:02:32.569> try<00:02:32.780> to

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
sometimes varying and basically try to

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.110 
sometimes varying and basically try to
get<00:02:33.049> through<00:02:33.200> either<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.590> fastest<00:02:34.250> or<00:02:34.610> with

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
get through either the fastest or with

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.699 
get through either the fastest or with
the<00:02:35.569> best<00:02:36.349> time<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:37.989> played<00:02:38.989> probably<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.530> lot

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
the best time I played probably a lot

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.240 
the best time I played probably a lot
more<00:02:39.739> with<00:02:40.160> my<00:02:40.489> head<00:02:41.030> versus<00:02:41.690> being<00:02:42.140> more<00:02:42.739> like

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
more with my head versus being more like

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.539 
more with my head versus being more like
physical<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.299> sort<00:02:44.569> of<00:02:44.859> see<00:02:45.859> what<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.040> need<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.280> do

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
physical I sort of see what I need to do

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.479 
physical I sort of see what I need to do
before<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.450> want<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.900> do<00:02:48.079> it<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.010> figure

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
before and want to do it and so I figure

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.370 
before and want to do it and so I figure
out<00:02:49.579> how<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.760> do<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.030> when<00:02:50.299> I<00:02:50.329> get<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.810> one<00:02:51.350> of

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
out how to do it when I get in one of

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.099 
out how to do it when I get in one of
the<00:02:51.530> things<00:02:51.739> our<00:02:52.100> coach<00:02:52.670> like<00:02:52.940> taught<00:02:53.239> us<00:02:53.450> or

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
the things our coach like taught us or

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.379 
the things our coach like taught us or
that<00:02:54.530> I've<00:02:54.799> run<00:02:55.010> from<00:02:55.310> also<00:02:55.670> high<00:02:55.819> school<00:02:56.120> was

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
that I've run from also high school was

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.360 
that I've run from also high school was
like<00:02:56.660> leaving<00:02:57.019> like<00:02:57.139> Lyman's<00:02:57.560> feet<00:02:57.859> pretty

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
like leaving like Lyman's feet pretty

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.650 
like leaving like Lyman's feet pretty
much<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.440> it's<00:03:00.440> actually<00:03:00.590> very<00:03:00.829> helpful<00:03:01.459> when

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
much and it's actually very helpful when

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.210 
much and it's actually very helpful when
learning<00:03:02.660> what<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.500> do<00:03:03.650> and<00:03:03.829> how<00:03:03.859> to<00:03:03.950> do

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
learning what to do and how to do

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.090 
learning what to do and how to do
because<00:03:04.870> someone<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.139> you<00:03:06.500> know<00:03:06.620> give<00:03:06.859> away

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
because someone and you know give away

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.160 
because someone and you know give away
certain<00:03:07.310> things<00:03:07.639> of<00:03:07.790> what<00:03:07.910> they<00:03:08.060> do<00:03:08.170> versus

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
certain things of what they do versus

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.080 
certain things of what they do versus
their<00:03:09.350> stance<00:03:09.709> or<00:03:10.100> how<00:03:10.280> they<00:03:10.489> get<00:03:10.790> off<00:03:10.940> the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
their stance or how they get off the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.140 
their stance or how they get off the
ball<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:12.489> use<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.519> to<00:03:14.000> your<00:03:14.090> advantage

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
ball and so use that to your advantage

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.300 
ball and so use that to your advantage
with<00:03:14.720> my<00:03:14.840> watching<00:03:15.230> film<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.920> things<00:03:16.130> like

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
with my watching film and things like

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.780 
with my watching film and things like
that<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.840> gain<00:03:17.840> upper<00:03:18.200> hand<00:03:18.410> on<00:03:18.530> I've<00:03:19.130> watched

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
that to gain upper hand on I've watched

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.680 
that to gain upper hand on I've watched
like<00:03:20.120> different<00:03:20.569> defensive<00:03:20.989> ends<00:03:21.170> like

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
like different defensive ends like

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.460 
like different defensive ends like
