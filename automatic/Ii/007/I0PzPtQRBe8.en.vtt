00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello everyone welcome to the channel 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.560
 Swami Sasha today we have such an unusual 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.960
 podcast- type video to effect only 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.969
 my skin they me and in this video I want 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.639
 tell future plans what I want 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.250
 make coming in about half a year like 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.820
 time before the new year that we will be with you 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.210
 do 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.920
 what I want to do well what I plan so 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.869
 first thing to want to do it 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.330
 Of course, Alex means that there is a big 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.160
 style i was going from big alex i and 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.050
 its value has already done a sweep all 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.960
 marked up the whole thing about changed where 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.670
 what should move took a sweep and in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.559
 general that I now do not they are not paper 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.690
 paints so I do not want to start now 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.610
 do it because I understand that I'll start 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.920
 and I donâ€™t want to finish right away 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.079
 all buy all gather prepare 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.300
 take two days done so while i'm 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.010
 I don't do it, but I really, really want to do 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.800
 I do not know whether the mobile will be 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.020
 mobile but she will be you sailors range 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.180
 and scan that is everything tread 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.670
 movable she placed where necessary 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.579
 cut and draw that we have everything here 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.460
 three saying here here it is not so 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.930
 torso us look here it is 0 and and a 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.220
 that you are and that is the finger is not 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.110
 it turns out, as it were, too, here such here 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.909
 movable like a human article 3 parts 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.310
 and not stuck on such simple ones 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.110
 stripes but how do you see us on kyoto 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.520
 strikes and it turns out that she is so 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.130
 here they go like this 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.049
 bend so it's very cool i 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 looked on the internet deal similar here 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.369
 as if there is a scan in principle 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.040
 only say if there will be a paper 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.869
 Paints all will then do Alex without 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.619
 problems but do not know that's such here 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.780
 movably 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.759
 or it will be necessary to scan this all 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.630
 check on plain paper 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.530
 try to test everything 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.329
 perfect the following what am i 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.340
 going to make it shoot in her hands 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.409
 on paper minecraft I them 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.630
 very, very soon I will start releasing 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.640
 I will show beginners how to do 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.520
 paper minecraft the most simple figures 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.680
 let's say that's how much CIF will be later 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.780
 us in physics skeletons later 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.619
 moving figures then everything will all go 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.810
 in order 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.670
 and maybe we'll do it honestly 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.100
 saying i don't know myself doing it in 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.170
 In general, harit is unlikely to be cruel 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.770
 also make tools with newbies 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.239
 If you 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.890
 newbie you don't know offended let's say 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.349
 find there an elk tool fixed 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.120
 the figure will take it all together and 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.680
 I do not know how many lessons from you even 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.959
 week maybe one by one maybe 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.670
 two each, and just no more than two 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.260
 I think we can do it ourselves later 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.209
 make a skin find there is not only 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.560
 sealed and figurines to do and simple 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.569
 painted figures for those who 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.670
 interesting so here I want to introduce 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.799
 such a lesson very soon I think not 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.440
 I want to plan how not to know so pretty 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.030
 make such a small preview lost weight and 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.819
 telling yes so here I want 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.709
 do well what go to the third but 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.599
 and the next thing I want to take is advent 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.430
 Calendar for people who do not know this is a 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.410
 Christmas is sick Christmas 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.750
 calendar will tell all about it in 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.430
 Last year, many have done it, I 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.079
 somehow not interested in thinking 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.239
 man they all open there know 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.519
 cards but before the new year some 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.140
 after let out to think something is not all there 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.450
 do and then looked it up 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.730
 Advent calendar this mainly do 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.079
 strange that the catholic faith is 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.410
 it turns out that from December 1 to December 24 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.120
 It turns out right until Christmas go 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.250
 these are the types of houses you see with 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.799
 with numbers each number is like 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.450
 would the number there open come across something 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.609
 precipice dedicated to Christmas 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.100
 I also thought to make such a calendar too 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.290
 but I will make it closer to the new year then 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.880
 have it to be the new year they to 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.940
 Christmas because we have Christmas in 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.470
 January 7 basically all say so that 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.970
 do not celebrate us very much in Christmas 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.489
 mostly predominantly new year 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.769
 so there will be an advent calendar i think 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.819
 he will be feats like here are the numbers by 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.400
 The 31st of you will be from December 1 to December 31, 2015 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.950
 years he he will be dedicated to minkravt I 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.230
 I just haven't figured out how to do it 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.630
 his, that is, as if in the form of a house or 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.489
 printed printed printed it 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.040
 somehow see the picture there I do not know 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.019
 or horses from minecraft know 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.030
 how to make and all sorts of comor glasses to 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.040
 then I want to get there 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.660
 some do not know or related story 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.090
 or something like this new year mother 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.970
 graph that is something like that 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.459
 cool to do an advent calendar i want 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.919
 already now at the end of the summer she too 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.590
 well, the end of summer is almost here already 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.810
 August at the end of summer I think I will 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.350
 to do in two or three months because 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.390
 it is a lot of work even if 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.740
 street print then it still do 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.050
 sweeping on a computer is all 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.450
 very, very long time so I hope that 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.000
 I can do it at least until November 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.190
 so that then for a month I forget that there and 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.130
 then in December along with you every 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.320
 day to open it somehow match 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.750
 it still thinks to do and by 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.700
 make a markup like this 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.860
 some house church no markup 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.050
 such that let's say there was a wall yes 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.090
 there will be markup and will be by numbers 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.830
 All Capri spelled know to then and 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.050
 so some story was created may 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.250
 New Year's graph and see the clinic 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.300
 cartoon can be anything from 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.190
 this will be such 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.130
 after I think it will be very, very 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.410
 great guys here are my plans here 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.720
 for the future hoping they suit you 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.090
 your ideas can also go into these plans 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.010
 these are the very three main ideas were 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.370
 who want to translate into reality but 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.370
 that's all with you was Sasha and all bye
