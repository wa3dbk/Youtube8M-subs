00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
her one hand only one hand will hold the

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.240 
her one hand only one hand will hold the
width<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.410> other<00:02:04.530> hand<00:02:04.770> I'll<00:02:04.920> show<00:02:05.069> you<00:02:05.129> guys

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
width the other hand I'll show you guys

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.490 
width the other hand I'll show you guys
in<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.489> second<00:02:05.879> the<00:02:06.810> whip<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.229> be<00:02:07.319> a<00:02:07.349> little

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
in a second the whip can be a little

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.779 
in a second the whip can be a little
harder<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.860> get<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.160> there<00:02:08.310> because<00:02:08.429> it's

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
harder to get in there because it's

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.500 
harder to get in there because it's
rubbery<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.479> doesn't<00:02:10.110> have<00:02:10.289> as<00:02:10.470> much<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.770> a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
rubbery it doesn't have as much of a

rubbery it doesn't have as much of a
stability<00:02:12.510> sturdiness<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.430> can<00:02:14.550> see

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
stability sturdiness to it you can see

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.390 
stability sturdiness to it you can see
it<00:02:14.790> Catwoman<00:02:14.970> holds<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.720> width<00:02:15.930> very<00:02:16.349> well<00:02:16.680> as

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
it Catwoman holds the width very well as

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.979 
it Catwoman holds the width very well as
for<00:02:17.580> her<00:02:17.670> other<00:02:17.910> hand<00:02:18.120> her<00:02:18.239> other<00:02:18.420> hand<00:02:18.629> is<00:02:18.780> in

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
for her other hand her other hand is in

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.550 
for her other hand her other hand is in
a<00:02:19.080> claw<00:02:19.470> shape<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:21.019> no<00:02:22.019> you're<00:02:22.319> not<00:02:22.349> gonna<00:02:22.500> be

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
a claw shape so no you're not gonna be

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.040 
a claw shape so no you're not gonna be
able<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.769> display<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.220> whip<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.720> hand

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
able to display the whip in this hand

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.290 
able to display the whip in this hand
instead<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.069> good<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.550> clawing<00:02:26.820> Batman

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
instead this is good for clawing Batman

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.910 
instead this is good for clawing Batman
and<00:02:27.960> that's<00:02:28.110> me

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
and that's me

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.530 
and that's me
not<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.460> that's<00:02:29.760> what<00:02:29.940> I'm<00:02:30.000> gonna<00:02:30.090> be<00:02:30.240> doing

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
not that that's what I'm gonna be doing

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.940 
not that that's what I'm gonna be doing
but<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:31.650> you

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
but you know you

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.050 
but you know you
probably<00:02:32.190> have<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> hand<00:02:32.670> more<00:02:32.910> extended<00:02:33.569> out

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
probably have the hand more extended out

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.180 
probably have the hand more extended out
okay<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.980> as<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.160> goes<00:02:38.280> for<00:02:38.580> figures<00:02:40.190> normally

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
okay so as it goes for figures normally

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.500 
okay so as it goes for figures normally
normally<00:02:41.879> I<00:02:42.300> like<00:02:42.810> Catwoman<00:02:44.300> Harley<00:02:45.300> Quinn

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510

normally I like Catwoman Harley Quinn
I've<00:02:45.629> joked<00:02:45.840> before<00:02:46.019> it<00:02:46.920> seems<00:02:47.160> like<00:02:47.340> Harley

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
I've joked before it seems like Harley

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.220 
I've joked before it seems like Harley
Quinn<00:02:48.000> can<00:02:48.209> be<00:02:48.330> hit<00:02:48.540> or<00:02:48.569> miss<00:02:48.690> when<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.080> comes

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
Quinn can be hit or miss when it comes

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.259 
Quinn can be hit or miss when it comes
to<00:02:49.349> figures<00:02:49.620> generally<00:02:49.860> Catwoman<00:02:50.730> gets<00:02:51.060> off

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
to figures generally Catwoman gets off

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.050 
to figures generally Catwoman gets off
pretty<00:02:51.810> good<00:02:52.200> she's<00:02:53.010> not<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.519> much<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:53.849> an

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
pretty good she's not that much of an

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.729 
pretty good she's not that much of an
eyesore<00:02:54.480> when<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.810> comes<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.200> figures<00:02:55.530> from

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
eyesore when it comes to figures from

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.280 
eyesore when it comes to figures from
you<00:02:56.069> know<00:02:56.160> from<00:02:56.580> figure<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.120> figure<00:02:57.480> Catwoman

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
you know from figure to figure Catwoman

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.470 
you know from figure to figure Catwoman
I<00:02:58.380> think<00:02:58.680> has<00:02:59.069> a<00:02:59.130> higher<00:02:59.459> percentage<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.239> being

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
I think has a higher percentage of being

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.330 
I think has a higher percentage of being
better-looking<00:03:01.200> figures<00:03:01.590> than<00:03:02.069> say<00:03:02.310> the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
better-looking figures than say the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.589 
better-looking figures than say the
likes<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.819> Harley<00:03:03.209> Quinn<00:03:04.580> this<00:03:05.580> figure<00:03:06.060> even

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
likes of Harley Quinn this figure even

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.809 
likes of Harley Quinn this figure even
though<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:06.959> understand<00:03:07.620> its<00:03:07.830> depicted<00:03:08.370> from<00:03:08.670> a

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
though I understand its depicted from a

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.569 
though I understand its depicted from a
certain<00:03:09.150> design<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.049> from<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.709> comics<00:03:11.160> Greg

Capullo<00:03:11.730> has<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> certain<00:03:12.569> design<00:03:12.870> style<00:03:13.319> to<00:03:13.620> it

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
Capullo has a certain design style to it

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.380 
Capullo has a certain design style to it
and<00:03:13.829> while<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.010> really<00:03:14.340> like<00:03:14.610> his<00:03:14.760> design<00:03:15.060> style

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
and while I really like his design style

for mr. freeze Catwoman at least

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.789 
for mr. freeze Catwoman at least
translating<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.819> figure<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.690> don't<00:03:22.079> care

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
translating it to a figure I don't care

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.380 
translating it to a figure I don't care
for<00:03:22.829> this<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.400> don't<00:03:23.610> care<00:03:23.819> for<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:24.090> design<00:03:24.360> of

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
for this I don't care for the design of

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.509 
for this I don't care for the design of
this<00:03:24.630> figure<00:03:24.930> it's<00:03:25.620> not<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.890> say<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.220> his

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
this figure it's not to say that his

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.850 
this figure it's not to say that his
design<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.150> comics<00:03:27.599> warrant<00:03:27.870> wasn't<00:03:28.440> bad

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
design in the comics warrant wasn't bad

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.250 
design in the comics warrant wasn't bad
but<00:03:29.730> somehow<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.269> just<00:03:30.299> didn't<00:03:30.690> translate<00:03:30.930> I

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
but somehow it just didn't translate I

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.729 
but somehow it just didn't translate I
think<00:03:31.560> well<00:03:31.769> -<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> figure<00:03:32.780> may<00:03:33.780> be<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.140> culprit

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
think well - a figure may be the culprit

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.160 
think well - a figure may be the culprit
while<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.400> culprit<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:35.819> can<00:03:35.940> tell<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.180> right

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
while the culprit I can tell you right

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.280 
while the culprit I can tell you right
off<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.500> bat<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.829> culprit<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.489> face

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
off the bat the culprit is the face

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.809 
off the bat the culprit is the face
there's<00:03:40.290> something<00:03:40.829> about<00:03:41.040> her<00:03:41.160> face<00:03:41.489> well

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819

appreciate<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.639> color<00:03:53.819> of<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.239> eyes

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
appreciate the color of that the eyes

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.440 
appreciate the color of that the eyes
are<00:03:54.780> this<00:03:55.019> nice<00:03:55.319> kind<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.280> honeycomb<00:03:56.850> golden

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
are this nice kind of honeycomb golden

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.309 
are this nice kind of honeycomb golden
yellow<00:03:59.299> maybe<00:04:00.299> this<00:04:00.569> isn't<00:04:00.780> helping<00:04:01.139> either

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
yellow maybe this isn't helping either

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.900 
yellow maybe this isn't helping either
because<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:01.799> ends<00:04:02.010> up<00:04:02.069> kind<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.489> making<00:04:02.670> her

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
because it ends up kind of making her

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.860 
because it ends up kind of making her
look<00:04:03.120> like<00:04:03.329> a<00:04:03.359> fly<00:04:03.810> or<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.260> bug<00:04:05.450> this<00:04:06.450> if<00:04:06.750> this

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
look like a fly or a bug this if this

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.500 
look like a fly or a bug this if this
was<00:04:07.049> maybe<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.319> translucent<00:04:08.250> plastic<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:09.450> you

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
was maybe a translucent plastic that you

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.020 
was maybe a translucent plastic that you
could<00:04:09.720> have<00:04:09.840> seen<00:04:10.109> the<00:04:10.139> eyes<00:04:10.440> underneath

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
could have seen the eyes underneath

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.190 
could have seen the eyes underneath
maybe<00:04:12.030> if<00:04:12.180> they<00:04:12.299> had<00:04:12.329> been<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.690> same<00:04:12.900> color

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
maybe if they had been the same color

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.110 
maybe if they had been the same color
but<00:04:13.440> again<00:04:13.500> more<00:04:13.889> of<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:14.040> see-through<00:04:14.519> yellow

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
but again more of a see-through yellow

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.150 
but again more of a see-through yellow
seeing<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.169> eyes<00:04:16.260> underneath<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.829> think<00:04:17.039> would

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
seeing the eyes underneath I think would

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.460 
seeing the eyes underneath I think would
have<00:04:17.280> gone<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.430> long<00:04:17.700> way<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.299> instead<00:04:18.570> because

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
have gone a long way and instead because

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.830 
have gone a long way and instead because
it's<00:04:19.650> more<00:04:19.979> solid<00:04:20.760> in<00:04:21.090> color<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.570> again<00:04:21.690> I

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
it's more solid in color and again I

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.960 
it's more solid in color and again I
don't<00:04:21.989> know<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.860> material<00:04:23.039> in<00:04:23.580> which<00:04:23.700> the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
don't know the material in which the

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.150 
don't know the material in which the
figure<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.450> based<00:04:24.479> from<00:04:25.080> but<00:04:25.860> even<00:04:26.070> like

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
figure is based from but even like

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.830 
figure is based from but even like
basing<00:04:26.580> it<00:04:26.639> from<00:04:26.820> the<00:04:26.910> side<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.210> packaging

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
basing it from the side of the packaging

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.230 
basing it from the side of the packaging
you<00:04:28.020> could<00:04:28.410> see<00:04:28.560> her<00:04:28.710> eyes<00:04:28.860> this<00:04:29.250> figure<00:04:29.580> they

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
you could see her eyes this figure they

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.270 
you could see her eyes this figure they
just<00:04:30.419> ultimately<00:04:30.780> gave<00:04:30.990> her<00:04:31.200> solid<00:04:31.770> eyes<00:04:31.950> I

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
just ultimately gave her solid eyes I

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.730 
just ultimately gave her solid eyes I
find<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.210> just<00:04:33.360> doesn't<00:04:33.660> work<00:04:33.780> as<00:04:33.990> well<00:04:34.380> for

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
find it just doesn't work as well for

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.860 
find it just doesn't work as well for
the<00:04:34.800> figure<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.789> rest<00:04:35.970> of<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.210> bodysuit<00:04:36.539> is

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
the figure the rest of the bodysuit is

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.350 
the figure the rest of the bodysuit is
nice<00:04:37.080> just<00:04:37.979> a<00:04:38.070> little<00:04:38.310> harder<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.700> stand<00:04:39.060> and

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
nice just a little harder to stand and

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.000 
nice just a little harder to stand and
she<00:04:39.450> does<00:04:39.599> have<00:04:39.780> one<00:04:40.110> peg<00:04:40.409> hole<00:04:40.710> on<00:04:40.919> the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
she does have one peg hole on the

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.370 
she does have one peg hole on the
underside<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.460> our<00:04:41.669> foot<00:04:41.940> so<00:04:42.450> if<00:04:43.050> you<00:04:43.229> have

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
underside of our foot so if you have

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.860 
underside of our foot so if you have
extras<00:04:44.150> find<00:04:45.150> yourself<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.539> good

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
extras find yourself a good

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.110 
extras find yourself a good
placed<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.350> put<00:04:46.830> her<00:04:46.920> on<00:04:47.070> there<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.520> keep<00:04:47.910> it

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
placed and put her on there and keep it

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.600 
placed and put her on there and keep it
because<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.420> mean<00:04:48.600> I<00:04:49.280> balanced<00:04:50.280> her<00:04:50.400> well

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
because I mean I balanced her well

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.740 
because I mean I balanced her well
enough<00:04:50.820> at<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.000> beginning<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:51.480> review

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
enough at the beginning of this review

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.690 
enough at the beginning of this review
to<00:04:51.930> get<00:04:52.050> her<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.290> stand<00:04:52.530> properly<00:04:53.070> but<00:04:53.250> because

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
to get her to stand properly but because

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.970 
to get her to stand properly but because
she's<00:04:53.880> got<00:04:54.060> high-heeled<00:04:54.570> shoes<00:04:54.960> she<00:04:55.650> doesn't

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
she's got high-heeled shoes she doesn't

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.710 
she's got high-heeled shoes she doesn't
do<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.160> greatest<00:04:56.520> of<00:04:56.640> jobs<00:04:56.910> of<00:04:57.150> standing<00:04:57.600> on

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
do the greatest of jobs of standing on

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.000 
do the greatest of jobs of standing on
her<00:04:57.810> own<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.050> rest<00:04:58.200> of<00:04:58.290> her<00:04:58.380> body<00:04:58.680> is

basically all black the only thing that

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.230 
basically all black the only thing that
really<00:05:01.440> breaks<00:05:01.830> up<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.190> east<00:05:02.370> suit<00:05:02.670> is<00:05:02.910> the

ends of the straps of a boots which is
also<00:05:11.670> silver<00:05:11.970> but<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.330> rest<00:05:12.510> of<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:12.660> body<00:05:12.900> is

all black it's nothing really breaking
it<00:05:16.050> out<00:05:16.140> but<00:05:16.290> normally<00:05:16.560> that's<00:05:16.710> not<00:05:16.860> really<00:05:17.250> so

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
it out but normally that's not really so

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.580 
it out but normally that's not really so
much<00:05:17.460> of<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.640> problem<00:05:17.670> for<00:05:18.060> me<00:05:18.240> if<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:19.080> face<00:05:19.110> had

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
much of a problem for me if the face had

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.020 
much of a problem for me if the face had
been<00:05:19.740> just<00:05:19.950> a<00:05:20.100> little<00:05:20.430> bit<00:05:20.610> better

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
been just a little bit better

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.500 
been just a little bit better
I<00:05:21.350> liked<00:05:22.350> the<00:05:22.470> sculpt<00:05:22.800> on<00:05:22.890> the<00:05:23.010> boots<00:05:23.510> they're

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
I liked the sculpt on the boots they're

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.630 
I liked the sculpt on the boots they're
pre<00:05:24.840> posed<00:05:25.170> in<00:05:25.710> other<00:05:25.830> words<00:05:26.040> you<00:05:26.310> can't

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
pre posed in other words you can't

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.610 
pre posed in other words you can't
manipulate<00:05:26.970> the<00:05:27.480> feet<00:05:27.750> individually<00:05:28.410> you<00:05:28.530> can

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
manipulate the feet individually you can

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.190 
manipulate the feet individually you can
rotate<00:05:28.830> at<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.190> boots<00:05:29.520> sure<00:05:29.910> enough<00:05:30.180> but<00:05:31.110> you

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
rotate at the boots sure enough but you

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.050 
rotate at the boots sure enough but you
can't<00:05:31.380> do<00:05:31.530> anything<00:05:31.560> with<00:05:32.280> the<00:05:32.430> feet<00:05:32.760> I<00:05:32.790> feel

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
like this is us figure strong enough

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.800 
like this is us figure strong enough
that<00:06:49.440> you<00:06:49.530> would<00:06:49.650> want<00:06:49.830> to<00:06:49.860> pick<00:06:50.070> her<00:06:50.250> up<00:06:50.280> again

that you would want to pick her up again

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.840 
that you would want to pick her up again
unless<00:06:51.810> you<00:06:52.020> really<00:06:52.350> like<00:06:52.740> Catwoman

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 
unless you really like Catwoman

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.680 
unless you really like Catwoman
I<00:06:53.880> think<00:06:54.750> the<00:06:55.350> bodysuit<00:06:55.860> as<00:06:56.340> vacant<00:06:57.270> as<00:06:57.420> it<00:06:57.570> is

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
I think the bodysuit as vacant as it is

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.600 
I think the bodysuit as vacant as it is
of<00:06:57.840> detail<00:06:58.260> it's<00:06:58.560> on<00:06:58.860> par<00:06:59.190> with<00:06:59.220> what

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
of detail it's on par with what

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.969 
of detail it's on par with what
you<00:06:59.669> would<00:06:59.819> get<00:06:59.969> from<00:07:00.150> a<00:07:00.270> cat<00:07:00.479> woman<00:07:00.800> it's<00:07:01.800> just

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 
you would get from a cat woman it's just

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:03.379 
you would get from a cat woman it's just
something<00:07:02.280> about<00:07:02.340> the<00:07:02.550> face<00:07:02.759> I'm<00:07:03.000> just<00:07:03.210> not

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:03.389 
something about the face I'm just not

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.040 
something about the face I'm just not
crazy

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
crazy

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.869 
crazy
and<00:07:04.409> I<00:07:04.560> think<00:07:04.770> the<00:07:04.889> culprit<00:07:05.129> really<00:07:05.430> boils

00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:05.879 
and I think the culprit really boils

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:07.399 
and I think the culprit really boils
down<00:07:05.939> to<00:07:06.240> the<00:07:06.419> goggles<00:07:06.870> if<00:07:07.050> not<00:07:07.199> for<00:07:07.349> the

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:07.409 
down to the goggles if not for the

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:09.409 
down to the goggles if not for the
goggles<00:07:07.800> I<00:07:08.009> think<00:07:08.550> the<00:07:08.639> figure<00:07:08.909> could<00:07:09.180> have

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419 
goggles I think the figure could have

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.629 
goggles I think the figure could have
potential<00:07:10.080> sadly<00:07:10.919> though<00:07:11.069> it's<00:07:11.250> not<00:07:11.370> a<00:07:11.400> figure

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 
potential sadly though it's not a figure

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.189 
potential sadly though it's not a figure
I<00:07:11.699> think<00:07:11.969> I<00:07:12.060> would<00:07:12.210> say<00:07:12.419> it's<00:07:12.719> worth<00:07:12.900> picking

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 
I think I would say it's worth picking

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:13.929 
I think I would say it's worth picking
