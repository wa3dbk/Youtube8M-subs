 o to a great title with someone told 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.989
 said but to defend what I do not put 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.580
 not everyone nor your talent as a writer 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.049

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.640

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.640
 participated in a co writing novel that 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.200
 was called the red house but that's it 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.119
 would be my first one alone so that's 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.100
 the first step then died in perpetuity 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.130
