00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.310
 the aper we report from who threaded in the morning moment 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:13.450
 at the 26 Spohn February in the year 2009 Dr. Volker Haxen there inherited times 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:18.240
 German premiere and events on skis and there are some flying 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.689
 Odenwald Baris can be appreciated 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.150
 - for a crater and a snow cave 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.760
 estimated around 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.699
 well between 13 and 21 inches 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.780
 Doctor WHO of the files varies after an hour and 50 minutes on the skis 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.000
 she nibbles 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.030
 he still lives and i just want to ask him how true i am to this day 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.030
 Offenders do not easily fall sharply 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 that's a lot of work for a technique 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.630
 with pole insert even without a pole a place 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.930
 Hannah Kinney Olof the cure now he's going to the World Cup on the spot and again 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.130
 here 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.180
 for the galleries 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.120
 Lie down a little sprint 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.410
 but the most important thing is that he demonstrates the small ride sound 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.700
 look in Ahlen 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.050
 highest concentration 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.050
 without sticks 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.890
 the debts go along nicely 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.890
 Schalke at the same time for Greece 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.290
 and now we take the pieces like the "media a few 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.899
 the Madrid bank very pronounced resembles feelings 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.770
 he comes over beautiful foot ball 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.370
 to contact 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.800
 to grow on the ski 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.000
 now he is turning 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.779
 to demonstrate that 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:11.779
 in a light 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:17.309
 Forward movement terrain adjusted down 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.479
 wonderful 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:26.159
 basically the body weight of a ski 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.159
 on the thickest shifted without sticks 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.939
 you can not see that is a pronounced sensibility 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.279
 to master the ski 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.279
 After all, that's also a practical one 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.519
 if now the 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.519
 wonderful the floor driveway 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.669
 come later 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.669
 Say, give up the hand to the back 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.449
 then everything would be perfect 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.449
 I bow to the great achievements 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:01.729
 After all, one must keep in mind that I can hardly believe that first time editions of 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.639
 to design many 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.359
 thanks to national coach 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.359
 the power plant becomes percent a Lauterbach 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.439
 So far, Chapeau Claque Steinbach 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.559
 Gold Balve 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:16.099
 PrÃ¶ll we will continue this twice this year next year 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.340
 tackle a big 2009 exam in 2010 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.750
 until then
