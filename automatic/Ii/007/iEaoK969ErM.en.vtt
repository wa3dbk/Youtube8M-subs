okay today I'm looking at making some

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.110 
okay today I'm looking at making some
pierogies<00:00:07.260> these<00:00:08.220> are<00:00:08.400> already<00:00:08.490> pre-made

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
pierogies these are already pre-made

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.209 
pierogies these are already pre-made
they're<00:00:09.420> frozen<00:00:09.720> just<00:00:10.139> 500<00:00:10.559> grams<00:00:10.799> it<00:00:11.129> is

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
they're frozen just 500 grams it is

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.360 
they're frozen just 500 grams it is
approximately<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.849> pound<00:00:11.879> of<00:00:12.269> them<00:00:13.219> first<00:00:14.219> of

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
approximately a pound of them first of

approximately a pound of them first of
all<00:00:14.490> I've<00:00:14.669> got<00:00:14.759> my<00:00:14.910> kettle<00:00:15.269> here<00:00:15.950> and<00:00:16.950> I've<00:00:17.130> got

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
all I've got my kettle here and I've got

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.910 
all I've got my kettle here and I've got
about<00:00:17.900> with<00:00:18.900> half<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> liter<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.529> water<00:00:19.619> in

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
about with half a liter of water in

I'm going to turn that on to preheat
boil<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.090> water<00:00:24.170> in<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.470> meantime<00:00:25.679> I<00:00:25.920> have

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
boil this water in the meantime I have

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.310 
boil this water in the meantime I have
some<00:00:26.580> water<00:00:26.759> in<00:00:27.060> my<00:00:27.589> pot<00:00:28.589> here<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> prevent

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
some water in my pot here so to prevent

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.130 
some water in my pot here so to prevent
the<00:00:31.410> corrosion<00:00:31.619> from<00:00:32.040> sticking<00:00:32.720> I'm<00:00:33.720> going<00:00:34.050> to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the corrosion from sticking I'm going to

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.820 
the corrosion from sticking I'm going to
put<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.470> a<00:00:34.590> couple<00:00:35.840> grinds<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:37.110> salt<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.740> I'm

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 
put in a couple grinds of salt and I'm

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.660 
put in a couple grinds of salt and I'm
going<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.010> add<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> little<00:00:38.370> bit<00:00:38.580> of<00:00:38.670> cooking<00:00:38.880> oil

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.950 

I'm<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:44.880> to<00:00:44.940> take<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.600> put<00:00:45.630> it<00:00:45.840> over

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
I'm going to take this and put it over

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.940 
I'm going to take this and put it over
on<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> stove<00:00:46.650> and<00:00:46.950> get<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.370> water<00:00:47.640> eating

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
on the stove and get this water eating

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.170 
on the stove and get this water eating
all<00:00:49.950> right<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.220> I<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.400> my<00:00:50.460> boiling<00:00:50.940> water

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
all right so I have my boiling water

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.700 
all right so I have my boiling water
just<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.810> mix<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:52.110> same<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.470> Mother

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
just going to mix the same as Mother

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.240 
just going to mix the same as Mother
water<00:00:53.250> that's<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.790> stove<00:00:54.650> altogether<00:00:55.650> for

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
water that's on the stove altogether for

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.010 
water that's on the stove altogether for
500<00:00:56.760> grams<00:00:56.970> of<00:00:57.150> grow<00:00:57.390> geese<00:00:57.600> you're<00:00:57.870> only

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
500 grams of grow geese you're only

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.340 
500 grams of grow geese you're only
going<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.290> look<00:00:58.410> at<00:00:59.900> approximately<00:01:00.900> no<00:01:01.140> more

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
going to look at approximately no more

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.260 
going to look at approximately no more
than<00:01:01.470> a<00:01:01.500> liter<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.830> water<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:02.970> I<00:01:03.030> do<00:01:03.150> is

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
than a liter of water so what I do is

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.520 
than a liter of water so what I do is
just<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> let<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.780> water<00:01:04.019> heat<00:01:04.260> up<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
just going to let this water heat up a

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950 
just going to let this water heat up a
bit<00:01:04.640> get<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> boiling<00:01:06.330> point<00:01:06.420> before<00:01:06.750> I

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
bit get to the boiling point before I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.880 
bit get to the boiling point before I
put<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.289> probe's<00:01:07.679> in<00:01:07.859> our<00:01:08.189> water<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:09.030> is

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
put the probe's in our water here is

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
put the probe's in our water here is
starting<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> boil<00:01:11.630> just<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.719> very<00:01:12.960> careful

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
starting to boil just be very careful

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.130 
starting to boil just be very careful
when<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.859> get<00:01:14.009> your<00:01:14.159> proteins<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:15.140> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
when you get your proteins in here you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.880 
when you get your proteins in here you
don't<00:01:16.289> want<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.469> lot<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.649> splash

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
don't want a lot of splash

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.990 
don't want a lot of splash
once<00:01:19.890> these<00:01:20.070> are<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.369> here<00:01:20.609> when<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> main

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
once these are in here when the main

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700 
once these are in here when the main
issues<00:01:21.390> even<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> oil<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.259> salt<00:01:22.530> air

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
issues even with the oil in the salt air

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.130 
issues even with the oil in the salt air
you<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.039> have<00:01:23.219> to<00:01:23.310> worry<00:01:23.460> about<00:01:23.579> sticking<00:01:24.140> I've

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
you do have to worry about sticking I've

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.240 
you do have to worry about sticking I've
got<00:01:25.289> to<00:01:25.380> probably<00:01:25.679> stick<00:01:25.859> it<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.039> the<00:01:26.130> bottom

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
got to probably stick it to the bottom

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.529 
got to probably stick it to the bottom
because<00:01:26.429> it<00:01:26.609> can<00:01:26.729> make<00:01:26.819> a<00:01:26.909> mess<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.359> have<00:01:27.509> a

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
because it can make a mess so I have a

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.139 
because it can make a mess so I have a
spoon<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:29.039> don't<00:01:29.460> use<00:01:29.609> a<00:01:29.640> fork<00:01:29.969> because

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
spoon here I don't use a fork because

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.819 
spoon here I don't use a fork because
you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.479> poke<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.899> pierogies<00:01:31.319> once<00:01:31.590> they

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you can poke the pierogies once they

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.380 
you can poke the pierogies once they
soften<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.600> basically<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:34.110> want<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
soften up and you basically just want to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.630 
soften up and you basically just want to
gently<00:01:36.390> lift<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.929> pierogies<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.009> this

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
gently lift the pierogies up and this

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.249 
gently lift the pierogies up and this
will<00:01:38.819> help<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.179> that<00:01:39.360> little<00:01:39.659> coating<00:01:40.079> on

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
will help get that little coating on

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.639 
will help get that little coating on
them<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.579> prevent<00:01:41.579> them<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.759> from<00:01:42.390> being

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
them and prevent them to from being

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.770 
them and prevent them to from being
sticking<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> bone<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:45.149> put<00:01:45.539> the<00:01:45.630> cover

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
sticking to the bone and put the cover

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.620 
sticking to the bone and put the cover
on<00:01:45.929> here<00:01:46.319> and<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.880> stir<00:01:48.149> these<00:01:48.329> every

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
on here and then I stir these every

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.510 
on here and then I stir these every
couple<00:01:48.929> minutes<00:01:49.229> until<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:50.130> temperature

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
couple minutes until the temperature

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.059 
couple minutes until the temperature
gets<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.819> to<00:01:50.939> boiling<00:01:51.590> once<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.739> gets<00:01:52.890> up<00:01:53.009> to

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
gets up to boiling once it gets up to

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:54.889 
gets up to boiling once it gets up to
boiling<00:01:53.549> we'll<00:01:54.030> come<00:01:54.209> back<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.569> take<00:01:54.689> them

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
boiling we'll come back and take them

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380 
boiling we'll come back and take them
out<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.439> meantime<00:01:55.880> I'm<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.060> preheat

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
out in the meantime I'm going to preheat
