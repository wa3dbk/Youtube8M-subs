00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
you'll make a new project and we make a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.330

window<00:00:20.699> based<00:00:20.880> applications<00:00:21.119> will<00:00:21.810> name<00:00:21.990> it

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
window based applications will name it

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.160 
window based applications will name it
first<00:00:23.340> because<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.210> first<00:00:24.539> video<00:00:24.990> so

quickly save this and we say build and

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.310 
quickly save this and we say build and
run<00:05:21.980> should<00:05:22.730> not<00:05:22.880> get<00:05:23.060> any<00:05:23.270> errors<00:05:23.600> hopefully

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
run should not get any errors hopefully

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:33.040

so go to page two and we go to the page

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.660 
so go to page two and we go to the page
two<00:05:36.320> when<00:05:36.620> I<00:05:36.740> click<00:05:36.800> here<00:05:37.130> go<00:05:37.250> to<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.460> main

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
two when I click here go to the main

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.250 
two when I click here go to the main
page<00:05:37.700> come<00:05:38.660> back<00:05:38.810> here<00:05:39.280> so<00:05:40.280> we<00:05:40.460> can<00:05:40.990> by<00:05:41.990> using

page come back here so we can by using

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.700 
page come back here so we can by using
this<00:05:42.500> we<00:05:42.710> can<00:05:42.740> add<00:05:43.010> multiple<00:05:43.970> pages<00:05:44.540> but<00:05:45.530> this

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
this we can add multiple pages but this

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.790 
this we can add multiple pages but this
was<00:05:45.860> just<00:05:45.890> my<00:05:46.190> first<00:05:46.220> video<00:05:47.090> tutorial<00:05:47.810> so<00:05:48.410> this
