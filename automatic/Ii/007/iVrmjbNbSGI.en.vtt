what<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.259> mean<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.470> mean<00:01:52.649> there's<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.860> lot<00:01:52.890> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
what I mean I mean there's a lot of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.649 
what I mean I mean there's a lot of
snipers<00:01:53.549> out<00:01:53.670> there<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.149> don't<00:01:54.270> play

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
snipers out there that don't play

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.980 
snipers out there that don't play
competitively<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.680> because<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> deuce<00:01:56.159> night

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
competitively just because a deuce night

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.209 
competitively just because a deuce night
and<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.229> only<00:01:58.409> problem<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.189> that

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
and the only problem with that is that

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.980 
and the only problem with that is that
they've<00:01:59.579> never<00:01:59.969> maxed<00:02:00.450> out<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.689> their<00:02:00.810> full

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
they've never maxed out to their full

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.420 
they've never maxed out to their full
potential<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.500> my<00:02:01.590> opinion<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.040> what<00:02:02.250> they<00:02:02.399> can

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
potential in my opinion on what they can

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.510 
potential in my opinion on what they can
and<00:02:02.759> can't<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> think<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.280> would<00:02:05.369> be

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
and can't do so I think it would be

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.330 
and can't do so I think it would be
amazing<00:02:06.240> for<00:02:06.899> those<00:02:07.049> guys<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.920> able<00:02:08.099> to
