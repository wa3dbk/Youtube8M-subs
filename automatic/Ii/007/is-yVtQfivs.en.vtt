I<00:02:21.690> wanted<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.260> paper<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.800> show<00:02:23.070> off<00:02:23.310> little

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
I wanted the paper to show off little

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.620 
I wanted the paper to show off little
bit<00:02:24.060> from<00:02:24.330> below<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.770> just<00:02:26.100> use<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.700> couple<00:02:27.480> of

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
bit from below so I just use a couple of

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.120 
bit from below so I just use a couple of
layers<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.760> paint<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:30.410> go<00:02:31.410> through<00:02:31.650> over<00:02:31.980> it

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
layers of paint to go through over it

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.280 
layers of paint to go through over it
and<00:02:32.460> that's<00:02:32.970> how<00:02:33.420> i<00:02:33.450> got<00:02:33.630> my<00:02:34.140> base<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.770> then<00:02:35.520> i

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
and that's how i got my base and then i

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.440 
and that's how i got my base and then i
use<00:02:37.290> my<00:02:37.530> gelly<00:02:37.770> roll<00:02:37.890> pen<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.820> love<00:02:39.030> them<00:02:39.270> now

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
because they practically walk on all

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.170 
because they practically walk on all
surfaces<00:02:43.170> as<00:02:43.860> long<00:02:44.100> as<00:02:44.310> your<00:02:44.460> paint<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.850> dry

this<00:03:04.890> design<00:03:05.720> using<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:07.050> jelly<00:03:07.230> roll<00:03:07.440> pan<00:03:07.730> gel

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
this design using the jelly roll pan gel

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.330 
this design using the jelly roll pan gel
pens<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.840> black<00:03:10.080> pin<00:03:10.530> then<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:13.160> went<00:03:14.160> through

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
pens the black pin then I went through

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.430 
pens the black pin then I went through
wood<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:14.910> colored<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.720> inside<00:03:16.350> with<00:03:16.830> a

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
wood and colored it inside with a

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.260 
wood and colored it inside with a
outline<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.620> with<00:03:19.770> black<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.459> then<00:03:20.580> color<00:03:20.910> is

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
outline is with black and then color is

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.610 
outline is with black and then color is
with<00:03:21.770> golden<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.090> then<00:03:24.090> I<00:03:24.480> gave<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.470> little

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
with golden and then I gave it a little

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.780 
with golden and then I gave it a little
dimension<00:03:26.160> because<00:03:27.500> I've<00:03:28.500> wanted<00:03:29.070> some<00:03:29.370> glass

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
dimension because I've wanted some glass

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.930 
dimension because I've wanted some glass
kind<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.420> effects<00:03:30.990> so<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.440> gave<00:03:31.830> it<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.280> dimension

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940
