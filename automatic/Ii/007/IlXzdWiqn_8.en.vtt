three strand braid you want to pieces
are<00:03:12.600> two<00:03:12.810> sections<00:03:13.019> of<00:03:13.380> hair<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.980> then<00:03:14.220> you

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
are two sections of hair and then you

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.849 
are two sections of hair and then you
want<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.549> begin<00:03:14.700> with<00:03:14.970> 1<00:03:15.299> section<00:03:15.780> just<00:03:16.530> very

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
want to begin with 1 section just very

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.309 
want to begin with 1 section just very
small<00:03:17.269> sections<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.660> want<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.930> go<00:03:19.019> ahead<00:03:19.079> and

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
small sections you want to go ahead and

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.250 
small sections you want to go ahead and
note<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.530> inner<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.670> sections<00:03:21.359> of<00:03:21.569> hair<00:03:21.600> the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
note the inner the sections of hair the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.070 
note the inner the sections of hair the
more<00:03:22.440> notice

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
more notice

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.250 
more notice
well<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.500> fish<00:03:23.770> tail<00:03:24.430> braid<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.540> going<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.080> be

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
well the fish tail braid is going to be

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.240 
well the fish tail braid is going to be
and<00:03:26.500> it's<00:03:26.590> going<00:03:26.710> to<00:03:26.770> look<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.070> lot<00:03:27.190> more

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
and it's going to look a lot more

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.820 
and it's going to look a lot more
elaborate<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.420> more<00:03:28.600> thicker<00:03:28.900> sections<00:03:29.200> it's

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
elaborate to more thicker sections it's

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.580 
elaborate to more thicker sections it's
going<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.220> just<00:03:30.610> kind<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.030> formulate<00:03:31.720> into<00:03:32.320> a

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
going to just kind of formulate into a

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.610 
going to just kind of formulate into a
more<00:03:33.310> normal<00:03:34.120> type<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.960> raid<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.410> it's<00:03:35.530> going

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
more normal type of raid and it's going

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.020 
more normal type of raid and it's going
to<00:03:35.680> be<00:03:35.830> more<00:03:35.980> hard<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.400> see<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.730> little<00:03:36.910> pieces

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
to be more hard to see the little pieces

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.960 
to be more hard to see the little pieces
I<00:03:37.810> like<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.110> kind<00:03:38.380> of<00:03:38.500> work<00:03:38.860> with<00:03:38.920> pieces<00:03:39.670> that

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
I like to kind of work with pieces that

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.000 
I like to kind of work with pieces that
are<00:03:40.090> kind<00:03:40.300> of<00:03:40.360> in<00:03:40.540> between<00:03:40.690> so<00:03:41.440> probably<00:03:41.920> about

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
are kind of in between so probably about

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.740 
are kind of in between so probably about
like<00:03:42.100> a<00:03:42.220> quarter<00:03:42.580> inch<00:03:42.820> thick<00:03:43.240> and<00:03:43.450> then<00:03:43.660> you

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
like a quarter inch thick and then you

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.450 
like a quarter inch thick and then you
want<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.020> begin<00:03:44.110> by<00:03:44.260> taking<00:03:44.470> one<00:03:44.860> here<00:03:45.190> is

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
want to begin by taking one here is

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.770 
want to begin by taking one here is
going<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:45.790> take<00:03:45.970> one<00:03:46.180> here<00:03:46.360> from<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.600> right

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
going to take one here from the right

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.080 
going to take one here from the right
side<00:03:47.050> put<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:47.650> over<00:03:47.800> and<00:03:48.490> move<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.820> to<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.060> left

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
side put it over and move it to the left

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.300 
side put it over and move it to the left
side<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:49.960> go<00:03:50.290> ahead<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.620> do<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.830> same<00:03:51.040> thing

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
side and go ahead and do the same thing

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.800 
side and go ahead and do the same thing
with<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.520> other<00:03:51.550> side<00:03:51.820> take<00:03:52.210> a<00:03:52.330> section<00:03:52.540> from

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
with the other side take a section from

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.720 
with the other side take a section from
the<00:03:52.900> left<00:03:53.200> here<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.740> take<00:03:54.100> it<00:03:54.220> over<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.580> the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
the left here and take it over to the

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.730 
the left here and take it over to the
right<00:03:54.970> side<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.540> while<00:03:55.810> I'm<00:03:55.990> doing<00:03:56.020> this<00:03:56.410> each

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
right side and while I'm doing this each

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.890 
right side and while I'm doing this each
time<00:03:56.770> I'm<00:03:57.430> just<00:03:57.490> kind<00:03:57.820> of<00:03:58.060> wing<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.570> strand

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
time I'm just kind of wing the strand

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.620 
time I'm just kind of wing the strand
from<00:03:59.350> both<00:03:59.680> sides<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:00.760> kind<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.060> gets<00:04:01.180> tight

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
from both sides so it kind of gets tight

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.740 
from both sides so it kind of gets tight
in<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.170> middle<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:03.100> sides<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:04.000> your<00:04:04.060> hair<00:04:04.420> I

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
in the middle the sides of your hair I

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.170 
in the middle the sides of your hair I
don't<00:04:05.080> like<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.410> so<00:04:05.620> structured<00:04:06.490> I<00:04:06.760> like<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.090> a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
don't like it so structured I like it a

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.120 
don't like it so structured I like it a
little<00:04:07.270> bit<00:04:07.450> more<00:04:07.630> messy<00:04:07.810> so<00:04:08.530> that's<00:04:08.709> why<00:04:08.980> I'm

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
little bit more messy so that's why I'm

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.580 
little bit more messy so that's why I'm
not<00:04:09.370> really<00:04:09.730> using<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.330> comb<00:04:10.600> or<00:04:10.780> anything<00:04:11.320> if

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
not really using a comb or anything if

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.410

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
and not so messy as mine is you can take

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.720 
and not so messy as mine is you can take
a<00:04:16.359> comb<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:17.019> comb<00:04:17.080> through<00:04:17.620> each<00:04:17.799> strand<00:04:18.250> add

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
a comb and comb through each strand add
