out<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.959> country<00:02:28.350> if<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.620> pushed<00:02:28.890> it

out in the country if you just pushed it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.770 
out in the country if you just pushed it
up<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.400> went<00:02:29.580> into<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.910> into<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.510> fourth

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.940 
up and it went into the into the fourth
here<00:02:31.680> oh<00:02:31.950> no<00:02:32.459> it's<00:02:32.880> too<00:02:33.120> many<00:02:33.300> people<00:02:33.660> that

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
here oh no it's too many people that

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.380 
here oh no it's too many people that
constantly<00:02:34.950> use<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.490> this<00:02:35.820> range<00:02:36.150> here

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
constantly use this this range here

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.229 
constantly use this this range here
however<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.370> available<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.090> I

however it is it is available and I

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:49.750 
however it is it is available and I
guess<00:02:39.570> we<00:02:39.810> shoot<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.080> certain<00:02:40.560> extent

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.520 
if you pull the gearshift lever forward
slightly<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.640> down<00:02:59.640> one<00:03:00.060> you're<00:03:00.569> in<00:03:00.780> low<00:03:01.260> gear

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
slightly and down one you're in low gear

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.839 
slightly and down one you're in low gear
the<00:03:02.370> low<00:03:02.640> gear<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:04.260> designation<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.340> sort<00:03:05.819> of

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
the low gear the designation is sort of

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.960 
the low gear the designation is sort of
a<00:03:05.970> misnomer<00:03:06.150> here<00:03:06.720> because<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.379> actually

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
a misnomer here because it actually

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.690 
a misnomer here because it actually
starts<00:03:08.970> off<00:03:09.209> in<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.569> second<00:03:10.080> gear<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:11.430> first

starts off in the second gear the first
years<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.420> guess<00:03:13.260> considered<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.769> bit<00:03:13.950> Torquay

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
years I guess considered a bit Torquay

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.070 
years I guess considered a bit Torquay
and<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.890> literature<00:03:17.190> states<00:03:17.550> that<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:18.080> allows

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
and the literature states that it allows

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.039 
and the literature states that it allows
you<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:20.750> pull<00:03:21.750> out<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:22.019> sand<00:03:22.319> or<00:03:22.680> snow<00:03:24.049> without

locking gear in there which locks the
transmission<00:04:07.530> huh<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.730> keeps<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.720> car<00:04:09.750> from

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
transmission huh and keeps the car from

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.729 
transmission huh and keeps the car from
rolling<00:04:10.319> sort<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.420> like<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.660> park<00:04:13.290> which<00:04:13.560> is

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
rolling sort of like a park which is

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.729 
rolling sort of like a park which is
exactly<00:04:14.549> what<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.880> is<00:04:14.910> this<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:15.870> before<00:04:16.019> they

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
exactly what it is this is before they

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.020 
exactly what it is this is before they
added<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:18.229> parking<00:04:19.229> gear<00:04:19.530> which<00:04:20.220> was<00:04:20.549> usually

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
added the parking gear which was usually

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.659 
added the parking gear which was usually
all<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.359> way<00:04:21.539> up<00:04:21.660> at<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.840> top<00:04:22.580> to<00:04:23.580> the

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
all the way up at the top to the

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.100 
all the way up at the top to the
hydra-matic<00:04:23.970> transmission<00:04:24.780> I<00:04:24.840> think<00:04:25.020> they

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
hydra-matic transmission I think they

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.490 
hydra-matic transmission I think they
did<00:04:25.289> that<00:04:25.320> in<00:04:25.500> 1956

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.560
