00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.029
 very purist and I welcome the 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.090
 temple of time we are facing the eighth 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.950
 music mont de zelda in commemoration by 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.620
 the release of the remake in more ways 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.560
 for 3ds the theme of this monthly monday 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.860
 is dedicated to that game I will teach you 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.309
 three remixed songs of the game that 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.169
 my opinion are of the best as you know 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:30.640
 the songs you will have in the 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.640
 description we find 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.100
 first we go with a song from which 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.270
 I will never tire of saying that he is very 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.950
 undervalued is the issue of 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.310
 palace with a song that to me 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.340
 I personally love and esther enix 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.410
 you 're listening is great leandro 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.300
 very very good additional and some 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.150
 instruments added and they really have 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.570
 all right 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.570
 Hello 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520
 ah 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.130
 and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.130
 down 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 do not 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.060
 as it could not be otherwise the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.810
 healing song can not miss in 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.239
 this list is there if we do sad remixes 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.700
 the same time as the cost 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.459
 today that gives a touch something 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.540
 different to the original song and to me 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.540
 love the result 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.780
 Y 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.400
 I wanted to leave it better for the final 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.770
 so that only those true fans 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.300
 of this section have the pleasure of 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.830
 enjoy such an awesome theme 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.470
 the original grace of the temple of the 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.550
 Stone tower is good in itself but 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:04.300
 this remix in folk version is 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.910
 simply incredible is a shame 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.270
 that is so short because of listening 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.880
 for hours personally this song 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.830
 would fit perfectly in my top 10 of 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.239
 best remixed songs that I've 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.849
 ever heard 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.109
 Enjoy feder or enjoy sight 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.509
 wonder 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.539
 we are in the next video here in the 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:29.380
 temple of time that the triforza os 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.380
 accompany 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.340
 all right
