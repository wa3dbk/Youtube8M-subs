 [Music] 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.189
 We are very proud to have achieved 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.139
 this agreement basically for nexus is 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.250
 a very important qualitative leap 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.119
 first force us to a club like river 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.800
 that with so much history tradition titles 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.470
 that followed by millions of fans in 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.970
 the whole country and second also that we 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.070
 will allow us to know a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.570
 most important way as a brand and 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.370
 also contribute to the club and in this 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.829
 change process 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.719
 and something very important that is the subject of 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.159
 and give a service to the fans in 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.769
 all the country arriving with the products 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:41.769
 from river to where they can have 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:44.500
 access the sponsorship agreement is for 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.929
 two and a half years the store will be in 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.320
 principle for four years but we aim 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:52.299
 to be the strategic partners in 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.680
 eating for much longer by 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.090
 last asked why an alliance 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.950
 monumental 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.900
 being here in this museum with so much 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.960
 history so many Olympic laps 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.790
 and monumental achievements for us is 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.050
 a monumental achievement the fact of being 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.050
 here on river 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.429
 It is a company that also raises a lot 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.259
 everything that has to do with trade 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.810
 electronic and eat we are going to 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.880
 set up a virtual store where everyone 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.759
 river fans have access to 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.689
 buy the shirt and sometimes it's not 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.399
 difficulty with which we have 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.709
 found several of us for 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.869
 get a local and have it is a way 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.429
 to democratize access up 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.229
 shirts we love so much our 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.200
 sacred mantle and obviously the theme of 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.479
 the sleeves is not a record contract for 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.850
 fruit of the Argentine with which we are 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.170
 very very very happy us as 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.909
 policy we want to get closer to the fan 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.049
 that is not very close we want to tell you 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.819
 everything we do has to do with the 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.409
 transparency also so that all 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.209
 know that what we do and where 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.789
 we go with our vision that what 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:54.320
 we propose and this staging I think 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.170
 what it has to do with that 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.640
 having reached this agreement with a 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.530
 global company d 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.100
 recognized throughout the sector 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.560
 to have 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.050
 it feels 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.440
 take a step below what we are 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.220
 having to do with them 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.220
 our shirt 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.870

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.300

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.900
 [Music] 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.060

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.750

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.270
