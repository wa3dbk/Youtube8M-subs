00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
so then I just got that big hard drive

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.499 
so then I just got that big hard drive
for<00:01:21.210> fucking<00:01:21.570> nothing<00:01:21.810> basically<00:01:23.210> but<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.390> you

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
for fucking nothing basically but if you

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.889 
for fucking nothing basically but if you
plug<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> regular<00:01:25.470> one

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.740 

the<00:01:29.590> home<00:01:29.770> flashes<00:01:30.670> and<00:01:30.909> then<00:01:31.119> it<00:01:31.299> don't<00:01:31.420> flash

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
the home flashes and then it don't flash

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.300 
the home flashes and then it don't flash
it<00:01:31.990> just<00:01:32.170> stays<00:01:32.380> red<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:35.220> as<00:01:36.220> you<00:01:37.030> can<00:01:37.210> see<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
it just stays red and as you can see it

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.499 
it just stays red and as you can see it
goes<00:01:39.600> right<00:01:40.600> how<00:01:40.930> it<00:01:41.140> should<00:01:41.380> go<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.880> boom<00:01:43.240> boom

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
goes right how it should go so boom boom

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.200 
goes right how it should go so boom boom
then<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:45.610> can<00:01:45.789> flipped<00:01:46.060> her<00:01:46.210> there<00:01:47.429> and<00:01:48.429> click

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
it and it shows the whole waveform so I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.410 
it and it shows the whole waveform so I
mean<00:01:56.039> I'm<00:01:57.039> not<00:01:57.100> sure<00:01:57.250> if<00:01:57.670> it's<00:01:57.820> something<00:01:58.299> I'm
