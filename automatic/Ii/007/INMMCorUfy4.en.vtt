00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
yo guys a spider here we're continuing

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.870 
yo guys a spider here we're continuing
our<00:00:10.110> quest<00:00:10.320> for<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.769> Easter<00:00:11.040> egg<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.280> origins

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
our quest for the Easter egg on origins

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.700 
our quest for the Easter egg on origins
this<00:00:12.240> time<00:00:12.420> we're<00:00:12.570> trying<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:13.049> figure<00:00:13.320> out<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
this time we're trying to figure out the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.109 
this time we're trying to figure out the
puzzle<00:00:14.000> that<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.710> elemental<00:00:17.430> staff

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
puzzle that is the the elemental staff

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.890 
puzzle that is the the elemental staff
of<00:00:18.449> wind<00:00:18.990> now<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.439> have<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.830> line<00:00:20.070> up<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
of wind now you have to line up the the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.130 
of wind now you have to line up the the
the<00:00:22.260> symbols<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:23.070> these<00:00:23.850> rings<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:25.019> you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
the symbols on these rings and that you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.470 
the symbols on these rings and that you
hit<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.560> rings<00:00:25.769> with<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.670> staff<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.210> wind

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
hit the rings with the the staff of wind

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.540 
hit the rings with the the staff of wind
I<00:00:27.810> don't<00:00:28.500> think<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.830> actually<00:00:28.949> mentioned<00:00:29.279> in

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
I don't think I actually mentioned in

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.160 
I don't think I actually mentioned in
the<00:00:29.699> blue<00:00:30.060> staff<00:00:30.269> here<00:00:30.510> we're<00:00:30.750> hitting<00:00:31.019> with

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the blue staff here we're hitting with

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.620 
the blue staff here we're hitting with
the<00:00:31.230> staff<00:00:31.439> but<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.740> mean<00:00:31.890> showing<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.510> so<00:00:33.510> we

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the staff but I mean showing it so we

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.229 
the staff but I mean showing it so we
have<00:00:33.950> Hydra<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.190> he's<00:00:35.670> gonna<00:00:35.820> be<00:00:36.000> hitting

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
have Hydra here he's gonna be hitting

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.670 
have Hydra here he's gonna be hitting
the<00:00:36.329> rings<00:00:36.540> now<00:00:36.840> I'll<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> first<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.559> admit

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
the rings now I'll be the first to admit

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.380 
the rings now I'll be the first to admit
and<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.489> look<00:00:38.670> at<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> pillars<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and if you look at the pillars the

and if you look at the pillars the
pillars<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.870> symbols<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.469> them<00:00:40.620> right<00:00:40.850> I'll

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
pillars have symbols on them right I'll

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.940 
pillars have symbols on them right I'll
be<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> first<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.480> admit<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:43.469> didn't<00:00:43.680> complete

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
be the first to admit we didn't complete

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.770 
be the first to admit we didn't complete
this<00:00:44.070> ourselves<00:00:44.219> somebody<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.149> our<00:00:45.390> chats

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
this ourselves somebody in our chats

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.130 
this ourselves somebody in our chats
actually<00:00:46.530> posted<00:00:46.829> an<00:00:46.950> image<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.370> them<00:00:47.550> in-game

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
actually posted an image of them in-game

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.110 
actually posted an image of them in-game
completing<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.350> step<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.850> really

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
completing this step and I really

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.580 
completing this step and I really
haven't<00:00:51.420> had<00:00:51.510> time<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.870> go<00:00:52.079> back<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.410> analyze

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
haven't had time to go back and analyze

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.889 
haven't had time to go back and analyze
it<00:00:52.920> properly<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.520> guys<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.699> will<00:00:53.940> do<00:00:54.660> that

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it properly for you guys I will do that

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.869 
it properly for you guys I will do that
but<00:00:55.710> we're<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:55.920> gonna<00:00:56.219> show<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.520> exactly

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
but we're just gonna show you exactly

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.630 
but we're just gonna show you exactly
how<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> line<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.719> up<00:00:57.989> probably<00:00:58.949> occurred<00:00:59.250> via

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
how to line it up probably occurred via

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.510 
how to line it up probably occurred via
trial<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.210> error<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:01.289> did<00:01:01.469> try<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.010> lot<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
trial and error we did try a lot of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.729 
trial and error we did try a lot of
trial<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.879> error<00:01:03.000> stuff<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.600> every<00:01:04.290> single

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
trial and error stuff but every single

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.390 
trial and error stuff but every single
ring<00:01:05.369> has<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.210> specific<00:01:06.750> position

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
ring has to be in a specific position

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.390 
ring has to be in a specific position
and<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.570> what<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.250> an

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and I think what it is is it's an

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.280 
and I think what it is is it's an
additive<00:01:11.850> subtractive<00:01:12.570> thing<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
additive subtractive thing so if you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.830 
additive subtractive thing so if you
line<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.740> symbols<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.909> symbols<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
line up the symbols the symbols the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.130 
line up the symbols the symbols the
symbols<00:01:16.080> line<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.330> stone

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
symbols line up with the the the stone

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.550 
symbols line up with the the the stone
that<00:01:19.170> has<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.979> markings<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.640> them<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.560> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
that has the markings in them and the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.380 
that has the markings in them and the
symbols<00:01:22.979> actually<00:01:23.159> are<00:01:23.520> additive<00:01:24.000> /

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
symbols actually are additive /

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.950 
symbols actually are additive /
subtractive<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.560> order<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.479> create<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
subtractive in order to create the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.929 
subtractive in order to create the
symbol<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.770> shown<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
symbol that is shown on the

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.810 
symbol that is shown on the
corresponding<00:01:30.689> pillar<00:01:30.990> okay<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.189> what<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.520> will

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
corresponding pillar okay so what I will

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.270 
corresponding pillar okay so what I will
do<00:01:33.140> because<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.170> don't<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> time<00:01:35.100> right

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
do because I don't have the time right

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.380 
do because I don't have the time right
now<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.579> trying<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.820> get<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.060> out<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.270> you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
analysis like we did with the staff the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.649 
analysis like we did with the staff the
elemental<00:01:53.040> staff<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.610> lightning<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659

in the future but I think it doesn't
change<00:02:28.470> from<00:02:28.770> game<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.070> game<00:02:29.100> either<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.820> only
