 empty wallet club 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.070

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.180
 I was half upset, half sad 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.040
 not worried 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.619
 angry people create expectations 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.979
 too much and then when frustration comes 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.320
 psa psa adapted to dengue 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.060
 when frustration came the disappointment is 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.950
 huge and we can not sometimes 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.130
 deal with it but I'm here for you 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.250

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.530
 at the time I posted the photo she 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.110
 will arrive in the different places of this 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.950
 country of this world at different times 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.439
 it is also not instantaneous because it is faster 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.530
 that the internet is going to be a delay 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:38.740
 of thousandths of a second millionths of 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.049
 seconds from the answer 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.270
 who would be the winner is the one who arrives 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.759
 first on my computer screen 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.520
 so as soon as I get in the picture, I 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.369
 I kept an eye on my monitor to see 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.590
 which would be the first to respond and was 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.170
 douglas son then you to yours 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.369
 response was the first because it was 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.369
 first to appear on your monitor 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.420
 actually did not lose anything you left 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.399
 to win and even if he had lost 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.770
 if we can differentiate that 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.800
 which is really important in our 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.860
 We're going to lose a lot of things in life. 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.270
 life and material things 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.460
 You can run after win 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.560
 again but there are things that we will 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.390
 lose that there is no return 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.980
 I for one car loses hair 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.690
 there is no turning back 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.010
 I'm waiting for the searches with 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.200
 stem cells 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.400
 We can lose our health here. 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.770
 living with the disease may lose a 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.270
 I loved you, by the way, we'll go 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.450
 lose one's life 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:49.550
 this life does not belong to us 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.160
 we want to lose it dramatic will not fall 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.090
 just the reality that no one refer 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.330
 about it 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.690
 really value what is important 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.690
 in your life 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.510

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.030

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.400
 look different understand what is 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.400

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.440
 I'm going to understand that 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.780
 you need help if you are 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.970
 someone who was sincere in his criticism of 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.880
 I will try to understand this criticism and 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.430
 learn from it 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.780
