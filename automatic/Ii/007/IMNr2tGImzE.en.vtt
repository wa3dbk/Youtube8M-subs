00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.120
 both 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.120
 2 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.289
 I think that at the moment the blogs 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.020
 have a vision of the automobile a lot 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.360
 wider and that people do not have 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.590
 necessarily need all aspects 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.489
 vehicle techniques they will look at 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.470
 our sides krieger the passion side and so 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.300
 we get to their release already it's 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.700
 the pleasure of driving and this pleasure 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.329
 of the automobile in general it brings 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.859
 as well 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.600
 an additional material is therefore 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.399
 complementary for the magazine of 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.780
 specialized press we are bloggers on 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.909
 is not a journalist and you have to 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.549
 not claiming the fact of being 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.379
 my brings a different look 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:01:00.439
 complementary may be more humane 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.109
 closer closer to the consumer 

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:04.070
 closer to the car buyer 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.119
 bloggers writing is 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.740
 completely different from that of 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.090
 journalists in the sense that I have 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.549
 absorbed bloggers write in a 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.960
 time a language - or do take shape 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.439
 writing that closer to people in 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.170
 general 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.000
 so when we read a blog awards article 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.810
 blog or advice on a blog we have 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.679
 really feel like being in the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.899
 to extend a friend's advice 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.409
 of emperor we are at a table lamy saw 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.569
 a movie we 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.859
 it's nice to test a car and 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.740
 so he will tell us about it with his words 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.299
 what I want to share is both 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.340
 the test of the vehicle itself but 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.200
 so it's a bit of an approach 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.850
 more personal and a little more original 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.450
 of these essays the living moments and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.450
 share them 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.570
 readers who are interested in the blog 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.730
 auto time of a purchase are without a doubt 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.680
 readers who already have a good 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.450
 knowledge of the product and who makes a 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.290
 information or less neutral because we 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.390
 can find in the press 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.850
 institutional and found rather 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.310
 opinion of a bit passionate bloggers who 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.170
 really have a very very subjective opinion 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.890
 on products I prepare a lot my 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.240
 article upstream I already have not hurt myself 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.010
 informed I had already done a test in 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.750
 concession to see a little bit of that 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.070
 give and I had already made a good 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.200
 first impression I made myself my 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.210
 schema is then there I took advantage of 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.100
 these two days of full test for 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.100
 to refine my impressions and 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.890
 on an October test 800 tunas and 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.480
 several bloggers to participate we know 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.920
 that behind there will be so many articles 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.849
 published so if we are not in the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.590
 first to publish 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.090
 we can quickly adapt because the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.370
 reader he will already have ss type 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.420
 the company especially pap allying 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.069
 the 11th and the 12th 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.900
 so it takes it's actually 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.540
 publish quickly enough I like it 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.180
 demarcated is really posted a little bit more 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.219
 late because suddenly it raises 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.420
 writing on the mark on the on the 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.689
 produced in it does less of this effect of 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.340
 buzz 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.719
 he told me this I spoke of being 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.639
 a month later or tomorrow at the latest 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.019
 trying to find the info by 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.190
 example that makes that at that moment 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.350
 it's interesting to talk about it 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.110
 with bloggers we all know each other 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.660
 it is true that it creates a 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.130
 real small group of friends we are 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.460
 always very happy with this 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.460
 withdrawal 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.840
 we weld ourselves pretty quickly so we 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.010
 is still more or less competitors 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.989
 it's true that we give ourselves little ones 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.099
 malignant who driving a small takes 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.840
 photos so we exchange photos 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.819
 after we do not go at all this rivalry 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.069
 we have to say there I have a picture 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.660
 that the other does not have that little little thing 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.710
 through all the social media of 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.720
 connections 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.630
 between the bloggers and then they 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.590
 can 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.650
 go to exchanges 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.580
 support information neither small 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.130
 pictures videos etc 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.450
 there really agree that 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.450
 links between bloggers
