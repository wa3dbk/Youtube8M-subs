it's<00:00:52.660> been<00:00:52.900> shown<00:00:53.230> that<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.650> brain<00:00:53.800> is

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
it's been shown that the brain is

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.880 
it's been shown that the brain is
neuroplastic<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:56.110> that's<00:00:56.260> a<00:00:56.350> fancy<00:00:56.560> word

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
neuroplastic and that's a fancy word

neuroplastic and that's a fancy word
that<00:00:56.920> really<00:00:57.310> means<00:00:57.520> it's<00:00:57.760> remodeling<00:00:58.360> itself

that really means it's remodeling itself

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.320 
that really means it's remodeling itself
in<00:00:58.900> rebuilding<00:00:59.350> itself<00:00:59.650> and<00:01:00.130> changing<00:01:00.970> itself

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
in rebuilding itself and changing itself

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.020

internally<00:01:04.030> I<00:01:04.300> don't<00:01:05.140> think<00:01:05.350> that's<00:01:05.560> halfway

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
internally I don't think that's halfway

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.520 
internally I don't think that's halfway
of<00:01:06.250> your<00:01:06.430> journey<00:01:06.730> so<00:01:07.720> it's<00:01:07.870> kind<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.140> like<00:01:08.260> you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
of your journey so it's kind of like you

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.200 
of your journey so it's kind of like you
should<00:01:08.710> be<00:01:08.860> like<00:01:09.010> a<00:01:09.040> candle<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:09.820> know<00:01:10.120> you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
should be like a candle you know you

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.450 
should be like a candle you know you
should<00:01:10.510> burn<00:01:10.780> burn<00:01:11.140> burn<00:01:11.170> and<00:01:11.740> then<00:01:12.040> you're

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
should burn burn burn and then you're

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:23.310 
should burn burn burn and then you're
done

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.660 

we<00:01:24.320> have<00:01:24.469> to<00:01:24.619> ask<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:25.070> most<00:01:25.189> important

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
we have to ask the most important

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.910 
we have to ask the most important
question<00:01:25.700> what<00:01:26.390> am<00:01:26.719> I<00:01:26.899> to<00:01:27.049> learn<00:01:27.380> from<00:01:27.679> this

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
question what am I to learn from this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.490 
question what am I to learn from this
and<00:01:28.520> when<00:01:29.240> we<00:01:29.390> realize<00:01:29.750> there's<00:01:30.049> really<00:01:30.259> no

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
and when we realize there's really no

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.929 
and when we realize there's really no
such<00:01:30.740> thing<00:01:30.979> as<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.130> good<00:01:31.460> thing<00:01:31.670> or<00:01:31.820> a<00:01:31.880> bad

thing they're just things the next thing
the<00:01:34.100> next<00:01:34.310> lesson<00:01:34.939> is<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.719> next<00:01:35.960> experience

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
the next lesson is the next experience

when I'm that age that's what I want to

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.240 
when I'm that age that's what I want to
do<00:02:24.450> what<00:02:24.599> they<00:02:24.690> found<00:02:24.870> as<00:02:25.140> as<00:02:25.349> long<00:02:25.590> as<00:02:25.799> we<00:02:25.980> are

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
do what they found as as long as we are

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.000 
do what they found as as long as we are
stimulating<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.970> brain<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:28.010> pursuing

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
stimulating the brain and pursuing

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.160 
stimulating the brain and pursuing
things<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.459> inspire<00:02:30.000> us<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.480> we're<00:02:30.930> going

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
things that inspire us and we're going

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.900 
things that inspire us and we're going
after<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:31.650> learning<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.069> creatively<00:02:32.549> going

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
after and learning and creatively going

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.220 
after and learning and creatively going
after<00:02:33.150> something<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.510> solving<00:02:33.900> problems

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
after something and solving problems

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.020 
after something and solving problems
with<00:02:34.260> our<00:02:34.410> brain<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.220> getting<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.579> glucose

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
with our brain and getting the glucose

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.449 
with our brain and getting the glucose
and<00:02:36.239> oxygen<00:02:36.390> working<00:02:37.079> in<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.290> brain<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:38.340> will

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
and oxygen working in that brain it will

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.100 
and oxygen working in that brain it will
last<00:02:38.670> for<00:02:38.970> an<00:02:39.030> unbelievable<00:02:39.599> period<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.930> time

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
last for an unbelievable period of time

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.990 
last for an unbelievable period of time
and<00:02:40.680> well<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.950> significance<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.610> if<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.819> have

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
and well the significance is if you have

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.780 
and well the significance is if you have
an<00:02:42.120> expectation<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.959> aging<00:02:43.560> well<00:02:44.489> then<00:02:44.670> you

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
an expectation of aging well then you

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.330 
an expectation of aging well then you
can<00:02:44.970> manifest<00:02:45.329> an<00:02:45.750> expectation<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.590> aging

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:03:01.550 

when<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.400> turned<00:02:51.700> 50<00:02:52.180> I<00:02:52.470> actually<00:02:54.330> was<00:02:55.330> grateful

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.660 

when<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.130> turned<00:03:02.520> 50<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.000> was<00:03:03.150> like<00:03:04.160> now<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.190> can

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
when I turned 50 it was like now I can

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.830 
when I turned 50 it was like now I can
do<00:03:06.150> something<00:03:06.569> with<00:03:06.990> life<00:03:07.319> that<00:03:07.740> I've<00:03:07.920> learned

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
occasion when I see myself in the mirror

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.000 
occasion when I see myself in the mirror
I<00:03:16.500> see<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> body<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.880> looks<00:03:18.030> older<00:03:18.480> than<00:03:18.510> 37<00:03:19.260> 48

I see a body that looks older than 37 48
sounds<00:03:20.340> way<00:03:20.459> better<00:03:20.489> than<00:03:20.819> 50<00:03:21.209> but<00:03:21.780> when<00:03:21.930> you

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
sounds way better than 50 but when you

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.620 
sounds way better than 50 but when you
hear<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.350> hard<00:03:22.680> number<00:03:23.100> 50<00:03:23.910> it's<00:03:24.420> like<00:03:24.600> a

hear that hard number 50 it's like a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.410 
hear that hard number 50 it's like a
death<00:03:25.020> sentence<00:03:25.440> but<00:03:25.620> it's<00:03:26.190> really<00:03:26.310> not<00:03:26.550> once

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
death sentence but it's really not once
