00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.289 
matter as Greenspan correctly pointed
out<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> question<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:48.030> enough

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
out so the question is do we have enough

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.569 
out so the question is do we have enough
of<00:01:48.450> those<00:01:48.570> assets<00:01:49.079> well<00:01:49.770> as<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.220> said<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.549> my

it's<00:02:58.680> true<00:02:58.950> because<00:02:59.849> you<00:03:00.000> would<00:03:00.120> worry<00:03:00.359> about

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
it's true because you would worry about

it's true because you would worry about
the<00:03:00.810> value<00:03:01.049> of<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.470> currency<00:03:01.799> if<00:03:02.099> we<00:03:02.819> printed

the value of the currency if we printed

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.180 
the value of the currency if we printed

too much of those dollars then they'd be
