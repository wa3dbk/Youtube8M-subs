00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.080 

we<00:00:17.250> didn't<00:00:17.460> connect<00:00:18.530> that<00:00:19.530> well<00:00:19.880> from<00:00:20.880> their

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
we didn't connect that well from their

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.679 
we didn't connect that well from their
set<00:00:21.300> piece<00:00:21.540> and<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.610> many<00:00:23.610> are<00:00:23.730> two<00:00:23.910> scrums<00:00:24.270> and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
set piece and so many are two scrums and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.210 
set piece and so many are two scrums and
the<00:00:24.960> whole<00:00:25.140> game<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.740> put<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> ball<00:00:26.189> on

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the whole game that we put the ball on

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.790 
the whole game that we put the ball on
and<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.810> makes<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.050> very<00:00:28.170> difficult<00:00:28.529> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
and so it makes it very difficult to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.440 
and so it makes it very difficult to
play<00:00:29.070> off<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.430> one<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.670> those<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:30.000> there<00:00:30.210> go<00:00:30.360> on

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
play off and one of those we there go on

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.740 
play off and one of those we there go on
the<00:00:30.570> sunburn<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.699> but<00:00:32.699> yet<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:33.030> started<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the sunburn and but yet we started up to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.680 
the sunburn and but yet we started up to
you<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.460> Ramesh<00:00:35.460> get<00:00:35.699> that<00:00:35.850> boy<00:00:36.000> attack

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you you know Ramesh get that boy attack

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.450 
you you know Ramesh get that boy attack
off<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:38.730> our<00:00:39.090> first<00:00:39.860> few<00:00:40.860> line<00:00:41.070> outs<00:00:41.280> we

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
off it and our first few line outs we

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.390 
off it and our first few line outs we
just<00:00:41.670> didn't<00:00:41.910> connect<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> battery<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
just didn't connect with the battery the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.460 
just didn't connect with the battery the
possible<00:00:44.400> in<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.940> driving<00:00:45.330> wall<00:00:45.540> or<00:00:45.870> a

delivery from la Cour line at catch it
to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> heart<00:00:51.000> deck<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:52.290> I<00:00:52.380> wasn't

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
to the heart deck and I wasn't

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.380 
to the heart deck and I wasn't
sufficient<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.460> us<00:00:53.550> together<00:00:53.760> linked<00:00:54.239> with

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
sufficient for us together linked with

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.440 
sufficient for us together linked with
the<00:00:54.540> back<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> that's<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:57.059> area<00:00:57.300> that

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
the back so so that's one area that

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.780 
the back so so that's one area that
we've<00:00:57.719> got<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> tidy<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.610> so<00:00:59.760> much

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
we've got a tidy up so it's not so much

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.060 
we've got a tidy up so it's not so much
about<00:00:59.910> winning<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> ball<00:01:00.630> or<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.739> having

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
about winning the ball or now having

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.979 
about winning the ball or now having
good<00:01:02.250> strikes<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:02.969> about<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.420> able<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
good strikes it's just about be able to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.850 
good strikes it's just about be able to
put<00:01:04.649> the<00:01:04.739> two<00:01:04.920> together<00:01:06.440> but<00:01:07.440> I<00:01:07.470> think<00:01:07.590> we

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
put the two together but I think we

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.520 
put the two together but I think we
kicked<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.280> particularly<00:01:08.729> well<00:01:08.910> and<00:01:09.530> from

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
kicked that particularly well and from

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.190 
kicked that particularly well and from
inside<00:01:10.860> at<00:01:11.009> 22<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.850> kept<00:01:12.450> four<00:01:12.690> or<00:01:12.780> five<00:01:12.960> times

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
inside at 22 we kept four or five times

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.510 
inside at 22 we kept four or five times
and<00:01:13.560> didn't<00:01:13.800> find<00:01:13.979> touch<00:01:15.560> and<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:17.430> know

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and didn't find touch and you know

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
and didn't find touch and you know
what's<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> line<00:01:18.000> out<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.300> do<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.690> defensive

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
what's the line out we do have defensive

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.870 
what's the line out we do have defensive
line<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.640> want<00:01:20.789> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
line that we do have them we want the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.340 
line that we do have them we want the
ball<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.179> out<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.750> put<00:01:21.929> the<00:01:22.050> pressure<00:01:22.200> back

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
ball to go out and put the pressure back

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.010 
ball to go out and put the pressure back
on<00:01:22.530> them<00:01:22.830> rather<00:01:23.069> than<00:01:23.220> having<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.840> look<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
on them rather than having to look at a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.469 
on them rather than having to look at a
team<00:01:25.319> running<00:01:25.530> at<00:01:25.740> us<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.550> we<00:01:26.970> paid<00:01:27.149> the<00:01:27.270> price

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
team running at us and we paid the price

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.980 
team running at us and we paid the price
and<00:01:28.399> erin's<00:01:29.399> kept<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.179> know<00:01:30.300> didn't<00:01:30.869> go

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and erin's kept that you know didn't go

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.919 
and erin's kept that you know didn't go
out<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.440> they<00:01:32.250> scored<00:01:32.550> off<00:01:33.050> so<00:01:34.050> that<00:01:35.929> there

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
out and they scored off so that there

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.650 
out and they scored off so that there
are<00:01:37.080> two<00:01:37.289> key<00:01:37.679> years<00:01:38.330> that<00:01:39.330> were<00:01:39.450> probably

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
are two key years that were probably

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.730 
are two key years that were probably
work<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:41.099> for<00:01:41.340> us<00:01:41.929> but<00:01:42.929> outside<00:01:43.289> of<00:01:43.319> those<00:01:43.560> two

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
work on for us but outside of those two

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.859 
work on for us but outside of those two
areas<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.910> was<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.179> of<00:01:45.209> positives<00:01:45.720> you

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
areas there was a lot of positives you

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.710 
areas there was a lot of positives you
know<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.229> they<00:01:47.039> showed<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> lot<00:01:47.550> of<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.940> game

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
know like they showed a lot of a game

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.480 
know like they showed a lot of a game
mental<00:01:49.110> fortitude<00:01:49.349> to<00:01:49.800> stand<00:01:49.890> again

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
mental fortitude to stand again

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.400 
mental fortitude to stand again
particularly<00:01:50.819> that<00:01:51.060> first<00:01:51.270> half<00:01:51.539> and<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
particularly that first half and you

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.350 
particularly that first half and you
know<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.709> dice<00:01:53.459> didn't<00:01:53.789> fall<00:01:53.970> they're<00:01:54.179> way

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
know the dice didn't fall they're way

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.180 
know the dice didn't fall they're way
too<00:01:54.599> often<00:01:55.819> and<00:01:56.819> again<00:01:57.240> massively<00:01:57.750> when<00:01:58.530> you

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
too often and again massively when you

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.500 
too often and again massively when you
know<00:01:59.310> cozy<00:01:59.880> got<00:02:00.030> yellow<00:02:00.660> carpet<00:02:00.959> and

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
know cozy got yellow carpet and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.360 
know cozy got yellow carpet and
in<00:02:03.080> fact<00:02:03.380> I<00:02:03.500> think<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.860> was<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.010> winning<00:02:04.250> of

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
in fact I think that was the winning of

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.990 
in fact I think that was the winning of
the<00:02:04.430> game<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:05.570> we<00:02:05.840> managed<00:02:06.530> in<00:02:07.130> that<00:02:07.640> probably

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
the game and we managed in that probably

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.690 
the game and we managed in that probably
20<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.570> 25<00:02:09.020> minutes<00:02:09.140> ten<00:02:10.070> of<00:02:10.190> which<00:02:10.280> he<00:02:10.490> wasn't

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
20 to 25 minutes ten of which he wasn't

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.000 
20 to 25 minutes ten of which he wasn't
there<00:02:10.970> we<00:02:11.300> we<00:02:11.900> just<00:02:12.200> took<00:02:12.350> control<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.770> the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
there we we just took control of the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.980 
there we we just took control of the
game<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:15.430> think<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.640> stats<00:02:17.030> at<00:02:17.270> position

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
game and I think the stats at position

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.510 
game and I think the stats at position
stats<00:02:18.260> after<00:02:18.530> online<00:02:18.980> we<00:02:19.160> had<00:02:19.280> only<00:02:19.370> had

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
stats after online we had only had
