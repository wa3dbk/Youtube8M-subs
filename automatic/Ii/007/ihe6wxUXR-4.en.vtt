00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:07.630
 hello good night friends 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.350
 there is an old dichotomy in the game of 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.990
 Argentine who talks an old fight that 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:19.010
 speaks of him menottismo and bilardismo 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:21.750
 two ways of focusing football 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.740
 they are old and missing menotti 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.710
 bilardo but the ideas are left because 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.140
 there was always a dichotomy between 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.579
 way in argentina especially in the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.890
 way of understanding the game of football 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.170
 then now instead of saying 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.870
 Mentalism or bilardism to bring us 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.309
 more to face boosting more modern we can 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.079
 say that the game is divided the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.989
 technical directors and the concepts of 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.290
 album are divided between conceptualism and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.050
 conceptualist tacticism is that 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.539
 coach who believes that first is the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.489
 Game concept before tactics 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.920
 that first is then why the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.960
 tactics there is always clear that yes but 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.440
 first is the concept we want 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.600
 play as we play a global issue and 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.670
 what is our identity and then if 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.280
 we establish the tactic to impose it and 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.399
 strategic is one that has as its 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.990
 priority the tactic believes that according to 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.850
 matches according to rivals has to 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.300
 establish different movements of 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.390
 team 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.390
 once daniel passarella told me 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.700
 a few years ago 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.229
 what was the difference between the 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.850
 bilardismo and Peronism and I know why 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.330
 I really do not understand it very well 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.450
 for me there is no difference then it gives me 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.539
 an explanation that occurs to me 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.860
 when you are going to give a talk in the 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.070
 start of the game before starting 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.270
 the party what do you think 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.399
 fundamentally happens with the ball 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.710
 that you will have a voice in that party or 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.630
 that the opposites will have 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.539
 I say if you do the talk thinking that 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.470
 the big ball is you sos 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.909
 menottistas are - you if you think that the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.049
 ball the band us 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.210
 fundamentally and you have to look 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.240
 how to take off age and set 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.680
 ways to get the ball sos 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.350
 bilardo 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.690
 he said good sometimes I do a 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.700
 thing and sometimes I do the other one I say very 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.310
 well daniel good i am ni menotti and 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.230
 bilardo are nothing this means 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.820
 that there are not our least means 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.000
 as there are no average terms in 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.220
 no in any order of life 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.800
 Everyday there are no third 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.180
 positions or venues in a way or venues 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.400
 from another or from the left is from 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.950
 right the intermediate questions the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.620
 center are times ambiguous positions 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.120
 it was football is conceptualist who 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.820
 is the maximum representative of 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.850
 conceptualism at this time in the 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.410
 argentina guy who understands the game 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.709
 conceptually before the tactic 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.989
 roman riquelme why I defend 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.050
 riquelme and the representative of the 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.930
 tactics at this moment in this moment 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.810
 is Alejandro Sabella, who is the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.040
 continuity of the tactic that established 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.040
 bilardo in students
