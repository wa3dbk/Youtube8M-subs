what<00:02:39.020> needs<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.350> be<00:02:39.530> done<00:02:39.710> first

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
what needs to be done first

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.520 
what needs to be done first
the<00:02:40.820> first<00:02:41.090> task<00:02:41.330> that<00:02:41.660> needs<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:42.080> be<00:02:42.110> done<00:02:42.320> is

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
the first task that needs to be done is

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.240 
the first task that needs to be done is
to<00:02:42.560> see<00:02:43.310> how<00:02:43.880> this<00:02:44.360> whole<00:02:44.870> riverfront<00:02:45.590> can<00:02:46.130> be

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
to see how this whole riverfront can be

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.840 
to see how this whole riverfront can be
integrated<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:48.290> plan<00:02:48.530> has<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.730> the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
integrated so the plan has the of the

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.240 
integrated so the plan has the of the
city<00:02:50.180> works<00:02:50.450> with<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.200> river<00:02:51.470> but<00:02:52.130> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
city works with the river but the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.210 
city works with the river but the
potentials<00:02:52.790> along<00:02:53.090> this<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.690> river<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.920> lot

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
potentials along this the river is a lot

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.120 
potentials along this the river is a lot
the<00:02:55.700> rehabilitation<00:02:56.510> process<00:02:56.750> is<00:02:57.170> long<00:02:57.650> but

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
the rehabilitation process is long but

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.710 
the rehabilitation process is long but
something<00:02:58.580> come<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:58.970> leaves<00:02:59.180> is<00:02:59.390> worth

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
something come of the leaves is worth

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.630 
something come of the leaves is worth
the<00:02:59.930> effort<00:03:00.290> Glen<00:03:00.800> river<00:03:01.070> is<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.430> most

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
the effort Glen river is the most

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.280 
the effort Glen river is the most
important<00:03:02.060> river<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:04.400> de<00:03:04.580> in<00:03:04.880> Malaysia<00:03:05.600> it's

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
important river in de in Malaysia it's

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.680 
important river in de in Malaysia it's
not<00:03:06.500> just<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:06.920> de<00:03:07.010> Peninsula<00:03:07.520> Malaysia<00:03:07.730> and

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
not just the de Peninsula Malaysia and

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.990 
not just the de Peninsula Malaysia and
it's<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.020> hot<00:03:09.230> men<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.920> know<00:03:10.040> it'd<00:03:10.580> be<00:03:10.730> hot

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
it's the hot men of you know it'd be hot

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.960 
it's the hot men of you know it'd be hot
the<00:03:11.920> veins<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.250> our<00:03:13.970> urban<00:03:14.450> life<00:03:14.690> KL<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.650> on<00:03:15.800> it

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
the veins of our urban life KL is on it

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.449 
the veins of our urban life KL is on it
you<00:03:16.970> know<00:03:17.120> our<00:03:17.390> biggest<00:03:17.989> spot<00:03:18.320> is<00:03:18.500> on<00:03:19.250> the

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
you know our biggest spot is on the

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.220 
you know our biggest spot is on the
reverse<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.140> I<00:03:21.489> think<00:03:22.489> this<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:22.989> one<00:03:23.989> of<00:03:24.019> the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
reverse and I think this is one of the

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.810 
reverse and I think this is one of the
most<00:03:24.350> important<00:03:24.860> are<00:03:24.980> because<00:03:25.640> we<00:03:25.790> are

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
most important are because we are

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.210 
most important are because we are
looking<00:03:25.940> at<00:03:26.269> 25<00:03:26.570> years<00:03:26.750> 10<00:03:27.170> 50<00:03:27.769> years<00:03:27.980> 100
