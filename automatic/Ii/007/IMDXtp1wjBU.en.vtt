here's<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.190> old<00:00:17.490> carburetor<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.800> couldn't

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
here's the old carburetor that couldn't

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.400 
here's the old carburetor that couldn't
get<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> float<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.490> move<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:21.779> one<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.230> got

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
get the float to move the one that I got

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.490 
get the float to move the one that I got
the<00:00:22.680> throttle<00:00:23.070> working<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.640> choke<00:00:27.500> but

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
the throttle working in the choke but

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.410 
the throttle working in the choke but
i'm<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:28.890> using<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.369> anymore<00:00:31.910> so<00:00:32.910> i<00:00:32.940> have

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
i'm not using this anymore so i have

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.500 
i'm not using this anymore so i have
this<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:34.370> think<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.640> don't<00:00:35.969> really<00:00:36.090> know<00:00:36.300> how<00:00:36.329> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
this I think I don't really know how to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.170 
this I think I don't really know how to
pronounce<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.989> right<00:00:37.579> kashima<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.610> think<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
pronounce it right kashima I think it is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.729 
pronounce it right kashima I think it is
it<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.050> come<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.640> engine<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.739> I

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
it to come so I have this engine and I

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.790 
it to come so I have this engine and I
took<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.040> carburetor<00:00:44.489> off<00:00:44.700> here<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.649> I<00:00:46.649> had

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
took the carburetor off here and I had

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.520 
took the carburetor off here and I had
to<00:00:46.920> modify<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.750> bolt<00:00:50.420> steppin<00:00:52.340> it<00:00:53.340> did<00:00:54.530> modified

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
to modify a bolt steppin it did modified

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.689 
to modify a bolt steppin it did modified
that<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.920> work<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:58.140> then<00:01:00.440> put<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.829> this

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
that to work and then put this in this

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.360 
that to work and then put this in this
boat<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.320> it<00:01:04.320> works<00:01:04.530> now<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.159> fits<00:01:05.369> perfect

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.390 

so<00:01:11.370> yeah<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.440> don't<00:01:13.440> know<00:01:13.680> how<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.250> this

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
so yeah but I don't know how to do this

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.190 
so yeah but I don't know how to do this
at<00:01:14.610> all<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.630> right<00:01:16.620> here<00:01:16.800> this<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.780> throttle

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
at all like right here this the throttle

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.810 
at all like right here this the throttle
pushes<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.680> way<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:20.370> turned<00:01:20.610> into<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
pushes this way which turned into the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.660 
pushes this way which turned into the
butterfly<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.480> on<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.680> old<00:01:22.830> carburetor<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
butterfly and on the old carburetor you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.690 
butterfly and on the old carburetor you
pull<00:01:24.000> back<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.480> this<00:01:24.990> would<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.560> way<00:01:25.800> but

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
pull back and this would go that way but

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.180 
pull back and this would go that way but
this<00:01:27.300> still<00:01:27.600> goes<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.990> way<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.950> goes

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
this still goes that way and this goes

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.670 
this still goes that way and this goes
that<00:01:29.370> way<00:01:29.550> so<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> don't<00:01:30.360> know<00:01:30.600> what<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:30.960> my

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
that way so I don't know what to do my

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.410 
that way so I don't know what to do my
dad<00:01:31.860> said<00:01:32.130> put<00:01:32.870> the<00:01:33.870> rod<00:01:34.140> wait<00:01:34.740> let<00:01:34.950> me<00:01:35.010> find<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.940 

ok<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> can't<00:01:39.840> find<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.590> guys<00:01:40.710> good

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.040 
ok I can't find it but you guys good
what<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.130> mean<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.970> rod<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.420> goes<00:01:42.450> from<00:01:42.750> here

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
what I mean the rod that goes from here

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.920 
what I mean the rod that goes from here
to<00:01:43.080> here<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> used<00:01:44.550> to<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.790> he<00:01:45.450> said<00:01:45.690> put

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
to here that I used to have he said put

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.350 
to here that I used to have he said put
it<00:01:46.250> in<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.430> hole<00:01:47.730> that<00:01:47.970> little<00:01:48.210> one<00:01:48.300> right

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it in that hole that little one right

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.250 
it in that hole that little one right
there<00:01:49.850> but<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.880> tried<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.510> and<00:01:51.540> when<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.050> pull

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
there but I tried it and when you pull

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.770 
there but I tried it and when you pull
it<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:53.160> creates<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.610> pressure<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:54.240> here

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
it just creates a pressure on here

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.110 
it just creates a pressure on here
because<00:01:55.650> this<00:01:55.890> won't<00:01:56.070> turn<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.730> would<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:57.000> to

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
because this won't turn it would have to

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.080 
because this won't turn it would have to
have<00:01:57.240> an<00:01:57.780> extension<00:01:58.410> over<00:01:58.590> here<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.850> on<00:01:59.970> an

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
have an extension over here and be on an

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.710 
have an extension over here and be on an
angle<00:02:00.480> because<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.260> it's<00:02:01.440> straight<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.980> won't

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
angle because if it's straight it won't

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.280 
angle because if it's straight it won't
turn<00:02:03.720> so<00:02:04.490> if<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.910> guys<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.270> any<00:02:06.360> any<00:02:06.840> ideas

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
turn so if you guys have any any ideas

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.970 
turn so if you guys have any any ideas
about<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:08.060> let<00:02:09.060> me<00:02:09.090> know<00:02:09.179> cumin<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:12.980> air

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
about that let me know cumin and the air

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.690 
about that let me know cumin and the air
filter<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:16.530> melts<00:02:16.860> are<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.130> same<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.670> I

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
filter the melts are the same so I

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.580 
filter the melts are the same so I
should<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.000> able<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.330> fit<00:02:18.959> their<00:02:19.170> original

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
should be able to fit their original

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.580 
should be able to fit their original
color<00:02:19.800> air<00:02:20.040> filter<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.520> there<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:22.500> only

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
color air filter on there and the only

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.250 
color air filter on there and the only
thing<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.220> one<00:02:23.400> doesn't<00:02:23.700> have<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.850> choke

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
thing is this one doesn't have a choke

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.460 
thing is this one doesn't have a choke
this<00:02:25.260> one<00:02:25.500> does<00:02:26.570> so<00:02:27.570> I<00:02:27.600> hope<00:02:27.959> it'll<00:02:28.140> still<00:02:28.440> work

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
this one does so I hope it'll still work

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.160 
this one does so I hope it'll still work
but<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:29.160> guess<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.209> could<00:02:30.239> kind<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.810> use<00:02:32.120> this

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
but I guess you could kind of use this

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.360 
but I guess you could kind of use this
almost<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.650> choke<00:02:36.709> injects<00:02:37.709> fuel<00:02:38.010> into

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
almost as the choke injects fuel into

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.920 
almost as the choke injects fuel into
the<00:02:38.489> carburetor<00:02:38.790> which<00:02:39.150> injects<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.780> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
the carburetor which injects it in the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.660 
the carburetor which injects it in the
engine<00:02:41.660> because<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.920> vertical<00:02:44.250> shaft

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
engine because this is a vertical shaft

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.810 
engine because this is a vertical shaft
on<00:02:45.030> mower<00:02:45.330> engine<00:02:45.950> 3.5<00:02:46.950> horsepower<00:02:49.610> sits<00:02:50.610> like

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
on mower engine 3.5 horsepower sits like

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.580 
on mower engine 3.5 horsepower sits like
that

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.570 

so<00:02:57.150> yeah<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.930> after<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.440> get<00:03:02.650> this<00:03:02.800> running<00:03:03.040> and

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
so yeah and after I get this running and

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.940 
so yeah and after I get this running and
hopefully<00:03:04.330> make<00:03:04.480> my<00:03:04.690> go-kart<00:03:05.080> I'm<00:03:05.590> going<00:03:05.890> to

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
hopefully make my go-kart I'm going to

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.910 
hopefully make my go-kart I'm going to
get<00:03:06.099> this<00:03:06.250> running<00:03:06.489> and<00:03:06.880> I'm<00:03:07.840> going<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.590> get<00:03:08.770> an

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
get this running and I'm going to get an

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.330 
get this running and I'm going to get an
old<00:03:09.099> tractor<00:03:09.370> chassis<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.120> see<00:03:10.300> if<00:03:10.360> I<00:03:10.450> can

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
old tractor chassis and see if I can

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.400 
old tractor chassis and see if I can
build<00:03:12.340> some<00:03:12.610> kind<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.849> racing<00:03:13.239> tractor<00:03:13.540> or

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
build some kind of racing tractor or

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:22.229 
build some kind of racing tractor or
something<00:03:14.860> just<00:03:15.069> for<00:03:15.220> fun<00:03:17.040> but<00:03:18.040> yeah<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:22.180> can

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
something just for fun but yeah you can

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.900 
something just for fun but yeah you can
see<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.660> carburetor<00:03:23.080> is<00:03:23.410> cheaper<00:03:23.910> plastic

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
see this carburetor is cheaper plastic

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.080 
see this carburetor is cheaper plastic
and<00:03:27.450> this<00:03:28.450> is<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:29.019> tip<00:03:29.290> off<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.500> old<00:03:29.830> one

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
and this is the tip off the old one

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.900 
and this is the tip off the old one
metal<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.269> was<00:03:32.010> seeing<00:03:33.010> if<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.459> would<00:03:33.610> go<00:03:33.760> in

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
metal I was seeing if this would go in

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.400 
metal I was seeing if this would go in
but<00:03:34.120> then<00:03:34.239> I'd<00:03:34.360> have<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.540> just<00:03:34.840> break<00:03:35.080> this<00:03:35.230> off

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
but then I'd have to just break this off

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.070 
but then I'd have to just break this off
because<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:36.610> doesn't<00:03:37.090> come<00:03:37.269> off<00:03:37.299> and<00:03:37.599> then<00:03:37.959> I'd

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
because it doesn't come off and then I'd

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.229 
because it doesn't come off and then I'd
have<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.260> thread<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:38.880> that's<00:03:39.880> my<00:03:40.030> dad's

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
have to thread this that's my dad's

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:47.640 
have to thread this that's my dad's
starting<00:03:40.660> kit<00:03:41.019> I<00:03:44.760> took<00:03:45.760> off<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.120> head<00:03:46.650> in

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
starting kit I took off the head in

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.949 
starting kit I took off the head in
there<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.549> cleaned<00:03:48.910> off<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.239> piston<00:03:49.690> the

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
there and cleaned off the piston the

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.890 
there and cleaned off the piston the
valves<00:03:50.349> and<00:03:51.099> I<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:52.120> underside<00:03:52.540> of<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.750> head

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
valves and I the underside of the head

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.170 
valves and I the underside of the head
yeah<00:03:53.470> i<00:03:53.739> took<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.099> wire<00:03:54.340> brush<00:03:54.549> a<00:03:54.670> little<00:03:54.790> and

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
yeah i took a wire brush a little and

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.819 
yeah i took a wire brush a little and
just<00:03:55.299> clean<00:03:55.810> them<00:03:55.989> down<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:57.480> um<00:03:58.829> intake

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
just clean them down and um intake

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.430 
just clean them down and um intake
manifold<00:04:00.420> right<00:04:01.420> there<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:03.430> this<00:04:03.790> is<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.440> weird

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
manifold right there and this is a weird

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.680 
manifold right there and this is a weird
flywheel<00:04:06.070> I've<00:04:06.549> never<00:04:07.000> seen<00:04:07.150> one<00:04:07.480> like<00:04:07.540> this

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
flywheel I've never seen one like this

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.280 
flywheel I've never seen one like this
before<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:08.500> has<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:08.950> magnet<00:04:09.579> up<00:04:09.850> here<00:04:10.290> that

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
before it has the magnet up here that

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.890 
before it has the magnet up here that
touches<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:11.829> coil<00:04:12.190> not<00:04:12.940> touches<00:04:13.299> but<00:04:13.480> sends<00:04:13.840> a

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
touches the coil not touches but sends a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.210 
touches the coil not touches but sends a
spark<00:04:14.170> through<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.440> coil<00:04:14.680> which<00:04:14.859> goes<00:04:15.040> off

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
spark through the coil which goes off

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.670 
spark through the coil which goes off
into<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.269> spark<00:04:16.539> plug<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:17.320> goes<00:04:17.470> down

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
into the spark plug and goes down

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.279 
into the spark plug and goes down
creates<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.489> spark<00:04:18.729> which<00:04:19.000> sparks<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.600> gas<00:04:19.780> and

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
creates a spark which sparks the gas and

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.920 
creates a spark which sparks the gas and
that's<00:04:20.950> how<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.160> engine<00:04:21.489> run<00:04:21.639> and<00:04:21.970> then<00:04:22.840> it

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
that's how the engine run and then it

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.690 
that's how the engine run and then it
has<00:04:23.139> a<00:04:23.350> counterweight<00:04:23.889> over<00:04:24.280> here<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:24.639> you

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
has a counterweight over here so you

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.490 
has a counterweight over here so you
don't<00:04:24.880> have<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.180> huge<00:04:25.510> vibration<00:04:26.200> when<00:04:26.380> it

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
don't have a huge vibration when it

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.860 
don't have a huge vibration when it
spins<00:04:27.060> but<00:04:28.060> I've<00:04:28.210> never<00:04:28.389> seen<00:04:28.630> that<00:04:28.690> before

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
spins but I've never seen that before

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.150 
spins but I've never seen that before
the<00:04:29.860> kohler<00:04:30.100> has<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:31.050> guess<00:04:32.050> it's<00:04:32.320> inside<00:04:33.130> the

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
the kohler has I guess it's inside the

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.779 
the kohler has I guess it's inside the
crankcase<00:04:33.610> there's<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:34.870> magneto<00:04:35.610> magnets<00:04:36.610> in

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
crankcase there's the magneto magnets in

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.190 
crankcase there's the magneto magnets in
there<00:04:37.000> on<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.840> crank<00:04:38.139> and<00:04:38.350> I'm<00:04:39.280> pretty<00:04:39.910> sure

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
there on the crank and I'm pretty sure

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.740 
there on the crank and I'm pretty sure
you<00:04:41.200> can<00:04:41.350> see<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:41.530> that's<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.550> forget<00:04:43.539> at

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
you can see that that's the I forget at

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.780 
you can see that that's the I forget at
all<00:04:43.960> um

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
all um

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.740 
all um
you<00:04:46.750> know<00:04:46.900> whatever<00:04:47.760> coil<00:04:48.760> wire<00:04:48.970> that<00:04:49.690> goes

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
you know whatever coil wire that goes

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.880 
you know whatever coil wire that goes
into<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.440> crankcase<00:04:50.710> so<00:04:51.550> I<00:04:51.880> think<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:53.710> the

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
into the crankcase so I think that the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.980 
into the crankcase so I think that the
coil<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.640> magnets<00:04:55.120> for<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.390> magneto<00:04:55.840> are

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
coil and the magnets for the magneto are

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.510 
coil and the magnets for the magneto are
in<00:04:56.110> there<00:04:58.320> but<00:04:59.320> yeah<00:04:59.650> if<00:04:59.920> you<00:05:00.040> guys<00:05:00.160> have<00:05:00.400> any

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
in there but yeah if you guys have any

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.360 
in there but yeah if you guys have any
ideas<00:05:00.910> about<00:05:01.150> that<00:05:01.750> let<00:05:02.410> me<00:05:02.500> know<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:04.030> then<00:05:04.780> I

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
ideas about that let me know and then I

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.740 
ideas about that let me know and then I
got<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.550> get<00:05:06.640> this<00:05:06.820> off<00:05:09.240> because<00:05:10.240> this<00:05:10.570> was

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
got to get this off because this was

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.160 
got to get this off because this was
what<00:05:11.970> powered<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.000> hydraulic<00:05:13.540> this<00:05:13.750> spawn<00:05:14.140> a

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170
