00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.040
 contest 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.649
 hello to all I wish it to be like this but of me it goes 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:15.649
 very well 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.039
 here it is that is done 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.829
 to the fact on a series of 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.900
 I do not know if it's cured of a party 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.980
 I mean level of matches on black horse 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.650
 I do not know too much I spent very little time on this game 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.660
 simply because I prefer modern warfare 2 the press that everyone 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.460
 his thing at my level of play 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.630
 so here you go see that's what I get a message from the one he 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.710
 love his son of a bitch 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.750
 I do not know at all what makes this young man say that mom 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.800
 is a prostitute 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.780
 but the game 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.400
 think you will agree that this subscriber is a 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.170
 subscriber 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.330
 naftal avenue to insult me 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.720
 especially when I'm in the match and lasts 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.010
 but the decrease of the receipts certainly not foot massages 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.430
 on a very hard match 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.670
 to appear in the video 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.880
 I have what is missing it's like that quite the contrary 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.820
 the mining giant they will be nine 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.540
 cherif what they want 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.700
 so I just wanted to tell you something 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.580
 these quests in the description of this video will go 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.750
 a moment listed vehicle to a video yesterday a part presents 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.020
 Installation 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.990
 while I had taken planned and first side video a long time ago 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 but I have never done against him 4 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.890
 here is 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.570
 so you find it on time 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.610
 why do not I the outgoing copy of trudy miller official offerings 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.650
 simply because it's totally out of context 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.700
 So here is 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.600
 like that you have it if you want it 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 so true that doing it is a very powerful weapon 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.299
 and I've been playing for a long time now I think it's the second one 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.040
 please the women I propose on the channel 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.330
 and honestly 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.240
 little cocker if even a lot and weapons much easier to use 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.420
 you will say that I am an enemy 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.170
 and then I went there and I lived 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.800
 at cff 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.000
 we will not present mayenne with 3 elected for the third championships 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.869
 five delegates see 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.209
 the mother how no harm to the limit I put very tall is 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.369
 really no problem 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:17.529
 month after 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.989
 it's normal that they come down easier to use than others 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.939
 if at the east and center facade 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.229
 beginners he would be much less christiane stahl 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.459
 and then it's a little short autonomy its weapons even if we find more 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.089
 in addition to the om 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:35.039
 prestige that scored six tries of the one that is a small trip 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.669
 I find that a little 

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.699
 a little oxygen after they do what they want they are there 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.369
 for fun I did not brave worn out other players 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.479
 unfortunately I want to say 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.149
 then apparently amused the only player 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:52.149
 can you make parody the goal is a little trick that I noticed 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.139
 these quests in modern warfare 3 they believed nÃ®mes the grenade launcher so 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:01.469
 while in modern warfare 2 and black ops' that he had been and especially 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.239
 criticized the end a little near the game 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.759
 I do not understand why they put it back in less than a month by three 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.939
 she could not listen to us on the spot there I start my second 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.319
 galette like what our party 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.349
 this fascinating a lot used 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.070
 waechter khadir but that's it 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.640
 so it amazes me that they submit to their club a bit for whom both 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.379
 previous opus 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.069
 after the info might not agree with me 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.899
 to go where 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:31.989
 lg players and then who explains bruno blackburn with the dogs 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.469
 the watchmaker stop playing with him the yes and lily collins in place 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.759
 as I do t &amp; d that I like 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:42.649
 simply because you do not have a dead time 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:43.789
 in the helicopter 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:47.179
 and I do most of the meetings myself thanks to some good jokes of 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:48.479
 redon cx-7 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.259
 all the better for you we'll say 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.259
 once by sand ghosts as usual 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.790
 so yes a rare asset that ghost be 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.139
 why use 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.159
 ben hebert the drone be used in friends that's all 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:04.060
 6 you do not take functions of m 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.260
 7 thierry like a pigeon on all sides because you want to be 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.620
 the only account the map reports Antoine what I do not want to be 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:15.779
 to personally travel on all classes 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:19.439
 except one perhaps interchrÃ©tien Thursday full in case 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:24.020
 but in principle in minimum each team the last third a throne so 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.379
 first goal of the ghostly match 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.520
 after that it's my personal opinion 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.720
 the gameplay is coming to an end if you had mine do not forget that you 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.430
 hast 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.070
 I hope you have that she had bowed well to the next one and I you 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.400
 say it bye-bye saliva
