00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.060
 I have the ones that there was a time that I wanted to make the recipe to spread 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.719
 it's an english meatloaf, so ask me on facebook to see if any 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.929
 I knew him 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:15.309
 but there was no luck 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.589
 and this morning I looked for the recipe on youtube and to my surprise there was a 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.140
 debon 11 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.520
 It seems to me that he is chasing me lately and I am going to prepare the first thing that 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.580

 the other day in youtube they made comment of sanpepe 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.980
 when you put boiled water 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.880
 Spain and the salt at the end because that's how you get to the boiling point 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.570
 efe with salt costs more and how you have seen then just before adding the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.580
 potatoes have gone to the assault after you put a pan on the fire with oil 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.670
 olive and I added c the ground beef 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.760
 you have to go chopping 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 the minced meat so that it is loose 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.190

 and we let it go about five minutes 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.150
 moving it from time to time so that it is done evenly 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.300

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.499
