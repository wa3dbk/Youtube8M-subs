00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
out a lot so many of us are used to

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.179 
out a lot so many of us are used to
pulling<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:34.020> line<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.890> we've<00:01:35.009> become

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
really good at that we've developed the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.380 
really good at that we've developed the
muscles<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.680> line<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.119> time<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
muscles in that line but it's time to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
muscles in that line but it's time to
try<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.810> hit<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.259> different<00:01:40.500> vector<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.310> the

try to hit a different vector of the
body<00:01:41.640> let's<00:01:42.270> try<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> tap<00:01:42.810> into<00:01:43.049> some<00:01:43.380> new

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.649 
body let's try to tap into some new
fibers<00:01:44.009> even<00:01:44.220> if<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.790> same<00:01:45.030> area<00:01:45.600> of

fibers even if it's in the same area of
the<00:01:45.780> body<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.680> kind<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.130> broaden<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the body but just kind of broaden the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.020 
the body but just kind of broaden the
sense<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.200> stress<00:01:49.590> throughout<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.310> muscle

sense of stress throughout the muscle
group<00:01:51.240> instead<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.899> one<00:01:52.170> particular

line<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.009> we're<00:01:53.310> used<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> moving<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.090> let's

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
line that we're used to moving in let's

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.260 
line that we're used to moving in let's
create<00:01:54.990> new<00:01:55.159> development<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> first

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
create new development so the first

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.700 
create new development so the first
thing<00:01:57.420> we're<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.469> we're<00:01:58.680> just

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
thing we're going to do is we're just

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.179 
thing we're going to do is we're just
going<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.130> roll<00:01:59.399> back<00:02:00.200> one<00:02:01.200> at<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> time<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
going to roll back one at a time and

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.039 
going to roll back one at a time and
you're<00:02:02.790> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.210> very<00:02:03.360> casually

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
you're going to do this very casually

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.990 
you're going to do this very casually
and<00:02:04.290> you're<00:02:04.979> not<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.369> come<00:02:05.579> up<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:05.939> high

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and you're not going to come up as high

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.550 
and you're not going to come up as high
as<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.719> you're<00:02:06.990> going<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.170> come<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.439> about

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
as you can you're going to come up about

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.050 
as you can you're going to come up about
75%<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.479> way<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.619> entire<00:02:10.890> time<00:02:11.060> feeling

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
75% of the way the entire time feeling

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.880 
75% of the way the entire time feeling
the<00:02:12.180> gravity

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
the gravity

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.500 
the gravity

the weight letting the weight kind of

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.390 
the weight letting the weight kind of
pull<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.960> down<00:02:15.170> at<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.530> same<00:02:15.830> time<00:02:16.130> you're

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
pull you down at the same time you're

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.199 
pull you down at the same time you're
coming<00:02:16.700> up<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:17.900> we're<00:02:18.080> rolling<00:02:18.230> back<00:02:18.680> about

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
coming up so we're rolling back about

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.600 
coming up so we're rolling back about
75%<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.420> maximum<00:02:21.050> height<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.530> again<00:02:22.130> feel

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the gravity of the weight you don't need

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.750 
the gravity of the weight you don't need
heavy<00:02:24.380> weights<00:02:24.590> for<00:02:24.770> this<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:25.069> use<00:02:25.220> sometimes

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
heavy weights for this I use sometimes

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.630 
heavy weights for this I use sometimes
25<00:02:26.660> 30<00:02:27.110> s<00:02:27.319> or<00:02:27.470> thirty<00:02:27.680> fives<00:02:28.010> okay<00:02:29.920> okay<00:02:30.920> then

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
25 30 s or thirty fives okay okay then

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.110 
25 30 s or thirty fives okay okay then
the<00:02:31.850> next<00:02:31.880> technique<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:33.850> think<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:34.940> this

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
the next technique is to think of this

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.240 
the next technique is to think of this
in<00:02:35.330> thirds<00:02:35.870> okay<00:02:36.500> I<00:02:36.530> want<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.830> think<00:02:37.070> of<00:02:37.160> a

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
in thirds okay I want you to think of a

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.880 
in thirds okay I want you to think of a
movement<00:02:37.520> in<00:02:37.970> thirds<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.870> first<00:02:39.140> we're<00:02:39.770> going

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
movement in thirds the first we're going

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.890 
movement in thirds the first we're going
to<00:02:40.040> come<00:02:40.190> up<00:02:40.340> one-third<00:02:40.820> of<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.000> way<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.390> second

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
to come up one-third of the way a second

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.250 
to come up one-third of the way a second
the<00:02:42.050> second<00:02:42.590> third<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:44.239> last<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.870> full

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
the second third and the last the full

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:57.120 
the second third and the last the full
third<00:02:45.770> okay<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:46.820> 1<00:02:47.510> 2<00:02:48.230> 3<00:02:49.330> 1<00:02:50.330> 2<00:02:50.600> 3<00:02:51.050> 1<00:02:52.209> 2<00:02:53.209> 3<00:02:53.930> 1<00:02:55.000> 2<00:02:56.000> 3

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
third okay so 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.690 
third okay so 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
next<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:59.480> is<00:02:59.540> akin<00:03:00.440> to<00:03:00.500> writing<00:03:01.250> with<00:03:01.430> your

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
next this is akin to writing with your

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.880 
next this is akin to writing with your
left<00:03:01.940> hand<00:03:02.150> if<00:03:02.420> your<00:03:02.570> righty<00:03:02.810> we're<00:03:03.530> writing

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
left hand if your righty we're writing

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.120 
left hand if your righty we're writing
with<00:03:04.220> your<00:03:04.519> right<00:03:05.360> hand<00:03:05.690> if<00:03:05.959> you're<00:03:06.230> lefty<00:03:06.709> it

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
with your right hand if you're lefty it

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.190 
with your right hand if you're lefty it
slows<00:03:07.489> things<00:03:07.519> down<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:08.090> little<00:03:08.269> bit<00:03:08.600> it<00:03:08.840> brings

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
slows things down a little bit it brings

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.710 
slows things down a little bit it brings
a<00:03:09.350> more<00:03:09.640> consciousness<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.060> exercise<00:03:11.480> and

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
a more consciousness to the exercise and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.180 
a more consciousness to the exercise and
it<00:03:11.780> makes<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.050> think<00:03:12.410> about<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.950> little<00:03:13.040> bit

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
it makes you think about it a little bit

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.430 
it makes you think about it a little bit
I<00:03:13.580> want<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.150> face<00:03:14.360> your<00:03:14.390> hands<00:03:14.930> the

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
opposite direction that you normally do

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.750 
opposite direction that you normally do
face<00:03:17.630> them<00:03:17.900> toward<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.470> mirror<00:03:18.709> or<00:03:19.190> away<00:03:19.489> from

want you to just pull up and
automatically<00:03:29.480> you'll<00:03:29.630> find<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.079> you're

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
automatically you'll find that you're

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
pulling up slower than you normally

there's<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:33.049> greater<00:03:33.350> consciousness<00:03:34.190> there's

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
there's a greater consciousness there's

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.479

a<00:03:34.850> greater<00:03:35.150> focus<00:03:35.570> on<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.290> area<00:03:36.650> because<00:03:37.400> you

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
a greater focus on the area because you

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:38.800 
a greater focus on the area because you
have<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.730> think<00:03:37.910> about<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.269> it's<00:03:38.390> not<00:03:38.540> so

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
have to think about it it's not so

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.030 
have to think about it it's not so
simple<00:03:39.019> because<00:03:39.260> we're<00:03:39.470> not<00:03:39.560> used<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.829> moving

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
simple because we're not used to moving

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.160 
simple because we're not used to moving
that<00:03:40.280> way<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:40.730> these<00:03:41.420> three<00:03:41.780> little

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
that way and these three little

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.870 
that way and these three little
