 c4 aircross infotainment and relationship 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.190
 mitsubishi we will see graphics and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.900
 operation that are not the classics 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.539
 that we have seen in the various powers mit di 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.789
 citroen home screen a little 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.090
 poor girl from a graphic point of view with 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.740
 however, many input possibilities 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.230
 especially with regards to audio 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.170
 because we have the radio we have a hard 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.180
 integrated disk in addition to the possibility if 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.250
 we open to insert cd and dvd dvd also 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.820
 videos fit into this slit 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.320
 I inserted a DVD with Tesco in the 23rd 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.550
 burned in but didn't read it 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.989
 therefore practically only read 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.910
 who the original DVDs or anyway maybe 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.469
 mastered some differently 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.160
 problem from this point of view then 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.469
 usb usb is placed here in below the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.510
 front armrest where there is also 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.900
 the entrance for the auxiliary and also for 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.260
 an analog video is also taken 12 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.010
 volts and if we want to power an ipod or 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.830
 everything 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.119
 a cell phone put in here for 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.920
 regarding two simple we enter 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.850
 immediately so we see the graphic of the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.159
 music player you browse by per 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.530
 folders let's go for example on lenny 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.110
 kravitz is also navigated however for 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.740
 arms by artist and by album 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.270
 clicking on these icons here on 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.850
 right we can define repetition 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.610
 causal or random excuse or go 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:48.130
 to visualize a help we return to the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.020
 home we are always surfing the web 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.570
 let's do for folders so let's go 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:57.759
 immediately to lenny kravitz here it is 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:01.470
 let's go to american women we are so down 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.470
 let's hear how it sounds 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.760
 the implant does not sound bad does not distort 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.100
 when we raise the bass to the maximum 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.980
 the others are also deep beautiful 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.360
 a pretty good sound quality 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.760
 the Bluetooth streaming and a little difficult 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.460
 find the setting for perin con 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.160
 bluetooth but then you have the voice is the 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.570
 bluetooth streaming work well 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.820
 what's a little slow is a little bit 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.040
 wind when we go to connect some 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.360
 USB 36 peripherals at being 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.650
 in greenhouses to avoid messing with i 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.710
 various connections we insert the cable of the 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.510
 of the iPhone and then go to 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.250
 use the iphone as ipod you will see there 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.200
 will take a little time now there 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.940
 I show the others in the meantime 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.890
 features that are especially those 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.810
 navigation a navigator who 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.910
 works very well I have to say that the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.790
 road to always do in a manner 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:10.070
 intelligent offers us three different three 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.970
 different roads when we decide a 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:17.060
 address now I'm putting a 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:20.100
 We give absolutely random address 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.680
 the beginning is he will start to calculate the 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.810
 the cuisine of 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.070
 have additional information 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.220
 then the position of the vehicle but 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:35.190
 especially the temperature in the last ones 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.190
 three hours and the altimeter the trip computer 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.750
 which also shows us the lap time 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.459
 of seconds so not very precise 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.290
 however for some itineraries that 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.790
 we often do could be useful 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.630
 to keep the speed under control 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.430
 average and average consumption the appropriate of 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.230
 enter the functionality of the mobile 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.569
 in this case I disconnected the 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.489
 the bluetooth let's go back like 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.110
 bluetooth audio works very well yes 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.290
 they feel very good and we hear a lot 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.659
 well from the voice possibility of 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.310
 also display the settings of 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.959
 conditioning directly here from 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.620
 touchscreen display 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.500
 here is display that maybe a little bit 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.780
 bright even if we go into the settings 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.019
 when we have strong daylight as in 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.840
 this case we do a little effort to 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.510
 to visualize I told you about the navigator 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.630
 that works well here the tools 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.900
 possibility to activate the tmc then the 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.979
 possibility to avoid queues always that 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.080
 the radio recognizes them thanks to the tmc here 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.210
 the ability to split the screen into 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.880
 unfortunately one or two maps here is not there 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.260
 the possibility of splitting the display e 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.539
 view information of 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.180
 navigator with the information of the 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.840
 then infotainment system when 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.389
 possibly change the here you have 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.130
 saw the apple turned on put us 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.840
 those two or three minutes once 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.539
 attacked no longer has this problem but 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.970
 the first time that time is connected 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.340
 activation is really slow on 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.130
 music server instead we are going to use 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.030
 the songs we have memorized 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.800
 on the equitable hard disk 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.910
 the operation is exactly like 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.360
 what we saw with the 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.419
 usb flash drive convenient on 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.090
 steering wheel on the left side the command 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.120
 voice for the phone for per 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.530
 answer the phone and to refuse 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.990
 the call while on the left 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.960
 we turn up we turn down the volume we change the 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.870
 stations and change the mode between ipod 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.400
 bluetooth auxiliary input or 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.650
 radio this is the relevant screen 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.190
 on the radio with the three favorites with the 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.520
 six storable stations for each 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.689
 favorite works well receives well every 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.519
 railway station 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:50.739
 the administration then an infotainment 

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:53.709
 from the good quality indeed excellent quality 

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:56.069
 audio only a bit slow on some 

00:05:53.709 --> 00:06:00.119
 functions such as connecting with 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:03.789
 good iphone in gps navigation 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:05.739
 unfortunately the graphics are not the last 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.169
 shout and even visibility under the 

00:06:05.739 --> 00:06:11.129
 sun is a bit undertone for walking 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.129
