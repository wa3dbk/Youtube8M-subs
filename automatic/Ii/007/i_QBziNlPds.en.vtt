 Yes 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.159
 living conditions children of civilization

 change our children 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.410
 and they stopped being clear 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.700
 there is a feeling I said hundreds 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.120
 parents who come to them 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.740
 consultation 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.290
 children have become different 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.170
 and old traditional methods of influencing 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.960
 of them 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.480
 just does not work 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.040
 for example for us was 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.770
 important is valuable 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.040
 phrase 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.990

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.070
 it was a holiday 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.130
 but now everything is wrong 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.260
 now have 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.290
 the Internet 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.410
 computers 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.070
 tangerines every day 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.320
 or for most children 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.390
 parents 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.770
 ceased to be 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.890
 apple giver 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.420
 or protection in the world 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.390
 parents became 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.970
 often just an obstacle because 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.420
 which is hardly you 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.650
 m 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.240

 And also I will watch TV 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.800
 television match 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.550
 children require their parents to 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.310
 bought new 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.650

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.360
 delicacy the driver could refuse 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.440
 for reasons unknown to screw it is not a fault 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.249
 Makarenko 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:51.770
 no, these are completely different children 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.920
 reality procedure 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.830
 reality then abundance reality 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.840
 which does held like 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.270
 however, there is and what will happen next 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.400
 Society and what is there not offended you your 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.850
 children be quiet first steps 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.690
 and sorry for that 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.059
 the term is spending them by yourself 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:11.179
 connect to your hands 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:12.480
 to your voice 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.899
 your reaction 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.279
 in a very comforting 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:16.329
 attentive 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.039
 open 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:19.989
 besides 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.530
 this communication 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.339
 seemingly foolish child 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.799
 format operating environment 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.699
 his mind is like this 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:29.969
 computer technology 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.309
 operating room 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:34.279
 environment in consciousness where parents 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:37.579
 Thio imagery enters the plan 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:38.810
 which are close 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.179
 him with himself 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.709
 fill the child's mind 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.139
 in your images 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.579
 but this does not mean that we must be tough 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.709
 format the disk remember that in your 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.179
 the child has his own birth 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:54.069
 program 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.289
 what are you already holding him close and 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:58.030
 understandably 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.569
 and the fact that only he will not take from you 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.689
 what circumstances 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:04.799
 so 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.899
 which dictates the baby every step 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:10.829
 starting from the cradle imposes his 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.619
 demeanor and your on the rolls of the world 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.799
 bad for baby 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.459
 we are always caring for the child and filling 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.499
 his life calls Kiev images playing with 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:22.570
 him constantly 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.099
 should leave him free 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.209
 freedom of choice 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.589
 I repeat again 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:31.459
 parents who ignore their 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.349
 child, someone does not forgive her attention 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.510
 also harmful 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.800
 how are you the parent who controls 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.449
 every step 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.269
 we have to be careful 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.329
 open and still allow the child 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.919
 free to draw from us 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.249
 those courses of action are those programs that 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.239
 are close to him 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.829
 fathers especially should not 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:53.980
 disengages 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.790
 because their energy 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.760
 their attitude to life is their strength 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.349
 these are necessary additions 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.259
 how are things afloat left care attention 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:05.009
 mothers 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:06.279
 strengthened as 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.919
 should be twos on the child should be affected 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.909
 and dad and mom 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.339
 and they should be in harmony 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:15.309
 each one must be 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:16.489
 individuality 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.349
 each of them should contribute community union from 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:20.030
 mite 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.269
 but in between 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.740
 there must be harmony which gives the child 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.199
 feeling of confidence strength and 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.749
 predictability of the world 

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:28.819
 well, the best way 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:30.659
 child interactions 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.219
 this is games with him play with baby nike first 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:38.620
 years of his life up to 15 and 16 we note 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.060
 plays best of all parents 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.430
 and when is it a way of knowing the world 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.430
 Moreover, the way of knowing the world is 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.430
 emotionally colored 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.580
 and always with feedback 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.479
 require multi-channel 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:57.999
 meaning baby 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.649
 plays to get pleasure from it 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:02.539
 fulfills new images separately 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:03.129
 all this 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:04.010
 word 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.310
 launches pick u find new ways 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.660
 solutions 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.860
 enjoy again but 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.640
 then this is similar at this place like 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.539
 computer which 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.889
 how is he his burden to type information 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.830
 raise your programs and expands 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.789
 own opportunities 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.870
 nevertheless adults are needed here 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.259
 because in many cases 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.680
 from the child just do not have enough images 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.970
 in order to 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.300
 by myself 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.379
 built yourself the rules of the game 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:34.629
 on the second 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.740
 for an adult to play with a child is the most 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.999
 comfortable 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:40.439
 most 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:41.860
 safe 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.800
 painless way 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.110
 impose on a child 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.710
 your expectations 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.479
 own programs 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.589
 its value system 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:53.800
 so the game 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.169
 Well, I'm starting 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.349
 factory 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:59.080
 simple toys 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.509
 people 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:01.839
 Besides 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:06.139
 2 this enterprise through the game to explain 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:06.750
 my daughter 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.860
 what rules exist in 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.740
 relationship between you in real life if 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.490
 you explain when to lead a doll 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.450
 These are the rules of the game. The rules of the game are necessary. 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.680
 observe and point gets used to observe 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.229
 rules of the game for example obey mom 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:22.789
 study ideology 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:24.899
 where what to speak immediately and for themselves and 

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:27.080
 the prosecutor's office is coping with it
