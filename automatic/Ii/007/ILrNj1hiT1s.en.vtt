00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
cyanide type compound and that's also

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.380 
cyanide type compound and that's also
found<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.190> seeds<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> berries<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.239> it

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
found in the seeds of the berries as it

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.750 
found in the seeds of the berries as it
matures<00:00:54.719> but<00:00:55.050> when<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.320> young<00:00:55.620> like<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.160> we

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
matures but when it's young like this we

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.060 
matures but when it's young like this we
get<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.120> nice<00:00:57.440> gentle<00:00:58.440> chemistry<00:00:58.920> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
get that nice gentle chemistry that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.119 
get that nice gentle chemistry that
effervescent<00:00:59.969> relaxing<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.140> just<00:01:01.199> really

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
effervescent relaxing and just really

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.700 
effervescent relaxing and just really
gentle<00:01:02.550> compounds<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.110> useful<00:01:04.500> for

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
gentle compounds that can be useful for

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.190 
gentle compounds that can be useful for
medicine<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.640> that's<00:01:06.299> totally<00:01:06.630> safe<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.049> so
