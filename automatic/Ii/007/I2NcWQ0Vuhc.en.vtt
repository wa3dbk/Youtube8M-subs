00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
popular size I think because my friend

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.939 
popular size I think because my friend
was<00:00:49.980> trying<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.550> get<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:52.440> salesperson

months<00:00:57.829> to<00:00:58.829> get<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.390> got<00:01:00.600> assume<00:01:01.109> that

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
months to get it so we got assume that

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.979 
months to get it so we got assume that
there<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> very<00:01:02.219> popular<00:01:02.550> size<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.570> so
