00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello bass galley playing is starting 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.690
 but a daily life checkpoint of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.069
 news of the kiss quoted not yet 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.929
 has enrolled in the channel 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.300
 click up or down and stay 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.889
 knowing all about the world games are missing 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.719
 two weeks to launch the new 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.789
 the last of fame in the version of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.260
 playstation 4 is curious to know 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.960
 What are the changes? 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.220
 Elton does not take advantage of anyone else's advantage. 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.289
 and see the commercial they made for 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.660
 link on television and promote the game 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.019
 the commercial is very short and soundtrack 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.640
 the wonderful gustavo santoalalla between 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.190
 they tell us the news we have to play 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.110
 will have 1080p resolution with 60 frames 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.540
 both 15 and 15 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.000
 multiplayer texture maps will have 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.040
 four times more detailed maps of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.059
 shadows are twice as good 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.920
 we will also have the possibility 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.320
 to switch triggers control and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.629
 and the game will be supported or 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.520
 the four clash with the touchpad bar 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.140
 gold and loudspeakers 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.120
 the touchpad will be used to open the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.980
 backpack and the loading of the game is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.300
 practically instantaneous beyond 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.520
 audio recordings now that they are 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.470
 played directly on the control without 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.630
 need to access the menu and pause the game 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.820
 but only this not only some things that I 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.380
 I've listed it in the news you can see other 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.090
 novelties and also a comparison of 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.180
 graphs between the two platforms 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.460
 game looks like gta5 will win one of them 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.479
 It's a lot of fun for 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.909
 on duty 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.189
 apparently two new clubs will be 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.770
 added to the game but in the second 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.780
 youtube user the game motorcycle 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.310
 might have been little for players and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.299
 I do not think anyone will complain if they have 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.070
 two more right 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.750
 because even if you think it's bad, it 's just not 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.820
 to download the package but it is 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.250
 likely to be really is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.020
 other spaces are also 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.720
 available and not only the two 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.820
 clubs and if it is actually launched 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.979
 would you buy a 0 to expedite nor 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.810
 was announced and soon entered beta 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.630
 and I as promised to visceral games 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.700
 listen to feedback from fans and there is launched 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.799
 list of 10 improvements that the game will 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.780
 receive the first improvement of the list is the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.700
 reducing the frequency of explosives 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.450
 which leaves the use of pumps much more 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.310
 realist 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.960
 then enters a renaming list of the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.390
 class of mechanics and rebalancing 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.220
 new graphical interface that will let 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.379
 with rudi that will give you absolute certainty 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.950
 that this is the online radio and none 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.349
 other field up customization 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.629
 is much clearer and easier and matches 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.580
 will last well over and looks that neither 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.260
 half of the same unhurried changes 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.000
 everything will be improved can know the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.830
 news that is here in the description gives me 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.870
 one as incredible as it may seem 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.090
 yes you can integrate isolation line 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.530
 without killing a single person at least 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.989
 not directly 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.849
 according to Guerra INEP design chief 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.550
 game and is due to artificial intelligence 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.440
 of the game it gives you the possibility to 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.330
 to avoid conflicts with android who care 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.549
 certain objects by 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.049
 example just giving back the same 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.790
 thing happens with 11 years with 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.370
 difference that it is possible to have ali 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.319
 Until them, why does he do work today? 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.329
 opens the path that was locked in 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.430
 relation to the items of the game net 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.560
 that they have no fixed positions 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.599
 making the game run a little bit around the 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.400
 metroid style come or you can 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.680
 back to places you've passed 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.170
 to explore finding items that can 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.849
 until you release new areas but like you 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.380
 You can not outrun the the 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.840
 Remember to run away, you must always be 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.739
 alert and use stealth tactics to 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.950
 survive 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.560
 sky people somebody else goes in cras 2 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.739
 in third person to stay very 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.690
 bizarre is bound only the regent user does not 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.489
 had a lot to do braid a game in 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.750
 third person thinking it was up to 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.750
 funny, huh? 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.450
 but it was really scary but the 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.190
 s &amp; p bizarro there is explanation is that a 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.139
 game made totally in first person 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.910
 is programmed to let the movement 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.430
 in this type of camera more fluid 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.290
 possible to save time and 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.359
 lines of code there is no need to 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.739
 to animate everything just a few details of the 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.049
 arms and face 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.239
 but the idea is so innovative not so long ago 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.060
 that the same has already been done with dener alan 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.569
 m rose the result the two is the one that 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.569
 are you seeing now? 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.160
 I already told you to take a shower. 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.110
 Blood, because we're in 10. 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.190
 very violent moments of the games do not 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.780
 stop checking 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.520
 I really hope you liked it. 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.290
 the bridge today is reminding us 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.739
 of course you have not yet registered with 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.630
 channel 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.580
 click above or below give a book 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.100
 video already written enjoy the une 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.360
 but leverages based on social networks 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.360
 beauty until tomorrow
