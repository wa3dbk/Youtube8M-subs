why<00:06:06.800> that<00:06:06.980> is<00:06:07.190> but<00:06:07.220> well<00:06:07.700> I<00:06:07.730> do<00:06:07.850> know<00:06:08.060> why<00:06:08.180> that

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
why that is but well I do know why that

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.640 
why that is but well I do know why that
is<00:06:08.450> because<00:06:08.660> they<00:06:08.900> have<00:06:08.930> tremendous<00:06:09.470> hunger

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
is because they have tremendous hunger

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.100 
is because they have tremendous hunger
and<00:06:10.430> they<00:06:11.000> want<00:06:11.210> to<00:06:11.300> be<00:06:11.390> the<00:06:11.510> best<00:06:11.690> and<00:06:11.990> they
