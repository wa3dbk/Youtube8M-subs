trailer<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.230> you<00:01:57.470> know<00:01:57.710> would<00:01:58.360> go<00:01:59.360> on<00:01:59.450> the

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
trailer that you know would go on the

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.230 
trailer that you know would go on the
back<00:01:59.720> here<00:02:00.050> but<00:02:00.650> basically<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:01.760> lady<00:02:02.000> that

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
back here but basically the lady that

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.690 
back here but basically the lady that
had<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.840> she<00:02:03.200> didn't<00:02:03.470> tie<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.800> trailer<00:02:04.550> on

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
had it she didn't tie the trailer on

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.330 
had it she didn't tie the trailer on
right<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:06.140> smacked<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:06.979> I<00:02:07.040> spilled

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
right and it smacked that and I spilled

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.889 
right and it smacked that and I spilled
this<00:02:07.550> all<00:02:07.760> in<00:02:07.909> with<00:02:08.030> silicone<00:02:08.539> I<00:02:08.569> thought<00:02:08.869> I

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
this all in with silicone I thought I

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.050 
this all in with silicone I thought I
did<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.170> really<00:02:09.379> good<00:02:09.649> job<00:02:09.890> but<00:02:10.549> I<00:02:10.609> just<00:02:10.670> took<00:02:10.999> a

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
did a really good job but I just took a

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.720 
did a really good job but I just took a
jug<00:02:11.420> of<00:02:11.569> water<00:02:11.719> and<00:02:12.260> with<00:02:12.889> all<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.189> carpet<00:02:13.609> and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
jug of water and with all the carpet and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.440 
jug of water and with all the carpet and
everything<00:02:13.760> pulled<00:02:14.329> up<00:02:14.480> along<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.989> track

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
everything pulled up along that track

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.540 
everything pulled up along that track
where<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.690> wire<00:02:15.900> goes<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.560> poured<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.340> water

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
where the wire goes I poured the water

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.009 
where the wire goes I poured the water
on<00:02:17.879> and<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.540> water<00:02:18.780> went<00:02:19.140> up<00:02:19.379> inside<00:02:19.620> here<00:02:21.019> and

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
on and the water went up inside here and

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.720 
on and the water went up inside here and
the<00:02:22.230> longest<00:02:22.620> track<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.190> can<00:02:23.370> see<00:02:23.550> where<00:02:23.700> I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the longest track you can see where I

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.089 
the longest track you can see where I
poured<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.120> water<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.720> all<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.500> water<00:02:25.830> went

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
poured the water and all the water went

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.309 
poured the water and all the water went
behind<00:02:26.310> here<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.150> down<00:02:27.599> in<00:02:27.870> there<00:02:28.110> so

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
behind here and down in there so

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.040 
behind here and down in there so
whenever<00:02:29.099> they<00:02:29.280> put<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.610> glass<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:29.940> they<00:02:30.870> did

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
whenever they put the glass in they did

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.040 
whenever they put the glass in they did
a<00:02:31.080> crappy<00:02:31.470> job<00:02:31.650> installing<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> glass<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.480> so

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
a crappy job installing the glass and so

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.009 
a crappy job installing the glass and so
there's<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.920> leak<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.910> goes<00:02:36.209> along<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.569> side

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
there's a leak that goes along the side

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.140 
there's a leak that goes along the side
of<00:02:37.200> here<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.650> instead<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.400> draining<00:02:38.730> out<00:02:39.120> the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
of here and instead of draining out the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.180 
of here and instead of draining out the
bottom<00:02:39.690> here<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.349> supposed<00:02:40.739> to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
bottom here like it's supposed to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.490 
bottom here like it's supposed to
it<00:02:41.610> just<00:02:41.849> goes<00:02:41.970> down<00:02:42.269> inside<00:02:42.660> into<00:02:43.049> this<00:02:43.200> I

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
it just goes down inside into this I

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.330 
it just goes down inside into this I
assume<00:02:44.269> so<00:02:45.269> I've<00:02:45.450> got<00:02:45.660> two<00:02:45.840> options<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:47.099> pull

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
assume so I've got two options and pull

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.750 
assume so I've got two options and pull
the<00:02:47.459> glass<00:02:47.730> out<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.630> fix<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.290> body<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:50.130> get

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the glass out and fix the body and get

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.100 
the glass out and fix the body and get
everything<00:02:50.970> straightened<00:02:51.480> out<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.930> then

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
everything straightened out and then

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.910 
everything straightened out and then
mount<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.380> glass<00:02:52.769> again<00:02:53.040> properly<00:02:54.709> my<00:02:55.709> other

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
mount the glass again properly my other

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.759 
mount the glass again properly my other
option<00:02:56.579> but<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.900> includes<00:02:58.290> pulling<00:02:58.680> the

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
option but and that includes pulling the

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.920 
option but and that includes pulling the
headliner<00:02:59.099> down<00:02:59.430> pulling<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.060> sides<00:03:00.390> out<00:03:00.690> and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
headliner down pulling the sides out and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.170 
headliner down pulling the sides out and
pull<00:03:01.110> in<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.230> back<00:03:01.349> seat<00:03:01.680> out<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.190> that's

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
pull in the back seat out of this that's

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.140 
pull in the back seat out of this that's
a<00:03:03.299> lot<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.510> work<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.930> do<00:03:04.079> it<00:03:04.170> properly<00:03:04.549> or<00:03:05.549> I<00:03:05.880> can

so<00:03:43.380> I'm<00:03:43.470> not<00:03:43.620> going<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:43.889> do<00:03:44.340> it<00:03:44.489> just<00:03:44.730> now<00:03:44.819> but

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
so I'm not going to do it just now but

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.180 
so I'm not going to do it just now but
at<00:03:45.569> least<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:45.870> tracked<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.350> down<00:03:46.590> by<00:03:46.829> pouring

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
at least I tracked it down by pouring

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.979 
at least I tracked it down by pouring
the<00:03:47.310> water<00:03:47.430> down<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:48.090> like<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.780> see

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
the water down that like you can see

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.860 
the water down that like you can see
right<00:03:49.650> here<00:03:49.920> it's<00:03:50.100> dry<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:51.090> was<00:03:51.239> just<00:03:51.510> pour<00:03:51.750> it

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
right here it's dry it was just pour it

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.539 
right here it's dry it was just pour it
I<00:03:52.109> poured<00:03:52.350> the<00:03:52.440> water<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:52.980> every<00:03:53.220> time<00:03:53.430> it

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
I poured the water so every time it

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.400 
I poured the water so every time it
rained<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:54.030> rained<00:03:54.090> ran<00:03:54.630> off<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:55.049> there<00:03:55.230> it

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
rained and rained ran off of there it

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.720 
rained and rained ran off of there it
would<00:03:55.530> just<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:56.040> know<00:03:56.069> because<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.639> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
would just you know because of the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.059 
would just you know because of the
tension<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.389> water<00:03:57.540> surface<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.950> would

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
tension of the water surface it would

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.979 
tension of the water surface it would
just<00:03:59.310> pour<00:03:59.519> itself<00:03:59.910> right<00:04:00.180> down<00:04:00.420> in<00:04:00.660> there<00:04:00.840> and

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
just pour itself right down in there and

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.140 
just pour itself right down in there and
just<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.440> know<00:04:01.889> just<00:04:02.010> like<00:04:02.370> funneling<00:04:03.030> it

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
just you know just like funneling it

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.229 
just you know just like funneling it
down<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.510> track<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.590> would<00:04:04.739> go<00:04:04.889> down<00:04:05.239> the

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
down the track and it would go down the

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.830 
down the track and it would go down the
inside<00:04:06.720> in<00:04:07.079> here<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:08.269> apologize<00:04:09.269> it's<00:04:09.420> so<00:04:09.540> dark

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
inside in here I apologize it's so dark

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.039 
inside in here I apologize it's so dark
but<00:04:10.170> go<00:04:10.739> down<00:04:10.950> inside<00:04:11.430> here<00:04:11.849> and<00:04:12.000> then<00:04:12.780> just

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
but go down inside here and then just

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.990 
but go down inside here and then just
down<00:04:13.319> along<00:04:13.709> this<00:04:13.919> carpet<00:04:14.430> line<00:04:14.579> where<00:04:14.910> the

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
down along this carpet line where the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.360 
down along this carpet line where the
wires<00:04:15.239> and<00:04:15.569> everything<00:04:15.660> are<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.650> then<00:04:17.220> it

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
wires and everything are and then it

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.800 
wires and everything are and then it
would<00:04:17.519> just<00:04:17.549> pull<00:04:17.940> up<00:04:17.970> here<00:04:18.359> because<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.690> was

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
would just pull up here because that was

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.979 
would just pull up here because that was
the<00:04:18.930> lowest<00:04:19.109> point<00:04:19.289> at<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:20.010> floorboard<00:04:20.989> but

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
the lowest point at the floorboard but

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.810 
the lowest point at the floorboard but
I'm<00:04:22.349> just<00:04:22.500> glad<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.979> find<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.460> cuz<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.729> was

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
I'm just glad to find it cuz that was

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.980 
I'm just glad to find it cuz that was
driving<00:04:24.060> me<00:04:24.330> crazy

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
driving me crazy

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.119 
driving me crazy
I<00:04:25.830> put<00:04:26.520> in<00:04:26.669> these<00:04:27.140> you<00:04:28.140> know<00:04:28.260> these<00:04:28.409> catch<00:04:28.650> man

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
I put in these you know these catch man

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:30.469 
I put in these you know these catch man
because<00:04:29.309> I<00:04:29.399> thought<00:04:29.550> it<00:04:29.729> was<00:04:29.819> from<00:04:30.029> my<00:04:30.209> ski

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
because I thought it was from my ski

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.149 
because I thought it was from my ski
boots<00:04:30.509> or<00:04:31.020> winter<00:04:31.289> boots<00:04:31.499> and<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:31.919> thought<00:04:32.069> it

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
boots or winter boots and I thought it

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.100 
boots or winter boots and I thought it
was<00:04:32.279> all<00:04:32.399> melt<00:04:32.699> so<00:04:33.149> I<00:04:33.179> bought<00:04:33.449> these<00:04:33.659> to<00:04:33.929> hold

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
was all melt so I bought these to hold

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.529 
was all melt so I bought these to hold
the<00:04:34.229> water<00:04:34.439> and<00:04:34.649> I<00:04:34.889> still<00:04:35.189> get<00:04:35.399> in<00:04:35.489> water<00:04:35.759> it's

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
the water and I still get in water it's

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.600 
the water and I still get in water it's
like<00:04:36.629> what<00:04:36.929> in<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.110> world<00:04:37.319> is<00:04:37.409> going<00:04:37.739> on<00:04:37.830> but

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
like what in the world is going on but

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.850 
like what in the world is going on but
that's<00:04:38.969> what<00:04:39.179> it<00:04:39.269> was

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
that's what it was

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.639 
that's what it was
so<00:04:40.860> anyway<00:04:41.789> another<00:04:42.239> guy<00:04:42.509> he<00:04:42.749> was<00:04:42.899> saying<00:04:43.169> that

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:43.649 
so anyway another guy he was saying that

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
the weather stripping's here if these go

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.509 
the weather stripping's here if these go
bad<00:04:45.839> it<00:04:46.139> can<00:04:46.289> be<00:04:46.319> a<00:04:46.409> problem<00:04:46.739> and<00:04:47.129> cause<00:04:47.369> the

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:47.519 
bad it can be a problem and cause the

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:50.540 
bad it can be a problem and cause the
same<00:04:47.789> issue<00:04:48.029> and<00:04:48.839> also<00:04:49.289> you<00:04:49.949> see<00:04:50.129> that<00:04:50.159> little

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
same issue and also you see that little

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.429 
same issue and also you see that little
oval<00:04:51.089> right<00:04:51.269> there<00:04:51.509> that's<00:04:51.689> called<00:04:52.019> the<00:04:52.139> door

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
oval right there that's called the door

oval right there that's called the door
drain<00:04:52.800> if<00:04:53.399> water<00:04:53.699> gets<00:04:53.969> in<00:04:54.269> on<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.509> outside<00:04:54.989> of

drain if water gets in on the outside of

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.049 
drain if water gets in on the outside of
the<00:04:55.229> window<00:04:55.649> you<00:04:56.219> know<00:04:56.339> like<00:04:56.580> say<00:04:56.849> these

00:04:57.049 --> 00:04:57.059 
the window you know like say these

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:58.850 
the window you know like say these
things<00:04:57.330> aren't<00:04:57.539> sealing<00:04:57.959> properly<00:04:58.229> on<00:04:58.709> the

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
things aren't sealing properly on the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.009 
things aren't sealing properly on the
door<00:04:59.069> if<00:04:59.879> they<00:04:59.999> go<00:05:00.149> in<00:05:00.300> there<00:05:00.509> then<00:05:00.719> the<00:05:00.749> water

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:01.019 
door if they go in there then the water

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:03.259 
door if they go in there then the water
supposed<00:05:01.349> to<00:05:01.469> drain<00:05:01.649> out<00:05:01.860> along<00:05:02.129> there<00:05:02.399> but

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:03.269 
supposed to drain out along there but

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:05.629 
supposed to drain out along there but
that's<00:05:03.569> all<00:05:03.869> downhill<00:05:04.139> along<00:05:04.709> this<00:05:04.949> body<00:05:05.279> line

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
that's all downhill along this body line

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.969 
that's all downhill along this body line
and<00:05:06.029> plus<00:05:06.509> there's<00:05:06.749> the<00:05:06.899> pinch<00:05:07.139> weld<00:05:07.409> that's

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
and plus there's the pinch weld that's

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.399 
and plus there's the pinch weld that's
right<00:05:08.249> here<00:05:08.580> that<00:05:09.479> would<00:05:09.569> keep<00:05:09.719> the<00:05:09.929> water<00:05:10.139> out

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
right here that would keep the water out

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.109 
right here that would keep the water out
so<00:05:10.439> I<00:05:10.649> knew<00:05:10.769> it<00:05:10.860> wasn't<00:05:11.039> that<00:05:11.339> all<00:05:11.669> my<00:05:11.819> plugs

00:05:12.109 --> 00:05:12.119 
so I knew it wasn't that all my plugs

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:13.669 
so I knew it wasn't that all my plugs
and<00:05:12.419> everything<00:05:12.779> else<00:05:12.929> there<00:05:13.139> okay<00:05:13.469> and

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:13.679 
and everything else there okay and

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:15.679 
and everything else there okay and
there's<00:05:14.309> no<00:05:14.399> holes<00:05:14.759> in<00:05:14.969> the<00:05:15.119> bottom<00:05:15.479> of<00:05:15.599> the

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:15.689 
there's no holes in the bottom of the

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.100 
there's no holes in the bottom of the
pan<00:05:16.099> the<00:05:17.099> floor<00:05:17.490> pan<00:05:17.729> so<00:05:18.479> those<00:05:18.839> are<00:05:18.990> the

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
pan the floor pan so those are the

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.779 
pan the floor pan so those are the
things<00:05:19.289> to<00:05:19.439> look<00:05:19.649> for<00:05:19.979> and<00:05:20.309> the<00:05:20.429> best<00:05:20.610> way<00:05:20.759> to
