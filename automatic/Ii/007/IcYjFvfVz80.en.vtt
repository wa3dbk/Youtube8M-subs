00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.790
 what's up with jappy to start again ? 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.980
 have a little interview action and today 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.519
 i follow another gas last thing 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:19.770
 the manuel of broken swamp today is it 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:24.300
 he wanted to paint with her a bit 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.650
 I have to say about strong 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.660
 of course take care a little bit 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.120
 It is not totally ambivalent year 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.200
 tells Texas offline how 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.350
 did you find the first season? 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:44.270
 So as a lack away was good fun 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.540
 The thing is so you were the project 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.150
 is kunga and me through you 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.050
 almost originated 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.390
 I think it's a pity that we actually 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.820
 not those can be the most 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.989
 recorded and fun what he is 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.570
 just on it on the channel 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.580
 that time and I did not have that much time 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.450
 had to record together or too 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.450
 nothing loss 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.329
 but so basically the recordings 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.380
 we can all do horny and 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.560
 I still find the idea cool 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.710
 that's why books start graduation 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.869
 I know what you are or just about it 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.420
 said what he was so in the crawl in 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:27.240
 strong season 2 has made something 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.240
 are your goals in season 2? 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.840
 I want at least once a season 2 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.450
 would also record 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.799
 no i just have fun so 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.899
 channel and there is nothing now 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.759
 great at a goal not one that 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.340
 So minecraft vanilla is the only one 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.619
 what I've planned is fun 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.630
 and if it changes now that I do 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.039
 People trolling a bit or something 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.740
 horny farmer or so we see then 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.420
 Yes 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.700
 do you also realize that in that 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.250
 I do not just do that house 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.509
 I can talk about his 14 Sauerland 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.509
 oettinger yes ok 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:17.860
 so vigorously as just just now 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:21.730
 you said with nico and I have that 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.110
 yes put together on the legs but 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.090
 I can no longer think of a question 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.590
 That's why I'm talking some shit 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.980
 you want something else to the people 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.150
 say again in the future 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.150
 may see vigorously 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.930
 on the one hand just that time 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.310
 a little changed 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.410
 has and a little smaller again 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.000
 what has become so not all now 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.840
 people in power to the end 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.640
 they were right at the beginning of 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.840
 from the second season doing that and there 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.109
 also a bit to do with that 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.660
 you sorted out the people in the nothing 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.010
 have done and as always better 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.750
 if he is with a smaller group 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.519
 starts and then could 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.810
 So I think so too 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.000
 right here with us on the channel is indeed 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.400
 a little something else, it is 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.370
 maybe the first season 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.480
 Let's see I am I am not me 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.690
 I'm also curious 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.079
 i would like to greet someone one has just 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.079
 let out big 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:31.419
 okay good to many greetings of the city not 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:34.150
 I think I would have solved that 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:37.480
 Say goodbye that was painted by broken 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.950
 swamp to the new and old power plant 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.769
 Staffel times to look I'm still like that 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.430
 in front of the microphone I would ask and ask 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.049
 answer stands 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.049
 So until next time are mistakes
