down in a certain area you know maybe
they'll<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.530> used<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:28.890> escape<00:01:29.310> which<00:01:29.490> was

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
they'll be used for escape which was

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.100 
they'll be used for escape which was
well<00:01:30.030> honestly<00:01:30.509> that's<00:01:30.689> what<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> hunter<00:01:31.049> is

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
well honestly that's what the hunter is

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.350 
well honestly that's what the hunter is
good<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.530> escape<00:01:32.100> honestly<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.000> maybe<00:01:33.210> it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
good for escape honestly so maybe it

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.830 
good for escape honestly so maybe it
would<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.689> highly<00:01:34.020> useful<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:35.040> I've<00:01:35.490> already

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
would be highly useful but I've already

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.539 
would be highly useful but I've already
had<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.170> know<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> support<00:01:37.920> class<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.430> that's

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
had you know a support class and that's

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.340 
had you know a support class and that's
a<00:01:38.640> son<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.180> sun<00:01:39.390> sea<00:01:39.540> girt<00:01:39.689> radiant<00:01:40.259> skin

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
a son see the sun sea girt radiant skin

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.710 
a son see the sun sea girt radiant skin
it<00:01:40.590> allows<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.009> reduce<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.579> cool<00:01:41.820> time<00:01:42.150> for

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
it allows you reduce to cool time for

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.590 
it allows you reduce to cool time for
your<00:01:42.930> allies<00:01:43.380> grenades<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.490> melee<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.420> they

this<00:02:12.330> stuff<00:02:12.420> unlocked<00:02:12.870> already<00:02:13.080> but

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
this stuff unlocked already but

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.530 
this stuff unlocked already but
it<00:02:13.620> did<00:02:13.860> not<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.670> take<00:02:15.090> everything<00:02:15.390> with<00:02:15.450> a

we're<00:02:18.120> going<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.330> get<00:02:18.480> these<00:02:18.690> abilities<00:02:18.989> just

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
we're going to get these abilities just

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.380 
we're going to get these abilities just
by<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.830> cutscenes<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.700> showed<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.030> of

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
by the cutscenes that I showed you of

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
course but I'm talkin about this your

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.460 
course but I'm talkin about this your
power<00:02:23.790> let's<00:02:24.239> say<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.930> launch<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
power let's say on the launch the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.580 
power let's say on the launch the
longitude<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.360> Warlocks<00:02:27.840> lightning<00:02:28.319> may

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
change the radius of the gravity bone

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.530 
change the radius of the gravity bone
may<00:02:33.030> change<00:02:33.390> as<00:02:33.750> well<00:02:34.200> now<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.730> shockwave<00:02:36.300> may

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
may change as well now the shockwave may

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.960 
may change as well now the shockwave may
be<00:02:36.599> a<00:02:36.750> bit<00:02:37.080> shorter<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:37.950> hammer<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.670> well

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970
