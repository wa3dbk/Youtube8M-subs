off<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.189> can<00:00:26.340> see<00:00:26.550> there's<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.090> lot<00:00:27.240> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
off you can see there's a lot of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.689 
off you can see there's a lot of
redstone<00:00:27.630> if<00:00:27.960> your<00:00:28.140> rest<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.800> savvy<00:00:29.250> like<00:00:29.429> you

redstone if your rest on savvy like you

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.519 
redstone if your rest on savvy like you
know<00:00:30.359> how<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> use<00:00:30.630> redstone<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.289> should<00:00:31.439> be

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
know how to use redstone this should be

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.620 
know how to use redstone this should be
fairly<00:00:31.710> simple<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:33.030> if<00:00:33.149> you're<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:33.420> I

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
fairly simple but if you're not I

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.840 
fairly simple but if you're not I
apologize<00:00:34.350> I'm<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.130> best<00:00:35.280> at<00:00:35.399> explaining

apologize I'm not the best at explaining
but<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.630> can<00:00:36.750> see<00:00:36.960> redstone<00:00:37.590> repeaters<00:00:38.190> are

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
but you can see redstone repeaters are

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.610 
but you can see redstone repeaters are
linked<00:00:38.760> dispensers<00:00:39.329> every<00:00:39.809> other<00:00:39.930> dispenser

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
linked dispensers every other dispenser

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.459 
linked dispensers every other dispenser
has<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> redstone<00:00:41.129> repeater<00:00:42.020> you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.170> see<00:00:43.350> how

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
has a redstone repeater you can see how

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.380 
has a redstone repeater you can see how
it's<00:00:43.680> all<00:00:43.829> linked<00:00:44.070> together<00:00:44.190> you'll<00:00:45.120> see

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
it's all linked together you'll see

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.330 
it's all linked together you'll see
later<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.230> there's<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> circle<00:00:46.920> where<00:00:47.250> all

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
later that there's a circle where all

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.430 
later that there's a circle where all
redstone<00:00:47.789> continuously<00:00:48.539> circulate<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.289> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
redstone continuously circulate so it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.680 
redstone continuously circulate so it
constantly<00:00:50.010> shoots<00:00:50.309> right<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.510> where

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
constantly shoots right there is where

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.330 
constantly shoots right there is where
the<00:00:51.840> button<00:00:52.110> will<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.350> as<00:00:52.559> where<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> was

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the button will be as where I was

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.189 
the button will be as where I was
hitting<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.690> I'm<00:00:54.899> kind<00:00:55.110> of

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
hitting you can see I'm kind of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.170 
hitting you can see I'm kind of
following<00:00:55.559> where<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.949> all<00:00:56.070> connects<00:00:56.489> you'll

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
following where it all connects you'll

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.849 
following where it all connects you'll
see<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.449> go<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> other<00:00:58.079> side<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.770> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
see it's on the other side it's all

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.549 
see it's on the other side it's all
connected<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:03.019> it's<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> pretty<00:01:04.320> simple

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
connected it's it's a pretty simple

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.080

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
one thing he survives a little longer

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.630

way<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.710> then<00:01:43.860> though<00:01:44.009> they'll

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
way I have it so then though they'll

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.609 
way I have it so then though they'll
have<00:01:44.640> no<00:01:45.000> way<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.210> get<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.470> want

have no way to get out and if you want
to<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.860> with<00:01:47.070> lava<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.549> cobblestone

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
to do this with lava and cobblestone

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.280 
to do this with lava and cobblestone
that<00:01:48.180> could<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:48.390> better<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:48.810> as<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.170> can

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
that could be better because as you can

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.450 
that could be better because as you can
see<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.590> kind<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.130> through<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
see you can kind of see through the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.510 
see you can kind of see through the
water<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.240> see<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> dispensers<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.399> know

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
water and see the dispensers so you know

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.609 
water and see the dispensers so you know
if<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.850> want<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.119> kind<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.479> make<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.439> lot

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
if you want to kind of make it a lot

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.859 
if you want to kind of make it a lot
more<00:01:55.799> hidden<00:01:56.210> but<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> think<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> lot<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> what

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
more hidden but I think a lot of what

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.179 
more hidden but I think a lot of what
makes<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.170> look<00:01:58.290> more<00:01:58.320> deadly<00:01:58.799> when<00:01:58.950> water

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
makes it look more deadly when water

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.730 
makes it look more deadly when water
looks<00:01:59.460> more<00:01:59.640> peaceful<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.119> guess<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.689> know

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
looks more peaceful I guess but you know

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.260 
looks more peaceful I guess but you know
now<00:02:01.740> you'll<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.009> how<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.759> redstone<00:02:03.240> is

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
now you'll see how the redstone is

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.929 
now you'll see how the redstone is
