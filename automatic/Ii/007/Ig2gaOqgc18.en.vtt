can<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.420> takes<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.690> little<00:00:33.809> while<00:00:34.050> because

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
can see it takes a little while because

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.860 
can see it takes a little while because
the<00:00:34.500> servers<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.160> up<00:00:35.550> at<00:00:36.030> current<00:00:36.660> moment

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the servers are not up at current moment

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.600 
the servers are not up at current moment
I<00:00:37.140> don't<00:00:37.559> know<00:00:37.649> when<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.950> pack<00:00:38.190> opening

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
I don't know when this pack opening

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.299 
I don't know when this pack opening
exactly<00:00:39.239> will<00:00:39.360> come<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.160> judging<00:00:41.160> by<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
exactly will come out so judging by the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.770 
exactly will come out so judging by the
last<00:00:41.579> few<00:00:41.790> weeks<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.120> servers<00:00:42.420> will<00:00:42.510> probably

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
last few weeks the servers will probably

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420 
last few weeks the servers will probably
go<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.170> down<00:00:43.320> about<00:00:43.590> five<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.160> times

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
go up and down about five more times

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.910 
go up and down about five more times
we'll<00:00:45.300> see<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.840> don't<00:00:46.200> know<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.770> getting

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
we'll see I don't know it's just getting

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.490 
we'll see I don't know it's just getting

jerky I was just at the tail end of the
servers<00:03:02.480> being<00:03:02.690> up<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.110> looks<00:03:03.320> like<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.800> the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310
