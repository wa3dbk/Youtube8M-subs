00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:14.109
 The first new way I am fast again Fire Stone 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.820
 and I would have thought so 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.730
 I have not yet been offended at her PSP and what again mean 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.840
 Videos you will not find the PSP cracked so have no costs 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.939
 for work on colors 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.939
 has made possible the Ruhr area with a pillow PS goes 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.630
 also with Dr PSP 3000 with the PSP Go 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.149
 the only one on site is a requirement 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.360
 you are not allowed only as one 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.740
 St also fish for arms 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.740
 6 point was enough 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.720
 not for 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.380
 with six points 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.860
 would be ideal 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.110
 6 point 2 0 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.160
 yes and we assume that we have lost six points 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.959
 6 and 3 5 had to downgrade to Poland 

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:01.910
 but that this is still something blocked 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.710
 so as that is 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.710
 Paul was first little of the 26 Hor 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 the two mines for the hack 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.860
 a description should be clear in every country 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.040
 and if he is here and there then I would only keep you under the rubble forever 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.740
 since 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.790
 then I would do everything 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.630
 so those are the four fights we need the left second 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.930
 These are the right ones since the hack 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.230
 the best two are to build a minute to keep it at 6 2 2 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.730
 gets 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.340
 Forest that is most important 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.150
 around 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.050
 and what else is there to say 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.440
 I'm looking for someone new in Krumbach so if he knows his way around and 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.650
 then we said it 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.970
 Interested parties can 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.970
 and guess a good program 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.249
 could the roles please me then 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.629
 then the judge could report to me hmmm percent not like that 

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:01.340
 can be scratchy 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.960
 you have probably already seen 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.960
 So I do not go this way 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.899
 she is already here 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.519
 5 There is the beginning of a new order than finally at the will 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.779
 SpaceClaim 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.879
 now also has to do 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.010
 Euro there is still a Polish there in all places I believe that 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.019
 we do this in this video 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.779
 I do not think so 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:29.439
 I am sorry 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.989
 and unfortunately I forgot you have to go to Borken the Spree 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.359
 in tears "then it's gone downhill is just on PSP 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.870
 at a last judicial forgot to say that I thought so 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.099
 I do not write but do it that way 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.099
 now have not and Axel's rescuer to Camacho Worcester is Defender 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.579
 right now 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.699
 so now we are in Weimar 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.999
 after I mean so the alderman Fergie Liebig said the semitrailer 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:05.969
 Red so you can not do without the 1 here we are really was looking 6 2 2 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.309
 0 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:10.309
 yes you should not recognize 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:14.429
 yes no longer gave up percent 6 and 2 0 I have 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.119
 already done 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.409
 Meanwhile, the play is 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:21.709
 there are around 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.679
 here this decay 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:26.629
 if he and the other partners and trailers and 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.779
 Solberg is now up 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:31.779
 Dallas Genesis covers 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:36.059
 then have started 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.329
 so eats and there is the EGS 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.329
 and again 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.459
 so now the double PSP stood up 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.459
 Blumberg percent up 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.769
 b costs associated 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.769
 because we can spy out ice as well 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:04.819
 she is active in abusing APA when I turn off now 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.459
 is the cost for Wolbeck 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.879
 we do not want that 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.179
 but here's my ice cream from the day 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:13.179
 Luigi Pizzi on the parliament patch 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.340
 And you will find out sooner 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.720
 Load in no case update so from the filling or 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:28.099
 I can still go it is also with my strength Pace go 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.509
 PSN laboratory 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.310
 in the clouds is as well as meant to do me he has HP had Georg Diez x 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.879
 and there are still times 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:44.279
 Now again I compensated more 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.110
 yes, yes 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.060
 that could 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.960
 PlayStation Network and so too 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.889
 for example, and a game I do not know how it works sometimes 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:54.889
 a patch 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.279
 Now please nothing 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.400
 it revolves 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.400
 Solstice covered 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.080
 and 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.500
 This evidence also does not want the real one to cost Gertraud 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.509
 frill 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.509
 and now I have the films 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:17.379
 6 point 2 0 problem case 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:19.900
 that's my new leadership now 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.020
 so thank you for watching 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.020
 Percent I have only five seconds now unfortunately 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.849
