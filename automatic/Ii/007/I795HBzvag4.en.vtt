00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
fault with that circuit this light will

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.130 
fault with that circuit this light will
come<00:04:57.430> on<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:58.120> let<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.390> know<00:04:58.480> that<00:04:58.660> fans<00:04:58.960> are

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
come on to let you know that fans are

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.040 
come on to let you know that fans are
the<00:04:59.350> most<00:04:59.410> likely<00:04:59.830> not<00:05:00.010> working<00:05:00.430> but<00:05:01.330> these

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
the most likely not working but these

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.930 
the most likely not working but these
are<00:05:02.230> fuel<00:05:02.500> objectives<00:05:02.950> and<00:05:03.100> just<00:05:03.280> turn

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
are fuel objectives and just turn

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.570 
are fuel objectives and just turn
crank<00:05:04.270> them<00:05:04.360> up<00:05:04.510> they<00:05:05.410> start<00:05:05.770> running<00:05:06.100> really

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
crank them up they start running really

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.260 
crank them up they start running really
well

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
well

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:15.360 
well
fuel<00:05:07.660> objections<00:05:08.170> just<00:05:08.560> fantastic

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.820 

alright<00:05:15.790> gotta<00:05:16.360> pull<00:05:17.020> it<00:05:17.140> that<00:05:17.260> opens<00:05:17.620> in<00:05:17.770> the

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
alright gotta pull it that opens in the

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.700 
alright gotta pull it that opens in the
front<00:05:21.120> pop<00:05:22.120> that<00:05:22.360> up<00:05:22.570> how's<00:05:23.080> the<00:05:23.230> storage

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
front pop that up how's the storage

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.260 
front pop that up how's the storage
under<00:05:23.950> here<00:05:23.980> but<00:05:24.400> they<00:05:24.580> make<00:05:24.760> it<00:05:24.790> real<00:05:25.060> easy

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270

steering motor not the Chuck do anything

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.150 
steering motor not the Chuck do anything
with<00:05:31.180> that<00:05:31.330> but<00:05:31.570> we'll<00:05:32.080> show<00:05:32.110> it<00:05:32.410> to<00:05:32.530> you<00:05:32.680> your

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
with that but we'll show it to you your

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.710 
with that but we'll show it to you your
coolant<00:05:33.490> reservoir<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:34.120> radiator<00:05:34.540> is

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
coolant reservoir the radiator is

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:42.870 
coolant reservoir the radiator is
mounted<00:05:35.050> higher<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:41.070> rear<00:05:42.070> shocks<00:05:42.400> just<00:05:42.580> give

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
mounted higher the rear shocks just give

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.870 
mounted higher the rear shocks just give
you<00:05:43.000> a<00:05:43.030> more<00:05:43.180> consistent<00:05:43.830> suspension<00:05:44.830> as<00:05:45.820> a

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
you a more consistent suspension as a

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.900 
you a more consistent suspension as a
shock<00:05:46.270> teamed<00:05:46.540> up<00:05:47.760> adjustable<00:05:48.760> suspension

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
shock teamed up adjustable suspension

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.360 
shock teamed up adjustable suspension
the<00:05:49.480> air<00:05:49.690> cleaner<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.440> air<00:05:50.470> box<00:05:50.800> is<00:05:51.190> now

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
the air cleaner the air box is now

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.190 
the air cleaner the air box is now
underneath<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.270> hood<00:05:52.420> as<00:05:52.690> opposed<00:05:53.080> to

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
underneath the hood as opposed to

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.450 
underneath the hood as opposed to
between<00:05:53.470> the<00:05:53.710> seats<00:05:53.920> and<00:05:54.070> the<00:05:54.160> tariffs

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
between the seats and the tariffs

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.520 
between the seats and the tariffs
two-seater<00:05:54.880> so<00:05:55.420> not<00:05:55.600> only<00:05:55.690> is<00:05:55.870> it<00:05:55.960> quieter<00:05:56.410> in

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
two-seater so not only is it quieter in

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.510 
two-seater so not only is it quieter in
the<00:05:56.590> cabin<00:05:56.920> because<00:05:57.040> you<00:05:57.190> don't<00:05:57.310> have<00:05:57.400> the

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
the cabin because you don't have the

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.850 
the cabin because you don't have the
noise<00:05:57.700> from<00:05:58.000> that<00:05:58.210> air<00:05:58.660> intake<00:05:59.170> but<00:05:59.410> also<00:05:59.590> we

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
noise from that air intake but also we

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.190 
noise from that air intake but also we
get<00:05:59.980> cleaner<00:06:00.280> air<00:06:00.550> and<00:06:00.880> it's<00:06:01.090> higher<00:06:01.330> so<00:06:02.050> it's

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
get cleaner air and it's higher so it's

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.500 
get cleaner air and it's higher so it's
cleaner<00:06:02.470> drier<00:06:02.890> air<00:06:03.160> in<00:06:03.400> front<00:06:03.700> and<00:06:03.910> then<00:06:04.270> all

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
cleaner drier air in front and then all

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.540 
cleaner drier air in front and then all
the<00:06:04.720> fuses<00:06:05.200> and<00:06:05.770> everything<00:06:06.070> have<00:06:06.190> been<00:06:06.340> moved

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
the fuses and everything have been moved

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.010 
the fuses and everything have been moved
to<00:06:06.640> right<00:06:06.820> up<00:06:06.970> here<00:06:07.150> so<00:06:07.300> very<00:06:07.330> high<00:06:07.780> in<00:06:07.960> the

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
to right up here so very high in the

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.240 
to right up here so very high in the
unit<00:06:08.320> but<00:06:08.350> about<00:06:08.620> as<00:06:08.740> high<00:06:08.919> as<00:06:08.950> they<00:06:09.190> could

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
unit but about as high as they could

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.210 
unit but about as high as they could
possibly<00:06:09.430> be<00:06:09.730> in<00:06:09.940> the<00:06:09.970> unit<00:06:10.360> and<00:06:10.919> so<00:06:11.919> it<00:06:12.040> keeps

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
possibly be in the unit and so it keeps

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.810 
possibly be in the unit and so it keeps
those<00:06:12.370> things<00:06:12.610> nice<00:06:12.850> and<00:06:12.880> dry<00:06:13.270> and<00:06:14.820> eliminate

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
those things nice and dry and eliminate

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.370 
those things nice and dry and eliminate
any<00:06:15.970> corrosion<00:06:16.240> issues<00:06:16.840> you<00:06:16.960> might<00:06:17.080> have<00:06:17.140> with

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
any corrosion issues you might have with

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.260 
any corrosion issues you might have with
those<00:06:17.740> plus<00:06:18.370> makes<00:06:18.610> them<00:06:18.730> really<00:06:18.880> easy<00:06:19.060> to

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
those plus makes them really easy to

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.530 
those plus makes them really easy to
access<00:06:19.600> so<00:06:19.830> really<00:06:20.830> nice<00:06:21.040> that<00:06:24.270> you<00:06:25.270> come<00:06:25.450> out
