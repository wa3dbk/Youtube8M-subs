00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
I wanted a 90 degree USB connector if

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
I wanted a 90 degree USB connector if
you<00:00:51.180> look<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.480> how<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.260> regular<00:00:52.649> GoPro

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
you look at how the regular GoPro

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.150 
you look at how the regular GoPro
connector<00:00:53.730> fits<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:55.379> freaking<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
connector fits in here it's freaking of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.049 
connector fits in here it's freaking of
massive<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:58.710> sticks<00:00:58.980> out<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.430> beast<00:00:59.760> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
massive and it sticks out like a beast I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.020 
massive and it sticks out like a beast I
mean<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> good<00:01:00.899> chance<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> snap<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.649> off

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
mean it's a good chance to snap that off

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.179 
mean it's a good chance to snap that off
ruin<00:01:03.030> your<00:01:03.210> USB<00:01:03.510> connection<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:04.799> GoPro

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
ruin your USB connection on your GoPro

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.990 
ruin your USB connection on your GoPro
or<00:01:05.640> break<00:01:06.540> your<00:01:06.720> $20<00:01:07.439> freaking<00:01:07.920> cable<00:01:08.310> so

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
or break your $20 freaking cable so

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.240 
or break your $20 freaking cable so
that's<00:01:09.600> why<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> went<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.380> 90<00:01:10.740> degree<00:01:10.830> as

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
that's why I went with the 90 degree as

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.679 
that's why I went with the 90 degree as
you<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.939> fits<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.390> here<00:01:12.630> perfectly

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
you can see it fits in here perfectly

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.100 
you can see it fits in here perfectly
and<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:14.820> barely<00:01:15.210> sticks<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.080> so

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and it barely sticks out at all so

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.660 
and it barely sticks out at all so
there's<00:01:16.680> less<00:01:16.890> likelihood<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.460> you're

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
there's less likelihood that you're

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.580 
there's less likelihood that you're
going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.850> snap<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.090> off<00:01:18.420> or<00:01:18.720> damage<00:01:19.560> your

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
going to snap it off or damage your

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.490 
going to snap it off or damage your
cable<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> process<00:01:20.990> I'll<00:01:21.990> provide<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.350> link

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
cable in the process I'll provide a link

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.499 
cable in the process I'll provide a link
to<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> cable<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.430> bought<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> description

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to the cable I bought in the description

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.899 
to the cable I bought in the description
below<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:25.380> upon<00:01:25.680> receiving<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.340> having<00:01:26.820> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
below but upon receiving in having a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.030 
below but upon receiving in having a
network<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.420> my<00:01:27.509> GoPro<00:01:27.720> Hero<00:01:28.170> 3<00:01:28.259> plus<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
network with my GoPro Hero 3 plus I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.920 
network with my GoPro Hero 3 plus I
decided<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.970> maybe<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> solder

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
decided that maybe one of the solder

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.080 
decided that maybe one of the solder
connections<00:01:31.439> inside<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> connector<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.460> is

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
connections inside the connector here is

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.090 
connections inside the connector here is
broken<00:01:33.659> or<00:01:33.780> damaged<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.409> decided<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.860> open

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
broken or damaged so I decided to open

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.950 
broken or damaged so I decided to open
up<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.759> connector<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.420> easily<00:01:36.630> opened

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
up this connector can be easily opened

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.550 
up this connector can be easily opened
by<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.560> three<00:01:38.130> access<00:01:38.670> ports<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.990> each<00:01:40.290> side

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
by the three access ports on each side

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.310 
by the three access ports on each side
of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> connector<00:01:41.159> simply<00:01:41.880> use<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> sharp<00:01:42.869> pry

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
of the connector simply use a sharp pry

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and see the wiring connections so you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.929 
and see the wiring connections so you
have<00:01:49.500> removed<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> outer<00:01:50.009> housing<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.759> can

have removed the outer housing you can

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.450 
have removed the outer housing you can
simply<00:01:51.270> lift<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.720> internal

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
plugged into it that's what didn't come

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.110 
plugged into it that's what didn't come
with<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:52.130> connector<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.760> that's<00:02:52.880> why<00:02:53.090> I

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
with this connector and that's why I

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.050 
with this connector and that's why I
didn't<00:02:53.480> work<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:55.190> there's<00:02:55.430> also<00:02:55.640> going<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:55.940> be

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
didn't work so there's also going to be

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.699 
didn't work so there's also going to be
three<00:02:56.360> other<00:02:56.540> leads<00:02:56.810> on<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.079> other<00:02:57.260> side<00:02:57.560> of

the bottom row I trimmed all those off

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:00.400 
the bottom row I trimmed all those off
because<00:02:59.510> you're<00:02:59.750> not<00:02:59.870> going<00:03:00.049> to<00:03:00.110> need<00:03:00.230> those

the<00:03:21.560> top<00:03:21.769> row<00:03:22.040> I'm<00:03:22.579> just<00:03:22.760> going<00:03:22.880> to<00:03:22.940> flip<00:03:23.150> this

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
the top row I'm just going to flip this

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.620 
the top row I'm just going to flip this
over<00:03:24.250> six<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.489> seven<00:03:25.820> here<00:03:26.030> on<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.239> bottom

over six and seven here on the bottom
this<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.320> where<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.739> soldered<00:03:28.220> in<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.489> resistor

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
this is where I soldered in the resistor

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.610 
this is where I soldered in the resistor
and<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.269> doesn't<00:03:29.540> matter<00:03:29.660> which<00:03:29.989> direction

and it doesn't matter which direction
you<00:03:30.950> solder<00:03:31.220> is<00:03:31.459> just<00:03:31.610> around<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.910> can<00:03:32.030> flip

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
you solder is just around you can flip

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.210 
you solder is just around you can flip
it<00:03:32.329> around<00:03:32.590> polarity<00:03:33.590> does<00:03:33.769> not<00:03:33.950> matter

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
it around polarity does not matter
