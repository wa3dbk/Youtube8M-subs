a packaging it's nothing special because

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.650 
a packaging it's nothing special because
it<00:00:10.710> just<00:00:10.860> looks<00:00:11.160> something<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.969> you

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
it just looks something like this you

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.959 
it just looks something like this you
take<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.080> out<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.559> carton<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.820> have

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
take it out of the carton and you have

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.510 
take it out of the carton and you have
the<00:00:15.120> product<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.990> one<00:00:16.260> liquid<00:00:16.500> liner<00:00:16.890> contains

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520

three<00:00:18.119> ml<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.600> product<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.350> think<00:00:19.380> that

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
three ml of product and I think that

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.710 
three ml of product and I think that
would<00:00:19.949> last<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.490> for<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> good<00:00:21.090> three<00:00:21.480> months

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
would last you for a good three months

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.679 
would last you for a good three months
or<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:23.010> some<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.460> my<00:00:23.609> viewers<00:00:23.910> asking

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
or so I have some of my viewers asking

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.019 
or so I have some of my viewers asking
if<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.050> product<00:00:25.320> contains<00:00:25.560> any<00:00:26.130> paraben<00:00:26.820> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
if this product contains any paraben and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.910 
if this product contains any paraben and
all<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.900> see<00:00:28.230> at<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> back<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.680> this

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
all I can see at the back of this

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.179 
all I can see at the back of this
content<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.910> has<00:00:30.650> methylparaben<00:00:31.650> so

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
content is that it has methylparaben so

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.729 
content is that it has methylparaben so

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
the pigmentation of this product is just

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.590 
the pigmentation of this product is just
the<00:02:36.950> blackest<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:37.670> can<00:02:37.880> get<00:02:38.120> another

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
the blackest that you can get another

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.270 
the blackest that you can get another
thing<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.020> I<00:02:39.080> also<00:02:39.260> notice<00:02:39.770> about<00:02:40.040> this

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
thing that I also notice about this

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.190 
thing that I also notice about this
product<00:02:40.820> is<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.210> dries<00:02:41.690> pretty<00:02:41.720> quickly

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
product is that it dries pretty quickly

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.250 
product is that it dries pretty quickly
now<00:02:42.980> we<00:02:43.040> can<00:02:43.310> do<00:02:43.490> this<00:02:43.640> much<00:02:43.910> proof<00:02:44.420> test<00:02:44.810> by

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
now we can do this much proof test by

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.580 
now we can do this much proof test by
just<00:02:45.770> rubbing<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:47.330> tail<00:02:47.570> part<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:48.140> my<00:02:48.320> liquid

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
just rubbing the tail part of my liquid

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.400 
just rubbing the tail part of my liquid
liner<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.610> looks<00:02:49.850> like<00:02:49.940> it's<00:02:50.209> not<00:02:50.450> budging

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
liner and it looks like it's not budging

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.070 
liner and it looks like it's not budging
at<00:02:51.590> all<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.240> I'm<00:02:53.240> pretty<00:02:53.450> sure<00:02:53.570> this<00:02:53.900> would

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
at all and I'm pretty sure this would

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.560 
at all and I'm pretty sure this would
also<00:02:54.260> be<00:02:54.490> waterproof<00:02:55.490> considering<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.270> fact

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
also be waterproof considering the fact

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.110 
also be waterproof considering the fact
that<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.050> already<00:02:57.470> smudge<00:02:57.950> proof<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.610> found

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
that it is already smudge proof I found

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.479 
that it is already smudge proof I found
it's<00:02:59.270> very<00:02:59.480> easy<00:02:59.810> to<00:03:00.050> apply<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:00.950> created

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
it's very easy to apply and I created

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.850 
it's very easy to apply and I created
the<00:03:01.760> most<00:03:01.970> beautiful<00:03:02.450> flick<00:03:02.840> or<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.650> tail

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
the most beautiful flick or the tail

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.740 
the most beautiful flick or the tail
part<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.400> eyeliner<00:03:04.790> because<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.480> brush

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
part of the eyeliner because the brush

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.920 
part of the eyeliner because the brush
was<00:03:06.050> really<00:03:06.530> very<00:03:07.010> smooth<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:08.000> work<00:03:08.180> with<00:03:08.480> now

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
was really very smooth to work with now

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.410 
was really very smooth to work with now
this<00:03:09.140> may<00:03:09.350> be<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.530> con<00:03:09.950> for<00:03:10.220> some<00:03:10.489> people<00:03:10.940> but<00:03:11.209> I

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
this may be a con for some people but I

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.500 
this may be a con for some people but I
noticed<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:11.959> when<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:13.010> liner<00:03:13.489> dries<00:03:13.910> up<00:03:14.209> it

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
noticed that when the liner dries up it

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.100 
noticed that when the liner dries up it
has<00:03:14.870> like<00:03:15.350> tiny<00:03:15.800> flakes<00:03:16.340> going<00:03:16.820> on<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.390> you

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
has like tiny flakes going on and you

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.000 
has like tiny flakes going on and you
have<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.590> go<00:03:19.580> over<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.570> line<00:03:20.840> with<00:03:21.650> another

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
have to go over the line with another

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.920 
have to go over the line with another
layer<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.430> color<00:03:22.730> just<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.270> give<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.570> a<00:03:23.720> more

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
layer of color just to give it a more

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.860 
layer of color just to give it a more
solid<00:03:24.380> color<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:25.700> initially<00:03:26.000> I'm<00:03:26.420> quite

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
solid color so initially I'm quite

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.870 
solid color so initially I'm quite
impressed<00:03:27.410> by<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.739> pigmentation<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.730> this

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
impressed by the pigmentation of this

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.479 
impressed by the pigmentation of this
Lal<00:03:29.180> eyeliner<00:03:29.690> I<00:03:30.050> love<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.709> brush<00:03:30.890> applicator

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
Lal eyeliner I love the brush applicator

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.400 
Lal eyeliner I love the brush applicator
because<00:03:31.940> it<00:03:32.180> was<00:03:32.360> able<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.780> give<00:03:33.019> such<00:03:33.380> a

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
because it was able to give such a

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.920 
because it was able to give such a
beautiful<00:03:34.040> flick<00:03:34.370> at<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:35.060> end<00:03:35.239> of<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.480> line<00:03:35.690> I

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
beautiful flick at the end of the line I

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.780 
beautiful flick at the end of the line I
also<00:03:36.260> like<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.769> fact<00:03:36.799> that<00:03:37.130> it<00:03:37.310> doesn't<00:03:37.640> have

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
also like the fact that it doesn't have

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.449 
also like the fact that it doesn't have
any<00:03:37.970> pungent<00:03:38.600> smell<00:03:38.930> at<00:03:39.170> all<00:03:39.440> we<00:03:39.860> have<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.250> take

any pungent smell at all we have to take

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.660 
any pungent smell at all we have to take
it<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.940> road<00:03:41.180> test<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:42.230> now<00:03:42.440> 429<00:03:43.310> in<00:03:43.549> the

afternoon<00:03:44.209> I'll<00:03:44.330> be<00:03:44.390> back<00:03:44.720> at<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:44.989> end<00:03:45.080> of<00:03:45.320> the

afternoon I'll be back at the end of the
night<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.769> see<00:03:45.799> if<00:03:46.519> this<00:03:46.760> liner<00:03:47.090> would<00:03:47.420> hold<00:03:47.660> up

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
night to see if this liner would hold up

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.039 
night to see if this liner would hold up
all<00:03:48.019> throughout<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:48.560> night<00:03:48.709> it<00:03:49.070> is<00:03:49.610> now<00:03:49.820> 11<00:03:50.239> 26

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
all throughout the night it is now 11 26

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.560 
all throughout the night it is now 11 26
in<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.350> evening<00:03:51.799> and<00:03:51.980> over<00:03:52.489> seven<00:03:52.970> hours<00:03:53.090> has

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
in the evening and over seven hours has

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.490 
in the evening and over seven hours has
already<00:03:53.780> passed

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
already passed

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.740 
already passed
since<00:03:55.100> I<00:03:55.250> last<00:03:55.459> applied<00:03:55.940> my<00:03:56.239> liquid<00:03:56.720> liner

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
since I last applied my liquid liner

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.319 
since I last applied my liquid liner
from<00:03:57.200> lol<00:03:57.829> and<00:03:58.100> this<00:03:58.250> is<00:03:58.370> what<00:03:58.610> it<00:03:58.760> looks<00:03:59.030> like

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
from lol and this is what it looks like

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:05.300 
from lol and this is what it looks like
now

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.670 

so<00:04:05.790> one<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.209> major<00:04:06.390> cons<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:07.110> this<00:04:07.200> liquid

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
so one of the major cons of this liquid

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.040 
so one of the major cons of this liquid
liner<00:04:07.890> has<00:04:08.130> got<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.610> be<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.970> minor<00:04:09.300> cracking

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
liner has got to be the minor cracking

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.650 
liner has got to be the minor cracking
going<00:04:10.319> on<00:04:10.440> especially<00:04:11.130> on<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.760> tail<00:04:12.030> part<00:04:12.390> of

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
going on especially on the tail part of

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.199 
going on especially on the tail part of
the<00:04:13.319> liner<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:14.430> noticed<00:04:14.819> that<00:04:15.030> when<00:04:15.150> I

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
the liner and I noticed that when I

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.690 
the liner and I noticed that when I
looked<00:04:15.600> up<00:04:15.750> close<00:04:16.079> into<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.560> mirror<00:04:16.919> it's

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
looked up close into the mirror it's

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.759 
looked up close into the mirror it's
just<00:04:17.880> very<00:04:18.180> very<00:04:18.540> dry<00:04:18.930> although<00:04:19.350> it's<00:04:19.500> not

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
just very very dry although it's not

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.400 
just very very dry although it's not
that<00:04:19.980> major<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.910> doesn't<00:04:21.389> like<00:04:21.540> fall<00:04:21.870> out<00:04:22.109> or

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
that major it doesn't like fall out or

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.800 
that major it doesn't like fall out or
flake<00:04:22.830> out<00:04:23.040> but<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:23.610> does<00:04:23.880> have<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.419> little<00:04:24.660> bit

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
flake out but it does have a little bit

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.470 
flake out but it does have a little bit
of<00:04:25.020> cracking<00:04:25.560> going<00:04:25.800> on<00:04:26.100> one<00:04:26.790> good<00:04:27.000> point<00:04:27.300> is

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
of cracking going on one good point is

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.540 
of cracking going on one good point is

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
the flick is still there it's just very

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.180 
the flick is still there it's just very
intact<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.480> the<00:04:42.480> color<00:04:42.750> did<00:04:43.080> fade<00:04:43.440> just<00:04:43.770> a

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
intact and the color did fade just a

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.970 
intact and the color did fade just a
little<00:04:44.460> bit<00:04:44.669> and<00:04:44.880> a<00:04:45.060> little<00:04:45.320> retouching<00:04:46.320> would

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
little bit and a little retouching would

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.640 
little bit and a little retouching would
give<00:04:47.669> it<00:04:47.760> a<00:04:47.910> more<00:04:48.150> solid<00:04:48.540> color<00:04:48.840> overall<00:04:49.620> I

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
give it a more solid color overall I

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.710 
give it a more solid color overall I
would<00:04:49.860> recommend<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.700> to<00:04:50.730> try<00:04:51.030> out<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.510> law
