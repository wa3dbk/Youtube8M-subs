something<00:03:43.550> for<00:03:43.910> something<00:03:45.340> two<00:03:46.340> times

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.959 

what<00:03:50.500> if<00:03:50.650> all<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.980> records<00:03:51.340> would<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.579> do<00:03:51.640> get

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:51.969 
what if all the records would I do get

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.270 
what if all the records would I do get
recorded<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:53.260> just<00:03:53.469> the<00:03:53.590> top<00:03:53.769> one<00:03:54.010> pretty

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
recorded and just the top one pretty

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.589 
recorded and just the top one pretty
sure<00:03:54.370> it's<00:03:54.400> just<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.819> top<00:03:55.030> one<00:03:55.269> and<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:58.420> did<00:03:58.569> the

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
sure it's just the top one and I did the

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.990 
sure it's just the top one and I did the
punch-out<00:03:59.140> one<00:03:59.379> it<00:03:59.590> was<00:03:59.650> like<00:03:59.890> I<00:04:00.189> beat<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.819> like

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
punch-out one it was like I beat it like

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:20.150 
punch-out one it was like I beat it like
a<00:04:01.030> bunch<00:04:01.299> times

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.310 

6-615<00:04:21.160> think<00:04:22.000> 615<00:04:22.540> is<00:04:22.600> over<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.870> world<00:04:23.050> record

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
6-615 think 615 is over the world record

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.320 
6-615 think 615 is over the world record
but<00:04:23.560> what<00:04:23.770> do<00:04:23.830> we<00:04:23.860> get<00:04:24.010> 653<00:04:24.640> reversals<00:04:25.090> trying

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
but what do we get 653 reversals trying

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.510 
but what do we get 653 reversals trying
to<00:04:25.390> treat<00:04:25.540> that<00:04:26.550> there<00:04:27.550> are<00:04:27.640> 6<00:04:27.910> 15<00:04:29.220> when<00:04:30.220> we<00:04:30.340> got

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
to treat that there are 6 15 when we got

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.600 
to treat that there are 6 15 when we got
653<00:04:31.510> earlier<00:04:31.960> so<00:04:32.770> we're<00:04:32.980> gonna<00:04:33.100> try<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.430> get

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
653 earlier so we're gonna try to get

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.129 
653 earlier so we're gonna try to get
that<00:04:33.820> now

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.570 

think<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.919> record<00:04:40.280> with<00:04:40.400> 6<00:04:40.639> 12<00:04:40.969> right<00:04:41.330> 12<00:04:42.219> 6<00:04:43.219> 13

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
think the record with 6 12 right 12 6 13

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.209 
think the record with 6 12 right 12 6 13
no<00:04:43.849> matter<00:04:44.090> I'm<00:04:44.569> gonna<00:04:44.689> get<00:04:44.840> 650<00:04:45.169> so<00:04:45.560> guess<00:04:46.099> I

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:46.219 
no matter I'm gonna get 650 so guess I

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.850 
no matter I'm gonna get 650 so guess I
don't<00:04:46.340> want<00:04:46.460> to<00:04:46.520> do<00:04:46.580> it's<00:04:46.699> like<00:04:46.729> six<00:04:47.120> times<00:04:47.270> and

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
don't want to do it's like six times and

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.379 
don't want to do it's like six times and
be<00:04:48.860> enough<00:04:51.099> it<00:04:52.099> was<00:04:52.249> a<00:04:52.279> nice<00:04:52.550> perfect<00:04:52.939> two<00:04:53.270> one

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
be enough it was a nice perfect two one

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:02.019 
be enough it was a nice perfect two one
right<00:04:53.569> there<00:04:55.749> that<00:04:56.749> one<00:04:56.900> wasn't<00:05:00.879> thing<00:05:01.879> is

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:02.029 
right there that one wasn't thing is

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.050 
right there that one wasn't thing is
they've<00:05:02.360> seemed<00:05:02.659> like<00:05:03.460> Donkey<00:05:04.460> Kong<00:05:04.639> records

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
they've seemed like Donkey Kong records

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.679 
they've seemed like Donkey Kong records
that<00:05:05.300> go<00:05:05.330> on<00:05:05.569> for<00:05:05.960> took<00:05:06.830> 17<00:05:07.249> little<00:05:07.550> better<00:05:07.699> 617

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:08.689 
that go on for took 17 little better 617

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:10.629 
that go on for took 17 little better 617
ducing<00:05:09.259> Donkey<00:05:09.680> Kong<00:05:09.860> records<00:05:10.279> that<00:05:10.430> go<00:05:10.460> on

ducing Donkey Kong records that go on

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.450 
ducing Donkey Kong records that go on
for<00:05:10.879> like<00:05:11.029> 18<00:05:11.900> hours<00:05:12.050> so<00:05:12.500> I<00:05:12.740> think<00:05:13.099> then

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
for like 18 hours so I think then

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:35.749 
for like 18 hours so I think then
watching<00:05:13.819> us<00:05:13.939> for<00:05:14.210> 10<00:05:14.659> minutes<00:05:14.840> this<00:05:15.080> time

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:52.990 

nice

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000
