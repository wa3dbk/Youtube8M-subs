00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
directly on to the dehydrator and spread

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:40.700 
directly on to the dehydrator and spread
it<00:00:29.880> around<00:00:37.160> you<00:00:38.160> don't<00:00:38.309> want<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:39.710> vegetables

and use one of the leather trays just to
show<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.920> how<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.340> process<00:00:56.520> will<00:00:56.910> work<00:00:59.840> some

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
show you how that process will work some

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:18.109 
show you how that process will work some
people<00:01:01.109> prefer<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.369> put<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> lid<00:01:17.939> on

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
people prefer and now we put the lid on

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.580 
people prefer and now we put the lid on
the<00:01:18.540> dehydrator<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.490> we<00:01:20.490> set<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> setting<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
the dehydrator and we set the setting to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.190 
the dehydrator and we set the setting to
a<00:01:22.619> hundred<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.430> thirty-five<00:01:24.270> degrees<00:01:24.570> that's

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
a hundred and thirty-five degrees that's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.819 
a hundred and thirty-five degrees that's
the<00:01:25.439> safe<00:01:25.799> range<00:01:26.130> for<00:01:26.610> vegetables<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:30.829> we

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the safe range for vegetables and we

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.730 
the safe range for vegetables and we
plug<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> dehydrator

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
plug in the dehydrator

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.450 
plug in the dehydrator
and<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.939> can<00:01:35.090> hear<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.600> fan<00:01:35.899> running<00:01:36.500> this

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
and you can hear the fan running this

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.969 
and you can hear the fan running this

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
dehydrator has a built-in fan and a heat

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.200 
dehydrator has a built-in fan and a heat
element<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:40.640> circulates<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.570> air

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
element and that circulates the air

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.450 
element and that circulates the air
throughout<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.479> dehydrator<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:46.250> there's<00:01:46.399> a

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
throughout the dehydrator and there's a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.380 
throughout the dehydrator and there's a
moisture<00:01:46.909> tray<00:01:47.240> with<00:01:47.689> a<00:01:47.720> moisture<00:01:49.180> can<00:01:50.180> come

moisture tray with a moisture can come
out<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:52.490> we'll<00:01:52.580> go<00:01:52.670> ahead<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:52.850> we'll<00:01:52.970> let

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
out and we'll go ahead and we'll let

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.080 
out and we'll go ahead and we'll let
this<00:01:53.299> sit<00:01:54.340> anywhere<00:01:55.340> from<00:01:55.460> six<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:55.939> eight
