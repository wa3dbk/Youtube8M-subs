00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
increase the accuracy by itself now just

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.109

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.539 
speaking of carbines the mtar-21 will
now<00:01:33.630> heavy<00:01:33.869> reduce<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.590> long-range<00:01:35.100> damage

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
now heavy reduce the long-range damage

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.219 
now heavy reduce the long-range damage
this<00:01:36.060> basically<00:01:36.270> means<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.079> will<00:01:37.170> be

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
this basically means that it will be

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.530 
this basically means that it will be
harder<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.710> kill<00:01:38.009> from<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.310> distance<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:38.970> but

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
harder to kill from a distance now but

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.300 
harder to kill from a distance now but
this<00:01:39.659> change<00:01:39.990> makes<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> weapons<00:01:40.740> similar<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
this change makes the weapons similar to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.940 
this change makes the weapons similar to
the<00:01:41.430> other<00:01:41.460> carbine<00:01:42.090> rifles<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:43.619> some<00:01:43.829> of

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
way in accuracy is handled when

transitioning from hipfire to aimed fire

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.920 
transitioning from hipfire to aimed fire
this<00:01:50.700> essentially<00:01:51.329> means<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.689> they<00:01:51.899> have

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
this essentially means that they have

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.240 
this essentially means that they have
fixed<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> bug<00:01:52.680> where<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.009> keep<00:01:53.220> your

you would fire your weapon before ad
essing<00:01:59.670> now<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.299> will<00:02:00.479> also<00:02:00.840> make<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> LMGs

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
essing now this will also make the LMGs

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.679 
essing now this will also make the LMGs
a<00:02:01.649> tad<00:02:02.070> bit<00:02:02.280> easier<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.850> use<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.090> your<00:02:03.390> rounds

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
a tad bit easier to use and your rounds

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.179 
a tad bit easier to use and your rounds
will<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.320> over<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> place<00:02:04.860> when<00:02:05.100> you

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
will not be all over the place when you

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.490

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.889 
fire however on the downside support
players<00:02:07.710> with<00:02:08.009> LMGs<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.879> now<00:02:09.000> panic<00:02:09.420> fire<00:02:09.660> in

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
players with LMGs can now panic fire in

players with LMGs can now panic fire in
close<00:02:10.170> quarters<00:02:10.619> with<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.830> tad<00:02:11.220> bit<00:02:11.430> more

close quarters with a tad bit more

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.870 
close quarters with a tad bit more
accuracy<00:02:12.060> than<00:02:12.209> before

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.640

let's<00:02:13.270> just<00:02:13.510> hope<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:13.960> doesn't<00:02:14.320> become<00:02:14.380> an

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
let's just hope this doesn't become an

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.530 
let's just hope this doesn't become an
epidemic<00:02:14.770> like<00:02:15.430> grenade<00:02:15.760> spam<00:02:16.000> has<00:02:16.270> in<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
epidemic like grenade spam has in the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.210 
epidemic like grenade spam has in the
game<00:02:16.720> but<00:02:17.080> anyways<00:02:17.440> moving<00:02:17.680> on<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.130> next

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220

general<00:02:18.700> change<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.540> heavy<00:02:19.780> barrels

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
general change the heavy barrels

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.080 
general change the heavy barrels
accuracy<00:02:20.740> bonus<00:02:20.860> now<00:02:21.220> applies<00:02:21.580> on<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.910> move

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
accuracy bonus now applies on the move

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.390 
accuracy bonus now applies on the move
but<00:02:22.630> at<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.750> reduced<00:02:23.230> bonus<00:02:23.770> when<00:02:23.920> compared<00:02:24.340> to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
but at a reduced bonus when compared to

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.940 
but at a reduced bonus when compared to
standing<00:02:24.880> still<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.390> battlefield<00:02:26.230> 4<00:02:26.320> I<00:02:26.560> tend

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
standing still in battlefield 4 I tend

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.170 
standing still in battlefield 4 I tend
to<00:02:27.070> stay<00:02:27.280> away<00:02:27.310> from<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.790> heavy<00:02:27.970> barrel

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
to stay away from the heavy barrel

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.150 
to stay away from the heavy barrel
because<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.810> adds<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.110> ton<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.410> recoil<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:30.070> the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
because it adds a ton of recoil to the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.800 
because it adds a ton of recoil to the
weapon<00:02:30.490> so<00:02:30.850> if<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.060> don't<00:02:31.270> use<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.660> heavy

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
weapon so if you don't use the heavy

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.240 
weapon so if you don't use the heavy
barrel<00:02:32.020> I<00:02:32.230> would<00:02:32.410> not<00:02:32.620> worry<00:02:32.860> about<00:02:32.950> this

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
barrel I would not worry about this

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.700 
barrel I would not worry about this
minor<00:02:33.520> tweak<00:02:33.910> now<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.330> last<00:02:34.690> general<00:02:35.350> change

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
minor tweak now the last general change

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.620 
minor tweak now the last general change
that<00:02:35.980> dices<00:02:36.340> may<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.610> applies<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.360> sniper

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
that dices may it applies to the sniper

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.690 
that dices may it applies to the sniper
rifles<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:38.800> if<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:38.980> like<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.280> snipe<00:02:39.490> in

battlefield 4 like choppy this change

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.770

full accuracy you won't have to wait to

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.180 
full accuracy you won't have to wait to
take<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.690> shot<00:02:49.960> now<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.350> I'm<00:02:50.440> fairly<00:02:50.680> confident

take a shot now and I'm fairly confident
this<00:02:51.370> will<00:02:51.640> fix<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.120> straight<00:02:52.390> pole<00:02:52.600> vault

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
this will fix the straight pole vault

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.170 
this will fix the straight pole vault
bug<00:02:53.170> now<00:02:53.740> this<00:02:53.920> sort<00:02:54.220> of<00:02:54.280> affects<00:02:54.670> me<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.090> then

bug now this sort of affects me and then
again<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.600> doesn't<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:56.140> only<00:02:56.410> snipe<00:02:56.710> like

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
again it doesn't I only snipe like

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.830 
again it doesn't I only snipe like
twenty<00:02:57.220> percent<00:02:57.490> of<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.700> time<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:57.940> play<00:02:58.330> but

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
twenty percent of the time I play but

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.540 
twenty percent of the time I play but
I'm<00:02:58.960> glad<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.230> can<00:02:59.470> use<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.800> straight<00:03:00.100> full<00:03:00.310> and

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
I'm glad I can use the straight full and

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.830 
I'm glad I can use the straight full and
not<00:03:00.640> have<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.970> worry<00:03:01.150> about<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.510> bug<00:03:01.690> that

not have to worry about the bug that
comes<00:03:02.080> with<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.470> now<00:03:03.130> I<00:03:03.160> regret<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.760> inform<00:03:04.030> you

comes with it now I regret to inform you

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.000 
comes with it now I regret to inform you
that<00:03:04.420> there's<00:03:04.720> still<00:03:04.900> a<00:03:05.020> tiny<00:03:05.290> bit<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.710> delay

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
that there's still a tiny bit of a delay

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.190 
that there's still a tiny bit of a delay
to<00:03:06.070> achieve<00:03:06.490> full<00:03:06.730> accuracy<00:03:07.390> but<00:03:07.870> this<00:03:08.020> makes

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
to achieve full accuracy but this makes

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.200 
to achieve full accuracy but this makes
quick<00:03:08.560> scoping<00:03:08.920> not<00:03:09.160> possible<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.000> game

quick scoping not possible in the game
as<00:03:10.450> of<00:03:10.750> right<00:03:10.780> now<00:03:10.960> those<00:03:11.380> are<00:03:11.410> all<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.890> the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.500 
listed primary weapon tweaks let's move
on<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.920> new<00:03:15.040> pistol<00:03:15.460> changes<00:03:15.880> now<00:03:16.450> the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
on to the new pistol changes now the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.300 
on to the new pistol changes now the
first<00:03:16.870> major<00:03:17.110> change<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:17.830> that<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:18.100> aimed

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
first major change is that the aimed

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.060 
first major change is that the aimed
accuracy<00:03:19.030> of<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.360> m1911<00:03:20.260> has<00:03:20.410> been<00:03:20.590> increased

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
accuracy of the m1911 has been increased

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.490 
accuracy of the m1911 has been increased
this<00:03:21.490> makes<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.940> m1911<00:03:22.810> a<00:03:22.930> viable<00:03:23.440> choice

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
this makes the m1911 a viable choice

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.370 
this makes the m1911 a viable choice
once<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.160> have<00:03:24.280> unlocked<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.610> compact<00:03:25.210> 45<00:03:25.600> so

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
once you have unlocked the compact 45 so

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.720 
once you have unlocked the compact 45 so
if<00:03:26.470> you're<00:03:26.590> picking<00:03:26.740> between<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.370> two<00:03:27.550> you

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
if you're picking between the two you

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.820 
if you're picking between the two you
can<00:03:27.880> choose<00:03:28.120> accuracy<00:03:28.750> over<00:03:28.780> mag<00:03:29.260> size<00:03:29.560> or

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
can choose accuracy over mag size or

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.220 
can choose accuracy over mag size or
vice<00:03:30.100> versa<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:31.120> m1911<00:03:31.870> has<00:03:32.020> more

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
vice versa and the m1911 has more

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.620 
vice versa and the m1911 has more
accuracy<00:03:32.680> while<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.100> compact<00:03:33.550> 45<00:03:33.940> has<00:03:34.480> an

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
accuracy while the compact 45 has an

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.960 
accuracy while the compact 45 has an
advantage<00:03:34.990> with<00:03:35.290> its<00:03:35.470> magazine<00:03:35.980> size<00:03:36.250> in<00:03:36.580> my

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
advantage with its magazine size in my

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.580 
advantage with its magazine size in my
opinion<00:03:37.300> I<00:03:37.570> don't<00:03:37.750> really<00:03:37.840> recommend<00:03:38.230> using

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
opinion I don't really recommend using

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.160 
opinion I don't really recommend using
the<00:03:38.760> m1911<00:03:39.760> because<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.240> magazine<00:03:40.660> size<00:03:40.930> is

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
the m1911 because the magazine size is

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.500 
the m1911 because the magazine size is
so<00:03:41.380> low<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:42.280> takes<00:03:42.490> almost<00:03:42.670> every<00:03:43.060> shot<00:03:43.300> in

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
so low and it takes almost every shot in

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.810 
so low and it takes almost every shot in
it<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.780> kill<00:03:43.990> somebody<00:03:44.200> now<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.190> next<00:03:45.310> change

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
it to kill somebody now the next change

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.940 
it to kill somebody now the next change
has<00:03:46.060> increased<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.660> close-range<00:03:47.140> damage<00:03:47.770> of

Rex's bullet delay prior to this change
it<00:04:21.370> would<00:04:21.460> take<00:04:21.640> about<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.910> half<00:04:22.000> second<00:04:22.600> for
