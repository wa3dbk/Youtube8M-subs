00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.569
 biotic and abiotic factors from the 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:07.700
 creation of the universe through the 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.099
 big-bang has had a diversity of 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.049
 ecosystems which were modified to 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.849
 over time opening the way to a 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.100
 wide range of biotic factors and 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.330
 abiotic an ecosystem is a unit 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.250
 composed of organisms 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.800
 interdependent who share the same 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.349
 Habitat conformed by factors 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.240
 biotic as a biotic between both 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.369
 generates a flow of matter and energy that 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.730
 are indispensable to maintain the 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.730
 ecosystem 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.859
 the biotic factors are the beings 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.890
 living from an ecosystem that survive 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.359
 they can refer to the flora the fauna the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.519
 humans of a place and their interactions 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.359
 individuals must have a 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.390
 behavior and characteristics 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.430
 specific physiological 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.390
 survival and its reproduction in a 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.390
 defined environment 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.770
 the abiotic factors are the different 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.420
 components that determine the space 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.490
 physical in which beings live 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.100
 alive among the most important we can 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.370
 find the water the temperature the light 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.440
 the ph the soil the humidity the air and the 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.250
 nutrients are specifically the 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.250
 lifeless factors 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.140
 The importance of both factors is 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.360
 crucial to the sustainability of the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.130
 life because if one of these two will be missing 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.130
 simply life would not exist 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.680
 among the most biotic factors 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.689
 important on earth are 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.640
 the trees as well as the plants and the 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.579
 vegetation since they are the source of 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.229
 oxygen for other organisms 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.229
 remember that without oxygen there is no life 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.879
 these organisms develop in a 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.099
 ecosystem that harbors the factors 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.989
 abiotics required for each species 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.409
 animal especially for its 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.409
 survival 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.720
 To conclude this issue only 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.090
 will highlight again the importance of 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.830
 these biotic and abiotic factors and the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.930
 role that the human being should take in 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.790
 your care because most of the time 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.010
 the human being is abusive with these 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.230
 factors should be aware of 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.840
 this issue since the human being depends 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.460
 of both factors in the same way the being 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.300
 human is only a biotic factor 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.300
 life more
