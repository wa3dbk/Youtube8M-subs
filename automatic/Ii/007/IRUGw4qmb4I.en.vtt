multiple clips together let's take a
look<00:00:12.420> at<00:00:12.480> how<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.630> do<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.950> so<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.070> have<00:00:14.160> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
look at how to do that so we have a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.550 
look at how to do that so we have a
video<00:00:14.340> clip<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.299> text<00:00:15.630> clip<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:16.260> want<00:00:16.470> to
