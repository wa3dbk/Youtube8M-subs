and I have the crack version because I
had<00:03:10.549> to<00:03:10.640> test<00:03:10.849> it<00:03:11.030> but<00:03:11.209> you<00:03:11.329> can<00:03:11.510> do<00:03:11.629> it<00:03:11.660> for<00:03:11.840> the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
had to test it but you can do it for the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.650 
had to test it but you can do it for the
crack<00:03:12.079> version<00:03:12.440> as<00:03:12.530> well<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.060> just<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.420> fix

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
crack version as well this is just a fix

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.629 
crack version as well this is just a fix
to<00:03:14.780> SLI<00:03:15.260> stutter<00:03:15.590> that's<00:03:15.859> what<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.190> fixes

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
to SLI stutter that's what that fixes

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.120 
to SLI stutter that's what that fixes
and<00:03:16.849> then<00:03:17.329> once<00:03:17.510> you've<00:03:17.660> downgraded<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.739> the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
and then once you've downgraded the the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.220 
and then once you've downgraded the the
drivers<00:03:19.609> what<00:03:19.819> happens<00:03:20.150> is<00:03:20.359> it<00:03:20.540> messes<00:03:20.870> up<00:03:20.900> and

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
drivers what happens is it messes up and

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.740 
drivers what happens is it messes up and
it<00:03:22.040> takes<00:03:22.340> away<00:03:22.639> the<00:03:22.940> trees<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.540> makes<00:03:23.660> the

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
it takes away the trees and makes the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.690 
it takes away the trees and makes the
trees<00:03:23.930> all<00:03:24.079> staticky<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:24.620> if<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:25.250> breaks<00:03:25.459> them

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
trees all staticky and if it breaks them

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.400 
trees all staticky and if it breaks them
again<00:03:25.970> because<00:03:26.450> normally<00:03:26.959> when<00:03:27.079> you<00:03:27.169> update

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
again because normally when you update

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.080 
again because normally when you update
the<00:03:27.500> driver<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.889> the<00:03:27.919> latest<00:03:28.250> one<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.609> fixes<00:03:28.940> it

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
the driver to the latest one it fixes it

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.610 
the driver to the latest one it fixes it
but<00:03:29.540> then<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.750> can't<00:03:29.959> use<00:03:30.079> shadowplay<00:03:30.440> so

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
but then you can't use shadowplay so

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.589 
but then you can't use shadowplay so
it's<00:03:30.859> kind<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.099> a<00:03:31.160> contradiction<00:03:31.519> so<00:03:32.299> after

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
it's kind of a contradiction so after

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.330 
it's kind of a contradiction so after
you<00:03:32.690> get<00:03:32.840> that<00:03:32.959> done<00:03:33.200> in<00:03:33.530> order<00:03:33.829> to<00:03:33.950> fix<00:03:34.190> the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
you get that done in order to fix the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.129 
you get that done in order to fix the
trees<00:03:34.609> thing<00:03:34.880> you're<00:03:35.419> just<00:03:35.480> gonna<00:03:35.690> go<00:03:35.900> on<00:03:35.930> the

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
trees thing you're just gonna go on the

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.680 
trees thing you're just gonna go on the
internet<00:03:36.349> again<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:37.400> you're<00:03:37.609> going<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.849> go

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.390 

you're<00:03:41.690> gonna<00:03:41.840> go<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.049> far<00:03:42.260> cry<00:03:42.470> 4<00:03:42.530> torrents<00:03:43.250> on

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
you're gonna go to far cry 4 torrents on

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.420 
you're gonna go to far cry 4 torrents on
I<00:03:43.849> would<00:03:44.030> say<00:03:44.060> kickass<00:03:44.569> so<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.799> you're<00:03:46.340> gonna
