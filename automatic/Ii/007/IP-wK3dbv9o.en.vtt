 young as it is as difficult as it is 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.100
 exciting ghosts but golden internet 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.170

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.660
 courses of different types most important 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.570
 they are masters and therefore courses of the duration 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.399
 a year a non-English Italian one 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.490
 characteristic of these courses will be 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.470
 the characteristic didactic approach 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.860
 of the university and therefore an approach 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.890
 based on both lectures and 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.280
 practice the educational journey and then the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.220
 visit to producers and companies related to 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.300
 world of food as well as obviously 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.190
 the acquisition of the techniques that for 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.560
 a cooking school is essential 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.540
 as they are short structured there will be one 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.130
 part of lectures for 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.710
 students a part of theory and practice is 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.259
 carried out in the gastronomic hall where 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.290
 there are convivial tables to be able to 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.920
 collect 78 students at most e 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.990
 behind has been redone restored one 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.780
 industrial kitchen 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.000
 following the lines 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.060
 common for a restaurant in service 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.260
 great importance will be given to the card 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.450
 to the product and therefore also the materials 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.130
 therefore material will not be declined 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.770
 by subject but every subject will come 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.170
 declined on a fundamental product 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.300
 for us it is the relationship with the cooks and 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.459
 Chef chefs fundamental for two reasons 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.959
 one because they helped us draw 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.750
 the school and also the training courses 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.060
 of the two masters and two because they will be 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.440
 those who will host that 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.290
 will transmit their experiences to 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.690
 students according to a simple outline 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.300
 or students will do two months here 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.920
 to pollenzo of practical theoretical lessons 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.050
 after which they will go three months into 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.569
 a tavern selected by the guides of 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.550
 osteria di sul food will return square 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.830
 another two months to continue to poll 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.430
 their training path for later 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.080
 go three more months in training though 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.700
 no longer in a tavern but in a 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.830
 restaurant and will close their 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.680
 training course with the last month here 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.140
 a pollenzo will be very important for us 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.269
 the sharing of experiences that i 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.980
 various students will do at the various 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.800
 reality and this because 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.200
 they will actually go to different regions 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.390
 different and it will be very important that 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.659
 when I come back here they will be able 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.290
 to bring to others also what 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:29.420
 have seen tasted and cooked the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.129
 Pollution cooking school in addition to the 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.440
 annual master in popular cooking 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.780
 Italian quality and slow mastering 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.940
 art of italian cuisine will also propose 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.099
 a series of amateur races intended for 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.709
 enthusiasts and aspiring chefs 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.299
 the themes will marry the full 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.090
 slow food biodiversity philosophy 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.860
 sustainability list education or if 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.349
 we want to raise awareness about food is 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.060
 important that people still 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.129
 know how to cook something that 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.430
 unfortunately it is also being lost in one 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.599
 reality like the Italian one 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.700
 how important the cook is 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.250
 multiplier and therefore it is a lot 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.560
 important to raise awareness among these people 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.109
 that in one way or another you take 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.599
 care or otherwise have the responsibility 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.989
 to prepare what other people do 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.989
 eat
