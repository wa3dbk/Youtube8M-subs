 is this program that we have here this 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.450
 what's here 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.970
 the imgburn 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.360
 I do not know how to pronounce it maybe in 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.360
 theory 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.210
 img for that purpose 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.210
 we go on the official website 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.940
 ww goal.com point and the link it 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.180
 I will leave the description in case 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.960
 they want to download the program and in this 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.370
 part 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.080
 after they enter the page they give 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.570
 download and search 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.130
 here is the language for the program 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.860
 what in Spanish 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.960
 in English 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.960
 in syrup as you want 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.670
 and after that we have not installed it and 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.330
 all that is going to open to us so we can 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.290
 Record 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.290
 come said 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.580
 create a disk image verify the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.240
 disc analyze the recording quality 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.670
 create file and folder images and 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.550
 record the file when the files of 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.300
 the movies 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:53.100
 we download commonly from blu-ray come 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:57.770
 so this mv folder is typical 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.240
 what we are going to do is click here 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.730
 when the program is installed by 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.220
 first time it appears 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.920
 this one that is checking verify the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.410
 please mark this what it does is 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.270
 to record verifies that the disc has been 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.600
 recorded well and will last long the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.150
 recording does not interest us that and the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.700
 speed just placed it and 4x them 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.040
 I recommend it is his disc 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.209
 just like your disk says to get worse 8x 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.209
 but I recommend 4x 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.960
 and me in my case I use lithium units of 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.870
 bluray 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.970
 I already have two years recording bluray and not 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.900
 has failed me I never have two burners 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.900
 of that and it does not fail me 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.900
 and it's very often in this folder 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.160
 we look where we have our movie 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.890
 in this case I have team will 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.850
 they place the Euroregion link 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.850
 we select the folder 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.569
 we give to whom I always go is for 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.280
 check the size that is the size 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.300
 just from 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.190
 of a 25 gb baby if it's the first time 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.990
 when they are going to record a blu-ray when 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.580
 the film selected the program will 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.160
 will automatically say the 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.620
 configuration that is going I think it says 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.330
 that if you want the program to use the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.400
 proper configuration something like that says 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.540
 to record your movies you tell him 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.340
 yes 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.430
 after this you give 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.290
 and in creating us it appears this is to confirm 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.470
 the disk name that says what name 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.040
 we want to give the Martians attack 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.500
 your name pedro one maria the one you 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.970
 you want and then we say yes and 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.580
 will start recording automatically 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.160
 our grief 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.700
 the average recording of a blue network 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.100
 it's 20 minutes 22 minutes no more day and 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.510
 if sometimes you can take a post on 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.050
 our the reader is failing but 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.350
 from there you can not stop www web layers 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:02.190
 it will take twice as long as 40 minutes 45 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.930
 minutes everything depends and I hope you 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.380
 have liked this tutorial and serve them 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.610
 I recommend 100% this great program 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.360
 As I said, I'm two years old 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.069
 recording 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.870
 bluray movies 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.150

 this channel that I will also do more gameplay 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.880
 football without too little because in this 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.940
 the country had 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.889
 with the economy and everything is great but 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.650
