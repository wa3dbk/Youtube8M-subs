00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
and simulate that a little bit actually

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.960 
and simulate that a little bit actually
a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.760> a<00:01:35.790> bit<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.320> I'm<00:01:38.009> also<00:01:38.250> adding<00:01:38.550> a<00:01:38.759> little

okay now let's go to the dirty bits mmm
that's<00:03:05.100> right<00:03:05.250> nice<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.700> dirty<00:03:05.790> myths<00:03:06.260> I'm

I<00:03:13.560> don't<00:03:13.980> use<00:03:14.100> it<00:03:14.130> very<00:03:14.250> often<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.940> pretty

I don't use it very often I I pretty

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.260 
I don't use it very often I I pretty
much<00:03:15.510> created<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.350> today<00:03:16.710> just<00:03:16.980> for<00:03:17.100> this

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
much created it today just for this

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
overdrive tone I brought it down a

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.680 
overdrive tone I brought it down a
little<00:03:26.280> bit<00:03:26.460> for<00:03:26.640> my<00:03:26.730> normal<00:03:27.090> just<00:03:27.390> because

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
little bit for my normal just because

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.710 
little bit for my normal just because
it's<00:03:28.560> our<00:03:28.680> Johnson<00:03:29.040> tone<00:03:29.190> come<00:03:29.550> on<00:03:29.670> it's<00:03:30.540> not

it's our Johnson tone come on it's not

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.500 
it's our Johnson tone come on it's not

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
70 on the distortion there's that and

70 on the distortion there's that and
that<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:41.120> am<00:03:42.120> using<00:03:42.240> a<00:03:42.390> gate<00:03:44.300> it's

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
that and that I am using a gate it's

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.900 
that and that I am using a gate it's
hard<00:03:45.540> gate<00:03:45.830> because<00:03:46.830> this<00:03:47.040> has<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.250> lot<00:03:47.580> of<00:03:47.730> gain

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
hard gate because this has a lot of gain

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
distortion gained a bit but for the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.870 
in it and h2 plus I believe in the
bridge<00:04:09.380> so<00:04:10.380> I'm<00:04:10.680> doing<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.340> little<00:04:11.459> bit<00:04:11.640> to

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
bridge so I'm doing a little bit to

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.070 
bridge so I'm doing a little bit to
accommodate<00:04:12.810> for<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.520> now<00:04:14.750> what<00:04:15.750> I'm<00:04:15.840> also

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
accommodate for that now what I'm also

doing oh you don't have forgot

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.170 
doing oh you don't have forgot
shee-it<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:20.150> forgot<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:22.290> EQ<00:04:22.940> there's<00:04:23.940> some<00:04:24.060> EQ

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
shee-it I forgot the EQ there's some EQ

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.470 
shee-it I forgot the EQ there's some EQ
happening<00:04:24.690> in<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.050> clean<00:04:25.440> bit<00:04:25.740> I'm<00:04:26.610> pulling

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
happening in the clean bit I'm pulling

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.470 
happening in the clean bit I'm pulling
down<00:04:27.600> some<00:04:27.810> low<00:04:27.990> end<00:04:28.430> because<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.640> intro<00:04:30.450> to

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
down some low end because the intro to

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.840 
down some low end because the intro to
that<00:04:30.600> song<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.080> just<00:04:31.230> played

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
that song that I just played

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.060 
that song that I just played
sort<00:04:32.850> of<00:04:32.880> sounded<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.240> way<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:34.650> I'm

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
sort of sounded that way and I'm

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:42.409 
sort of sounded that way and I'm
boosting<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.400> little<00:04:35.610> bit<00:04:39.230> now<00:04:40.230> with<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:41.419> with

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
boosting a little bit now with the with

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.060 
boosting a little bit now with the with
the<00:04:42.510> over<00:04:42.690> driven<00:04:42.960> bit<00:04:43.110> what<00:04:43.650> I'm<00:04:43.740> doing<00:04:43.980> is

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
the over driven bit what I'm doing is

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.650 
the over driven bit what I'm doing is
I'm<00:04:44.220> turning<00:04:44.640> off<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:45.780> modulation<00:04:46.320> and

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
I'm turning off the modulation and

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.140 
I'm turning off the modulation and
bringing<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.870> loop<00:04:49.770> back<00:04:49.980> in<00:04:50.160> also<00:04:50.880> turning

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
bringing the loop back in also turning

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.540 
bringing the loop back in also turning
off<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.360> EQ<00:04:51.660> so<00:04:52.530> this<00:04:52.710> is<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.010> way<00:04:53.130> that<00:04:53.310> looks

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
off the EQ so this is the way that looks

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:20.340 
off the EQ so this is the way that looks
for<00:04:54.540> the<00:04:54.630> order<00:04:54.900> from<00:04:54.960> bit<00:04:55.140> 1<00:04:55.500> here<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:56.490> goes

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.920 

there<00:05:21.350> you<00:05:21.470> have<00:05:21.620> it<00:05:21.650> everybody<00:05:22.750> some<00:05:23.750> new

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
there you have it everybody some new

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.170 
there you have it everybody some new
guitar<00:05:24.260> tone<00:05:24.500> for<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.800> new<00:05:24.920> year<00:05:25.280> I<00:05:25.460> hope<00:05:26.030> it's

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
guitar tone for the new year I hope it's

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.850 
guitar tone for the new year I hope it's
better

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
better

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.310 
better
it<00:05:27.860> sure<00:05:28.100> does<00:05:28.280> sound<00:05:28.520> better<00:05:28.640> to<00:05:28.850> me<00:05:28.880> when<00:05:29.180> I

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
it sure does sound better to me when I

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.840 
it sure does sound better to me when I
run<00:05:30.320> it<00:05:30.410> into<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.650> computer<00:05:30.860> which<00:05:31.280> is<00:05:31.490> sadly

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
run it into the computer which is sadly

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.700 
run it into the computer which is sadly
what<00:05:31.970> I<00:05:32.000> have<00:05:32.150> to<00:05:32.240> do<00:05:32.330> now<00:05:32.480> though<00:05:32.690> I've<00:05:33.410> had
