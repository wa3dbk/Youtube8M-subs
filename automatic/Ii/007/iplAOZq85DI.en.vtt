00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.380
 see the piece has one surface 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.230
 clean without fat and the second surface 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.300
 fat so here we will cut it by 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.219
 the surface where the fat is 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.059
 when he will drown he will 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.850
 seeping inside the meat cut into 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:45.649
 finger width pieces without cutting through 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.649
 completely to the ground like this 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.880
