this look is more for evening really and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.600 
this look is more for evening really and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
I know it's slightly eighties because

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.139 
I know it's slightly eighties because
I've<00:01:24.850> got<00:01:25.060> strong<00:01:25.840> lip<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:27.340> slightly<00:01:27.819> dark

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
eye as well and but I thought it really

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.919 
eye as well and but I thought it really
suited<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.149> dress<00:01:31.360> because<00:01:31.509> it's<00:01:31.690> got<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.869> bit

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
suited the dress because it's got a bit

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.380 
suited the dress because it's got a bit
of<00:01:32.110> a<00:01:32.140> shoulder<00:01:32.470> pad<00:01:32.800> going<00:01:33.130> on<00:01:33.280> here<00:01:33.550> so<00:01:33.850> it

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
of a shoulder pad going on here so it

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.620 
of a shoulder pad going on here so it
makes<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.259> quite<00:01:35.440> a<00:01:35.560> retro<00:01:36.460> feel<00:01:36.490> almost<00:01:37.090> and

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
makes it quite a retro feel almost and

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.420

of contouring going on underneath the
cheekbones<00:02:06.909> just<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.299> give<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:07.860> kind<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:09.160> a

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
cheekbones just to give that kind of a

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.040 
cheekbones just to give that kind of a
tease<00:02:09.729> feel<00:02:10.030> but<00:02:10.300> I've<00:02:10.390> tried<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.750> keep<00:02:10.869> it

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
tease feel but I've tried to keep it

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.040 
tease feel but I've tried to keep it
quite<00:02:11.260> modern<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:11.860> this<00:02:12.040> would<00:02:12.160> be<00:02:12.220> great<00:02:12.430> for

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
quite modern so this would be great for

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.630 
quite modern so this would be great for
you<00:02:14.050> know<00:02:14.110> after<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.680> date<00:02:14.890> where<00:02:15.190> I've<00:02:15.310> got

in your bag and a dash of red lipstick

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.960 
in your bag and a dash of red lipstick

shoes over and then you're ready to go
out<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.010> think<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.400> looks<00:02:24.730> quite<00:02:25.390> glamorous

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
out and I think it looks quite glamorous

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.839 
out and I think it looks quite glamorous
really<00:02:26.170> this<00:02:26.769> is<00:02:26.920> what<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.069> like<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.430> call<00:02:27.459> my

grown stroke banker look I've got on my
best<00:02:30.760> optics<00:02:31.269> which<00:02:31.810> I've<00:02:31.989> had<00:02:32.110> for<00:02:32.170> about

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
best optics which I've had for about

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.830 
best optics which I've had for about
seven<00:02:33.250> or<00:02:33.310> eight<00:02:33.370> years<00:02:33.510> completely<00:02:34.510> bashed

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
seven or eight years completely bashed

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.740 
seven or eight years completely bashed
up<00:02:35.110> but<00:02:35.440> I'm<00:02:36.069> next<00:02:36.340> still<00:02:36.640> going<00:02:37.299> strong<00:02:37.569> and

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
up but I'm next still going strong and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.780 
up but I'm next still going strong and
isn't<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.319> more<00:02:38.920> bashed<00:02:39.190> up<00:02:39.400> they<00:02:39.519> get<00:02:39.700> the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
isn't the more bashed up they get the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.680 
isn't the more bashed up they get the
better<00:02:39.940> than<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.209> look

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
better than you look

nice bit of black eye makeup just to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.069 
nice bit of black eye makeup just to
kind<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.930> define<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.350> eyes<00:02:50.470> as<00:02:50.769> a<00:02:50.829> new<00:02:51.640> lip<00:02:52.079> and

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
kind of define the eyes as a new lip and

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.930 
kind of define the eyes as a new lip and
I've<00:02:53.650> just<00:02:53.769> got<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.010> bit<00:02:54.100> tinted<00:02:54.519> moisturizer

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
I've just got a bit tinted moisturizer

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.580 
I've just got a bit tinted moisturizer
on<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.299> keep<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.600> skin<00:02:55.840> quite<00:02:56.079> blurry<00:02:56.410> and

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
on to keep the skin quite blurry and

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.620 
on to keep the skin quite blurry and
fresh<00:02:56.890> because<00:02:57.190> don't<00:02:57.340> going<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.519> be

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
fresh because don't going to be

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:06.290 
fresh because don't going to be
completely<00:02:58.630> made<00:02:58.780> up

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.720 

but<00:03:07.200> out<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.380> all<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.740> looks<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.190> think<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.580> is

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
but out of all the looks I think this is

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.240 
but out of all the looks I think this is
probably<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.720> will<00:03:10.050> wear<00:03:10.260> most<00:03:10.680> because

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
probably one I will wear most because

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.730 
probably one I will wear most because
it's<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.330> between<00:03:13.010> done<00:03:14.010> up<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.460> casual<00:03:15.450> and

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
it's in between done up and casual and

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.380 
it's in between done up and casual and
it's<00:03:16.740> just<00:03:16.920> really<00:03:17.070> easy<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.520> add<00:03:17.760> boots<00:03:18.090> very

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
it's just really easy to add boots very

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.120 
it's just really easy to add boots very
comfortable<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.440> don't<00:03:19.500> feel<00:03:19.770> like<00:03:19.980> I'm

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
comfortable and I don't feel like I'm

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.980 
comfortable and I don't feel like I'm
too<00:03:20.310> dressed<00:03:20.580> up<00:03:20.790> but<00:03:21.330> also<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.600> could<00:03:21.720> go<00:03:21.930> to

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
too dressed up but also I could go to

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.450 
too dressed up but also I could go to
meetings<00:03:22.440> or<00:03:22.590> whatever<00:03:22.890> in<00:03:23.070> this<00:03:23.220> dress

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
meetings or whatever in this dress

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.690 
meetings or whatever in this dress
because<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:24.450> looks<00:03:24.750> quite<00:03:25.020> smart<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.160> is

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
because it looks quite smart so that is

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.850 
because it looks quite smart so that is
my<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.480> it's<00:03:27.690> not<00:03:27.840> really<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.200> biker<00:03:28.470> grunge

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
my so it's not really a biker grunge

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.820 
my so it's not really a biker grunge
look<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.400> don't<00:03:29.670> know<00:03:29.880> why<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.030> should<00:03:30.150> call<00:03:30.360> it

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
look I don't know why I should call it

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.550 
look I don't know why I should call it
anyway<00:03:31.830> it's<00:03:32.010> my<00:03:32.100> favorite<00:03:32.430> one
