00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:13.980
 hello friends we are here to make mobiles wanted in this case it's about 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.140
 of a ring using these ski smara elements 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.650
 they are the reference to 51 81 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.460
 are the ones to decide what to call dt to go pulling and month 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.249
 that really are very nice 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.760
 using this same technique that we are going to do now we can do 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.940
 your temples 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.590
 little yaris rings 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.600
 the only downside is this reference is a bit expensive 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.180
 and we can not use 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.140
 as many as we would like 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.380
 also 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.380
 in fact 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.660
 of the piece of the most intimate excite 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 four millimeter balls of plates 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.409
 a little baby and lion 0 25 mm thick 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.610
 the realization of the ring this case will be very simple 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 but I hope it's ideas to make our creations 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.650
 The first thing we are going to do is quite important, not even the sand will go 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.070
 with about 50 centimeters it was smaller enough 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.260
 simply 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.240
 we are introducing 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.520
 the different barriers and as follows 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.100
 one end of the thread 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.100
 for each leaf thread 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.630
 and we take the piece to the center of the thread 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.510
 and then 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.510
 at each end of the inau a silver bullet 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.750
 villanueva 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.960
 a piece of swarovski 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.899
 in this case I am condemning the amethyst color 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.299
 with the color 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.299
 crystal haven 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.419
 cÃ³rdoba and this time you will rods if you want form of breeding angle 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:34.179
 the ring is making this effect 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.889
 it is very original 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.709
 we follow 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.749
 using the same technique 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:44.939
 a silver bullet each end 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.109
 and then 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.570
 a piece of s / likewise on the grid the result 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.709
 the truth 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.709
 which is very nice now to make the closure 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.439
 what I'm going to do 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.439
 in getting a little wine from this extreme 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.469
 and cut it in half 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.639
 road and several worlds 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.639
 in each part 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:29.379
 the minutes after how glory is explained several times 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.379
 we can hide them inside the accounts 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:51.849
 now another two or three nulls 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.849
 an extreme 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:04.699
 in my case to do in the millenium entity 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.069
 the detainee imposed by the constitutionalist 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.469
 what happens here in more 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:13.369
 it's been this part of the ring 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:15.429
 that did not look 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:18.019
 it would be however 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.019
 the part where there are several sets 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.729
 It also allows you to consider 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.279
 and use more and my case 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:32.800
 Well now I only have left 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.800
 hide this nule within the account 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.710
 and then cut at the ends of the Lyon 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.539
 discounted with the ends of the centuries 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:26.550
 for her 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.550
 coasts 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.639
 in this way they will remain in tandil 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:52.499
 these things are what he explained feels 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.259
 it cost us all the extremes 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.150
 I hope you are encouraging us to do our creations 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.279
 I hope and wish that civil countries 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.279
 we will face solving them as soon as possible 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.379
 the millionaire without a doubt 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:27.270
 I think it's very elegant 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.710
 and what do they want for them 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.460
 in any situation 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.289
 Well, thank you very much for coming these days and see you soon 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.289
 San Diego 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.249
 p 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:51.389
 the 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:51.680
 efe
