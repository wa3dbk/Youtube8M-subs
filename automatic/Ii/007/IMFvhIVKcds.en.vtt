00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.390
 Welcome to the first part of my video test the new Nokia N95 8GB 

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:08.229
 job 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.879
 the new m5 90 is a technical as well as an optical one 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.949
 modified version of the old n95 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.589
 a straight ahead 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.800
 the n95 would have to be released straight in that version then 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.859
 Buyers and Nokia have spared some problems 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.419
 At first glance, it becomes clear 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.419
 that the design has partially completely changed 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.090
 we see 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.090
 the savings plans in the paint 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.590
 At the back is the guardrail Matt Thornton is light and spatial 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.800
 over 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.740
 Here it is also clear that you have a new 95 in the hand 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.840
 because the camera cover with old 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.920
 Shake completely 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.320
 she was rationalized 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.450
 one or the other may now say that catamaran Jung leads to it 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.660
 that the comrades are now more often DAX will share this opinion I 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.210
 Not 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.470
 but not the actual improvements under this Baku blanket 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.090
 because the new m5 90 8 gigabyte image with the money sextet operated an acute 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.370
 Anette Wagner 12 MacLean PH has about one-third 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.930
 is more powerful 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.510
 this improvement for everyday use an acute Auer which is around 50 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.510
 Percent has decreased 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.070
 Other technical changes have been made to the 8 gigabytes internal 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.070
 Memory not actually made 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.710
 the control panels unit 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.850
 dat wat shrunk the Finns shrunk the left sortie to the Auditors 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.620
 give 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.150
 the menu button 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.280
 multimedia files 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.850
 the navigation Kreuth 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.860
 when on the calls Anna Mungiu danced both 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.860
 this unit is now clear compared to the old model 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.159
 the keyboard has become actual compared to the old n94
