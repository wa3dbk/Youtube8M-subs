face and you can't even enjoy yeah it's
very<00:01:32.820> frustrating<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.630> your<00:01:33.750> face<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.110> what

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
very frustrating in your face is what

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.840 
very frustrating in your face is what
you<00:01:34.350> show<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> world<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.220> can't<00:01:35.430> hide<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
you show the world so you can't hide it

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.270

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
no matter how you cover it it seems to

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.550 
no matter how you cover it it seems to
just<00:01:38.490> make<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.729> worse<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.420> okay<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.020> things

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
just make it worse so okay so things

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.859 
just make it worse so okay so things

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.450 
though change dramatically you they did
when<00:01:43.140> did<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.470> did<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> made<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> connection

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
when did that did I made a connection

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.910 
when did that did I made a connection
between<00:01:44.759> my<00:01:45.509> history<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.020> taking<00:01:46.170> antibiotics

it's<00:02:00.600> never<00:02:00.810> come<00:02:01.079> back<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.969> way<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.119> did

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
it's never come back so I the way I did

it's never come back so I the way I did
that<00:02:03.450> was<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.840> went<00:02:04.110> on<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> fast<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.740> fruit<00:02:04.950> fast

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that was I went on a fast a fruit fast

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.459 
that was I went on a fast a fruit fast
for<00:02:05.790> three<00:02:05.820> days<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> typical<00:02:06.899> facet

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
for three days so not a typical facet

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.749 
for three days so not a typical facet
you<00:02:07.530> hear<00:02:07.710> about<00:02:07.799> where<00:02:08.099> people<00:02:08.369> don't<00:02:08.520> eat

anything I just only apples for three

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.200 
anything I just only apples for three
days<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
days and the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.180 
days and the
I<00:02:13.240> guess<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.570> fiber<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.590> enzymes<00:02:14.740> in<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
I guess the fiber and the enzymes in the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.740 
I guess the fiber and the enzymes in the
Apple<00:02:15.550> that's<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.850> scientific<00:02:16.030> research

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
Apple that's the scientific research

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.920 
Apple that's the scientific research
that's<00:02:16.930> behind<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.410> now<00:02:17.530> actually<00:02:18.780> created<00:02:19.780> an

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
that's behind it now actually created an

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.570 
that's behind it now actually created an
environment<00:02:20.290> where<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:20.770> got<00:02:21.010> back<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.220> balance

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
environment where I got back in balance

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.700 
environment where I got back in balance
and<00:02:22.000> then<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.240> acne<00:02:22.570> just<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.960> went<00:02:23.140> away<00:02:23.200> by

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
tool I'm 43 now so what's the map almost

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.170 
tool I'm 43 now so what's the map almost
20<00:02:58.750> years<00:02:59.050> really<00:02:59.830> young<00:03:00.160> by<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:00.550> way<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:00.880> think

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
20 years really young by the way I think

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.970 
20 years really young by the way I think
that's<00:03:01.570> worked<00:03:01.990> yeah<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.290> think<00:03:02.590> that's<00:03:02.740> part

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
that's worked yeah I think that's part

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.380 
that's worked yeah I think that's part
of<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.190> whole<00:03:03.340> thing<00:03:03.550> of<00:03:03.670> learning<00:03:04.240> how<00:03:04.330> to

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
of the whole thing of learning how to

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.900
