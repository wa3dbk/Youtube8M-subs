wanted to for the Saturday night main

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.760 
wanted to for the Saturday night main
events<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.780> feel<00:02:54.810> though<00:02:55.140> it<00:02:55.290> was<00:02:55.620> like

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
events I feel though it was like

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.870 
events I feel though it was like
probably<00:02:55.980> like<00:02:56.160> eight<00:02:56.370> or<00:02:56.400> nine<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.640> year

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
probably like eight or nine a year

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.550 
probably like eight or nine a year
though<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.480> was<00:02:57.570> off<00:02:57.780> no<00:02:58.080> because<00:02:58.290> they<00:02:58.530> have

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
though it was off no because they have

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.720 
though it was off no because they have
all<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.890> them<00:02:59.010> up<00:02:59.100> there<00:02:59.310> now<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.460> I<00:02:59.670> think

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
all of them up there now and I think

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.090 
all of them up there now and I think
there's<00:03:00.030> probably<00:03:00.240> 20<00:03:00.660> episodes<00:03:01.110> between<00:03:01.380> 85

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
there's probably 20 episodes between 85

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.960 
there's probably 20 episodes between 85

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
usually do like the sorta I guess

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.370 
usually do like the sorta I guess
biggest<00:03:51.300> match<00:03:51.420> like<00:03:51.630> if<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:51.810> was<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:51.959> Hogan<00:03:52.170> on

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
biggest match like if it was a Hogan on

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.250 
biggest match like if it was a Hogan on
there<00:03:52.590> you'd<00:03:52.950> see<00:03:53.040> him<00:03:53.220> like<00:03:53.970> 2/3<00:03:54.870> 3<00:03:55.080> like

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
there you'd see him like 2/3 3 like

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.690 
there you'd see him like 2/3 3 like
probably<00:03:55.410> on<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.860> hour<00:03:56.010> mark<00:03:56.340> then<00:03:56.489> after

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
probably on the hour mark then after

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.820 
probably on the hour mark then after
that<00:03:56.790> you'd<00:03:56.970> have<00:03:57.120> one<00:03:57.300> or<00:03:57.420> two<00:03:57.570> lower<00:03:58.560> make

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
that you'd have one or two lower make

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.440 
that you'd have one or two lower make
