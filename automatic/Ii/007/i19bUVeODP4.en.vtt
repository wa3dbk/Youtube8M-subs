and<00:00:26.160> Wendell<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.260> order<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.289> one<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.830> I've

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and Wendell in order that one in I've

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.919 
and Wendell in order that one in I've
split<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.880> up<00:00:30.000> obviously<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.510> wish<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.810> could

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
split that up obviously I wish you could

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.510 
split that up obviously I wish you could
run<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.080> first<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> game<00:00:34.100> so<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.190> just

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
run that first in the game so you just

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.639 
run that first in the game so you just
need<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.910> get<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.390> sort<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.050> end<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.590> the

need to get to that sort of end of the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.920 
need to get to that sort of end of the

some business doesn't have to have a
full<00:00:45.239> ammo<00:00:45.510> he's<00:00:45.960> been<00:00:46.110> doing<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.410> 15<00:00:46.590> times

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
full ammo he's been doing this 15 times

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.490 
full ammo he's been doing this 15 times
an<00:00:47.250> hour

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
an hour

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.500 
an hour
and<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.370> three<00:00:49.700> governor

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
and the three governor

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.030 
and the three governor
there's<00:00:51.079> at<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.380> end<00:00:51.500> of<00:00:51.590> this<00:00:51.649> video<00:00:51.829> I<00:00:51.950> think

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
there's at the end of this video I think

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.790 
there's at the end of this video I think
a<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.460> switching<00:00:52.940> into<00:00:53.180> a<00:00:53.270> shotgun<00:00:53.540> very

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
a the switching into a shotgun very

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.590 
a the switching into a shotgun very
ineffectively<00:00:54.800> but<00:00:55.550> yeah<00:00:55.970> just<00:00:56.150> shoot<00:00:56.390> it<00:00:56.510> up

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
ineffectively but yeah just shoot it up

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.140 
ineffectively but yeah just shoot it up
until<00:00:57.110> someone<00:00:57.410> starts<00:00:57.590> calling<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:57.950> cops

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
until someone starts calling the cops

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.910 
until someone starts calling the cops
let<00:00:59.150> them<00:00:59.180> call<00:00:59.600> it<00:00:59.629> and<00:00:59.870> just<00:01:00.320> start<00:01:00.620> driving

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
let them call it and just start driving

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.819 
let them call it and just start driving
down<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.489> highway<00:01:01.900> so<00:01:02.900> just<00:01:03.140> drive<00:01:03.290> north<00:01:03.620> ear

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
down the highway so just drive north ear

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.370 
down the highway so just drive north ear
from<00:01:04.250> Brenna<00:01:04.699> docks<00:01:05.000> up<00:01:05.720> through<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.170> loop

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
from Brenna docks up through the loop

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.120 
from Brenna docks up through the loop
and<00:01:06.950> then<00:01:07.130> up<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.610> Med<00:01:07.820> mile<00:01:08.119> at<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.390> end

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
and then up to the Med mile at the end

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.430 
and then up to the Med mile at the end
and<00:01:10.130> once<00:01:10.340> you've<00:01:10.640> got<00:01:11.240> there<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:11.930> scans<00:01:12.290> will

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
and once you've got there the scans will

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.380 
and once you've got there the scans will
be<00:01:12.530> complete<00:01:12.920> you'll<00:01:13.250> be<00:01:13.460> safe<00:01:13.820> at<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.060> scan

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
be complete you'll be safe at the scan

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.609 
be complete you'll be safe at the scan
so<00:01:14.660> one<00:01:14.930> run

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
so one run

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.349 
so one run
one<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> scans<00:01:17.399> you<00:01:17.549> need<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> get<00:01:17.880> 15<00:01:18.210> from

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
one of the scans you need to get 15 from

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.300 
one of the scans you need to get 15 from
the<00:01:18.420> trophy<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.590> drive<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> other
