where digital speedpaint

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.509 
where digital speedpaint
though<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.049> just<00:00:13.139> didn't<00:00:13.559> really<00:00:14.130> find<00:00:14.400> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
though I just didn't really find the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.250 
though I just didn't really find the
time<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.849> actually<00:00:14.940> record<00:00:15.210> my<00:00:15.420> voice<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.230> I

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
time to actually record my voice so I

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.500 
time to actually record my voice so I

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
reference sheet but she has orange hair

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.149 
reference sheet but she has orange hair
and<00:01:52.110> everything<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.590> she<00:01:52.680> likes<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> wear<00:01:53.100> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and everything and she likes to wear a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.760 
and everything and she likes to wear a
purple<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.820> blue<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.659> that's<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.470> then

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
purple and blue so that's that and then

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.950 
purple and blue so that's that and then
I<00:01:55.799> made<00:01:55.979> another<00:01:56.250> icon<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:57.180> really<00:01:57.509> random<00:01:57.689> I

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
I made another icon just really random I

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.090 
I made another icon just really random I
actually<00:01:58.079> don't<00:01:58.290> really<00:01:58.439> like<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.860> one<00:01:58.920> too

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
actually don't really like this one too

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.819 
actually don't really like this one too
much<00:01:59.340> because<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.969> kind<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.479> looks<00:02:00.630> weird

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
much because this kind of looks weird

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.289 
much because this kind of looks weird
but<00:02:01.829> yeah<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> called<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.520> pink<00:02:02.759> Elmo<00:02:03.270> I

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
but yeah I called it pink Elmo I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.539 
but yeah I called it pink Elmo I
probably<00:02:04.259> because<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.649> has<00:02:04.770> pink<00:02:05.009> hair<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
probably because it has pink hair and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.089 
probably because it has pink hair and
the<00:02:06.420> next<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.380> drawing<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.429> named

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
the next one is a drawing that I named

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.250 
the next one is a drawing that I named
outside<00:02:11.099> because<00:02:11.690> there's<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.750> window<00:02:13.110> when

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
outside because there's a window when

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.850 
outside because there's a window when
he's<00:02:13.379> looking<00:02:13.500> at

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
he's looking at

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.680 
he's looking at
side<00:02:14.010> with<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> sunset<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.180> clouds<00:02:15.450> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
side with like a sunset and clouds and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.740 
side with like a sunset and clouds and
everything<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.830> that's<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.220> one<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.750> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
everything so that's that one and the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.650 
everything so that's that one and the
next<00:02:18.900> one<00:02:19.280> was<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> commission<00:02:20.850> for<00:02:21.120> someone<00:02:21.450> on

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
next one was a commission for someone on

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.500 
next one was a commission for someone on
deviantART<00:02:22.380> it's<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.250> drawing<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.970> their<00:02:24.210> lion

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
deviantART it's a drawing of their lion

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.570 
deviantART it's a drawing of their lion
character<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.380> in<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.740> an<00:02:25.950> throw<00:02:26.190> for<00:02:26.460> him

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
character it's in like an throw for him

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.610 
character it's in like an throw for him
and<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.150> decided<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.720> accept<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.170> Commission

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
and I decided to accept the Commission

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.110 
and I decided to accept the Commission
because<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.010> was<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.160> good<00:02:29.490> challenge<00:02:29.730> for<00:02:30.030> me

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
because it was a good challenge for me

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.790 
because it was a good challenge for me
to<00:02:30.180> try<00:02:30.330> draw<00:02:30.540> something<00:02:30.840> different<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.380> I

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
to try draw something different and I

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.740 
to try draw something different and I
think<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.100> turned<00:02:32.310> out<00:02:32.370> okay<00:02:32.760> I'll<00:02:33.390> put<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.570> link

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
think it turned out okay I'll put a link

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.060 
think it turned out okay I'll put a link
to<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.080> description<00:02:34.200> once<00:02:34.770> again

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
to that in the description once again

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.300 
to that in the description once again
and<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.910> next<00:02:36.180> one<00:02:36.330> is<00:02:36.570> my<00:02:36.870> first<00:02:37.140> ever<00:02:37.350> actual

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
and the next one is my first ever actual

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.190 
and the next one is my first ever actual
OC<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.910> came<00:02:39.090> before<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.480> orange<00:02:39.780> haired<00:02:40.020> one

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
OC it came before the orange haired one

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.170 
OC it came before the orange haired one
and<00:02:40.530> her<00:02:40.950> name<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.100> ivory<00:02:41.610> now<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.060> like

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
and her name is ivory now it's just like

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.300 
and her name is ivory now it's just like
a<00:02:42.209> chibi<00:02:42.570> version<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:43.230> her<00:02:43.380> but<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.860> honestly

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
a chibi version of her but I honestly

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.370 
a chibi version of her but I honestly
don't<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.420> want<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.660> redo<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.140> I

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
don't like it and I want to redo it so I

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.340 
don't like it and I want to redo it so I
probably<00:02:46.770> will<00:02:46.980> be<00:02:47.160> redoing<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:49.260> the

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
probably will be redoing that and the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.830 
probably will be redoing that and the
next<00:02:49.560> one<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.830> just<00:02:50.100> like<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:51.030> headshot

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
next one is just like a headshot

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.660 
next one is just like a headshot
practice<00:02:52.380> on<00:02:52.530> paint<00:02:52.770> tool<00:02:52.950> sign<00:02:53.250> nothing
