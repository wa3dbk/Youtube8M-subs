00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.470
 I greet you all my friends and I 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.610
 new fragrance is a mask of the night filing 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.650
 like claus fight box 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.859
 Here is such a bottle unusual and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.900
 purchase history of such 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.710
 as now everywhere sales I went 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.410
 to fly 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.320
 and already before leaving it as always 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.660
 It happens to me I saw this bottle 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.660
 which circular horror as well as not like 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.130
 well , at least when you didn't like 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.160
 now somehow but normally and I saw 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.920
 These are bottles and I think yes even attack 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.809
 at the exit opened squirted sniffed 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.809
 understood nothing heard nothing 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.480
 nothing felt and spattered yet 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.219
 I thought suddenly by spattered sniff no 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.719
 Nothing and thinking is he really 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.160
 such lungs 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.359
 he is not heard he is not felt and so 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.360
 then began to go watch and then 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.780
 still began to sniff it in my 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.409
 arm and you know and then I him 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.689
 felt usually aromas are like 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.240
 you splattered 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:22.560
 much yes you are angry you understand 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.290
 what spirtyagu and start walking shake 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.800
 hand to all dispelled to the whole 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.010
 this alcohol and top notes 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.500
 come out and then you base and 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.550
 enjoy it but she then quickly leaves 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.050
 it's the other way around 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:41.320
 here you sniff him listen to him and not 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.700
 feel you don't understand him really 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.270
 so light but then later and now 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.720
 let's get everything in order 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.850
 aroma of the bay and the ninth year 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.450
 moschino light clouds light clouds 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.640
 Called I would never have acquired 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.840
 such a flag but it is not mine in fact I 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.950
 love more classic vials either 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.940
 something unusual but not like that 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.610
 here is something that is not mine 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.690
 here are my friends if I said no then this 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:24.360
 I will definitely have 2 thousand and nine 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.320
 years and include riveting 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.250
 flower and fruit in my opinion I am right 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.880
 uttered 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.130
 and what does he smell like after you 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.130
 hear him how you felt him 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.290
 first fruits come so light 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.989
 fruits fruit transparent unobtrusive 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.310
 they then stretch to fade out what 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:53.480
 I really like and he sits you know in 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.400
 so soft and light so fluffy 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.629
 out of such warmth 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.120
 although the aroma is cold here I often 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.370
 I confuse warm aromas and cold aromas 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.000
 Well, I do not know why this happens with 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.720
 by me but like this and you know and he 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.540
 so calm he is so soft he 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.720
 really soft when you already sit down 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:22.220
 such a warm sv with such a 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:25.340
 aroma and I liked it for ease 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.329
 this and the warmth I donâ€™t know him 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.889
 I feel so 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:34.069
 but for me soft warm fluffy 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:37.190
 so know them very hard to go too far 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.470
 and I can take a few times a day 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.920
 know our our necessarily hair on 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.880
 clothes otherwise if you will 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.840
 on the body and if you have skin type 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.120
 dry 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.959
 cold skin will just eat it 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.930
 so I think it's very hard for them 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:02.290
 overdo it such an unusual 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.840
 the bottle and I don't know how it will behave 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.170
 heat I do not know how it will be revealed 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.599
 In the summer I will try traces of life because I 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.409
 already pretty much him 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:17.109
 emit a gallon of yourself 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:20.820
 so who wants 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:25.300
 light warm unobtrusive 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:28.240
 you know the flavor 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.699
 until girlish feminine it's not an adult 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.280
 some kind of stiff aunt who 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:36.190

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.699

 this is not aldehyde this is not very 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:46.530
 this is not something so serious this 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.850
 here is thin and at the same moment soft here 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.260
 so you know how here 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:59.260
 it is not the first snow that falls, but when 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.900

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.780

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.970
 the bulk of the snow here it is 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.790
 here you take him the way snow snow they blind 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.190
 are obtained because he is dry himself by 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.700
 imagine this snow air could not earlier 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.760
