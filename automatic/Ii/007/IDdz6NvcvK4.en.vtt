00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
their spark they won 3-1 as well against

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.000 
their spark they won 3-1 as well against
you<00:06:25.940> and<00:06:26.090> B<00:06:26.180> and<00:06:26.450> again<00:06:27.020> could<00:06:27.530> have<00:06:27.620> been<00:06:27.680> 61

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
you and B and again could have been 61

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.490 
you and B and again could have been 61
but<00:06:28.370> kind<00:06:28.940> of<00:06:29.030> had<00:06:29.720> a<00:06:29.750> couple<00:06:29.990> kind<00:06:30.290> of<00:06:30.350> go<00:06:30.410> off

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
but kind of had a couple kind of go off

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.110 
but kind of had a couple kind of go off
the<00:06:30.620> crossbar<00:06:30.860> but<00:06:31.310> I<00:06:31.340> think<00:06:31.610> both<00:06:31.760> teams<00:06:31.790> are

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
the crossbar but I think both teams are

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.850 
the crossbar but I think both teams are
pretty<00:06:32.240> competitive<00:06:32.810> and<00:06:33.020> hopefully<00:06:33.680> by<00:06:33.800> the

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
pretty competitive and hopefully by the

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.350 
pretty competitive and hopefully by the
end<00:06:33.950> of<00:06:34.070> October<00:06:34.490> first<00:06:34.640> November<00:06:35.150> they'll<00:06:35.270> be

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
end of October first November they'll be

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.270 
end of October first November they'll be
able<00:06:35.420> to<00:06:35.510> challenge<00:06:35.690> for<00:06:35.870> an<00:06:36.050> AOS<00:06:36.290> title<00:06:36.620> and

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
able to challenge for an AOS title and

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.650 
able to challenge for an AOS title and
it's<00:06:37.550> looking<00:06:37.850> good<00:06:37.970> as<00:06:38.120> you<00:06:38.240> said<00:06:38.419> for<00:06:38.600> the

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
it's looking good as you said for the

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.230 
it's looking good as you said for the
men<00:06:38.810> here<00:06:38.990> today<00:06:39.230> how's<00:06:39.410> the<00:06:39.560> score<00:06:39.860> now<00:06:40.240> to

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
men here today how's the score now to

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.880 
men here today how's the score now to
nothing<00:06:41.600> right<00:06:41.900> now<00:06:41.930> and<00:06:42.260> again<00:06:42.500> I<00:06:42.530> think<00:06:42.650> they

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
nothing right now and again I think they

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.409 
nothing right now and again I think they
had<00:06:43.040> a<00:06:43.070> couple<00:06:43.550> good<00:06:43.730> chance<00:06:44.000> as<00:06:44.150> a<00:06:44.180> goalie

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
had a couple good chance as a goalie

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:45.909 
had a couple good chance as a goalie
from<00:06:44.630> you<00:06:44.750> and<00:06:44.870> be<00:06:44.960> even<00:06:45.169> very<00:06:45.200> strong<00:06:45.680> and

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
from you and be even very strong and

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:47.680 
from you and be even very strong and
hopefully<00:06:46.550> we<00:06:46.640> can<00:06:46.760> hold<00:06:46.940> on<00:06:47.120> and<00:06:47.360> get<00:06:47.600> it

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
hopefully we can hold on and get it

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.880 
hopefully we can hold on and get it
three<00:06:47.870> more<00:06:48.050> points<00:06:48.230> for<00:06:48.410> the<00:06:48.560> men's<00:06:48.740> team

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
three more points for the men's team

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.290 
three more points for the men's team
