the<00:01:04.019> lashes<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> strip<00:01:04.949> always<00:01:05.400> look

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the lashes in the strip always look

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.039 
the lashes in the strip always look
different<00:01:05.939> when<00:01:06.119> they<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.600> go<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.720> some

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
different when they actually go on some

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.039 
different when they actually go on some
of<00:01:07.110> these<00:01:07.170> eyes<00:01:08.090> just<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.299> know<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.869> strip

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
of these eyes just so you know the strip

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.920 
of these eyes just so you know the strip
lash<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> regular<00:01:10.880> length<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.150> guess<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
lash is a regular length I guess but I

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.870 
lash is a regular length I guess but I
cut<00:01:13.140> them<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.439> about<00:01:13.680> half<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.670> three-quarters

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
cut them to about half to three-quarters

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.670 
cut them to about half to three-quarters
of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> sides<00:01:15.659> because<00:01:15.900> my<00:01:16.049> eyes<00:01:16.200> are<00:01:16.229> fairly

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
of the sides because my eyes are fairly

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.280 
of the sides because my eyes are fairly
small<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.580> if<00:01:18.270> they<00:01:18.450> look<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:18.780> small<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.140> me

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
small so if they look really small on me

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.350 
small so if they look really small on me
not<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.830> worry<00:01:19.979> they<00:01:20.340> are<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> full<00:01:20.790> size<00:01:21.060> so

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
not to worry they are the full size so

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.899 
not to worry they are the full size so
they<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.750> fit<00:01:21.930> anyway<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.490> ones<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.880> i

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.290 
actually found these extremely
uncomfortable<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:11.160> wear<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.580> has<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> very

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
uncomfortable to wear it has a very

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.280 
uncomfortable to wear it has a very
thick<00:02:12.720> band

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
thick band

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.259 
thick band
didn't<00:02:13.560> conform<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.189> shape<00:02:14.219> of<00:02:14.549> my<00:02:14.579> eye<00:02:14.700> at

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
didn't conform to the shape of my eye at

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.140 
didn't conform to the shape of my eye at
all<00:02:15.599> so<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.930> didn't<00:02:16.319> like<00:02:16.439> them<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:17.760> next<00:02:17.969> pair

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
all so I didn't like them this next pair

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.030 
all so I didn't like them this next pair
of<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.329> Gypsy<00:02:18.689> ones<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.349> lash<00:02:19.560> band<00:02:19.859> was

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
of the Gypsy ones and the lash band was

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.729 
of the Gypsy ones and the lash band was
really<00:02:20.459> nice<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.670> was<00:02:20.939> very<00:02:21.299> thin<00:02:21.739> discreet

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
really nice it was very thin discreet

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.220 
really nice it was very thin discreet
but<00:02:23.519> I<00:02:23.790> didn't<00:02:24.090> like<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.209> lashes<00:02:24.659> themselves

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
but I didn't like the lashes themselves

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.390 
but I didn't like the lashes themselves
just<00:02:25.409> because<00:02:25.650> they<00:02:25.769> looked<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.069> little<00:02:26.219> bit

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
just because they looked a little bit

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.030 
just because they looked a little bit
too<00:02:26.640> unkempt<00:02:27.150> on<00:02:27.420> me<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:28.560> next<00:02:28.799> center<00:02:28.980> of

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
too unkempt on me the next center of

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.429 
too unkempt on me the next center of
japonesque<00:02:29.579> lashes<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.750> actually<00:02:31.140> hated

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
japonesque lashes and I actually hated

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.080 
japonesque lashes and I actually hated
these<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.890> most<00:02:32.099> they're<00:02:32.609> supposed<00:02:32.939> to<00:02:32.970> be

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
these the most they're supposed to be

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.789 
these the most they're supposed to be
really<00:02:33.239> good<00:02:33.510> r<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.750> good<00:02:34.140> quality<00:02:34.349> but<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
really good r and good quality but the

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.099 
really good r and good quality but the
band<00:02:35.010> again<00:02:35.250> was<00:02:35.430> extremely<00:02:36.030> thick<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.540> didn't

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
band again was extremely thick it didn't

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.630 
band again was extremely thick it didn't
wear<00:02:37.230> while<00:02:37.439> on<00:02:37.590> my<00:02:37.620> eye<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.220> didn't<00:02:38.519> like

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
wear while on my eye and I didn't like

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.759 
wear while on my eye and I didn't like
the<00:02:38.670> overall<00:02:38.879> look<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:40.079> little<00:02:40.470> bit<00:02:40.620> too

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
the overall look a little bit too

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.429 
the overall look a little bit too
dramatic<00:02:41.189> and<00:02:41.370> not<00:02:41.609> even<00:02:41.849> nice<00:02:42.139> the<00:02:43.139> duo's

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:43.439 
dramatic and not even nice the duo's

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.990 
dramatic and not even nice the duo's
were<00:02:43.590> my<00:02:43.739> favorite<00:02:44.129> they<00:02:44.340> had<00:02:44.489> a<00:02:44.519> thick<00:02:44.790> band

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
were my favorite they had a thick band

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.490 
were my favorite they had a thick band
as<00:02:45.150> well<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:45.420> these<00:02:45.569> were<00:02:45.750> quite<00:02:46.109> a<00:02:46.139> bit<00:02:46.319> more

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
as well but these were quite a bit more

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.809 
as well but these were quite a bit more
comfortable<00:02:46.859> aware<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.489> have<00:02:47.700> been

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
comfortable aware and I have been

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.190 
comfortable aware and I have been
wearing<00:02:48.000> them<00:02:48.209> every<00:02:48.480> day<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.810> last<00:02:48.930> two

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
wearing them every day of the last two

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.710 
wearing them every day of the last two
weeks<00:02:49.409> think<00:02:50.129> its<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.310> mix<00:02:50.489> between<00:02:50.720> natural

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
weeks think its a mix between natural

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.979 
weeks think its a mix between natural
and<00:02:52.109> dramatic<00:02:52.829> so<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.040> really<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.989> the

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
and dramatic so I really like that the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.300 
and dramatic so I really like that the
other<00:02:55.019> release<00:02:55.650> ones<00:02:55.859> are<00:02:56.010> kind<00:02:56.099> of<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
other release ones are kind of the

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.729 
other release ones are kind of the
crosshairs<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.389> these<00:02:58.049> ones<00:02:58.260> had<00:02:58.439> two<00:02:58.560> thick

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
crosshairs and these ones had two thick

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.800 
crosshairs and these ones had two thick
band<00:02:58.919> as<00:02:59.069> well<00:02:59.099> I<00:02:59.549> wasn't<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.269> huge<00:03:00.450> fan<00:03:00.569> of

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
band as well I wasn't a huge fan of

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.599 
band as well I wasn't a huge fan of
these<00:03:01.079> ones<00:03:01.379> I<00:03:01.799> just<00:03:02.099> don't<00:03:02.250> like<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.519> way

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
these ones I just don't like the way

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.339
