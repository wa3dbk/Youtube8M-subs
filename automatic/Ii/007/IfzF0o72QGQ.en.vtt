everyone<00:00:34.500> that's<00:00:34.829> thinking<00:00:35.280> about<00:00:35.550> this

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
everyone that's thinking about this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.590 
everyone that's thinking about this
process<00:00:36.180> assuming<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.410> not<00:00:37.559> hard<00:00:38.210> my<00:00:39.210> hair

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.799 
process assuming it's not hard my hair
is<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.739> much<00:00:40.950> easier<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.700> maintain<00:00:41.879> than<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
is so much easier to maintain than it
