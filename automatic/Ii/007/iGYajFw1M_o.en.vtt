00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
here so I'll promote this variation e

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.559 
here so I'll promote this variation e

interesting move here which Arab we came

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.320 
interesting move here which Arab we came
up<00:02:38.530> with<00:02:39.010> earlier<00:02:39.700> um<00:02:41.400> which<00:02:42.400> may<00:02:42.640> be<00:02:42.670> worth<00:02:43.000> a

punt<00:02:44.730> you're<00:02:45.730> not<00:02:45.880> seeing<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.300> here<00:02:46.420> at<00:02:46.569> the

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
punt you're not seeing it here at the

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.420 
punt you're not seeing it here at the
moment<00:02:46.780> surprisingly<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.800> thought<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.310> would

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
moment surprisingly I thought it would

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.790 
moment surprisingly I thought it would
have<00:02:48.580> been<00:02:48.730> none<00:02:49.319> featured<00:02:50.319> eggs<00:02:50.470> I've<00:02:50.650> got

have been none featured eggs I've got

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.610 
have been none featured eggs I've got
some<00:02:50.950> store<00:02:51.190> than<00:02:51.340> asus<00:02:51.700> with<00:02:51.880> Queen<00:02:52.120> g4<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:53.560> if

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
some store than asus with Queen g4 so if

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.740 
some store than asus with Queen g4 so if
we<00:02:53.680> leave<00:02:53.860> this<00:02:54.010> depth<00:02:54.310> go<00:02:54.520> up<00:02:54.730> we<00:02:55.300> have<00:02:55.480> Queen

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
we leave this depth go up we have Queen

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.320 
we leave this depth go up we have Queen
g4<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:57.130> could<00:02:57.310> be<00:02:57.400> an<00:02:57.490> interesting<00:02:57.550> antidote

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
g4 this could be an interesting antidote

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.750 
g4 this could be an interesting antidote
to<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.599> whole<00:02:58.690> system<00:02:58.930> if<00:02:59.560> this<00:03:00.160> pin<00:03:00.459> is<00:03:00.490> what

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
to the whole system if this pin is what

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.850 
to the whole system if this pin is what
the<00:03:00.880> opponent<00:03:01.209> was<00:03:01.300> relying<00:03:01.569> on<00:03:01.770> in<00:03:02.770> this

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
the opponent was relying on in this

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.479 
the opponent was relying on in this
variation<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:04.330> Queen<00:03:04.599> g4<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:06.099> it's<00:03:06.220> attacking

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
variation so Queen g4 so it's attacking

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.740 
variation so Queen g4 so it's attacking
g7<00:03:08.250> if<00:03:09.250> knight<00:03:09.520> takes<00:03:09.760> Bishop<00:03:09.970> takes<00:03:10.450> Knight

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
g7 if knight takes Bishop takes Knight

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.380 
g7 if knight takes Bishop takes Knight
e5<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:13.480> forcing<00:03:13.930> Queen<00:03:14.140> virtually<00:03:14.530> take<00:03:14.739> on<00:03:14.860> g7

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
e5 so forcing Queen virtually take on g7

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.449 
e5 so forcing Queen virtually take on g7
Queen<00:03:16.390> takes<00:03:16.569> d4<00:03:17.819> now<00:03:18.819> here<00:03:19.090> there's<00:03:19.300> only<00:03:20.459> one

offering exchange saying cuz um this is

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.850 
offering exchange saying cuz um this is
crushing<00:03:46.000> now<00:03:46.150> this<00:03:46.720> kind<00:03:46.959> of<00:03:46.989> thing<00:03:47.170> with

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
crushing now this kind of thing with

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.089 
crushing now this kind of thing with
like<00:03:48.069> getting<00:03:48.310> mated<00:03:48.670> if<00:03:49.200> it's<00:03:50.200> not<00:03:50.410> Bishop<00:03:50.709> g4

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
like getting mated if it's not Bishop g4

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:58.259 
like getting mated if it's not Bishop g4
take<00:03:51.400> bishop<00:03:51.670> e6<00:03:54.150> Queen<00:03:55.150> takes<00:03:55.360> h8<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:58.150> the

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.979 
exchange I believe I'm just taking on h7
or<00:04:02.860> even<00:04:03.220> stronger<00:04:03.459> rock<00:04:03.670> 81<00:04:06.750> now<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.780> nice

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
or even stronger rock 81 now a nice

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.410 
or even stronger rock 81 now a nice
tactical<00:04:08.530> move<00:04:08.650> here<00:04:09.209> which<00:04:10.209> I<00:04:10.300> probably

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
tactical move here which I probably

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.240 
tactical move here which I probably
never<00:04:10.629> see<00:04:10.959> sunshine<00:04:11.769> at<00:04:12.069> Bishop<00:04:12.340> d7<00:04:14.250> this

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
never see sunshine at Bishop d7 this

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.479 
never see sunshine at Bishop d7 this
what's<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.610> idea<00:04:15.849> Bishop<00:04:16.449> takes<00:04:17.370> 95

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.040 

it<00:04:21.489> all<00:04:21.609> gets<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.879> bit<00:04:21.909> messy<00:04:22.360> tactically<00:04:22.840> so

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
it all gets a bit messy tactically so

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.689 
it all gets a bit messy tactically so
here<00:04:23.759> see<00:04:24.759> free<00:04:25.030> apparently<00:04:25.449> hmm<00:04:26.460> why<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.490> guess

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
here see free apparently hmm why I guess

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.129 
here see free apparently hmm why I guess
now<00:04:27.940> if<00:04:28.060> Bishop<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.389> father's<00:04:28.810> be<00:04:29.020> four<00:04:29.379> and

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
now if Bishop a father's be four and

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.110 
now if Bishop a father's be four and
this<00:04:32.139> starts<00:04:32.470> to<00:04:32.500> be<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:32.680> huge<00:04:32.919> of<00:04:33.039> life<00:04:33.220> away<00:04:33.520> so

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
this starts to be a huge of life away so

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.270 
this starts to be a huge of life away so
basically<00:04:34.419> that's<00:04:34.569> that<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.710> play<00:04:35.979> against

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
basically that's that so to play against

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.879 
basically that's that so to play against
the<00:04:36.460> surprise<00:04:36.819> system<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.389> seems<00:04:37.650> one<00:04:38.650> has<00:04:38.770> to

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
the surprise system it seems one has to

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.640 
the surprise system it seems one has to
play<00:04:39.039> extreme<00:04:39.370> dynamically<00:04:40.110> we<00:04:41.110> were<00:04:41.229> like

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
play extreme dynamically we were like

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.420 

follow<00:05:28.750> this<00:05:28.900> a<00:05:28.960> bit<00:05:29.140> further<00:05:29.410> that's<00:05:30.190> got<00:05:30.400> a

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
follow this a bit further that's got a

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.910 
follow this a bit further that's got a
lot<00:05:30.550> of<00:05:30.580> pressure<00:05:30.820> though<00:05:31.740> Bishop<00:05:32.740> can

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
retreat here still think might got a

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.260

nagging<00:05:40.090> advantage<00:05:40.600> so<00:05:40.920> in<00:05:41.920> the<00:05:42.100> game<00:05:42.340> man<00:05:42.370> it

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
nagging advantage so in the game man it

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.820
