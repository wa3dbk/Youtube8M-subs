things<00:00:21.750> with<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.380> sort<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.680> effect<00:00:23.010> got<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
things with this sort of effect got a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.150 
things with this sort of effect got a
mixer<00:00:24.150> here<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.600> here<00:00:25.529> I've<00:00:25.680> got<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> bass

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
mixer here and here I've got a bass

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.589 
mixer here and here I've got a bass
synthesizer<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:27.300> kick<00:00:28.230> drum<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:29.269> snare<00:00:30.269> drum

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
synthesizer a kick drum and snare drum

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.590 
synthesizer a kick drum and snare drum
so<00:00:31.529> here<00:00:31.890> are<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> drums<00:00:36.079> and<00:00:38.210> here<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
so here are the drums and here is the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.319 
so here are the drums and here is the
bass

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:58.060 

so<00:00:47.870> together<00:00:48.140> they<00:00:48.320> sound<00:00:48.469> like<00:00:48.559> this<00:00:57.070> now

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
so together they sound like this now

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.160 
so together they sound like this now
that<00:00:58.370> can<00:00:58.579> be<00:00:58.760> really<00:00:59.269> cool<00:00:59.420> sounding<00:00:59.899> but

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
that can be really cool sounding but

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.819 
that can be really cool sounding but
let's<00:01:00.530> make<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:00.739> even<00:01:00.920> more<00:01:01.040> danceable<00:01:01.699> so

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
let's make it even more danceable so

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.570 
let's make it even more danceable so
we're<00:01:03.829> gonna<00:01:03.949> use<00:01:04.009> this<00:01:04.339> thing<00:01:04.550> called

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
we're gonna use this thing called

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.820 
we're gonna use this thing called
side-chaining<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.200> under<00:01:06.530> your<00:01:06.650> bass

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
side-chaining so under your bass

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.980 
side-chaining so under your bass
synthesizer<00:01:07.310> whatever<00:01:08.270> that<00:01:08.479> may<00:01:08.630> be<00:01:08.659> it

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
synthesizer whatever that may be it

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.420 
synthesizer whatever that may be it
doesn't<00:01:09.140> even<00:01:09.290> have<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.619> be<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.770> bass<00:01:09.979> it<00:01:10.220> can<00:01:10.340> be

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
doesn't even have to be a bass it can be

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.609 
doesn't even have to be a bass it can be
any<00:01:10.580> sort<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:10.909> synthesizer<00:01:11.420> or<00:01:11.540> even<00:01:11.869> a<00:01:12.020> vocal

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
any sort of synthesizer or even a vocal

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.490 
any sort of synthesizer or even a vocal
sample<00:01:12.830> or<00:01:13.190> anything<00:01:13.670> really<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.170> I<00:01:15.170> want<00:01:15.380> you

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
sample or anything really and I want you

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.430 
sample or anything really and I want you
to<00:01:15.590> create<00:01:16.509> right<00:01:17.509> below<00:01:17.780> it<00:01:17.899> or<00:01:17.990> inside<00:01:18.290> it's

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
to create right below it or inside it's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.560 
to create right below it or inside it's
a<00:01:18.470> Combinator<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:20.289> m-class<00:01:21.289> compressor<00:01:22.570> and

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
a Combinator a m-class compressor and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.730 
a Combinator a m-class compressor and
what<00:01:23.840> you're<00:01:23.930> gonna<00:01:24.050> do<00:01:24.320> is<00:01:24.530> you're<00:01:24.680> gonna

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
what you're gonna do is you're gonna

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.460 
what you're gonna do is you're gonna
turn<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.190> threshold<00:01:25.729> all<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.090> way<00:01:26.210> down<00:01:26.470> turn

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
turn the threshold all the way down turn

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.160 
turn the threshold all the way down turn
the<00:01:27.530> ratio<00:01:28.009> all<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.580> way<00:01:28.700> up<00:01:28.880> turn<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.869> attack

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
the ratio all the way up turn the attack

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.560 
the ratio all the way up turn the attack
all<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.800> way<00:01:30.890> down<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.429> the<00:01:31.820> release<00:01:32.119> all<00:01:32.330> the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
all the way down and the release all the

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.480 
all the way down and the release all the
way<00:01:32.660> up<00:01:32.810> this<00:01:33.679> is<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.920> preset<00:01:34.310> for

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
way up this is the preset for

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.900 
way up this is the preset for
sidechaining<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.710> I'll<00:01:36.710> explain<00:01:37.460> about<00:01:37.700> the

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
sidechaining and I'll explain about the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.639 
sidechaining and I'll explain about the
threshold<00:01:38.360> later<00:01:38.539> you<00:01:38.720> can<00:01:38.899> use<00:01:38.929> that<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.500> make

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
threshold later you can use that to make

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.580 
threshold later you can use that to make
it<00:01:39.940> less<00:01:40.940> punchy<00:01:41.539> I<00:01:41.690> guess<00:01:41.960> or<00:01:42.140> more<00:01:42.289> punchy<00:01:42.940> so

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
it less punchy I guess or more punchy so

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.080 
it less punchy I guess or more punchy so
then<00:01:45.590> you're<00:01:45.770> also<00:01:45.950> going<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.399> create<00:01:46.580> below

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
then you're also going to create below

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.540 
then you're also going to create below
everything<00:01:47.679> down<00:01:48.679> here<00:01:48.710> outside<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.429> any

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
everything down here outside of any

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.040 
everything down here outside of any
Combinator's<00:01:50.149> or<00:01:50.270> anything<00:01:50.600> you're<00:01:50.780> going<00:01:50.960> to

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
Combinator's or anything you're going to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.380 
Combinator's or anything you're going to
create<00:01:51.259> a<00:01:51.470> spider<00:01:52.250> audio<00:01:52.789> merger<00:01:53.209> and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
create a spider audio merger and

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.430 
create a spider audio merger and
splitter<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.819> this<00:01:55.819> basically<00:01:56.289> emerges<00:01:57.289> some

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
splitter and this basically emerges some

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.419 
splitter and this basically emerges some
audio<00:01:57.770> together<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:59.380> let's<00:02:00.380> open<00:02:00.679> up<00:02:01.929> your

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
audio together so let's open up your

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.930 
audio together so let's open up your
kick<00:02:04.429> drum<00:02:04.759> or<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:07.250> Reed<00:02:07.429> rum<00:02:07.610> that<00:02:07.640> has<00:02:07.910> a

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
kick drum or the Reed rum that has a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.520 
kick drum or the Reed rum that has a
kick<00:02:08.239> drum<00:02:08.270> just<00:02:08.509> make<00:02:08.810> sure<00:02:08.929> that's<00:02:09.050> open

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
kick drum just make sure that's open

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.910 
kick drum just make sure that's open
open<00:02:10.280> up<00:02:10.369> your<00:02:10.459> mixer<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.709> open<00:02:12.709> up<00:02:12.770> the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
open up your mixer and open up the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.650 
open up your mixer and open up the
compressor<00:02:13.250> on<00:02:13.520> your<00:02:13.849> bass<00:02:14.000> that's<00:02:14.270> set<00:02:14.480> for

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
compressor on your bass that's set for

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.210 
compressor on your bass that's set for
side-chaining<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.260> have<00:02:15.380> two<00:02:15.530> compressors<00:02:15.920> on

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
side-chaining I have two compressors on

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.680 
side-chaining I have two compressors on
here<00:02:16.430> but<00:02:16.580> only<00:02:16.670> one<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:16.940> them<00:02:17.120> it's<00:02:17.300> made<00:02:17.510> for

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
here but only one of them it's made for

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.869 
here but only one of them it's made for
sidechaining

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
sidechaining

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.790 
sidechaining
so<00:02:20.170> then<00:02:21.170> you're<00:02:21.290> going<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.470> scroll<00:02:21.620> all<00:02:21.680> the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
so then you're going to scroll all the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.949 
so then you're going to scroll all the
way<00:02:21.890> down<00:02:22.099> to<00:02:22.250> your<00:02:22.340> Spyder<00:02:22.640> audio<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.300> hit

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
way down to your Spyder audio and hit

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.050 
way down to your Spyder audio and hit
the<00:02:24.080> tab<00:02:24.349> key<00:02:24.520> that's<00:02:25.520> what<00:02:25.640> I'm<00:02:25.730> doing<00:02:25.940> there

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
the tab key that's what I'm doing there

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.600 
the tab key that's what I'm doing there
to<00:02:26.180> flip<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.569> back<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.520> you're<00:02:28.520> gonna

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
to flip to the back and you're gonna

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.400 
to flip to the back and you're gonna
have<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.849> do<00:02:29.000> some<00:02:29.209> wiring<00:02:29.450> here<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.170> first

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
have to do some wiring here so the first

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.710 
have to do some wiring here so the first
one<00:02:30.709> starts<00:02:31.610> right<00:02:31.790> here<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.270> click<00:02:32.450> there

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
one starts right here just click there

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.760 
one starts right here just click there
and<00:02:32.840> drag<00:02:33.379> this<00:02:33.650> all<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:35.030> way<00:02:35.120> up<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:36.680> your

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
and drag this all the way up to your

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.610 
and drag this all the way up to your
kick<00:02:37.099> drum<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.640> put<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.569> right<00:02:38.840> where<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.379> the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
kick drum and put it right where in the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.990 
kick drum and put it right where in the
actual<00:02:39.890> slot<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.430> kick<00:02:40.580> drum<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:40.879> on

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
actual slot that the kick drum is on

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.220 
actual slot that the kick drum is on
let's<00:02:41.180> say<00:02:41.270> your<00:02:41.390> kick<00:02:41.540> drum<00:02:41.569> is<00:02:41.870> in<00:02:41.989> five

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
let's say your kick drum is in five

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.559 
let's say your kick drum is in five
you're<00:02:42.500> gonna<00:02:42.590> put<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.010> five<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.610> you<00:02:44.450> can

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
you're gonna put it in five and you can

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.240 
you're gonna put it in five and you can
sidechain<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.290> snare<00:02:45.650> too<00:02:45.860> if<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.099> want

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
sidechain it to a snare too if you want

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.589 
sidechain it to a snare too if you want
it<00:02:46.310> doesn't<00:02:46.489> necessarily<00:02:47.000> have<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.150> be<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.330> kick

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
it doesn't necessarily have to be a kick

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.190 
it doesn't necessarily have to be a kick
but<00:02:47.840> this<00:02:48.080> example<00:02:48.470> is<00:02:48.709> just<00:02:48.739> a<00:02:48.980> kick<00:02:50.200> so

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
but this example is just a kick so

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.809 
but this example is just a kick so
there's<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.830> then<00:02:52.129> your<00:02:52.280> second<00:02:52.640> one

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
there's that and then your second one

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.810 
there's that and then your second one
you're<00:02:53.120> gonna<00:02:53.209> drag<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.599> all<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.200> way<00:02:54.290> up<00:02:54.820> to

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
you're gonna drag that all the way up to

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.520 
you're gonna drag that all the way up to
your<00:02:55.910> mixer<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.570> put<00:02:56.930> it<00:02:57.020> in<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.260> next

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
your mixer and put it in the next

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.470 
your mixer and put it in the next
available<00:02:57.740> mix<00:02:58.250> report<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.730> doesn't<00:02:59.000> matter

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
available mix report it doesn't matter

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.910 
available mix report it doesn't matter
which<00:02:59.690> one<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.020> is<00:03:00.110> as<00:03:00.440> long<00:03:00.590> as<00:03:00.770> it's

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
which one it is as long as it's

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.500 
which one it is as long as it's
available<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:02.319> then<00:03:03.319> the<00:03:03.349> last<00:03:03.680> one<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.510> going

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
available and then the last one is going

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.290 
available and then the last one is going
to<00:03:05.569> go<00:03:05.780> up<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.769> cop<00:03:07.099> up<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.790> compressor

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
to go up to the cop up to the compressor

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.000 
to go up to the cop up to the compressor
of<00:03:08.480> your<00:03:08.599> bass<00:03:08.780> synthesizer<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.650> see<00:03:09.890> this

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
of your bass synthesizer and see this

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.800 
of your bass synthesizer and see this
area<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.340> says<00:03:10.550> sidechain<00:03:11.120> in<00:03:11.360> I'm<00:03:11.750> gonna

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
area that says sidechain in I'm gonna

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:12.759 
area that says sidechain in I'm gonna
put<00:03:12.080> that<00:03:12.170> right<00:03:12.379> there

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
put that right there

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.740 
put that right there
and<00:03:12.860> it<00:03:13.489> should<00:03:13.670> automatically<00:03:14.150> connect<00:03:14.569> both

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
and it should automatically connect both

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.680 
and it should automatically connect both
wires<00:03:15.050> to<00:03:15.319> each<00:03:15.349> one<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.880> then<00:03:17.030> click<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.510> tab

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
wires to each one so then click the tab

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:33.370 
wires to each one so then click the tab
again<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:20.530> let's<00:03:21.530> have<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.709> listen<00:03:30.700> as<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:33.230> can

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
again and let's have a listen as you can

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.160 
again and let's have a listen as you can
hear<00:03:33.709> it<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.819> bass<00:03:35.030> doesn't<00:03:35.390> play<00:03:35.810> whenever

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
hear it the bass doesn't play whenever

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.229 
hear it the bass doesn't play whenever
the<00:03:36.470> kick<00:03:36.650> drum<00:03:36.860> is<00:03:36.980> playing<00:03:37.010> making<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.760> much

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
the kick drum is playing making it much

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.030 
the kick drum is playing making it much
more<00:03:38.299> obvious<00:03:39.200> that<00:03:39.230> there<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.680> kick<00:03:40.010> drum

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
more obvious that there is a kick drum

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.400 
more obvious that there is a kick drum
laying<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.120> four-on-the-floor<00:03:41.569> beat<00:03:42.140> for

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
laying that four-on-the-floor beat for

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.460 
laying that four-on-the-floor beat for
you<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:42.890> that's<00:03:43.420> really<00:03:44.420> helpful<00:03:44.840> trick<00:03:45.230> for

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
you so that's really helpful trick for

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.339 
you so that's really helpful trick for
when<00:03:45.860> you're<00:03:45.980> making<00:03:46.160> dance<00:03:46.970> music<00:03:47.480> oh<00:03:47.720> one

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
when you're making dance music oh one

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.150 
when you're making dance music oh one
more<00:03:48.530> added<00:03:48.829> tip<00:03:49.069> before<00:03:49.250> you<00:03:49.430> go<00:03:49.750> if<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.890> want

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
more added tip before you go if you want

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.740 
more added tip before you go if you want
to<00:03:52.630> make<00:03:53.630> it<00:03:53.810> less<00:03:54.260> punchy<00:03:55.069> and<00:03:55.510> make<00:03:56.510> the

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
to make it less punchy and make the

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.300 
to make it less punchy and make the
side-chaining<00:03:57.349> less<00:03:57.560> apparent<00:03:57.860> you<00:03:58.160> can

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
side-chaining less apparent you can

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.940 
side-chaining less apparent you can
change<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.730> threshold<00:03:58.849> here<00:03:59.480> so<00:04:00.410> here's<00:04:00.799> what

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
change the threshold here so here's what

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:18.909 
change the threshold here so here's what
the<00:04:01.040> threshold<00:04:01.400> all<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.579> way<00:04:01.670> up<00:04:17.889> see<00:04:18.889> the

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
the threshold all the way up see the

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.460 
the threshold all the way up see the
threshold<00:04:19.459> allows<00:04:19.729> it<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:20.000> be<00:04:20.660> more<00:04:21.169> or<00:04:21.410> less

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
threshold allows it to be more or less

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.680 
threshold allows it to be more or less
apparent<00:04:22.190> whether<00:04:22.700> it's<00:04:22.940> being<00:04:23.120> side<00:04:23.360> chained

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
apparent whether it's being side chained

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.270 
apparent whether it's being side chained
or<00:04:23.840> not<00:04:23.960> so<00:04:24.229> that's<00:04:24.410> a<00:04:24.500> really<00:04:24.710> useful<00:04:24.889> thing

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
or not so that's a really useful thing

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.400 
or not so that's a really useful thing
for<00:04:25.310> you<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.669> automate<00:04:26.090> maybe<00:04:26.389> or<00:04:26.750> you<00:04:27.289> can

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
for you to automate maybe or you can

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.510 
for you to automate maybe or you can
mess<00:04:27.560> around<00:04:27.590> with<00:04:27.889> that<00:04:27.950> until<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.400> get<00:04:28.490> a

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
mess around with that until you get a

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.909 
mess around with that until you get a
sound<00:04:28.760> that<00:04:28.970> you<00:04:29.030> really<00:04:29.330> like<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:30.710> I<00:04:30.770> hope

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
sound that you really like so I hope
