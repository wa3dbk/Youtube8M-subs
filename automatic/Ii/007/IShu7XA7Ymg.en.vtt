be in your downloads so there's not

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
afraid in my downloads does not have an

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.790 
afraid in my downloads does not have an
error<00:04:53.470> I<00:04:53.970> can<00:04:54.970> triple<00:04:55.870> tap<00:04:56.050> it<00:04:56.200> to<00:04:56.320> listen<00:04:56.680> to

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:06.830 
error I can triple tap it to listen to
it<00:04:56.919> and<00:04:57.870> indeed<00:04:58.870> it<00:04:59.200> is<00:04:59.970> good

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.890 

so<00:05:07.440> I<00:05:07.470> think<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:08.100> can<00:05:08.280> only<00:05:08.460> sync<00:05:09.030> songs<00:05:09.480> to

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
so I think you can only sync songs to

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.890 
so I think you can only sync songs to
your<00:05:10.020> ipod<00:05:11.330> music<00:05:12.330> library<00:05:13.490> once<00:05:14.490> every<00:05:15.030> ten
