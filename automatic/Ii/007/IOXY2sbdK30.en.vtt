00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
going to have a hole in each side of

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.110 
going to have a hole in each side of
this<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:51.500> pipe<00:03:51.890> ray<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.959> hold<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.170> paper<00:03:54.320> be

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
this of pipe ray and hold the paper be

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.860 
this of pipe ray and hold the paper be
so<00:03:56.120> now<00:03:56.299> i'm<00:03:57.230> going<00:03:57.410> to<00:03:57.620> put<00:03:58.660> after<00:03:59.660> you<00:03:59.720> take
