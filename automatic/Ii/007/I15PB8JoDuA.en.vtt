what<00:00:06.750> I've<00:00:06.870> done<00:00:07.049> I<00:00:07.340> measured<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.460> concrete

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
what I've done I measured the concrete

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.720 
what I've done I measured the concrete
patio<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.690> measured<00:00:10.080> nine<00:00:10.469> feet<00:00:10.889> wide<00:00:11.190> so

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
patio and it measured nine feet wide so

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.730 
patio and it measured nine feet wide so
I<00:00:11.759> found<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.240> center<00:00:12.630> point<00:00:12.900> which<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.410> four

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
I found the center point which is four

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.570 
I found the center point which is four
foot<00:00:14.040> six

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
foot six

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.060 
foot six
now<00:00:15.179> our<00:00:15.540> granite<00:00:15.900> stairs<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.410> four<00:00:16.770> feet<00:00:17.039> wide

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
now our granite stairs a four feet wide

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.060 
now our granite stairs a four feet wide
so<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.580> measured<00:00:18.000> two<00:00:18.330> feet<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.869> each<00:00:19.470> side<00:00:19.500> of

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
so I measured two feet on each side of

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.980 
so I measured two feet on each side of
the<00:00:20.310> center<00:00:20.520> line<00:00:20.760> then<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.359> added<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.840> little

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the center line then I added a little

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.990 
the center line then I added a little
bit<00:00:22.109> more<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.619> three<00:00:22.890> inches<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.400> help<00:00:23.609> support

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
bit more of three inches to help support

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.179 
bit more of three inches to help support
the<00:00:24.210> granite<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> width<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the granite so this is the width of the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.920 
the granite so this is the width of the
hole<00:00:26.640> we're<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.180> digging<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.750> ready

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
hole we're going to be digging you ready

absolutely<00:00:29.720> how<00:00:30.720> much<00:00:30.900> deeper<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.410> got<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.679> go

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
absolutely how much deeper we got to go

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.010 
absolutely how much deeper we got to go
here<00:00:32.070> Roger<00:00:32.309> well<00:00:32.820> John<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> can't<00:00:33.570> answer<00:00:33.899> that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
here Roger well John I can't answer that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.780 
here Roger well John I can't answer that
question<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.800> right<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.010> because<00:00:35.550> see

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
question for you right now because see

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.690 
question for you right now because see
this<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.149> found<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.540> my<00:00:36.660> shovel<00:00:37.079> yeah<00:00:37.320> clay<00:00:38.040> now

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
this I found on my shovel yeah clay now

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.549 
this I found on my shovel yeah clay now
we<00:00:38.760> can't<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.450> underneath<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.290> stairs

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
we can't have that underneath the stairs

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.569 
we can't have that underneath the stairs
why<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.010> that

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
why is that

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.030 
why is that
because<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.210> holds<00:00:42.450> water<00:00:42.960> it'll<00:00:43.350> freeze<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
because it holds water it'll freeze and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.220 
because it holds water it'll freeze and
expand<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.730> cause<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.210> stairs<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.750> move<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
expand and cause I stairs to move in the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.319 
expand and cause I stairs to move in the
wintertime<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.550> dig<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:47.940> below

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
wintertime so we have to dig down below

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.340 
wintertime so we have to dig down below
that<00:00:48.570> clay<00:00:48.809> level<00:00:50.629> John<00:00:51.629> take<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> look<00:00:52.140> here

underneath<00:01:13.890> our<00:01:14.159> granite<00:01:14.400> steps<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.479> I'm

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
underneath our granite steps now I'm

underneath our granite steps now I'm
going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> dump<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.439> we're<00:01:17.070> going<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> put

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
in a four to five inch layer and then

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.600 
in a four to five inch layer and then
compact<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.830 

we're<00:01:24.610> going<00:01:24.759> to<00:01:24.820> be<00:01:24.909> putting<00:01:25.149> in<00:01:25.299> over<00:01:25.570> two

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
we're going to be putting in over two

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.020 
we're going to be putting in over two
feet<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.320> stone<00:01:26.590> in<00:01:26.860> here<00:01:27.070> now<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.280> key<00:01:27.670> is<00:01:27.850> to

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
feet of stone in here now the key is to

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.179 
feet of stone in here now the key is to
get<00:01:28.180> it<00:01:28.329> compacted<00:01:29.320> so<00:01:29.590> that<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.860> stairs

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
get it compacted so that the stairs

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.580 
get it compacted so that the stairs
don't<00:01:30.520> settle<00:01:30.880> now<00:01:31.479> we<00:01:31.539> could<00:01:31.840> use<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:32.079> good<00:01:32.409> old

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
don't settle now we could use a good old

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.069 
don't settle now we could use a good old
fashioned<00:01:33.130> hand<00:01:33.430> compactor<00:01:33.850> but<00:01:34.659> it's<00:01:34.810> really

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
fashioned hand compactor but it's really

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.960 
fashioned hand compactor but it's really
hard<00:01:35.439> to<00:01:35.649> get<00:01:35.860> everything<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.520> hundred<00:01:36.729> percent

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
hard to get everything a hundred percent

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.080 
hard to get everything a hundred percent
compact<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:39.009> what<00:01:39.220> we're<00:01:39.340> going<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.490> use<00:01:39.640> today

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
compact so what we're going to use today

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.749 
compact so what we're going to use today
is<00:01:40.299> called<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.960> jumping<00:01:41.560> jack<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:42.610> got<00:01:42.729> a

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
is called a jumping jack it's got a

is when you're setting this bottom step
to<00:06:03.320> shim<00:06:03.710> it<00:06:03.740> up<00:06:03.979> with<00:06:04.220> a<00:06:04.250> little<00:06:04.490> bit<00:06:04.669> of<00:06:04.789> stone

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
to shim it up with a little bit of stone

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.730 
to shim it up with a little bit of stone
dust<00:06:05.330> so<00:06:05.449> it<00:06:05.570> has<00:06:05.750> pitch<00:06:06.050> then<00:06:06.320> when<00:06:06.470> you<00:06:06.590> weigh

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
dust so it has pitch then when you weigh

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.189 
dust so it has pitch then when you weigh
this<00:06:06.949> next<00:06:07.370> step<00:06:07.520> on<00:06:07.760> it<00:06:08.180> has<00:06:08.389> the<00:06:08.539> same<00:06:08.810> exact

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
this next step on it has the same exact

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.310 
this next step on it has the same exact
pitch<00:06:09.470> and<00:06:10.070> over<00:06:10.340> here<00:06:10.580> we<00:06:11.360> overlap<00:06:12.110> the

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
pitch and over here we overlap the

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.260 
pitch and over here we overlap the
bottom<00:06:12.710> step<00:06:12.979> and<00:06:13.190> it<00:06:13.280> helps<00:06:13.550> to<00:06:13.699> hide<00:06:13.970> that

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
bottom step and it helps to hide that

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.660 
bottom step and it helps to hide that
joint
