00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello dear friends speak to them cristian 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.580
 duke of the dotcom frameworks pages 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.730
 this video I'm doing for the 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.459
 page muscle big point blogspot.com 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.459
 and the theme of the day is protein and 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.350
 how much should join me all 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.660
 days I get letters from all america 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.190
 latina asking in the christian that 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.070
 we should make this cristian that 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.550
 It must be the other 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.279
 I think before talking about hormones 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.990
 synthetic and creatine yes I know what 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.960
 important is the protein the protein is 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.940
 the basis of bodybuilding the protein is the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.340
 The base of the body is the base of the muscle 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.860
 the basis of everything 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.810
 carbohydrates are important 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.960
 fat is important but the most 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.690
 important in terms of quantity is the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.130
 protein and protein quality in 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.140
 whey protein egg protein and 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.430
 also even soy protein does not 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.790
 believe that soy is a protein 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.350
 the bottom is not 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.269
 good 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.280
 many people enter protein 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.810
 after training the idea is 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.170
 because that protein helps with the 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.790
 I recover that is true but 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.810
 there are also many people who go to 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.119
 fasting gym or take a soup or 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.049
 you eat a sandwich or a very 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.149
 slight 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.950
 that's also bad for me 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.200
 I recommend if you want to increase mass 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.539
 muscle and strength because I am a 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.009
 bodybuilder I'm very fat and I have to 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.750
 lose weight no I do not have any 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.510
 pretext in telling them 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.860
 but I like the strength 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.480
 administration and jackson ronnie colmarÃ¡n 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.910
 I like bodybuilders with strength 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.290
 because one can be a bodybuilder and not 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.420
 has to have strength for example can 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.200
 make vi be with 20 pounds or about 10 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.110
 kilos can do chest with 60 kilos 70 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.380
 kilos and does not need to have strength but to 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.390
 I like the appearance of muscle and 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.940
 I like the appearance of a person 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.950
 Strong like the person who can 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.690
 break a phone guide in half with 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.580
 hands that kind of thing I like in 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.230
 addition to being a person with 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.160
 muscle is not me what I recommend 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.440
 it is this 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.840
 protein before whey protein eggs 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.330
 Hates 30 to 45 minutes before 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.480
 Amino acids training during the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.360
 training with water 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.940
 and a whey or egg protein shake 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.310
 no soy after training inside 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.239
 of 10-15 maybe 20 minutes of 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.280
 drive and the time after that 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.620
 protein shake is then where I 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.569
 I recommend a healthy meal a 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.750
 food that has carbohydrates but 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.940
 complex carbohydrates like potatoes 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.580
 sweets or 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.150
 and that is any such thing with 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.010
 meat 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.819
 I am a vegetarian you can use soy 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.849
 but with meat 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.370
 maybe egg white eggs even 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.379
 up a yolk a yolk that food 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.959
 should have fat carbohydrates and 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.650
 proteins or have been protein shake 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.700
 before training 30 and 45 minutes 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.400
 amino acids during training 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.200
 protein shake 10 to 15 minutes 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.549
 after training or followed by 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.799
 half an hour an hour later for a 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.549
 healthy food with high levels of 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.870
 high fat levels of carbohydrates and 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.280
 moderate levels of protein because 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.209
 appears then it takes you to have the 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:27.239
