00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.490 
there but it appears the text in the
screen<00:01:35.119> like<00:01:35.360> they<00:01:36.050> have<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.200> name<00:01:36.380> of

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
what I'm doing in a mountain because it

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.200 
what I'm doing in a mountain because it
worked<00:01:49.430> fucking<00:01:49.850> awesome<00:01:50.180> I'm<00:01:50.510> actually<00:01:50.690> I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
worked fucking awesome I'm actually I

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.460 
worked fucking awesome I'm actually I
think<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.270> said<00:01:53.509> that<00:01:53.660> but<00:01:53.869> I'm<00:01:53.990> playing<00:01:54.289> with

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
think I said that but I'm playing with

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.550 
think I said that but I'm playing with
reading<00:01:55.039> mode<00:01:55.190> as<00:01:55.369> well<00:01:55.550> because<00:01:56.539> I<00:01:56.929> think

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
reading mode as well because I think

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.169 
reading mode as well because I think
it's<00:01:57.679> more<00:01:58.070> fun<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.460> play<00:01:58.490> with<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.850> creative

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
it's more fun to play with the creative

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.499 
it's more fun to play with the creative
up<00:01:59.300> and<00:02:00.490> if<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.640> wonder<00:02:01.910> how<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.090> get<00:02:02.360> to

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.559 
design for you here so I'm gonna cut the
video<00:02:15.800> until<00:02:16.310> I<00:02:16.430> put<00:02:16.730> all<00:02:16.910> this<00:02:17.090> blue<00:02:17.360> mark

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
video until I put all this blue mark

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:45.220 
video until I put all this blue mark
blueprints<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.410> mean

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.530
