00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.659
 we have arrived and we have begun to walk 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.310
 down the river until we have peered 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.520
 there is a gap and we have visited a luce 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.189

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.680

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.780
 repeated and then our fish that

 normally they repeat already the second well 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.049

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.060
 feet began to stir there to jump to the 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.060
 water and such and it's broken 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.070

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.070

 At the mouth water fish is super strong 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.409
 solution of rivers that is incredible 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.940
 It is also that they have a hunger that is 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.560
 amazing 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.560

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.660

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.280

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.939

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.430

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:49.530

 once many attacks have failed 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.370
 the first attack of each personally 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.370
 they failed 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.350
 to control the situation a bit more 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.430
 it's good it's been a good day to be 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.470
 lights are not too big 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.750
 but they are fish of good size and very 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.620
 fun we carry light equipment that 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.620

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.750
