something similar to this that somebody
made<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.390> Kickstarter<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.260> they're<00:00:19.410> trying

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
made on Kickstarter and they're trying

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.800 
made on Kickstarter and they're trying
to<00:00:19.740> start<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.220> thing<00:00:20.580> there's<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.510> bit<00:00:21.689> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
to start this thing there's a bit of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.019 
to start this thing there's a bit of
drama<00:00:22.080> around<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.680> which<00:00:22.859> I'm<00:00:23.039> not<00:00:23.550> gonna<00:00:23.789> go

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
drama around that which I'm not gonna go

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.269 
drama around that which I'm not gonna go
into<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.720> one<00:00:24.930> I'll<00:00:25.500> keep<00:00:25.680> my<00:00:25.830> opinions

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
into on this one I'll keep my opinions

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.720 
into on this one I'll keep my opinions
on<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> myself<00:00:26.970> anyways<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.550> is

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
on that one to myself anyways so this is

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.479 
on that one to myself anyways so this is
a<00:00:29.939> really<00:00:30.330> cool<00:00:30.510> puzzle<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.990> think<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:32.189> me<00:00:32.309> it

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
a really cool puzzle I think to me it

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.250 
a really cool puzzle I think to me it
looks<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> three<00:00:33.239> by<00:00:33.420> five<00:00:33.690> by<00:00:33.930> five

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
looks like a three by five by five

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.470 
looks like a three by five by five
without<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.980> corners<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.969> side<00:00:36.239> edge

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
without the corners and the side edge

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.389 
without the corners and the side edge
pieces<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.590> think<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.920> might<00:00:38.040> solve<00:00:38.280> it

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
pieces so I think I might solve it

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.590 
pieces so I think I might solve it
exactly<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.820> same<00:00:38.850> now<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> haven't<00:00:39.329> opened

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
exactly the same now I haven't opened

five by five or sorry three by three by
five<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> showed<00:00:54.120> moved<00:00:54.899> really<00:00:55.170> really

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
five that I showed moved really really

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.290 
five that I showed moved really really
well<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.949> I'm<00:00:56.070> hoping<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.520> one<00:00:56.730> does<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.059> well

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
well so I'm hoping this one does as well

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450 
well so I'm hoping this one does as well
this<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.289> actually<00:00:58.559> got<00:00:58.710> some<00:00:58.949> weight<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.430> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
this is actually got some weight to it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.630 
this is actually got some weight to it
this<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.879> quite<00:01:00.510> heavy<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:02.010> we'll<00:01:02.250> zoom

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
this is quite heavy and so we'll zoom

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.479 
this is quite heavy and so we'll zoom
ins<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.149> show<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.629> sticker<00:01:04.250> again<00:01:05.250> on

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
ins and show you the sticker again on

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.230 
ins and show you the sticker again on
this<00:01:05.670> side<00:01:06.080> we've<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.409> got<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.970> one

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
this side we've just got the one

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.359 
this side we've just got the one
person's<00:01:09.810> sticker<00:01:10.380> remember<00:01:10.830> last<00:01:11.010> time<00:01:11.130> we

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
person's sticker remember last time we

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.340 
person's sticker remember last time we
had<00:01:11.520> another<00:01:11.760> sticker<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.200> we

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
had another sticker but on this one we

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.109 
had another sticker but on this one we
only<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.670> maybe<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> other

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
only have the one so maybe the other

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.240 
only have the one so maybe the other
person<00:01:15.180> wasn't<00:01:15.630> affiliated<00:01:15.900> with<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.530> so

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
person wasn't affiliated with this so

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.719 
person wasn't affiliated with this so
basically<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.689> were<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.170> take<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.430> off<00:01:20.700> and

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
basically if I were to take this off and

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.390 
basically if I were to take this off and
take<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.450> off<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.900> would<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.650> three<00:01:23.100> by

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
take this off I would have a three by

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.030 
take this off I would have a three by
three<00:01:23.430> by<00:01:24.060> five<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.780> that's<00:01:25.290> basically<00:01:25.799> what

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
three by five and that's basically what

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
three by five and that's basically what
they<00:01:26.189> did<00:01:26.250> they<00:01:26.909> used<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.810> top<00:01:28.049> parts<00:01:28.470> that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
they did they used the top parts that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.080 
they did they used the top parts that
they<00:01:28.829> would<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.130> for<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.850> they<00:01:30.060> put

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
they would have for this and they put

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.660 
they would have for this and they put
them<00:01:30.420> over<00:01:30.600> here<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.189> actually<00:01:32.340> have

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
them over here so you can actually have

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.399 
them over here so you can actually have
combinations<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> stuff<00:01:33.750> wow<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.140> that's

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
combinations of stuff wow that that's

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.679 
combinations of stuff wow that that's
really<00:01:34.710> really<00:01:34.890> smooth<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.549> now<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> know

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
really really smooth here now I know

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.749 
really really smooth here now I know
that<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> mechanism<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.890> exactly<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> same<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
that the mechanism is exactly the same I

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.050 
that the mechanism is exactly the same I
bet<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.210> turn<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:40.520> maybe<00:01:41.520> pop<00:01:41.820> one

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
bet you if I turn it I can maybe pop one

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.120 
bet you if I turn it I can maybe pop one
out<00:01:42.150> yes<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.259> think<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.530> one's<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.770> lot<00:01:43.860> tighter

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
out yes I think this one's a lot tighter

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.300 
out yes I think this one's a lot tighter
than<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> three<00:01:44.549> by<00:01:44.670> five<00:01:44.820> by<00:01:45.000> five<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.390> I

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
than the three by five by five but I

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.980 
than the three by five by five but I
don't<00:01:47.310> want<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.490> break<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.820> anyways<00:01:48.329> from<00:01:48.840> what

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
don't want to break it anyways from what

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.929 
don't want to break it anyways from what
calvinist<00:01:49.439> told<00:01:49.680> me<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.100> mechanisms<00:01:50.790> are

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
calvinist told me the mechanisms are

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.760 
calvinist told me the mechanisms are
exactly<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> same<00:01:51.780> they<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.049> added<00:01:52.560> them<00:01:52.649> on

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
exactly the same they just added them on

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.830 
exactly the same they just added them on
these<00:01:52.979> sides<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.030> really<00:01:54.270> wanted<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
these sides so if you really wanted you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.240 
these sides so if you really wanted you
could<00:01:54.930> probably<00:01:55.049> make<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> cross<00:01:55.649> cube<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.159> add

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
could probably make a cross cube and add

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.100 
could probably make a cross cube and add
them<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.640> side<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.420> side<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.840> well

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
them on this side and this side as well

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.530 
them on this side and this side as well
and<00:01:58.560> then<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.920> would<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.520> five<00:02:00.360> by<00:02:00.509> five

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
and then you would have a five by five

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.160 
and then you would have a five by five
centers<00:02:01.049> only<00:02:01.969> Wow<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.210> thing<00:02:03.420> moves<00:02:03.780> really

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
centers only Wow this thing moves really

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.920 
centers only Wow this thing moves really
really<00:02:04.380> nice<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:06.210> think<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.719> gonna<00:02:06.840> be

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
really nice and I think this is gonna be

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.930 
really nice and I think this is gonna be
a<00:02:07.020> bit<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.320> challenge<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.770> solve<00:02:09.770> because

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
a bit of a challenge to solve because

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.010 
a bit of a challenge to solve because
you<00:02:11.940> know<00:02:12.030> what<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.209> gotta<00:02:12.420> say<00:02:12.480> really<00:02:12.840> quick

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
you know what I gotta say really quick

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.640 
you know what I gotta say really quick
that<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.290> thing

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that this thing

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.140 
that this thing
so<00:02:13.829> much<00:02:13.980> better<00:02:14.159> than<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.519> three<00:02:14.700> by<00:02:14.819> three

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
so much better than the three by three

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.819 
so much better than the three by three
by<00:02:15.180> five<00:02:15.510> um<00:02:15.840> that's<00:02:15.989> the<00:02:16.079> same<00:02:16.260> mechanism<00:02:16.709> so

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
by five um that's the same mechanism so

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.619 
by five um that's the same mechanism so
I<00:02:16.890> think<00:02:17.159> it's<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.819> amount<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.180> Lube<00:02:18.420> that's

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
I think it's the amount of Lube that's

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.819 
I think it's the amount of Lube that's
in<00:02:18.780> here<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.019> feels<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.409> it's<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.590> little<00:02:19.650> bit

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
in here it feels like it's a little bit

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:26.720 
in here it feels like it's a little bit
more<00:02:19.920> gummy<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.489> also<00:02:22.340> also<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.760> feels<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:25.730> lot

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
more gummy and also also it feels a lot

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.729 
more gummy and also also it feels a lot
tighter<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.569> just<00:02:28.049> feels<00:02:28.319> more<00:02:28.890> well<00:02:29.340> built

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
tighter so it just feels more well built

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.670 
tighter so it just feels more well built
all<00:02:31.739> right<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.790> moves<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.359> moves

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
all right so this moves and that moves

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.319 
all right so this moves and that moves
the<00:02:34.680> cool<00:02:34.890> thing<00:02:35.099> about<00:02:35.129> this<00:02:35.430> puzzle<00:02:35.819> is<00:02:36.000> not

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
the cool thing about this puzzle is not

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.179 
the cool thing about this puzzle is not
only<00:02:36.540> can<00:02:36.689> you<00:02:36.780> exchange<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.680> top<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.129> the

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
only can you exchange the top and the

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.860 
only can you exchange the top and the
bottom<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.239> wanted<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.659> could

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
bottom but if I wanted to I could

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
bottom but if I wanted to I could
exchange<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.439> sides<00:02:41.359> so<00:02:42.359> there's<00:02:43.290> really<00:02:43.769> a

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
exchange the sides so there's really a

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.589 
exchange the sides so there's really a
lot<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.189> options<00:02:44.340> here<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:44.939> the<00:02:45.000> reason<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:45.359> say

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
lot of options here and the reason I say

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.970 
lot of options here and the reason I say
I<00:02:45.629> would<00:02:45.900> sell<00:02:46.109> this<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.409> three<00:02:46.769> by<00:02:46.950> five

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
I would sell this like a three by five

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.149 
I would sell this like a three by five
by<00:02:47.459> five<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.260> because<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.530> shape<00:02:49.739> now

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
by five is because of the shape now

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.420 
by five is because of the shape now
there<00:02:50.639> is<00:02:50.879> corners<00:02:51.450> here<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.200> here<00:02:53.129> you<00:02:53.310> know

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
there is corners here and here you know

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.699 
there is corners here and here you know
like<00:02:53.700> corner<00:02:54.180> pieces<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:54.690> edges<00:02:55.139> then<00:02:55.590> it

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
like corner pieces and edges then it

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.319 
like corner pieces and edges then it
would<00:02:55.829> be<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> three<00:02:56.340> by<00:02:56.370> five<00:02:56.670> by<00:02:56.879> five<00:02:57.150> so

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
would be a three by five by five so

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.149 
would be a three by five by five so
that's<00:02:57.930> what<00:02:58.079> tells<00:02:58.260> me<00:02:58.409> I<00:02:58.439> might<00:02:58.680> be<00:02:58.739> able<00:02:59.010> to

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
that's what tells me I might be able to

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.770 
that's what tells me I might be able to
solve<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.579> like<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.090> because<00:03:00.629> you<00:03:00.750> have

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
solve it like that and because you have

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.789 
solve it like that and because you have
one<00:03:01.109> two<00:03:01.620> three<00:03:02.250> four<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.269> five<00:03:03.599> layers<00:03:04.409> that

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
one two three four and five layers that

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.920 
one two three four and five layers that
are<00:03:04.920> available<00:03:05.129> to<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.819> on<00:03:06.060> all<00:03:06.629> sides

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
are available to you on on all sides

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.349 
are available to you on on all sides
plus<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.560> three<00:03:07.859> it<00:03:08.549> just<00:03:08.939> tells<00:03:09.150> me<00:03:09.269> that

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
plus the three it just tells me that

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.240 
plus the three it just tells me that
it's<00:03:09.720> probably<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.290> similar<00:03:10.590> solve<00:03:11.040> and

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
it's probably a similar solve and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.250 
it's probably a similar solve and
there's<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:11.909> pretty<00:03:12.480> cool<00:03:12.689> thing<00:03:12.989> with<00:03:13.170> the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
there's a pretty cool thing with the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.470 
there's a pretty cool thing with the
three<00:03:13.409> by<00:03:13.530> five<00:03:13.709> by<00:03:13.829> five<00:03:14.040> where<00:03:14.849> I<00:03:14.879> can

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
three by five by five where I can

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.439 
three by five by five where I can
actually<00:03:16.430> exchange<00:03:19.129> this<00:03:20.129> piece<00:03:20.549> for<00:03:21.299> this

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
actually exchange this piece for this

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.289 
actually exchange this piece for this
big<00:03:21.690> piece<00:03:21.930> because<00:03:22.199> this<00:03:23.190> is<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.790> guess<00:03:24.269> a

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
big piece because this is I guess a

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.420 
big piece because this is I guess a
floppy<00:03:24.900> cuboid<00:03:25.709> now<00:03:25.949> so<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.280> mean

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
floppy cuboid now so you mean

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.099 
floppy cuboid now so you mean
interesting<00:03:26.699> solve<00:03:27.239> I'm<00:03:27.449> really<00:03:27.660> excited<00:03:27.930> for

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
interesting solve I'm really excited for

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.960 
interesting solve I'm really excited for
this<00:03:28.260> one<00:03:28.440> because<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.889> can<00:03:29.040> exchange<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.730> and

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
this one because I can exchange this and

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.659 
this one because I can exchange this and
change<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.840> height<00:03:31.079> of<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.799> puzzle<00:03:32.159> so<00:03:32.579> now

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
change the height of the puzzle so now

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.030 
change the height of the puzzle so now
the<00:03:32.730> puzzle<00:03:32.970> is<00:03:33.209> changed<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.959> five<00:03:34.560> instead<00:03:34.949> of

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
the puzzle is changed to five instead of

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.119 
the puzzle is changed to five instead of
three<00:03:35.370> for<00:03:35.579> height<00:03:35.849> and<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.750> think<00:03:37.680> it's<00:03:37.919> gonna

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
three for height and I think it's gonna

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.119 
three for height and I think it's gonna
be<00:03:38.280> pretty<00:03:38.549> cool<00:03:38.849> to<00:03:39.030> solve<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:40.319> again<00:03:40.799> yes<00:03:40.949> it

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
be pretty cool to solve and again yes it

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.619 
be pretty cool to solve and again yes it
is<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.280> shapeshifter<00:03:41.639> obviously<00:03:42.329> you've<00:03:42.449> just

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
is a shapeshifter obviously you've just

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.349 
is a shapeshifter obviously you've just
seen<00:03:43.139> that<00:03:43.379> and<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:44.370> combinations<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.180> this

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
seen that and the combinations of this

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.349 
seen that and the combinations of this
puzzle<00:03:45.659> must<00:03:45.870> be<00:03:46.079> huge<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.949> mean<00:03:47.129> it's<00:03:47.370> really

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
puzzle must be huge I mean it's really

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.390 
puzzle must be huge I mean it's really
really<00:03:48.479> cool<00:03:48.900> anyways<00:03:49.620> let's<00:03:49.799> do<00:03:49.979> a<00:03:50.010> checker

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
really cool anyways let's do a checker

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.940 
really cool anyways let's do a checker
pattern

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.980 

and<00:03:57.100> here<00:03:57.880> we<00:03:58.000> go<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:58.360> this<00:03:58.480> is<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.690> checker

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
and here we go so this is a checker

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.809 
and here we go so this is a checker
pattern<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.560> really<00:03:59.860> like<00:04:00.040> how<00:04:00.190> you<00:04:00.250> can<00:04:00.580> see

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
pattern I really like how you can see

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.660 
pattern I really like how you can see
all<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:02.319> green<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:02.950> blue<00:04:03.190> on<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.459> side

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
all the the green and blue on the side

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.070 
all the the green and blue on the side
and<00:04:03.850> then<00:04:03.970> right<00:04:04.209> here<00:04:04.240> you<00:04:04.420> can<00:04:04.630> start<00:04:04.840> seeing

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
and then right here you can start seeing

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.080 
and then right here you can start seeing
you<00:04:05.650> know<00:04:05.680> between<00:04:06.160> this<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.670> this<00:04:06.819> so<00:04:06.880> you

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
you know between this and this so you

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.490 
you know between this and this so you
can<00:04:07.209> start<00:04:07.360> seeing<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.780> next<00:04:07.959> side<00:04:08.230> already

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
can start seeing the next side already

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.550 
can start seeing the next side already
so<00:04:09.100> that's<00:04:09.190> pretty<00:04:09.520> cool<00:04:09.790> as<00:04:09.970> well<00:04:10.560> I'm

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
so that's pretty cool as well I'm

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.949 
so that's pretty cool as well I'm
excited<00:04:11.890> for<00:04:12.069> this<00:04:12.280> puzzle<00:04:12.520> I'm<00:04:13.420> excited<00:04:13.870> to

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
excited for this puzzle I'm excited to

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.159 
excited for this puzzle I'm excited to
solve<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.380> so<00:04:14.410> I<00:04:14.620> think<00:04:14.770> what<00:04:15.070> I'm<00:04:15.160> gonna<00:04:15.250> do

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
solve it so I think what I'm gonna do

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.319 
solve it so I think what I'm gonna do
this<00:04:17.200> scramble<00:04:18.100> it<00:04:18.220> up<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.549> we<00:04:18.730> will<00:04:18.880> solve<00:04:19.150> it

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
this scramble it up and we will solve it

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.340 
this scramble it up and we will solve it
so<00:04:19.959> we<00:04:20.079> scramble<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:20.650> up<00:04:21.840> I'm<00:04:22.840> gonna<00:04:23.020> scramble

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
so we scramble it up I'm gonna scramble

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.870 
so we scramble it up I'm gonna scramble
it<00:04:23.530> up<00:04:23.620> as<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.770> cuboid<00:04:24.130> first<00:04:24.400> I'm<00:04:24.520> not<00:04:24.550> sure<00:04:24.760> if

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
it up as a cuboid first I'm not sure if

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.760 
it up as a cuboid first I'm not sure if
you<00:04:25.000> have<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.450> but<00:04:25.630> this<00:04:25.780> is<00:04:25.840> just<00:04:26.080> habit<00:04:26.410> for

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
you have to but this is just habit for

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:44.010 
you have to but this is just habit for
me<00:04:33.150> all<00:04:34.150> right<00:04:42.240> okay<00:04:43.240> so<00:04:43.300> now<00:04:43.600> let's<00:04:43.810> go<00:04:43.990> into

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
me all right okay so now let's go into

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:54.360 
me all right okay so now let's go into
the<00:04:44.290> shape-shifting<00:04:49.050> hopeful<00:04:50.050> Wow<00:04:53.070> so<00:04:54.070> this

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
the shape-shifting hopeful Wow so this

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.420 
the shape-shifting hopeful Wow so this
is<00:04:54.610> now<00:04:54.820> turned<00:04:55.210> itself<00:04:55.540> into<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.960> bandaged<00:04:56.560> 3x3

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
is now turned itself into a bandaged 3x3

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.920 
is now turned itself into a bandaged 3x3
because<00:04:57.700> all<00:04:57.940> of<00:04:57.970> these<00:04:58.300> pieces<00:04:58.570> here<00:04:58.840> are

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
because all of these pieces here are

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.170 
because all of these pieces here are
bandaged<00:04:59.380> with<00:04:59.590> this<00:04:59.770> one<00:04:59.980> then<00:05:00.310> one<00:05:00.460> two<00:05:00.910> and

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
bandaged with this one then one two and

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.210 
bandaged with this one then one two and
then<00:05:01.390> this<00:05:01.750> is<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.290> third<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:02.890> it's<00:05:03.100> like

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
then this is the third and it's like

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.730 
then this is the third and it's like
that<00:05:03.370> on<00:05:03.520> all<00:05:03.700> sides<00:05:03.940> so<00:05:04.260> I'm<00:05:05.260> pretty<00:05:05.500> sure

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
that on all sides so I'm pretty sure

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.740 
that on all sides so I'm pretty sure
it's<00:05:05.919> gonna<00:05:06.040> be<00:05:06.190> quite<00:05:06.430> similar<00:05:06.729> to<00:05:06.910> a<00:05:07.150> three

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
it's gonna be quite similar to a three

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.450 
it's gonna be quite similar to a three
by<00:05:07.960> five<00:05:08.260> by<00:05:08.440> five<00:05:08.680> solved<00:05:09.040> which<00:05:09.190> would<00:05:09.340> be

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
by five by five solved which would be

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.840 
by five by five solved which would be
really<00:05:09.669> cool<00:05:09.930> because<00:05:11.220> that's<00:05:12.220> a<00:05:12.370> really<00:05:12.610> fun

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
really cool because that's a really fun

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.360 
really cool because that's a really fun
solve<00:05:13.200> anyways<00:05:14.200> guys<00:05:14.410> so<00:05:14.680> I<00:05:14.710> think<00:05:14.979> I've<00:05:15.190> got

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
solve anyways guys so I think I've got

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.760 
solve anyways guys so I think I've got
it<00:05:15.460> sufficiently<00:05:16.000> scrambled<00:05:16.630> now<00:05:16.750> I<00:05:17.020> will

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
it sufficiently scrambled now I will

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.100 
it sufficiently scrambled now I will
take<00:05:17.890> my<00:05:18.070> time<00:05:18.100> and<00:05:18.580> solve<00:05:19.240> it<00:05:19.330> oh<00:05:19.510> that's<00:05:20.020> a

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
take my time and solve it oh that's a

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.920 
take my time and solve it oh that's a
little<00:05:20.200> bit<00:05:20.410> easy<00:05:20.620> there<00:05:20.919> I<00:05:21.750> guess<00:05:22.750> that's

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
little bit easy there I guess that's

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.200 
little bit easy there I guess that's
bandaged<00:05:23.290> it<00:05:23.320> can't<00:05:23.590> do<00:05:23.680> that<00:05:23.830> there<00:05:24.400> we<00:05:24.460> go<00:05:24.520> so

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
bandaged it can't do that there we go so

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.940 
bandaged it can't do that there we go so
I'll<00:05:25.300> take<00:05:25.419> my<00:05:25.479> time<00:05:25.780> I'll<00:05:26.110> solve<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:26.680> and<00:05:26.860> then

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
I'll take my time I'll solve it and then

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.180 
I'll take my time I'll solve it and then
I<00:05:27.100> will<00:05:27.479> get<00:05:28.479> back<00:05:28.540> to<00:05:28.780> you<00:05:28.870> all<00:05:29.500> right<00:05:29.710> so<00:05:30.040> I've

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
I will get back to you all right so I've

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.950 
I will get back to you all right so I've
solved<00:05:30.520> it<00:05:30.550> a<00:05:30.669> few<00:05:30.910> times<00:05:31.150> now<00:05:31.540> and<00:05:31.570> I<00:05:31.810> gotta

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
solved it a few times now and I gotta

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.200 
solved it a few times now and I gotta
say<00:05:32.140> it's<00:05:32.290> pretty<00:05:32.380> fun<00:05:33.100> it's<00:05:33.400> similar<00:05:33.850> to<00:05:34.030> a

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
say it's pretty fun it's similar to a

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.000 
say it's pretty fun it's similar to a
three<00:05:34.479> by<00:05:34.600> five<00:05:34.630> by<00:05:34.930> five<00:05:35.140> but<00:05:35.290> not<00:05:35.470> exactly

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
three by five by five but not exactly

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.909 
three by five by five but not exactly
these<00:05:36.610> pieces<00:05:36.910> that<00:05:37.090> are<00:05:37.419> here<00:05:37.810> that<00:05:38.530> are<00:05:38.560> now

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
these pieces that are here that are now

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.010 
these pieces that are here that are now
not<00:05:39.190> here<00:05:39.669> make<00:05:40.150> it<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.300> little<00:05:40.419> bit<00:05:40.600> different

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
not here make it a little bit different

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.440 
not here make it a little bit different
and<00:05:41.169> and<00:05:41.860> in<00:05:42.160> the<00:05:42.310> way<00:05:42.430> it<00:05:42.550> moves<00:05:42.760> and<00:05:43.000> stuff<00:05:43.060> so

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
and and in the way it moves and stuff so

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.810 
and and in the way it moves and stuff so
it's<00:05:43.870> not<00:05:44.080> exactly<00:05:44.500> the<00:05:44.620> same<00:05:44.919> but<00:05:45.370> it<00:05:45.460> is<00:05:45.490> very

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
it's not exactly the same but it is very

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.490 
it's not exactly the same but it is very
very<00:05:46.000> similar<00:05:46.600> and<00:05:46.720> I<00:05:46.750> had<00:05:46.900> a<00:05:46.930> lot<00:05:47.200> of<00:05:47.229> fun

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
very similar and I had a lot of fun

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.260 
very similar and I had a lot of fun
solving<00:05:47.800> this<00:05:48.100> thing<00:05:48.280> the<00:05:48.729> movement<00:05:49.150> is

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
solving this thing the movement is

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.580 
solving this thing the movement is
getting<00:05:49.539> better<00:05:49.690> and<00:05:49.840> better<00:05:49.990> even<00:05:50.440> though<00:05:50.530> it

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
getting better and better even though it

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.170 
getting better and better even though it
was<00:05:50.680> already<00:05:51.070> really<00:05:51.430> good<00:05:51.460> at<00:05:51.729> first<00:05:51.940> the

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
was already really good at first the

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.850 
was already really good at first the
corner<00:05:52.510> cuts<00:05:52.750> really<00:05:53.169> really<00:05:53.410> well

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
corner cuts really really well

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.940 
corner cuts really really well
the<00:05:54.310> design<00:05:54.700> of<00:05:54.729> this<00:05:55.030> is<00:05:55.620> fantastic<00:05:56.620> I<00:05:56.740> mean<00:05:56.770> I

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
the design of this is fantastic I mean I

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.890 
the design of this is fantastic I mean I
really<00:05:57.280> really<00:05:57.550> like<00:05:57.729> this<00:05:57.970> puzzle<00:05:58.330> it's

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
really really like this puzzle it's

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.060 
really really like this puzzle it's
gonna<00:05:59.050> be<00:05:59.200> one<00:05:59.320> of<00:05:59.380> my<00:05:59.470> favorite<00:05:59.770> ones<00:05:59.919> and

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
can actually see that I did get some

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.040 
can actually see that I did get some
sticker<00:06:20.710> peeling<00:06:21.100> going<00:06:21.310> on

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
sticker peeling going on

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.870 
sticker peeling going on
so<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.680> stickers<00:06:24.040> actually<00:06:24.400> to<00:06:24.550> be<00:06:24.639> honest

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
so the stickers actually to be honest

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.670 
so the stickers actually to be honest
aren't<00:06:25.210> super<00:06:25.690> great<00:06:25.900> we've<00:06:26.080> got<00:06:26.260> some<00:06:26.500> there

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
aren't super great we've got some there

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.230 
aren't super great we've got some there
and<00:06:26.710> we've<00:06:26.979> got<00:06:27.010> some<00:06:27.430> here<00:06:27.610> going<00:06:27.790> on<00:06:28.030> and

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
and we've got some here going on and

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.730 
and we've got some here going on and
that<00:06:28.330> happened<00:06:28.660> during<00:06:28.720> the<00:06:28.900> solves<00:06:29.320> and<00:06:29.650> I

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
that happened during the solves and I

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.170 
that happened during the solves and I
don't<00:06:29.919> I've<00:06:30.160> clipped<00:06:30.430> my<00:06:30.550> nails<00:06:30.580> so<00:06:30.880> it's<00:06:31.000> not

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
don't I've clipped my nails so it's not

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.420 
don't I've clipped my nails so it's not
that<00:06:31.389> either<00:06:31.630> I'm<00:06:32.560> not<00:06:32.620> sure<00:06:32.919> why<00:06:33.250> that

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
that either I'm not sure why that

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.340 
that either I'm not sure why that
happened<00:06:33.820> but<00:06:33.880> anyway<00:06:34.690> so<00:06:34.750> the<00:06:35.050> stickers

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
happened but anyway so the stickers

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.510 
happened but anyway so the stickers
aren't<00:06:35.500> bad<00:06:35.680> but<00:06:35.979> I<00:06:36.010> think<00:06:36.250> that<00:06:36.370> they<00:06:36.460> could

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
aren't bad but I think that they could

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.730 
aren't bad but I think that they could
be<00:06:36.669> a<00:06:36.760> little<00:06:36.910> bit<00:06:37.120> better<00:06:37.270> the<00:06:37.780> cube<00:06:38.139> in<00:06:38.470> the

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
be a little bit better the cube in the

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.129 
be a little bit better the cube in the
puzzle<00:06:39.310> and<00:06:39.430> the<00:06:39.550> solve<00:06:39.850> of<00:06:40.060> it<00:06:40.180> is<00:06:40.330> fantastic

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
puzzle and the solve of it is fantastic

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.710 
puzzle and the solve of it is fantastic
so<00:06:41.650> anyways<00:06:42.430> guys<00:06:42.460> if<00:06:43.210> you<00:06:43.330> want<00:06:43.479> to<00:06:43.539> take<00:06:43.690> a

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 
so anyways guys if you want to take a

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.450 
so anyways guys if you want to take a
look<00:06:43.900> at<00:06:43.990> this<00:06:44.139> there's<00:06:44.740> also<00:06:44.860> another<00:06:45.250> one

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
look at this there's also another one

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.219 
look at this there's also another one
just<00:06:46.090> to<00:06:46.180> let<00:06:46.330> you<00:06:46.419> know<00:06:46.600> I<00:06:46.630> didn't<00:06:47.020> get<00:06:47.080> this

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:47.229 
just to let you know I didn't get this

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:50.610 
just to let you know I didn't get this
one<00:06:47.410> and<00:06:47.620> it's<00:06:48.100> basically<00:06:48.750> it's<00:06:49.750> an<00:06:49.930> L<00:06:50.110> it's<00:06:50.410> an

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
one and it's basically it's an L it's an

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.770 
one and it's basically it's an L it's an
L<00:06:50.740> keyboard<00:06:51.160> so<00:06:51.310> it<00:06:51.400> looks<00:06:51.580> like<00:06:51.669> this<00:06:52.060> so<00:06:52.720> you

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
L keyboard so it looks like this so you

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.320 
L keyboard so it looks like this so you
can<00:06:53.020> scramble<00:06:53.680> this<00:06:53.889> with<00:06:54.190> you<00:06:54.970> know<00:06:55.090> this

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
can scramble this with you know this

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.540 
can scramble this with you know this
layer<00:06:55.539> with<00:06:55.720> that<00:06:55.930> layer<00:06:56.169> and<00:06:56.440> without<00:06:57.310> these

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
layer with that layer and without these

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.740 
layer with that layer and without these
two<00:06:57.760> and<00:06:57.910> there's<00:06:58.030> going<00:06:58.120> to<00:06:58.180> be<00:06:58.240> a<00:06:58.330> bunch<00:06:58.630> of

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
two and there's going to be a bunch of

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.629 
two and there's going to be a bunch of
them<00:06:58.870> I<00:06:58.990> hope<00:06:59.110> that<00:06:59.289> they<00:06:59.380> make<00:06:59.530> one<00:06:59.710> with<00:07:00.430> an

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 
them I hope that they make one with an

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.060 
them I hope that they make one with an
extension<00:07:01.120> here<00:07:01.449> in<00:07:01.600> here<00:07:02.229> and<00:07:02.410> then<00:07:02.800> one<00:07:02.979> on

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.070 
extension here in here and then one on

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.710 
extension here in here and then one on
the<00:07:03.100> side<00:07:03.370> so<00:07:03.550> it's<00:07:03.669> like<00:07:03.760> one<00:07:03.940> two<00:07:04.150> three<00:07:04.180> in<00:07:04.630> a

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
the side so it's like one two three in a

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.600 
the side so it's like one two three in a
circle<00:07:05.169> and<00:07:05.320> then<00:07:05.770> not<00:07:05.919> on<00:07:06.070> the<00:07:06.160> other<00:07:06.280> side<00:07:06.490> so

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
circle and then not on the other side so

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.680 
circle and then not on the other side so
I'd<00:07:06.729> be<00:07:06.880> cool<00:07:07.060> I<00:07:07.150> think<00:07:07.210> there's<00:07:07.510> gonna<00:07:07.630> be

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
I'd be cool I think there's gonna be

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.750 
I'd be cool I think there's gonna be
like<00:07:07.870> 11<00:07:08.260> different<00:07:08.590> versions<00:07:09.250> of<00:07:09.400> this<00:07:09.580> or

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:09.760
