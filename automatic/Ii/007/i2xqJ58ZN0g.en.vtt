00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.770 
is a little bit bigger if I were to do
it<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.640> those<00:01:44.880> edges<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.899> would<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.170> line<00:01:46.380> up

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
it on those edges it would not line up

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.690 
it on those edges it would not line up
so<00:01:48.780> again<00:01:49.200> I'm<00:01:49.380> being<00:01:49.560> very<00:01:49.590> generous<00:01:50.130> because

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.550 
that down it'll be easier to take this
and<00:02:11.410> try<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.590> measure<00:02:11.830> that<00:02:12.130> directly<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:13.560> all

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
and try to measure that directly and all

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.470 
and try to measure that directly and all
the<00:02:14.770> way<00:02:14.890> around<00:02:15.010> I<00:02:15.490> hope<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.390> can<00:02:16.570> see<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:18.480> so

side of the closer down and then I'm

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.850 
side of the closer down and then I'm
going<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.540> Center<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.959> entire<00:02:56.230> squash<00:02:56.620> book

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
going to Center the entire squash book

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:05.280

on<00:02:57.010> top<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.430> that<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:04.030> that's<00:03:04.300> pretty<00:03:04.630> good<00:03:04.900> so

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
on top of that so that's pretty good so

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.890 
on top of that so that's pretty good so
once<00:03:05.590> again<00:03:06.060> apply<00:03:07.060> some<00:03:07.300> pressure<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.840> you

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
once again apply some pressure so you

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:18.270 
once again apply some pressure so you
have<00:03:08.080> a<00:03:08.110> good<00:03:08.350> bond<00:03:16.739> little<00:03:17.739> extra<00:03:18.010> on<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.160> one

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
have a good bond little extra on the one

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.160 
have a good bond little extra on the one
side<00:03:18.310> but<00:03:19.170> we<00:03:20.170> should<00:03:20.410> have<00:03:20.560> plenty<00:03:20.920> there<00:03:22.170> so

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
side but we should have plenty there so

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.060 
side but we should have plenty there so
that<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:25.120> coasters<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.380> ribbon<00:03:26.769> and
