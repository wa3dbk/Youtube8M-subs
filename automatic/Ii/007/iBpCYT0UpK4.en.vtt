this video a couple times watch it back

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
this video a couple times watch it back
in<00:01:35.790> slow<00:01:36.000> motion<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.509> whatnot<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.930> figure<00:01:37.259> out

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
in slow motion and whatnot to figure out

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.960 
in slow motion and whatnot to figure out
all<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> details<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.340> here's<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.640> quick<00:01:38.790> view

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
all the details so here's a quick view

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.609 
all the details so here's a quick view
of<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.390> little<00:01:39.630> bit<00:01:39.720> less<00:01:39.900> slow<00:01:40.140> motion

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
of it in a little bit less slow motion

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.170 
of it in a little bit less slow motion
and<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:41.070> after<00:01:41.340> it'll<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> full<00:01:41.909> speed

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and then after it'll have a full speed

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.490 
and then after it'll have a full speed
bone<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.049> thought<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.320> move
