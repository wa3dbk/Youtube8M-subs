00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.710 
exploit as I said in my previous video
so<00:01:43.530> pretty<00:01:43.799> much<00:01:44.009> these<00:01:44.610> guns<00:01:45.000> are<00:01:45.240> just

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
so pretty much these guns are just

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.870 
so pretty much these guns are just
various<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.530> are<00:01:46.710> already<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.430> game<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
various that are already in the game and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.240 
various that are already in the game and
stuff<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.079> we've<00:01:49.439> already<00:01:49.590> seen<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.040> it's

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
stuff that we've already seen but it's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.819 
stuff that we've already seen but it's
just<00:01:50.490> offshore<00:01:50.759> grand<00:01:51.270> master<00:01:51.810> prestige<00:01:52.020> camo

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
just offshore grand master prestige camo

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.760 
just offshore grand master prestige camo
and<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.490> see<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> actual<00:01:54.600> Rico<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.590> this

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and you can see the actual Rico in this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.459 
and you can see the actual Rico in this
game<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.310> much<00:01:56.520> worse<00:01:57.329> than<00:01:57.360> what<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.229> will

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
game is much worse than what you will

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.039 
game is much worse than what you will
see<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> console<00:01:59.579> is<00:02:00.030> more<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.509> vigorous<00:02:00.899> as

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
see a console is more in on vigorous as

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.469 
see a console is more in on vigorous as
all<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.469> PI<00:02:01.619> tag<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.729> moving<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
all for the PI tag but moving on to the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.920 
all for the PI tag but moving on to the
next<00:02:03.600> one<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> h<00:02:04.710> VAR<00:02:05.340> 3<00:02:06.149> royalty<00:02:06.810> so

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
next one we have the h VAR 3 royalty so

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.210 
next one we have the h VAR 3 royalty so
you<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.320> we've<00:02:07.530> missed<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.829> ton<00:02:07.890> le

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
you can see that we've missed a ton le

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.339 
you can see that we've missed a ton le
but<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> actual<00:02:09.270> bare<00:02:09.810> fists<00:02:10.140> that

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
but this is the actual bare fists that

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.380 
but this is the actual bare fists that
I'm<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:11.370> know<00:02:11.489> we've<00:02:11.670> seen<00:02:11.879> before<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.300> not

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
first they did this for the exam I think

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.760 
first they did this for the exam I think
this<00:02:15.300> wouldn't<00:02:15.570> be<00:02:15.630> one<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.960> best<00:02:16.170> looking

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
inside these in the whole game and I

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.900 
inside these in the whole game and I
