00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.670
 stealing was bad at all times but to 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.860
 Happily there are computer games in the world 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.260
 where forbidden fruits lose their shackles and 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.680
 give us a little bit of freedom today we 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.360
 let's talk about the game Ziv February Thu our 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.770
 The editor said that if I do not pronounce 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.920
 this again he will not mount this 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.670
 review is shorter talk about new yard or 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.670
 into a nut 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.160
 since 1998, CIF has changed developers 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.500
 improved but always ported 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.750
 remained true to his traditions 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.460
 the hero of Garot and concurrently better 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.650
 Victorian Bear Cub 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.050
 rendered us all the thieves 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.619
 world and taught not to divide the world into black and 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.530
 white 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.479
 last time he did this in 2004 in 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.479
 the third part of those ever 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:27.670
 ordered to live long and new game even 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.830
 played on this fact forcing the main 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.630
 hero find out in the course of the plot that 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.320
 It became his hometown during 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.970
 lack of 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.130
 and why he doesn't remember anything for 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.229
 last year cause so deep 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.509
 amnesia became a mess in which burn 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.119
 together with his protege, ellen tried 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.310
 steal sectarians cool artifact but 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.429
 both were in the wrong place and wrong 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.429
 time 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.119
 The plot plot of the game is the first thing 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.340
 pleases intrigue adds not even so much 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.259
 the fact that burn lost memory and the fact that 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.360
 the play goes we have to figure out how to 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.610
 this is a devil involved ellen of course 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.290
 the canonical conflict in 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.550
 the city has guards who serves 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.709
 creepy tyrant baron 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.600
 there is poverty forcing people to commit 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:18.239
 desperate acts have a plague which 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.910
 takes away the lives of citizens every day all these 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.500
 circumstances are terrible here so yes 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.870
 at first the gameplay seems well 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.610
 completely without for light gloomy 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.100
 curving city with its dirty 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.080
 streets and scurrying Baron servers 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.640
 hardly seeks to please the player 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.380
 there was even the impression that 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.150
 developers deliberately spawn 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.209
 dark locations to hide technical 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.489
 flaws well even despite the 90 percent 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.080
 the concentration of darkness will see deficiencies 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.080
 developers will not be difficult 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.650
 you are the technical component of the game 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.720
 really weak and if so 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.980
 graphics and such optimization is crowned 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.200
 era playstation 3 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.840
 then the Japanese seem to have serious problems 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.360
 in fact, everything is much easier to create 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.250
 or elementary released grayish game 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.290
 so see how the enemies pass 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.290
 through each other here have often 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.470
 but what no complaints so it 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.959
 gameplay you do story tasks we 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.879
 We are passing our way home in the city take 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.129
 all that is bad lies but rings well and 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.530
 clear unsuspecting guards 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.629
 success as always concluded in one if 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.500
 stealing business is quiet don't forget 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.420
 hide in the shadows 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.310
 the shadow is generally the main ally of the mountain 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.560
 even he is not always reliable if you 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.690
 raised excessive hype constantly fidgeting 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.739
 and hiding behind the box anyway 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.900
 can calculate 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.890
 the authors did not lie with the duration of the enemies 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:57.079
 on high complexity 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:58.700
 it is worth counting any loot instantly 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.440
 transformed into gold which 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.720
 allows you to acquire various useful 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.650
 There were several items in the game. 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.930
 types of arrows 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.730
 from water and fire which is easy mascara 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.160
 from the torch and accordingly light them 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.650
 up to strangling does anyone bring these guards 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.810
 out of action is morally to be solved again 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.720
 whether to kill stun enemies for a while or 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.889
 do without battering 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.750
 perfectionists for perfect statistics 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.900
 at the end of the chapter will of course choose the last one 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.900
 option 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.160
 separate words deserve a test 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.139
 which pass free from 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.970
 single player campaign time this is such 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.650
 training camp with different tasks 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.960
 on time where you can hone 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.240
 skill Silent kazhi way 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.220
 find cleverly hidden jewels 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.260
 disarm traps or unravel not 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.389
 the simplest puzzles will now help 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.120
 special concentration ability 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.330
 which is replenished if you eat 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.330
 miracle mac 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.020
 General merits of new boron 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.340
 appear on the light immediately only with 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.020
 time you begin to understand that 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.600
 make your way to a given destination 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.590
 different ways it's really nice 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.750
 roofs 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.550
 street through the apartment if you want you can 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.150
 use any path from point a to 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.460
 point b 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.560
 However, lovers of running around in the spirit of the mirror's 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.270
 edge waits somewhat scripted 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.270
 damn exciting scenes 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.110
 safe is a dish that you need 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.180
 not all games 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.890
 deserve such a chance but I would give you 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.660
 recommended not to write off the thief 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.180
 accounts in the first minutes of passing 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.460
 even closing their eyes on the bugs slow down 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.000
 textures and long swinging plot 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.380
 new steve still looks decent 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.390
 here you think I can't hear you until 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.390
 let me hear the deaf one more time 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.389
 there are creatures in the shadows and more terrible than you
