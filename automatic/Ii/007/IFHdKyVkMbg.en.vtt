00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.670 

hi<00:00:07.170> folks<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.360> Stirling<00:00:09.360> cycle<00:00:10.110> engine

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680 
hi folks this is a Stirling cycle engine

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.580 
hi folks this is a Stirling cycle engine
it's<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.850> little<00:00:12.120> different<00:00:12.450> from<00:00:12.660> most

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
it's a little different from most

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.510 
it's a little different from most
because<00:00:14.220> it<00:00:14.460> uses<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:15.650> rotary<00:00:16.650> displacer

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
because it uses a rotary displacer

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.050 
because it uses a rotary displacer
instead<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.150> reciprocating<00:00:19.080> displacer

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
instead of a reciprocating displacer

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.040 
instead of a reciprocating displacer
it's<00:00:21.060> not<00:00:21.210> terribly<00:00:21.660> efficient<00:00:22.200> but<00:00:23.810> it<00:00:24.810> does

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
it's not terribly efficient but it does

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:34.430 
it's not terribly efficient but it does
work<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:27.439> let's<00:00:28.439> fire<00:00:28.829> it<00:00:28.860> up<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.290> we

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
work and let's fire it up and see if we

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.029 
work and let's fire it up and see if we
can<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.010> run<00:00:36.590> just<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.859> to<00:00:37.949> hook

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
can get it to run just going to hook

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.540 
can get it to run just going to hook
these<00:00:38.250> two<00:00:38.309> candles<00:00:39.030> underneath<00:00:40.309> to<00:00:41.309> heat<00:00:41.519> up

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
these two candles underneath to heat up

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.150 
these two candles underneath to heat up
the<00:00:41.879> hot<00:00:42.030> side<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:44.820> gets<00:00:45.090> warm<00:00:46.039> see<00:00:47.039> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the hot side that gets warm see it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.889 
the hot side that gets warm see it
starting<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.609> move<00:00:47.850> some<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:53.820> doesn't<00:00:54.690> have

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
starting to move some it doesn't have

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900 
starting to move some it doesn't have
enough<00:00:55.140> power<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.559> start<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.129> its<00:00:56.309> own<00:00:56.489> after

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
enough power to start on its own after

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.549 
enough power to start on its own after
it<00:00:57.239> gets<00:00:57.420> warm<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.899> seem<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> give<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.530> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
it gets warm you seem to give it a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.229 
it gets warm you seem to give it a
little<00:00:58.710> kick

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.050 

there<00:01:04.900> it<00:01:05.049> goes<00:01:05.350> we've<00:01:05.799> got<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.950> green<00:01:06.790> balloon

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
there it goes we've got a green balloon

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.060 
there it goes we've got a green balloon
for<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:08.009> diaphram<00:01:10.409> bicycle<00:01:11.409> spoke<00:01:11.710> for<00:01:12.009> the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
for the diaphram bicycle spoke for the

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.219 
for the diaphram bicycle spoke for the
connecting<00:01:12.490> rod<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.149> the<00:01:13.210> bicycle<00:01:13.720> spoke<00:01:13.840> for

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
connecting rod and the bicycle spoke for

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.210 
connecting rod and the bicycle spoke for
the<00:01:14.290> shaft<00:01:15.210> made<00:01:16.210> these<00:01:16.420> clear<00:01:16.780> ends<00:01:17.320> so<00:01:18.009> that

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
the shaft made these clear ends so that

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.910 
the shaft made these clear ends so that
it<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:20.020> can<00:01:20.170> see<00:01:20.409> it<00:01:20.560> see<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.460> displacer<00:01:22.090> move

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
it you can see it see the displacer move

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.800 
it you can see it see the displacer move
got<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:23.950> little<00:01:24.189> frizzy<00:01:24.460> pack<00:01:24.789> up<00:01:25.000> top<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.659> keep

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
got a little frizzy pack up top to keep

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.929 
got a little frizzy pack up top to keep
the<00:01:25.869> cold<00:01:26.380> side<00:01:26.679> cold<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:30.460> doesn't<00:01:30.789> really

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
the cold side cold it doesn't really

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:38.580 
the cold side cold it doesn't really
make<00:01:31.149> much<00:01:31.360> sound<00:01:31.750> at<00:01:31.960> all

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.800 

you<00:01:39.280> see<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.640> air<00:01:39.789> running<00:01:40.450> into<00:01:40.719> the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
you see the air running into the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.399 
you see the air running into the
diaphragm<00:01:41.439> when<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.780> displacer<00:01:43.780> gap<00:01:44.020> comes

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
diaphragm when the displacer gap comes

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.910 
diaphragm when the displacer gap comes
over<00:01:44.649> to<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.829> hot<00:01:44.979> side<00:01:49.500> that's<00:01:50.500> my<00:01:50.710> little

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
over to the hot side that's my little

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:59.340 
over to the hot side that's my little
Stirling<00:01:51.399> engine<00:01:51.729> I<00:01:55.920> hope<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.069> enjoy
