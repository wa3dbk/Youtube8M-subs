 hello everyone hello you are on the channel 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.029
 today is such a small bag 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:20.250
 he got hongkong mail 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:23.150
 three weeks drove wrote three dollars 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.560
 actually here and usb extension 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.270
 worth 1 dollar 25 cents 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:34.710
 where there is a region of 60 rubles open 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:39.780
 let's see i need it as an extension cord on 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:45.079
 keyboard so as the keyboard cable 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:50.399
 short and constantly not enough length 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:58.229
 somewhere rests somewhere something so here 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:02.899
 So here we are wrapped and usb 2 0 4 ports 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:07.740
 that is, three on top one side 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:10.950
 cable here as two feet most 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.160
 neat and let's see what's here 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.160
 inside 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:24.290
 how does he understand so that's probably yes 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:37.640
 nail can be pinched and normally come out 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.640
 so a little bit aside 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.990
 that's the whole and usb-extension cable 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:52.260
 3 connector and one on top of the side as 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:56.310
 the soldering is more or less Chinese of course 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:00.620
 in another way can not wiring of course 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.830
 the foot should be soldered painfully flimsy 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.840
 sealed and so 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:12.540
 great thing for your money 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.540
