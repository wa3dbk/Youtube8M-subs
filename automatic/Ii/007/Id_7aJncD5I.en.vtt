00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.400 
reviewing but the reason I changed it is
because<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:32.360> there<00:02:33.360> was<00:02:33.450> no<00:02:33.540> reason<00:02:34.019> for<00:02:34.050> me<00:02:34.379> to

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.939 
actually seeing the anime yes there are
two<00:04:38.900> cases<00:04:39.080> that<00:04:39.289> I<00:04:39.470> could<00:04:39.620> think<00:04:39.680> of<00:04:39.800> off<00:04:39.919> the

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
two cases that I could think of off the

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.969 
two cases that I could think of off the
top<00:04:40.220> of<00:04:40.250> my<00:04:40.340> head<00:04:40.520> first<00:04:41.120> case<00:04:41.389> being<00:04:41.979> Tsubasa

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
top of my head first case being Tsubasa

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.950 
top of my head first case being Tsubasa
Reservoir<00:04:43.520> chronicles<00:04:44.090> which<00:04:44.300> I<00:04:44.539> have<00:04:44.750> owned

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
Reservoir chronicles which I have owned

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.360 
Reservoir chronicles which I have owned
actually<00:04:45.349> for<00:04:45.500> quite<00:04:45.650> a<00:04:45.680> while<00:04:45.830> but<00:04:46.070> because<00:04:46.340> I

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
actually for quite a while but because I

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.710 
actually for quite a while but because I
haven't<00:04:46.610> had<00:04:46.820> access<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.360> blu-ray<00:04:47.690> player

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
haven't had access to a blu-ray player

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.439 
haven't had access to a blu-ray player
for<00:04:48.139> who<00:04:48.889> knows<00:04:49.070> how<00:04:49.130> long<00:04:49.340> and<00:04:49.550> I<00:04:50.120> own<00:04:50.270> in

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
for who knows how long and I own in

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.150 
for who knows how long and I own in
blu-ray<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.930> wasn't<00:04:51.289> able<00:04:51.349> to<00:04:51.500> watch<00:04:51.650> it<00:04:51.680> and<00:04:51.949> at

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.620 
blu-ray I wasn't able to watch it and at

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.020 
this point I just haven't gotten around
to<00:04:53.900> it<00:04:54.139> but<00:04:54.740> because<00:04:55.250> it's<00:04:55.400> Yuki<00:04:55.639> Kaji<00:04:55.820> were
