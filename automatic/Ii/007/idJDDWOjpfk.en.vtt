I<00:00:06.740> got<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.770> intake<00:00:08.580> air<00:00:08.849> mattress<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.599> had<00:00:09.750> it

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
I got a intake air mattress that had it

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.560 
I got a intake air mattress that had it
built<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.469> air<00:00:10.590> pump<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.570> started

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
built in the air pump and started

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.600 
built in the air pump and started
leaking<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.110> cut<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.009> out<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.250> mat<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
leaking so I cut it out of the mat the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.689 
leaking so I cut it out of the mat the
air<00:00:14.820> mattress<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.389> took<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.719> apart<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.699> it's

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
air mattress and took it apart and it's

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.529 
air mattress and took it apart and it's
got<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> neat<00:00:18.180> little<00:00:18.359> 120-volt<00:00:20.210> air<00:00:21.210> blower

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
got a neat little 120-volt air blower

I just kind of got it temporarily rigged

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.700 
I just kind of got it temporarily rigged
up<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> PVC<00:00:32.480> air<00:00:33.480> pipe<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:34.680> of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
up with the PVC air pipe just kind of

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:44.270 
up with the PVC air pipe just kind of
stuck<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> blower<00:00:35.489> frame<00:00:42.950> I've<00:00:43.950> got<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.139 
with the capatch Izzy capacitor rigged
I'm<00:00:49.440> not<00:00:49.620> running<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> 12-volt<00:00:50.760> battery

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
I'm not running on the 12-volt battery

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.080 
I'm not running on the 12-volt battery
I've<00:00:51.270> got<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.480> power<00:00:51.780> supply<00:00:52.020> here<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:53.090> I've

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
I've got a power supply here and I've

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.360 
I've got a power supply here and I've
got<00:00:54.120> set<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.539> 12<00:00:54.870> volts<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> chopper<00:00:56.190> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
got set to 12 volts so the chopper and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.639 
got set to 12 volts so the chopper and
the<00:00:56.430> rotator<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.719> control<00:00:58.079> circuit<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the rotator and the control circuit is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.040 
the rotator and the control circuit is
still<00:00:58.859> running<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.190> 12<00:00:59.430> volts<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.989> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
still running on 12 volts and this is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.490 
still running on 12 volts and this is
100<00:01:02.570> 120<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.949> I'm<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:06.080> run<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> couple<00:01:07.320> of

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
100 120 so I'm going to run a couple of

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.050 
100 120 so I'm going to run a couple of
times<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:07.979> running<00:01:08.369> better<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.700> little<00:01:08.970> bit

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
times it's running better a little bit

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.350 
times it's running better a little bit
better<00:01:09.210> than<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:10.369> last<00:01:11.369> time<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.760> videoed<00:01:12.150> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
better than the last time I videoed it

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.850 
better than the last time I videoed it
still<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:14.479> burpee<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.110> sine<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.680> clean

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
still a burpee but it's sine and clean

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.100 
still a burpee but it's sine and clean
the<00:01:16.950> collector<00:01:17.340> ring<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:18.720> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.049> go

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the collector ring so I'm going to go

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.740 
the collector ring so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.439> run<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.820> don't<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.630> it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
ahead and run it and I don't have it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.060 
ahead and run it and I don't have it
hooked<00:01:21.869> up<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.110> time<00:01:22.500> where<00:01:22.710> I'm<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:22.860> going

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
hooked up to time where I'm just going

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.670 
hooked up to time where I'm just going
to<00:01:23.100> run<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.750> steady<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:24.990> for<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> minute<00:01:25.590> or

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
to run it steady here for a minute or

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.730 
to run it steady here for a minute or
two<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.390> I<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.630> kind<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.840> mainly<00:01:28.290> hook<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.619> up

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
two and I just kind of mainly hook it up

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.380 
two and I just kind of mainly hook it up
here

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.020 

and<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.480> chopper<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.580> rotator<00:01:35.580> on<00:01:35.820> now

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
and the chopper and the rotator on now

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.920 
and the chopper and the rotator on now
you<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.270> barely<00:01:36.570> hear<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.840> chopper

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
you can barely hear the chopper

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.360 
from I think a car that was flooded I
got<00:04:33.510> it<00:04:33.600> on<00:04:33.690> eBay<00:04:33.720> for<00:04:34.020> about<00:04:34.320> 10<00:04:34.590> bucks<00:04:34.620> but<00:04:35.130> I

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
got it on eBay for about 10 bucks but I

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.880 
got it on eBay for about 10 bucks but I
think<00:04:36.270> this<00:04:36.450> seems<00:04:36.690> like<00:04:36.750> this<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.470> air

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
think this seems like this the air

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.540 
think this seems like this the air
output<00:04:38.160> of<00:04:38.580> this<00:04:38.870> little<00:04:39.870> 120<00:04:40.260> 120<00:04:41.160> volt<00:04:41.370> one

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
output of this little 120 120 volt one

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.150 
output of this little 120 120 volt one
is<00:04:41.670> about<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.030> same<00:04:42.270> as<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:42.540> big<00:04:43.160> clunky

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
is about the same as that big clunky

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.890 
is about the same as that big clunky
piece<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.640> junk<00:04:44.850> there<00:04:45.120> you<00:04:45.360> see<00:04:45.540> they're<00:04:45.690> just

piece of junk there you see they're just

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.890 
piece of junk there you see they're just
about<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.260> same<00:04:46.470> size<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:48.270> impeller<00:04:48.600> and

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
about the same size the impeller and

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.130 
about the same size the impeller and
this<00:04:49.020> thing<00:04:49.230> is<00:04:49.380> smaller<00:04:50.450> I've<00:04:51.450> got<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.900> you

just rigged all this up just to see how

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.980 
just rigged all this up just to see how
it<00:04:57.960> will<00:04:58.170> work<00:04:59.150> and<00:05:00.150> it<00:05:00.300> seems<00:05:00.570> to<00:05:00.690> run<00:05:00.840> okay

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
it will work and it seems to run okay

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.640 
it will work and it seems to run okay
outs<00:05:01.440> nita<00:05:02.510> yeah<00:05:03.510> I<00:05:03.540> can<00:05:03.900> hook<00:05:04.080> all<00:05:04.290> this<00:05:04.410> up

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
outs nita yeah I can hook all this up

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.640 
outs nita yeah I can hook all this up
too<00:05:05.480> so<00:05:06.480> it<00:05:06.570> can<00:05:06.720> be<00:05:06.840> run<00:05:07.050> just<00:05:07.230> with<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.500> push

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
too so it can be run just with the push

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.990 
too so it can be run just with the push
of<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.860> button<00:05:07.890> so<00:05:08.220> that<00:05:08.430> shouldn't<00:05:08.790> be<00:05:08.850> too

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
of a button so that shouldn't be too

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.320 
of a button so that shouldn't be too
hard<00:05:09.030> but<00:05:10.280> that's<00:05:11.280> for<00:05:11.520> another<00:05:11.550> day<00:05:11.790> I<00:05:11.940> guess

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
hard but that's for another day I guess

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.240 
hard but that's for another day I guess
anyway<00:05:12.750> about<00:05:13.200> it<00:05:13.320> for<00:05:13.440> this<00:05:13.530> video<00:05:13.710> I<00:05:13.920> guess

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
anyway about it for this video I guess

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.480 
anyway about it for this video I guess
maybe<00:05:14.970> Thunderbolt<00:05:15.450> video<00:05:15.690> number<00:05:16.220> 8<00:05:19.040> 7<00:05:20.040> or<00:05:20.190> 6

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
maybe Thunderbolt video number 8 7 or 6

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.170 
maybe Thunderbolt video number 8 7 or 6
or<00:05:20.820> never<00:05:21.480> millions<00:05:21.870> been<00:05:22.110> uh<00:05:24.020> I<00:05:25.970> guess<00:05:26.970> that's

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
or never millions been uh I guess that's

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:35.010 
or never millions been uh I guess that's
about<00:05:27.390> it<00:05:31.040> yeah

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020
