would<00:01:32.340> regret<00:01:32.670> right<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.150> what<00:01:33.299> isn't<00:01:33.479> isn't

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
would regret right but what isn't isn't

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.420 
would regret right but what isn't isn't
attractive<00:01:34.350> depends<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.740> who<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.009> talk<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
attractive depends on who you talk to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.679 
attractive depends on who you talk to
some<00:01:35.640> people<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:35.939> gonna<00:01:36.030> find<00:01:36.240> your<00:01:36.479> gauges

them<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.490> attractive<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.119> think<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.360> best<00:01:39.509> bet

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
them not attractive I think the best bet

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.510 
them not attractive I think the best bet
is<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.960> avoid<00:01:40.229> physical<00:01:40.680> alterations<00:01:41.400> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
is to avoid physical alterations that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.190 
is to avoid physical alterations that
you<00:01:41.729> cannot<00:01:42.060> reverse<00:01:42.299> until<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.869> are<00:01:42.990> 100%

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
you cannot reverse until you are 100%

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.560 
you cannot reverse until you are 100%
certain<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.310> want<00:01:44.549> them<00:01:44.700> these<00:01:44.939> tattoos

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
certain that you want them these tattoos

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.510 
certain that you want them these tattoos
if<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.020> could<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.350> them<00:01:46.530> removed<00:01:46.680> right<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.250> I

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
if I could get them removed right now I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
if I could get them removed right now I
would<00:01:47.790> say<00:01:48.030> no<00:01:48.270> because<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> bottom<00:01:49.049> line<00:01:49.200> is

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
