00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:12.440
 to do with technology and have 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.269
 decided to take a little bit out of our 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.619
 agendas to come and tell us 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.360
 some of the tricks that we 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.650
 we internally handle many of the 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.600
 tricks that we are going to tell you are already 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.860
 publicly known sorry not the 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.210
 you know so let's take a moment 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.040
 of our time to give you some 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.930
 tips some tricks so that 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.610
 know what the risks are and 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.190
 what are the tools that should be 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.960
 use today to be more 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.350
 protected against bad types of 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.350
 Internet 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.679
 to 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.220
 what we're going to see now is a simple 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.870
 hakim trick I will make people 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.970
 that has an iphone 5 to show you 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.790
 as the default settings that 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.650
 brings the old iphone 4 are even more 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.760
 sure the trick we're going to do is 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.770
 pretty simple I have here a 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.420
 iphone that is totally blocked and 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.370
 what we are going to do is take advantage 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.890
 some of the insecure configurations 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.450
 so as not to steal the account from the 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.330
 email to the owner of the phone 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.710
 first of all let's use zinc 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.420
 to get to know who the owner is 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.640
 of the phone then it's something so 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.479
 simple how to activate go and ask 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.479
 who I am 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.780
 it is automatically giving me the 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.310
 information and I can see the data from 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.380
 contact in this case the emails 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.700
 electronic from the other terminal what 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.560
 what we are going to do now is ask for a 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.840
 password recovery account 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.220
 from the owner of this phone and we're going to 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.590
 ask for password recovery 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.100
 using the recovery options 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.159
 by means of code sent in an SMS 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.130
 then we select the option of 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.600
 ask for the sms code this has been sent and 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.979
 is asking me to enter the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.840
 code and the only thing I have to do is 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.280
 wait for it to reach the other phone and 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.319
 in the preview options 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.729
 we can read exactly the number like this 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.649
 that we would reach the telephone 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.850
 we would enter the number that I'm not going 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.740
 to do because in my email account 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.200
 electronic and automatically there would be 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.420
 achieved with an unlocked terminal 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.369
 that I have to steal the associated account in 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.649
 another phone that simple and thus 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.659
 easy what should we do then disable 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.799
 siri if the screen is locked and 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.869
 supposed to deactivate 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.330
 previews of messages from 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.069
 email and the sms is for 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.630
 that nobody can read information if the 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.630
 phone is blocked and that's it
