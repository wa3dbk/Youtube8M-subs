00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.480
 Talk to you guys, how are you? 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.880
 I'll be doing you a makeup 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.560
 quick and easy to choose the cover and 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.470
 marks of pimples leaving the skin with 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.840
 natural and healthy appearance I already 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.550
 I spoke my skin there with the problem that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.550
 act of the natural line one 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.010
 but you can use a beak there and you 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.309
 can also use meet or moisturizer 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.200
 very light to prepare this skin 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.020
 remembering that it is good for you to shave and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.719
 also because he is beard knows when 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.850
 It starts to get ugly appearance grip means 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.440
 so it's if you come by, we will not 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.660
 will be left behind product and not 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.480
 look so cool so I 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.210
 I used eye drops also used this 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.390
 makeup and my skin is already 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.550
 ready 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.000
 So I'll make an anti leave with the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.530
 present that the LG he sent that is the g-4 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.590
 so we can compare the before and the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.590
 after 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.530
 so like I said to you in just 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.659
 two steps we will cover the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.000
 the marks of pimples and leave behind 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.119
 the skin with natural appearance 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.640
 I'll use base here, but if your 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.680
 skin is oily you replace the base 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.299
 but not by a powder base 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.880
 let's not go here for a net concealer 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.250
 because the net concealer it spreads 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.640
 with ease it is lighter then 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.310
 it will keep our focus which is to leave 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.470
 a natural aspect to the base you use 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.170
 color of the skin tone and the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.590
 corrective tone a tone a tone above not 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.590
 lighter than your silver skin for 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.500
 marks are dark but if you have 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.840
 only that look of swelling only at 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.649
 base or even corrective of the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.320
 your skin 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.649
 enough to go to leave this aspect 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.509
 natural people then to spread the 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.509
 based on taste 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.459
 put a little bit here a little bit 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.300
 even because we want something well 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.879
 Light 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.879
 I'm going to spend a little bit here in Oliveira 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.920
 So you do not have to use too much 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.040
 collective or other 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.310
 another product just spend a little bit 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:33.640
 I think here gave a failed the 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:45.220
 partner there now tapping us 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:48.069
 will fail this larger product spread 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.970
 by the face left the uniform waits 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:55.060
 inheriting an absurdity is 2 to 3 minutes and 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.370
 begins to pass the corrective device only 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.099
 corrective buying enough you pass 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.340
 already in the face you will put here 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:07.989
 on the back and will put the business failed 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.780
 and will put the dot no problem 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:15.099
 just put it right where it's at 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:19.540
 stain with the tip of a finger and points 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:22.630
 on the other you have been equating care there 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.239
 You'll use the concealer there. 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.060
 but of course your skin gives 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:32.079
 trick because it gets lighter then 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.169
 just places above the stain and comes 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.260
 tapping there not to stay 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:41.590
 light spots on your face and then I 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.209
 I will not do here in the dark circles is to pass 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.970
 Corrective because you do not want that thing. 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.900
 But if your look was very 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.349
 marked 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.410
 You can do it there with retouching with 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.389
 own basis of action if the corrective 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.690
 do not mind but I think with 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:01.690
 corrective already gives a more natural effect and 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.840
 if that aspect of 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.550
 product together in your choices is because 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.910
 You passed 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.740
 the excess or you did not prepare the skin 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.850
 correctly then you will do some 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.070
 tests before you do there is is the 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.350
 Final makeup goes on training because 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.940
 You're getting the hang of it. I'm with a 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.880
 mark here puts it very little and spread 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.580
 containing clean 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.760
 just to soften up why this 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.100
 make-up here it will soften or 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.920
 pimple marks and tradings and also 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.170
 Dark circles are quite simple you saw 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.430
 and corrective in the tones in which I passed 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.860
 here for you 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.620
 you see which fits best in your 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.680
 skin tone and for the function one 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.650
 with you want you to do the following 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.600
 Do the makeup there, wait to dry it. 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.730
 absorbed and takes a photo with the 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.760
 flash to see if you stayed there with the 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.010
 excess makeup on the face I like 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.750
 much of the natura line because it is 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:07.020
 made by a Brazilian company that 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.180
 knows the Brazilian skin so she knows 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.010
 more or less how our skin works 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.980
 this kind of makeup here has a 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.680
 long lasting male skin case 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.350
 Do you want something shorter or find 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.740
 What is this makeup is very elaborate? 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.410
 you can wear a bikini or a base 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.600
 multibenefits and ends with a review of 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.190

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.169
