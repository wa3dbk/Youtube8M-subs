these powers he gains his capabilities

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.350 
these powers he gains his capabilities
and<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.010> only<00:04:32.130> thing<00:04:32.220> that<00:04:32.430> he<00:04:32.490> can<00:04:32.520> do<00:04:32.790> is<00:04:33.060> to

as<00:04:35.880> this<00:04:36.090> person<00:04:36.480> is<00:04:36.600> learning<00:04:37.080> about<00:04:37.169> where

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
as this person is learning about where

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.040 
as this person is learning about where
where<00:04:37.980> it<00:04:38.100> comes<00:04:38.280> from<00:04:38.370> what<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.360> what<00:04:39.930> it's

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
where it comes from what it is what it's

where it comes from what it is what it's
about<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.560> what<00:04:41.160> is<00:04:41.400> this<00:04:41.940> initial<00:04:42.450> goal

about and what is this initial goal

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.240 
about and what is this initial goal
don't<00:04:42.960> think<00:04:43.139> it<00:04:43.200> was<00:04:43.380> initial<00:04:43.830> goal<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.160> that

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
don't think it was initial goal is that

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.920 
don't think it was initial goal is that
it<00:04:44.400> failed<00:04:44.760> because<00:04:44.970> I'm<00:04:45.330> supposed<00:04:45.480> to<00:04:45.660> try

body and such like that I don't know it

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.980

was<00:04:56.160> really<00:04:56.490> really<00:04:56.940> it's<00:04:57.780> really

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
was really really it's really

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.720 
was really really it's really
interesting<00:04:58.320> i<00:04:58.680> just<00:04:58.919> kind<00:04:59.190> of<00:04:59.250> liked<00:04:59.490> him<00:04:59.610> or

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
interesting i just kind of liked him or

mutated<00:05:00.150> some<00:05:00.300> backstory<00:05:00.690> behind<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:01.140> aliens

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
mutated some backstory behind the aliens

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.740 
mutated some backstory behind the aliens
at<00:05:01.980> least<00:05:02.220> tell<00:05:02.430> us<00:05:02.460> at<00:05:02.760> least<00:05:02.970> gives<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.510> rough

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
at least tell us at least gives a rough

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.990 
at least tell us at least gives a rough
example<00:05:03.960> because<00:05:04.860> it's<00:05:05.070> got<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.280> goal<00:05:05.550> its<00:05:05.790> goal

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
example because it's got a goal its goal

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.710 
example because it's got a goal its goal
is<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.240> get<00:05:06.330> inside<00:05:06.570> of<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.840> head<00:05:07.050> and<00:05:07.290> to

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
is to get inside of the head and to

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.600 
is to get inside of the head and to
completely<00:05:09.720> take<00:05:09.810> over<00:05:09.990> him<00:05:10.260> now<00:05:10.680> why<00:05:10.979> how's

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
completely take over him now why how's

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.980 
completely take over him now why how's
it<00:05:11.760> gonna<00:05:11.850> know<00:05:12.090> that<00:05:12.330> but<00:05:12.600> now<00:05:12.690> where<00:05:12.870> it's

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
it gonna know that but now where it's

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.140 
it gonna know that but now where it's
from<00:05:13.229> so<00:05:13.710> most<00:05:13.919> likely<00:05:14.040> a<00:05:14.310> king<00:05:14.580> from<00:05:14.820> a<00:05:14.970> host

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
from so most likely a king from a host

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.330 
from so most likely a king from a host
its<00:05:15.389> well<00:05:15.600> maybe<00:05:16.229> a<00:05:16.320> queen<00:05:16.680> or<00:05:16.710> something<00:05:16.979> like

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
its well maybe a queen or something like

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.490 
its well maybe a queen or something like
that<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.790> then<00:05:18.390> it<00:05:18.540> most<00:05:18.750> likely<00:05:18.840> what<00:05:19.290> it<00:05:19.380> did

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
that and then it most likely what it did

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.480 
that and then it most likely what it did
afterwards<00:05:20.040> is<00:05:20.370> it<00:05:22.070> probably<00:05:23.070> had<00:05:23.340> that

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
afterwards is it probably had that

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.040 
afterwards is it probably had that
program<00:05:23.880> the<00:05:24.000> side<00:05:24.150> of<00:05:24.180> his<00:05:24.330> head<00:05:24.510> from<00:05:24.780> birth

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
program the side of his head from birth

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.690 
program the side of his head from birth
and<00:05:25.320> then<00:05:25.680> was<00:05:25.890> probably<00:05:26.220> sent<00:05:26.460> from<00:05:26.550> outer

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
and then was probably sent from outer

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.610 
and then was probably sent from outer
space<00:05:26.940> from<00:05:27.090> a<00:05:27.120> different<00:05:27.450> planet<00:05:28.229> I<00:05:28.470> don't

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
space from a different planet I don't

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.020 
space from a different planet I don't
fucking<00:05:29.010> know<00:05:29.039> I'm<00:05:29.370> just<00:05:29.520> taking<00:05:29.789> a<00:05:29.850> guess

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
fucking know I'm just taking a guess

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.730 
fucking know I'm just taking a guess
right<00:05:30.210> now<00:05:30.390> I'm<00:05:30.450> just<00:05:30.660> I'm<00:05:30.870> brough<00:05:31.260> guessing

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
right now I'm just I'm brough guessing

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.290 
right now I'm just I'm brough guessing
right<00:05:31.830> now<00:05:31.919> as<00:05:32.550> we're<00:05:32.700> gonna<00:05:32.820> be<00:05:33.000> it<00:05:33.120> though

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
right now as we're gonna be it though

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.670 
right now as we're gonna be it though
it's<00:05:33.510> really<00:05:33.660> gonna<00:05:33.870> be<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.169> power's<00:05:34.380> idea<00:05:34.620> is

it's really gonna be the power's idea is

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.140 
it's really gonna be the power's idea is
pretty<00:05:34.860> badass<00:05:35.130> I<00:05:35.490> can't<00:05:35.700> wait<00:05:35.820> to<00:05:35.850> see<00:05:36.030> what
