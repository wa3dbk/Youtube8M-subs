room and the parlor from what from my
reading<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.530> understand<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.280> were

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
reading I understand that they were

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.940 
reading I understand that they were
fairly<00:01:29.939> large<00:01:30.390> lavish<00:01:30.930> rooms<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> time

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
fairly large lavish rooms for the time

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.679 
fairly large lavish rooms for the time
but<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.759> would<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.119> been<00:01:33.240> where<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> house

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
but that would have been where the house

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:42.429 
but that would have been where the house
ended<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:35.600> in<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:38.030> early<00:01:39.030> 1900s<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:41.250> these

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
ended so in the early 1900s the these

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.569 
ended so in the early 1900s the these
the<00:01:43.439> wall<00:01:43.590> between<00:01:43.770> them<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.189> taken<00:01:44.460> down

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
the wall between them was taken down

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.340 
the wall between them was taken down
these<00:01:44.880> two<00:01:45.119> rooms<00:01:45.329> were<00:01:45.479> opened<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:45.930> into<00:01:46.259> the
