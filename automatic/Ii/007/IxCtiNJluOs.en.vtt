00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.520
 called the vitruvian with martina sana 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.480
 using the safety belt to 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.590
 get an elongation an alignment 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.590
 of the entire muscular structure 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.310
 we are this vitruvian stance in 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.890
 suspension allows us to elongate the body 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.770
 in the five cardinal points without 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.780
 there is no surface that contains that 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.630
 long body action allows us cross 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.590
 grow and extend the posture without limits 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.590
 in the space 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.130
 from here we're going to go to the posture 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.130
 we call from the queen's chair 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.259
 since the appointment of the queen we are going to go 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.860
 to the position that we call the turn of 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.670
 susana susana's turn is a turn 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.299
 infinite we relate breathing and 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.299
 gesture 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.500
 we end up in the posture of heaven 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.020
 as the twist of its wings allows us 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.150
 make infinite turns we reproduce the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.310
 Susana's twist going through all the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.760
 phases except for the position of the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.760
 vitruvian 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.090
 from the queen's chair 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.090
 we reproduce the swing of susana 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.160
 life 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.540
 from the bat posture 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.810
 we go back to the queen's appointment for 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.000
 reproduce now a new posture 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.000
 fantastic that is the turn of andy 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.489
 that we are all in the chair of the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.680
 queen and we go to andy's spin grabbing 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.410
 the body of the swing we made a 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.700
 turn without letting go 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.700
 the body of the swing 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.580
 Excellent 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.879
 the turn of antich we return to the 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.290
 bat position to rest 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:18.239
 investment we make a breath 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.760
 bioenergetics that helps us 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.430
 stabilize rhythm biorhythms 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.430
 respiratory cardiac blood pressure 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.270
 with this posture we finish the sequence 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.270
