to<00:00:41.280> YouTube<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:42.210> isn't<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> best<00:00:42.899> quality

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to YouTube this isn't the best quality

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.110 
to YouTube this isn't the best quality
you'll<00:00:43.620> get<00:00:43.860> from<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.190> DSLR

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
you'll get from this DSLR

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.940 
you'll get from this DSLR
now<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.809> captured<00:00:46.230> footage<00:00:46.469> has<00:00:46.920> been

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
now this captured footage has been

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.830 
now this captured footage has been
imported<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.700> Final<00:00:48.090> Cut<00:00:48.120> Pro<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.750> then

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
imported to Final Cut Pro and then

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.380 
imported to Final Cut Pro and then
shared<00:00:49.260> straight<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.770> YouTube<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.640> 1080p

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
shared straight to YouTube at 1080p

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.840 
shared straight to YouTube at 1080p
where<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.289> compressed<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.949> fair<00:00:53.309> amount<00:00:53.489> for

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
where it's compressed a fair amount for

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.119 
where it's compressed a fair amount for
easy<00:00:54.030> streaming<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.379> compression

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
easy streaming and it's this compression

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.459 
easy streaming and it's this compression
that<00:00:56.550> generally<00:00:57.090> means<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.600> drop<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.140> video

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
that generally means a drop in video

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.799 
that generally means a drop in video
quality<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.699> take<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.059> clip<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> pinch

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
quality so take this clip with a pinch

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.100 
quality so take this clip with a pinch
of<00:01:00.930> salt<00:01:01.309> even<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:02.789> 1080p<00:01:03.359> you'll<00:01:03.719> see<00:01:03.930> it's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
of salt even so at 1080p you'll see it's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.080 
of salt even so at 1080p you'll see it's
still<00:01:04.350> pretty<00:01:04.710> sharp<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.460> more<00:01:05.909> than

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
still pretty sharp and more than

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.490 
still pretty sharp and more than

following<00:01:10.770> few<00:01:11.070> Clips<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.549> testing<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
following few Clips I'm testing the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.570 
following few Clips I'm testing the
autofocus<00:01:12.900> speed<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.799> subject<00:01:14.310> close

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
autofocus speed I have a subject close

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
autofocus speed I have a subject close
to<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> lens<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.420> case<00:01:15.720> these<00:01:15.960> batteries

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
to the lens in this case these batteries

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.920 
to the lens in this case these batteries
and<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:17.070> subject<00:01:17.520> further<00:01:17.790> away<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.540> I'm

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and a subject further away and I'm

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.660 
and a subject further away and I'm
simply<00:01:19.259> touching<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.890> screen<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.310> set<00:01:20.520> the

simply touching the screen to set the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210 
simply touching the screen to set the
focal<00:01:21.060> point<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.509> must<00:01:22.110> say<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.680> really

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
focal point I must say it's really

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.700 
focal point I must say it's really
pretty<00:01:23.610> impressive<00:01:24.150> how<00:01:24.479> fast<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> autofocus

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
pretty impressive how fast the autofocus

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.950 
pretty impressive how fast the autofocus
is<00:01:25.979> there's<00:01:26.549> no<00:01:26.790> searching<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.570> focal

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
is there's no searching for the focal

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.800 
is there's no searching for the focal
point<00:01:28.229> whatsoever<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.549> buttery<00:01:30.180> smooth<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
point whatsoever it's buttery smooth and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.990 
point whatsoever it's buttery smooth and
seems<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.380> grab<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.860> focal<00:01:32.250> point<00:01:32.520> straight

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
seems to grab the focal point straight

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.270 
seems to grab the focal point straight
away<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:34.380> I'll<00:01:34.500> leave<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.009> consider
