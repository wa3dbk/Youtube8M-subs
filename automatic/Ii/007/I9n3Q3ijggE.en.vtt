00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.050 
all you just upward a fat all run down
then<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.500> turn<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> monkey<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> few<00:01:26.790> laps

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
then you turn to a monkey do a few laps

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.999 
then you turn to a monkey do a few laps
then<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.509> teleport<00:01:27.810> back<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.590> Percy

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
then you can teleport back but Percy

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.560 
then you can teleport back but Percy
this<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.280> much<00:01:29.460> faster<00:01:29.729> obviously<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.390> just

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
this is much faster obviously you just

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.109 
this is much faster obviously you just
you<00:01:30.810> know<00:01:30.900> grab<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.170> ring<00:01:31.590> around<00:01:32.130> an<00:01:32.610> ambulance

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
you know grab a ring around an ambulance

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.429 
you know grab a ring around an ambulance
or<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> ring<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.689> guess<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.200> teleport

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
or a ring I guess and you just teleport

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.870 
or a ring I guess and you just teleport
and<00:01:34.650> you're<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.850> course

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
and you're right there and of course

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.789 
and you're right there and of course
don't<00:01:36.210> forget<00:01:36.299> broads<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.409> don't<00:01:37.439> if

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
don't forget broads on if you don't if

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.469 
don't forget broads on if you don't if
you<00:01:37.890> can't<00:01:38.100> flex<00:01:38.250> basrah<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:38.909> too<00:01:39.000> expensive

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you can't flex basrah for too expensive

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.149 
you can't flex basrah for too expensive
for<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.200> definitely<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> would<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.130> say

expensive<00:02:17.000> some<00:02:17.390> inexperienced<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:17.960> would<00:02:18.080> not

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
expensive some inexperienced I would not

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.230 
expensive some inexperienced I would not
really<00:02:18.290> recommend<00:02:18.800> this<00:02:18.860> for<00:02:18.980> everybody<00:02:19.490> but

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
it can be I guess sort of cheap if you

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.390 
it can be I guess sort of cheap if you
are<00:02:23.210> to<00:02:23.300> do<00:02:23.420> iron<00:02:23.600> bars<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:24.200> do<00:02:24.290> addy<00:02:24.620> bars<00:02:24.920> but

iron bars out or if you are to put the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.390 
iron bars out or if you are to put the
next<00:02:35.900> thing<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.110> think<00:02:36.200> which<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.380> mithril<00:02:37.220> then

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
next thing I think which is mithril then

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.760 
next thing I think which is mithril then
you<00:02:37.490> need<00:02:37.640> mithril<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.210> coal<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.840> like<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.710> D

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
you need mithril and coal and like a D

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.680 
you need mithril and coal and like a D
and<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.250> addy<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.090> cold<00:02:41.300> stuff<00:02:41.540> like<00:02:41.660> that

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
and the addy and cold stuff like that

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.260 
and the addy and cold stuff like that
it's<00:02:42.590> quite<00:02:42.710> expensive<00:02:42.980> but<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.550> damn<00:02:44.090> in

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
it's quite expensive but it is damn in

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.090 
it's quite expensive but it is damn in
it<00:02:44.390> it's<00:02:44.570> like<00:02:44.660> four<00:02:44.930> or<00:02:45.050> five<00:02:45.080> minutes<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.680> AFK

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
it it's like four or five minutes of AFK

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.940 
it it's like four or five minutes of AFK
and<00:02:46.370> it's<00:02:46.960> 220<00:02:47.960> km<00:02:48.380> in<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.530> experience<00:02:48.800> an

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
and it's 220 km in the experience an

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.330 
and it's 220 km in the experience an
hour<00:02:49.180> if<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.300> do<00:02:50.420> adamant<00:02:50.840> which<00:02:51.140> is<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.410> dig<00:02:52.190> a

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
hour if you do adamant which is a dig a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.280 
hour if you do adamant which is a dig a
deep<00:02:52.490> late<00:02:52.700> blight<00:02:52.820> is<00:02:53.000> about<00:02:53.180> 240<00:02:53.780> k<00:02:53.960> now<00:02:54.140> or

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
deep late blight is about 240 k now or

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.500 
deep late blight is about 240 k now or
250<00:02:54.710> so<00:02:55.340> it's<00:02:55.580> not<00:02:55.670> too<00:02:55.850> much<00:02:55.970> slower<00:02:56.210> but<00:02:56.360> it's

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
250 so it's not too much slower but it's

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.420 
250 so it's not too much slower but it's
completely<00:02:56.600> AFK<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.530> you'll<00:02:57.800> basically<00:02:57.980> love

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
