00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.800
 dear friends today we will talk about 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.120
 such an important part of the chane and actions as 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.220
 water actually water can by 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.359
 cleaning the same value to cassam tea 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.769
 that is, it must be correct

 generally perfect water for tea 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.720
 always in antiquity in china was considered 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.240
 spring water is moreover real 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.520
 tea connoisseurs give mapped 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.570
 springs 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.270
 most suitable for correct 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.530
 brewed tea existed in China 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.420
 an old tradition like that in winter 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:48.390
 collected snow from flowers and then these 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.760
 these snow put in the bank buried 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.670
 the earth was kept 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.160
 until the summer in this got it and on this water 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.129
 brewed tea too get what to understand 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.920
 how attentive was the attitude to 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.340
 water in china and in principle remains among 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.380
 connoisseurs tea now we are the same therefore 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.970
 perfect water for the rogue tea 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.070
 but of course modern 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.860
 residents of the metropolis is not so easy to find 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.060
 good spring and not always convenient to him 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.590
 on him to go on this basically 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.190
 srail and maybe good 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.770
 bottled water proven principle 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.590
 big brands there too shishkin orchestra 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.010
 forest and so on they make good water 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.890
 that's not the tab really need to enjoy 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.850
 tap water 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.120
 You can of course use filtered 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.950
 but experience shows that the 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.850
 central still worse bottled 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.310
 here they want it look bottled 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.690
 the main thing to try it is said and 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.080
 time when it is already so much more 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.320
 try different waters 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.660
 notice the big differences between 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.220
 own different varieties 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.460
 bottled water that is where 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.910
 softness stiffness will then notice 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.009
 thinner taste and aroma and tea because 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.800
 some kind of soft water there on the first 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.830
 opens there Odessa from tea more such 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.740
 so rigidly to this 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.180
 This other person 40 I mean there is 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.280
 different properties 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.850
 that is, thinner and thinner work 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:28.460
 feel the tea itself so I wish everyone 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.460
 pleasant tea drinking of all the best
