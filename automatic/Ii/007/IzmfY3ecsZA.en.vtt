to using our body and our energy if we
want<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.739> think<00:00:59.859> of<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.129> that<00:01:00.280> way<00:01:00.460> as<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:02.050> turns

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
want to think of it that way as it turns

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.500 
want to think of it that way as it turns
us<00:01:02.469> into<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.829> sort<00:01:03.190> of<00:01:03.250> subtle<00:01:03.550> way<00:01:03.850> of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
us into a sort of subtle way of

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.360 
us into a sort of subtle way of
interacting<00:01:05.110> with<00:01:05.320> our<00:01:05.470> own<00:01:05.710> kinesthetic

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
sense and as such is very useful for
