00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.250
 welcome to cake recipe today we are going 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.440
 to make a delicious cupcake 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.260
 orange the ingredients that we're going to 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.230
 use for a mold number 2 are 4 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.540
 large eggs 120 grams of sugar 120 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 grams of flour 40 a teaspoon 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.010
 vanilla essence the zesting of 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.980
 the skin of an orange and a teaspoon 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.840
 of salt butter flours needed for 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.510
 mold 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.980
 to make a delicious syrup with 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.140
 orange flavor 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.360
 We are going to use 200 cubic centimeters 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.700
 of water 50 grams of sugar one 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.610
 teaspoon of vanilla essence and the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.250
 skin of an orange that I fought with a 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.980
 Peel dad the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.650
 is to turn the oven on 180 degrees and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.620
 greased and floured the mold 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.210
 Here I show the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.430
 use is to say half in term and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.760
 As you can see, the first thing that 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.510
 let's make is the syrup we're going to 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.050
 put the water together with the sugar 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.020
 boil 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:14.030
 in a pot the one they have 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.030
 let's light the fire now 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.409
 and when it breaks the boil and is no longer seen 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.540
 sugar in the pot let's turn the 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.060
 fire 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:36.580
 let's add vanilla essence and 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.580
 the box the skin of the orange to house the 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.260
 essence that gives a rich taste to 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.690
 vanilla and the skin of the orange 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.940
 this we are going to leave at least 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.320
 half an hour that's why we did it before 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.410
 the recipe so that it takes a rich flavor on 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.340
 syrup let's say it is well soaked in taste 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.920
 orange 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.070
 well now let's start preparing the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.790
 sponge cake we are going to put in the bowl of 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.740
 the egg blender 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.740
 together with sugar 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.520
 and salt to the maximum speed this 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.650
 shake is very important because it's going to 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.320
 generate the base support of the sponge cake 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.170
 so we must discuss at least 5 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.350
 minutes until it's okay and tripling 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.790
 the volume only gatti 6 in this case the 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.950
 acid has to get to what is called 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.810
 point letters that means that it 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.910
 can make letters or figures with the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.090
 beaten and that these remain drawn 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.400
 without melting 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.550
 for those who did not see my 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.629
 another video of the vanilla cupcake 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.940
 they will see the link as to see what is 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.700
 exactly the same only that it takes us 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.849
 orange zest when I tripled 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.350
 the volume we are going to add the essence 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:01.900
 and the orange zest 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.300
 You can also use essence of 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.020
 orange but good to me I do not like it 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.930
 a lot to use 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.450
 this type of essences like this has a taste 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.670
 quite artificial there are some that are 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.250
 very good but good and be careful 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.790
 the amount they add because they are 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.150
 very strong and now we are going to add 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.610
 all the flour 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.739
 there are two ways to do it this is a 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.340
 way that is very simple and the other is 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.329
 stable as there are in two envelopes 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.220
 integrate the flour with movements 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:36.360
 envelopes that actually that's better 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.970
 will make the milkshake be 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.280
 retain much more air and that the 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.760
 sponge cake then be much higher 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.760
 much more 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.820
 it looks much better but this is a 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.410
 very simple way to do it all 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.030
 next to the blender so good for 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.040
 that the returns we will integrate everything 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.500
 that was left on the walls of the flour and 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.460
 then we are going to fill the mold and this goes 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.130
 to go to the oven for about 30 minutes a 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.460
 180 degree oven 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.190
 much better than one of the 190 about 30 or 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.030
 40 minutes when it's ready you go 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.450
 to see good here I want to show you that 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.750
 the approximately 15 minutes 14 15 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.400
 minutes that they lack of cooking already 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.890
 sponge cake is well high there in the 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.700
 beautiful one looks at her and says wow what 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.930
 cute what is that hunger I have I want 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:35.320
 eat very cute biscuits 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:39.550
 and it reaches almost to the top of the walls 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.840
 But the important thing is more than the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.390
 amount of time that I can them 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.970
 to get to say is that they look at two 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.490
 things one is that the cake is already 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.170
 separated from the walls of the mold that already 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.610
 that is going to indicate that it is ready and what 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.180
 second is to use a toothpick 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:58.370
 skewer that almost comes out dry the stick 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.460
 if it does not come out wet mass it is because it is already 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.940
 when we remove it, let's leave it 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.660
 cool down we're going to take it apart and we're going to 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.600
 add the syrup now is important 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.280
 keep in mind that if we are going to have the 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.100
 biscuit what is already cold the syrup 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.229
 it has to be hot and if instead 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.699
 if we want to use the cold syrup the 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.220
 sponge cake and it has to be hot 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.530
 this is done so that it does not get soaked 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.740
 the sponge cake and it really is very 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.889
 rich and 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.870
 as one likes to eat what is less 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:38.259
 fascinates this very rich sponge like this 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:41.319
 moist but no soup looks like this 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:43.270
 so well here it's ready ideal for 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:46.810
 the kids snack for tea with 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.780
 friends for is done in less than an hour 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.479
 in less than an hour they have ready they have 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:56.680
 solved a delicious sponge cake of what 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:06:00.190
 it is already done like this with very much followed and it is 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.690
