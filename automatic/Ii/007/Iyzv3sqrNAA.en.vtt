00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:07.540
 very good vignette is that such today 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.480
 I bring an explanatory video with a little 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.590
 because a lot of people have asked me 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:18.700
 how do you step the videos that you recorded from the 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.800
 PSs lose 4 to a pendrive though 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.480
 it seems easy many people leave other 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.180
 so many do not know it then they have 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:30.170
 asked that if as I do not 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.410
 I put back that any game this 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.410
 same 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.500
 and now I explain how it's done 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.290
 and the first thing we're going to make clear is 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.610
 is to record the game 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.510
 logically good yes no 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:51.110
 of love what I have put so that 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:56.180
 concrete cotton be twice black 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.830
 flag in the corner you have to be 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.590
 I'm not going to record this bit any more 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.370
 for what 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.690
 so you can see how it is done now 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.860
 we give again you load video clips 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.780
 and saved very well 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.780
 we wait for moment to load 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:25.850
 very well we already have it 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.850
 we left we left the video game 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:37.280
 we go out and go to 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.750
 adjustments we give you management adjustments of 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.750
 storage of systems 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.880
 the capture gallery that we get then 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.030
 both the videos and the photos that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.270
 let's share 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:56.350
 velocity here now we give the button 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.320
 options and up here you see sale copy 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.000
 USB storage device you 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.740
 we give 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.290
 we select and copy 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.960
 to accept 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.890
 and it's that easy 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.980
 is good copy this own occupies little and 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:20.580
 I also do not usually take half an hour 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.510
 or so the videos of 15 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.390
 15 13 minutes are you occupy about tard 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.990
 that and good and it's already we have 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.690
 the video in the pen and it's already out 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.700
 and we put it where we want and already what 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.530
 We can see 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.080
 so nothing friends I hope that I have 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.360
