 he wants to become a Dutch champion 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.399
 to 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:15.469

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:20.710
 started well 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.710
 in the second round it went wrong for gervinho 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.330

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.590

 I'm not sitting there 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.670
 but I have been very sick of it because again completely as occurred 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.660
 have trained well 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.150
 and then losing in such a way was a bit of bad luck, I think so 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.430
 it happens in the 6th 7th under the carport say 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.510
 but 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.040
 so the first round went on Nijmegen knew nothing to say below 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.540
 happened in the second round 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540

 for it is obtained with in households 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.200
 the striking thing about this party is Sunday 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.039
 that the landlord went to see 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.530

 there was a strange story for promoting it is about their work 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.190
 immigrants and here he asks of me 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.490
 I said to take the promoter if you better give that man another 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.870
 I do it myself 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.920
 Paris wants so badly clashed 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.050
 to reach politics 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.180
 that you surrender money yes 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.710

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:26.230
 technically good 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.230
 This means that the competent facilitate 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.649
 it is not that you are standing here a whistle that is said I am the best 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:40.649

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.729
 if they are the students that you did better than me 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:48.599
 but I do the commercial policy everything is done an action 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.599
 and the match if you then we lose 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.469
