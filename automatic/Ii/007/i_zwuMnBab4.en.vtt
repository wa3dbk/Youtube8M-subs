00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
the few that I seem to like just because

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.520 
the few that I seem to like just because
main<00:02:35.640> reasons<00:02:35.970> because<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.420> had<00:02:36.569> black<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.870> my

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
main reasons because it had black and my

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.930 
main reasons because it had black and my

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
phones locked so just goes into the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.970 
phones locked so just goes into the
black<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.420> looks<00:02:39.599> natural<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.769> phone

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
black so it looks natural with the phone
