00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
gradually with the beats matching up go

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.270 
gradually with the beats matching up go
into<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> next<00:01:03.480> song<00:01:03.690> okay<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.530> here's<00:01:04.890> what

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
all I can already see the tempo not

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.469 
all I can already see the tempo not
matching<00:02:08.709> up<00:02:08.829> already<00:02:09.220> you<00:02:09.429> see<00:02:10.119> these<00:02:10.299> are

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
matching up already you see these are

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.000 
matching up already you see these are
pretty<00:02:10.660> close<00:02:10.929> temples<00:02:11.470> but<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.709> can<00:02:11.829> see

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
pretty close temples but you can see

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.289 
pretty close temples but you can see
that<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.250> snare<00:02:12.489> drum<00:02:12.670> right<00:02:12.849> here<00:02:13.180> is

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
that the snare drum right here is

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.000 
that the snare drum right here is
already<00:02:13.840> starting<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.260> be<00:02:14.319> out<00:02:14.500> only<00:02:14.799> after

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
already starting to be out only after

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.940 
already starting to be out only after
like<00:02:15.489> half<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.910> bar<00:02:16.150> half<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:17.049> measure<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.530> look

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
like half a bar half a measure and look

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.979 
like half a bar half a measure and look
it's<00:02:18.069> even<00:02:18.190> at<00:02:18.430> more<00:02:18.670> as<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:18.970> go<00:02:19.090> across<00:02:19.180> these

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
it's even at more as you go across these

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.289 
it's even at more as you go across these
dark<00:02:20.410> pulses<00:02:20.980> are<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.430> snare<00:02:21.670> drum<00:02:21.880> beats<00:02:22.090> and

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
dark pulses are the snare drum beats and

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.539 
dark pulses are the snare drum beats and
generally<00:02:22.810> they're<00:02:23.019> on<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.500> beat<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:24.430> can

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
generally they're on the beat you can

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:25.890 
generally they're on the beat you can
see<00:02:24.700> they're<00:02:24.850> getting<00:02:24.910> wider<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.389> wider<00:02:25.540> as

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
see they're getting wider and wider as

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.020 
see they're getting wider and wider as
you<00:02:25.930> go<00:02:26.019> across<00:02:26.319> that's<00:02:26.950> because<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.670> tempo

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
you go across that's because the tempo

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.750 
you go across that's because the tempo
is<00:02:28.209> not<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.630> same<00:02:29.040> now<00:02:30.040> when<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.370> do<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.489> mix

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
is not the same now when you do a mix

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.520 
is not the same now when you do a mix
tape<00:02:30.970> sort<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.359> thing<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.959> don't<00:02:32.139> have<00:02:32.380> to

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
tape sort of thing you don't have to

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.650 
tape sort of thing you don't have to
have<00:02:32.650> exactly<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.280> same<00:02:33.310> tempo<00:02:33.970> got<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.600> be

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
have exactly the same tempo got to be

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.479 
have exactly the same tempo got to be
close<00:02:34.900> but<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.560> doesn't<00:02:35.769> have<00:02:35.859> to<00:02:35.920> be<00:02:36.040> exact

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
close but it doesn't have to be exact

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.759 
close but it doesn't have to be exact

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.110 
here this pulse right here that is on
the<00:03:20.310> downbeat<00:03:20.969> right<00:03:21.840> here<00:03:22.489> see<00:03:23.489> that<00:03:23.640> here<00:03:24.030> it

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
the downbeat right here see that here it

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.020 
the downbeat right here see that here it
is<00:03:24.150> again<00:03:24.920> yeah<00:03:25.920> right<00:03:26.280> here<00:03:26.609> that's<00:03:26.849> a

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
downbeat so I want that pulse to line up

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.429 
downbeat so I want that pulse to line up
with<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.719> pulse<00:03:31.109> right<00:03:31.709> here<00:03:32.540> okay<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:34.079> I'm

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
with this pulse right here okay so I'm

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.080 
with this pulse right here okay so I'm
again<00:03:34.889> said<00:03:35.159> you<00:03:35.250> got<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.400> use<00:03:35.519> your<00:03:35.549> ears<00:03:35.819> for

this stuff it's easy to get a piece of

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.110 
this stuff it's easy to get a piece of
software<00:03:38.069> to<00:03:38.159> do<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.370> for<00:03:38.549> you<00:03:38.639> but<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:38.939> want

that I use my time shift tool to move

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.780 
that I use my time shift tool to move
over<00:03:45.510> piece<00:03:46.230> number<00:03:46.379> two<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.280> pulse<00:03:47.519> is

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
over piece number two so the pulse is

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.470 
over piece number two so the pulse is
lined<00:03:48.030> up<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:49.230> I'm<00:03:49.319> using<00:03:49.470> my<00:03:49.650> um<00:03:49.950> my<00:03:50.299> in<00:03:51.299> and

right there on that pulse so it's right

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.060 
right there on that pulse so it's right
there<00:04:39.330> me<00:04:39.930> zoom<00:04:40.169> back<00:04:40.320> out<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.560> bit<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:40.889> little
