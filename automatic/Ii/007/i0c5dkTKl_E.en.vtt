00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.680 
drywall to wood studs and it's a it's a
very<00:00:04.589> simple<00:00:05.100> process<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:06.060> if<00:00:06.299> you're<00:00:06.420> doing

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
very simple process and if you're doing

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.570 
very simple process and if you're doing
full<00:00:07.020> sheets<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.379> drywall<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:08.280> want<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.490> make

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
full sheets of drywall you want to make

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.520 
full sheets of drywall you want to make
sure<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.210> beveled<00:00:09.900> edges<00:00:10.080> you're<00:00:10.380> going

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
sure that the beveled edges you're going

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.110 
sure that the beveled edges you're going
to<00:00:10.590> have<00:00:10.679> two<00:00:10.950> sides<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.460> have<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> beveled

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
to have two sides that have a beveled

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.669 
to have two sides that have a beveled
edge<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.450> want<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.660> buck<00:00:12.870> those<00:00:13.049> together<00:00:13.259> and

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
edge you want to buck those together and

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.799 
edge you want to buck those together and
put<00:00:14.099> your<00:00:14.250> full<00:00:14.429> sheets<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.000> those<00:00:15.269> edges

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
put your full sheets so that those edges

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.500 
put your full sheets so that those edges
are<00:00:16.020> easy<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.470> tape<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.890> compound<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:18.330> this

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
are easy to tape and compound in this

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.420 
are easy to tape and compound in this
case<00:00:18.779> we're<00:00:19.050> doing<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.560> repair<00:00:19.949> here<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
case we're doing a repair here in the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.490 
case we're doing a repair here in the
middle<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.850> section<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.359> drywall<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.350> we're

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
middle of section of drywall so we're

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.230 
middle of section of drywall so we're
going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.830> edges<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.490> aren't<00:00:23.760> beveled

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
going to have edges that aren't beveled

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.170 
going to have edges that aren't beveled
and<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.869> trick<00:00:25.609> when<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.730> break<00:00:27.029> your

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
and one trick when you break your

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.750 
and one trick when you break your
drywall<00:00:27.420> sometimes<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.490> seam<00:00:29.490> of

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
drywall sometimes you have a seam of

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.580 
drywall sometimes you have a seam of
paper<00:00:30.060> that's<00:00:30.420> sticking<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.500> can

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
paper that's sticking up and you can

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.950 
paper that's sticking up and you can
just<00:00:31.740> take<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.949> real<00:00:32.250> sharp<00:00:32.610> nice<00:00:32.910> knife<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
just take a real sharp nice knife and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.010 
just take a real sharp nice knife and
just<00:00:34.410> come<00:00:34.649> down<00:00:34.890> at<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.700> 45<00:00:35.730> degree<00:00:36.360> angle<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
just come down at a 45 degree angle and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.810 
just come down at a 45 degree angle and
you<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.170> take<00:00:37.500> off<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.920> excess<00:00:38.280> paper<00:00:38.550> if<00:00:38.790> you

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you can take off the excess paper if you

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.340 
you can take off the excess paper if you
have<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.210> way<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> makes<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.840> easier<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
have it that way it makes it easier to

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.760 
have it that way it makes it easier to
compound<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.850> if<00:00:42.180> you're<00:00:42.570> replacing<00:00:43.530> or<00:00:43.710> if

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
compound but if you're replacing or if

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.069 
compound but if you're replacing or if
you're<00:00:43.890> doing<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.250> section<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.789> repair<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.480> great

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
you're doing a section of repair a great

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.380 
you're doing a section of repair a great
tool<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> stud<00:00:47.100> finder<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.730> trying<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> find

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
tool is a stud finder and trying to find

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.660 
tool is a stud finder and trying to find
the<00:00:48.510> middle<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.050> these<00:00:49.260> two<00:00:49.500> by<00:00:49.649> fours<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.280> in

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the middle of these two by fours and in

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.360 
the middle of these two by fours and in
this<00:00:50.760> case<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.780> one<00:00:52.500> too<00:00:52.649> much<00:00:52.770> work<00:00:53.010> here

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
this case we have one too much work here

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.920 
this case we have one too much work here
and<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.180> side<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.510> actually<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and on this side we actually get it

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.569 
and on this side we actually get it
double<00:00:55.230> two<00:00:55.350> by<00:00:55.500> fours<00:00:55.739> because<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.250> window

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
double two by fours because the window

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.549 
double two by fours because the window
and<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> closet<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.109> very<00:00:58.320> easy

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and the closet here so this is very easy

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.040 
and the closet here so this is very easy
we've<00:00:58.829> got<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> full<00:00:59.370> piece<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.760> wood<00:00:59.940> here<00:01:00.300> but

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
we've got a full piece of wood here but

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.920 
we've got a full piece of wood here but
in<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.230> case<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.890> most<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> area<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.870> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
in this case in most of the area of the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.020 
in this case in most of the area of the
wall<00:01:04.199> you're<00:01:04.439> gonna<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.860> two<00:01:05.220> by<00:01:05.369> four<00:01:05.610> studs

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
wall you're gonna have two by four studs

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.250 
wall you're gonna have two by four studs
every<00:01:06.840> 16<00:01:07.320> inches<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:08.340> center<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:10.110> want

every 16 inches on center and you want

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.750 
every 16 inches on center and you want
to<00:01:10.320> make<00:01:10.439> sure<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> cut<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.310> straight

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
to make sure that you cut that straight

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.520 
to make sure that you cut that straight
down<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.390> we're<00:01:12.570> catching<00:01:13.049> our<00:01:13.110> screw

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
down so that we're catching our screw

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.910 
down so that we're catching our screw
about<00:01:13.830> 3/8<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> get<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> nice<00:01:16.530> tight

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
about 3/8 in so you get a nice tight

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.910 
about 3/8 in so you get a nice tight
hold<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.450> cut<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:18.840> drywall<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.710> have

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
hold so you cut your drywall you have

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.399 
hold so you cut your drywall you have
your<00:01:20.360> rate<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.509> your<00:01:21.600> piece<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.170> already

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
your rate of your piece that's already

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.740 
your rate of your piece that's already
here<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.580> trimmed<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
here you have it trimmed out so that

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.410 
here you have it trimmed out so that
your<00:01:24.960> drywall<00:01:25.259> fits<00:01:25.770> nice<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.430> would<00:01:26.939> cut<00:01:27.299> it

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
your drywall fits nice I would cut it

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.660 
your drywall fits nice I would cut it
just<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:28.200> short<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.040> bottom

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
just a little short on the bottom

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.380 
just a little short on the bottom
in<00:01:29.970> case<00:01:30.240> there's<00:01:30.540> some<00:01:30.900> expansion<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:32.939> it'll

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
in case there's some expansion and it'll

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.370 
in case there's some expansion and it'll
be<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.659> little<00:01:33.960> bit<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.170> room<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.880> move

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
be a little bit of room for that move

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.719 
be a little bit of room for that move
and<00:01:37.380> once<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.009> place<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.610> want

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and once you have it in place you want

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.539 
and once you have it in place you want
to<00:01:38.909> recess<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.810> head<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> screw<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
to recess the head of the screw so a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.690 
to recess the head of the screw so a
great<00:01:41.880> tool<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> drill<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:44.009> an<00:01:44.220> adjustable

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
great tool is a drill with an adjustable

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.460 
great tool is a drill with an adjustable
clutch<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.479> will<00:01:45.659> adjust<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> amount<00:01:46.409> of

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
clutch so this will adjust the amount of

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.399 
clutch so this will adjust the amount of
force<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.750> screw<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.020> don't<00:01:49.170> tear

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
force on that screw so you don't tear

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.730 
force on that screw so you don't tear
through<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> face<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.689> drywall<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.380> so

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
through the face of the drywall and so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.789 
through the face of the drywall and so
about<00:01:52.950> 3/8<00:01:53.490> from<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:57.320> you<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.469> hear<00:01:58.619> how

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
about 3/8 from the see you can hear how

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.999 
about 3/8 from the see you can hear how
that<00:01:59.210> all<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.420> releases<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.380> you're<00:02:01.770> just

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
that all that releases and you're just

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.800 
that all that releases and you're just
dipping<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.729> paper<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.659> put

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
dipping the paper so that we can put

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.139 
dipping the paper so that we can put
some<00:02:03.960> compound<00:02:04.439> over<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> top<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.820> in

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
some compound over the top of this so in

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.910 
some compound over the top of this so in
this<00:02:06.270> case<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.689> would<00:02:06.750> probably<00:02:07.020> put<00:02:07.409> my<00:02:07.530> screws

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
this case I would probably put my screws

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.490 
this case I would probably put my screws
about<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> foot<00:02:08.970> apart<00:02:09.060> if<00:02:09.929> you're<00:02:10.170> working<00:02:10.349> on

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
about a foot apart if you're working on

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.350 
about a foot apart if you're working on
a<00:02:10.590> full<00:02:10.860> sheet<00:02:11.160> you'd<00:02:11.430> probably<00:02:11.700> space<00:02:12.150> them

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
a full sheet you'd probably space them

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.559 
a full sheet you'd probably space them
about<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> foot<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.230> half

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
about a foot and a half

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.679 
about a foot and a half
and<00:02:13.749> no<00:02:13.959> further<00:02:14.290> than<00:02:14.829> two<00:02:15.159> feet<00:02:15.459> apart<00:02:15.700> but

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
and no further than two feet apart but

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:17.580 
and no further than two feet apart but
that's<00:02:16.840> all<00:02:16.989> there<00:02:17.049> is<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.349> it

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
that's all there is to it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.209 
that's all there is to it
very<00:02:17.950> simple<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.549> do<00:02:18.730> you're<00:02:19.420> just<00:02:19.599> going<00:02:19.840> to

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
very simple to do you're just going to

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:31.259 
very simple to do you're just going to
put<00:02:21.219> your<00:02:21.400> screws<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:29.639> and<00:02:30.639> we<00:02:30.790> just<00:02:31.030> want<00:02:31.180> to

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
put your screws in and we just want to

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.300 
put your screws in and we just want to
dip<00:02:31.480> lit<00:02:31.659> if<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.930> tear<00:02:32.260> through<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.920> face<00:02:33.129> of

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
dip lit if you tear through the face of

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.699 
dip lit if you tear through the face of
the<00:02:33.370> paper<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:35.019> would<00:02:35.139> want<00:02:35.379> to<00:02:35.439> put<00:02:35.620> an

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
the paper you would want to put an

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.000 
the paper you would want to put an
additional<00:02:36.159> screw<00:02:36.459> about<00:02:36.609> two<00:02:37.209> inches<00:02:37.540> away

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
additional screw about two inches away

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.009 
additional screw about two inches away
because<00:02:42.150> if<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.299> tear<00:02:43.540> through<00:02:43.659> the<00:02:43.780> paper

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
because if you tear through the paper

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.170 
because if you tear through the paper
but<00:02:44.530> it's<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.769> easy<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.400> put<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.819> piece<00:02:46.030> of

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
but it's that easy to put a piece of

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.330 
but it's that easy to put a piece of
drywall<00:02:46.450> in<00:02:46.959> now<00:02:47.799> if<00:02:47.889> you<00:02:47.980> just<00:02:48.129> have<00:02:48.310> a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
drywall in now if you just have a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.520 
drywall in now if you just have a
regular<00:02:48.549> drill<00:02:49.060> one<00:02:49.540> thing<00:02:49.719> to<00:02:49.959> do<00:02:50.169> is<00:02:50.319> run

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
regular drill one thing to do is run

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.559 
regular drill one thing to do is run
down<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.099> hardware<00:02:51.430> store<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:52.030> they<00:02:52.329> have

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
down to the hardware store and they have

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.349 
down to the hardware store and they have
these<00:02:52.810> drill<00:02:53.199> bits<00:02:53.439> that<00:02:53.680> are<00:02:53.859> Diplo's<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.609> so

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
these drill bits that are Diplo's and so

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.849 
these drill bits that are Diplo's and so
we<00:02:55.480> just<00:02:55.659> attach<00:02:56.019> this<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.560> have<00:02:56.739> this

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
we just attach this and I have this

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.509 
we just attach this and I have this
black<00:02:57.239> standard<00:02:58.239> setting<00:02:58.689> and<00:02:58.870> when<00:02:59.769> we<00:02:59.949> push

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
black standard setting and when we push

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.449 
black standard setting and when we push
this<00:03:00.730> into<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.209> drywall<00:03:02.069> it's<00:03:03.069> going<00:03:03.370> to

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
this into the drywall it's going to

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.439 
this into the drywall it's going to
release<00:03:03.760> on<00:03:04.000> its<00:03:04.150> own<00:03:05.129> and<00:03:06.129> it's<00:03:06.909> going<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.239> dip

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:07.449 
release on its own and it's going to dip

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:09.509 
release on its own and it's going to dip
let's<00:03:07.689> dip<00:03:07.989> look<00:03:08.169> for<00:03:08.379> us<00:03:08.469> so<00:03:08.949> doesn't<00:03:09.430> nice

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
let's dip look for us so doesn't nice

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.909 
let's dip look for us so doesn't nice
job<00:03:09.760> nice<00:03:10.209> little<00:03:10.540> tool<00:03:10.930> as<00:03:11.109> you<00:03:11.139> can<00:03:11.319> get<00:03:11.469> so

if you're doing repairing drywall it's

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.199 
if you're doing repairing drywall it's
really<00:03:13.989> easy<00:03:14.169> to<00:03:14.349> fasten<00:03:14.949> it<00:03:15.069> and<00:03:15.219> drywall<00:03:16.150> is

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
really easy to fasten it and drywall is

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.390 
really easy to fasten it and drywall is
very<00:03:16.480> forgiving<00:03:17.109> so<00:03:17.560> if<00:03:17.829> you<00:03:17.949> don't<00:03:18.189> make

very forgiving so if you don't make

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.119 
very forgiving so if you don't make
perfect<00:03:18.909> cuts<00:03:19.209> like<00:03:19.449> this<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:20.590> know<00:03:20.709> don't<00:03:21.009> be

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
perfect cuts like this you know don't be

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.649 
perfect cuts like this you know don't be
nervous<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.909> finished<00:03:22.150> product<00:03:22.540> isn't

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659 
nervous that the finished product isn't

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.089 
nervous that the finished product isn't
going<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.019> look<00:03:23.169> good<00:03:23.319> as<00:03:23.500> soon<00:03:23.680> as<00:03:23.769> we<00:03:23.859> put

going to look good as soon as we put

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.490

compound and tape over this you'll never

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.080 
compound and tape over this you'll never
know<00:03:26.680> there<00:03:26.889> was<00:03:26.979> a<00:03:27.009> senior<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:27.729> you'll<00:03:27.909> get<00:03:28.030> a
