00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.470
 whatever you want to call it, and 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:43.299

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:46.540
 kemkers tales from every case devices and 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.250

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.670
 Steffen from the cliff is doing me 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.519
 to meet 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.780
 I am absolute damon fendel because of that 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.320
 He wants to hit the cliff 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.120
 crash and I have now at paris as 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.790
 stefan and damon because it too 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.200
 there are books and its from the cliff 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.640
 help to fall 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:12.069
 then I have two more videos in that 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:14.849
 what he is and yes, okay, it's easy 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.849
 because it is easy 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.819
 ok i will marry this 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.079
 I will marry then that is 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:29.670
 but I would say so too 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:33.620
 ok be his kiss and jan kempf from 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.620
 The cliff does not overthrow everything 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.299
 so far it was still quite 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:55.159
 I think it's really cool 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:57.810
 good next 30 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.700
 I'll say it will be easy and simple 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.010
 then something like that comes 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.730
 and then we also noticed that 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.340
 now called 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.810
 the call now ok so we go the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.760
 times by ko I'm actually totally 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.859
 okay i do not like dirt often 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.780
 I mean, it always has that one 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.430
 wants to rely so much but makes everyone 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.650
 mother but so in recent movies 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.720
 also and list books is just there 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.970
 does one understand why that is so and 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.159
 that's why for you but i can neither 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.800
 This still fall wildly off the cliff 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.510
 ok break, I'm very sorry it does 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.020
 I'm sorry but I have to suppress that 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:46.470
 crashed by the bridge from the cliff 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:51.389
 and so then I still daytrader myself 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:54.510
 can i marry my okay okay alright 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:58.500
 Well, I say on days kiss and want 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.909
 marry because is just fine and this 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.690
 look at the characters 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:05.010
 So it was up to me to decide 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.840
 Did you read me for who you are 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.599
 you i can not decide me 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.300
 have books read every basket of Anglo 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.949
 body prince and klop has princess and 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.490
 I can not decide 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:19.740
 not easy not even one has 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.520
 yes, you still have such a tendency 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.560
 usually 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.490
 I think for example in thinking and 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.370
 Steffen has my tendency to do so Jacob 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:34.470
 and edward we also have a trend 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:35.729
 and but why from the series a thanks 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.810
 I can not decide 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:41.840
 I do not have one and one after 208 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.889
 Yes, okay 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:52.620
 edward cullen from twilight I am and 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:53.870
 dl from games the cat empire bay and 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.740
 Jacob black 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.800
 okay there's actually pretty easy 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:08.580
 due i will marry a little bit 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:11.190
 So I'm holding on to something like that 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.300
 but it is okay to find no words 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.099
 I will have something of mine, I think 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.419
 now easy and then red and Jacob 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:20.310
 okay i will directly christmann of the 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.060
 cliff fall because I was always more 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.880
 to be bought 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:30.199

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.009
 different 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:54.599
 in the biggest damon fan and think so 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:57.319

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:57.319

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:09.540
 I do not like him actually from the 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.830
 cliff crashed and harry is cut 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.630
 although if i hang from the cliff 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.770
 could crash too 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.920
 somehow with magic again 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.950
 but no matter I support the cliff yes 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.110
 what we do not do 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:24.080
 i hope you have discovered and discovered 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.340
 once said whether or not 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.110
 completely different things I would say 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.790
 somehow totally on this day too 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.250
 could still do for series then 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.630
 I also spontaneous and glasses liars 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.000

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.770
 and even if there I have then and still 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.590
 to bring in many other series 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.700
 It's cool too, though he does 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.100
 I can not stop myself anymore 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.870
 I hope you have this one 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:49.460
 fallen day and that maybe we 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.460
