much<00:02:17.410> they're<00:02:17.740> too<00:02:18.099> bulky<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.750> same<00:02:20.530> goes<00:02:20.560> for

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
much they're too bulky and same goes for

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.650 
much they're too bulky and same goes for
video<00:02:21.280> some<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:22.030> them

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
video some of them

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.920 
video some of them
really<00:02:22.990> are<00:02:23.170> optimized<00:02:23.770> as<00:02:23.920> well<00:02:24.130> for<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:24.520> so

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
really are optimized as well for that so

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.650 
really are optimized as well for that so
it's<00:02:25.930> hard<00:02:25.990> to<00:02:26.200> find<00:02:26.560> breaking<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.970> rig<00:02:28.420> down

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
it's hard to find breaking it a rig down

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.070 
it's hard to find breaking it a rig down
into<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.620> form<00:02:30.070> factor<00:02:30.460> that<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.820> both<00:02:31.060> good<00:02:31.840> for

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
into a form factor that is both good for

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.790 
into a form factor that is both good for
video<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.630> for<00:02:34.810> stills<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.530> wanted

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
video and and for stills and I wanted

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.830 
video and and for stills and I wanted
something<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.400> could<00:02:36.850> fit<00:02:37.120> into<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.360> camera

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
something that I could fit into a camera

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.920 
something that I could fit into a camera
bag<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.350> like<00:02:38.890> go<00:02:39.130> downtown<00:02:39.640> with<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.210> still

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
bag and like go downtown with and still

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.770 
bag and like go downtown with and still
be<00:02:41.290> able<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.430> use<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:42.760> as<00:02:42.850> stills<00:02:43.180> camera<00:02:43.390> and

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
be able to use that as stills camera and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.500 
be able to use that as stills camera and
do<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.860> know<00:02:44.980> be<00:02:45.160> very<00:02:45.370> free<00:02:45.640> with<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.940> at<00:02:46.390> the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
do you know be very free with it at the

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.990 
do you know be very free with it at the
same<00:02:46.660> time<00:02:46.900> have<00:02:47.230> enough<00:02:47.560> stability<00:02:48.490> there

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
same time have enough stability there

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.710 
same time have enough stability there
and<00:02:49.210> wait<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:50.260> also<00:02:51.070> shoot<00:02:51.820> some<00:02:52.090> some<00:02:52.510> great

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
and wait to also shoot some some great

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.420 
and wait to also shoot some some great
video<00:02:52.990> and<00:02:53.200> not<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.560> thats<00:02:53.800> really<00:02:54.130> shaky

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
video and not have thats really shaky

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.230 
video and not have thats really shaky
nasty<00:02:55.000> look<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.840> we<00:02:55.960> see<00:02:56.110> way<00:02:56.230> too<00:02:56.290> much<00:02:56.560> of

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
nasty look that we see way too much of

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.460 
nasty look that we see way too much of
so<00:02:58.240> I<00:02:58.270> kind<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.510> put<00:02:58.690> together<00:02:58.960> this<00:02:59.200> this

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
so I kind of put together this this

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.990 
so I kind of put together this this
little<00:02:59.740> burg<00:02:59.860> right<00:03:00.070> here<00:03:00.540> very<00:03:01.540> simple

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
little burg right here very simple

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.940 
little burg right here very simple
really<00:03:04.000> really<00:03:04.300> easy<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.750> tear<00:03:04.960> down<00:03:06.240> like<00:03:07.240> so

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
really really easy to tear down like so

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.470 
really really easy to tear down like so
you<00:03:08.950> just<00:03:09.130> stick<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.490> whole<00:03:09.700> thing<00:03:09.970> take<00:03:10.270> the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
you just stick this whole thing take the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.510 
you just stick this whole thing take the
viewfinder<00:03:11.410> off<00:03:11.530> stick<00:03:11.770> it<00:03:11.890> into<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.100> carrot

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
viewfinder off stick it into a carrot

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.040 
viewfinder off stick it into a carrot
bag<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.870> it's<00:03:14.260> very<00:03:14.650> small<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:16.360> we'll<00:03:16.600> just<00:03:16.810> go

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
bag and it's very small so we'll just go

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.410 
bag and it's very small so we'll just go
ahead<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.230> walk<00:03:17.470> right<00:03:17.740> through<00:03:17.800> each<00:03:18.160> piece

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
ahead and walk right through each piece

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.450 
ahead and walk right through each piece
the<00:03:19.420> first<00:03:19.690> thing<00:03:20.020> let<00:03:20.860> me<00:03:20.920> take<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.190> handle

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
the first thing let me take the handle

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.740 
the first thing let me take the handle
off<00:03:21.580> here<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.010> first<00:03:24.520> thing<00:03:24.790> is<00:03:25.000> the

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
off here the the first thing is the

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.440 
off here the the first thing is the
plate<00:03:26.320> that's<00:03:26.560> underneath<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.190> camera<00:03:27.550> on

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
plate that's underneath the camera on

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.100 
plate that's underneath the camera on
the<00:03:28.690> 70<00:03:29.050> here<00:03:29.260> it's<00:03:29.520> red<00:03:30.520> rocks<00:03:30.840> mount<00:03:31.840> plate

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
the 70 here it's red rocks mount plate

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.010 
the 70 here it's red rocks mount plate
that<00:03:32.380> comes<00:03:32.560> with<00:03:32.860> their<00:03:33.040> shoulder<00:03:33.490> mount<00:03:34.020> rig

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
that comes with their shoulder mount rig

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.880 
that comes with their shoulder mount rig
and<00:03:36.660> another<00:03:37.660> thing<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:37.959> could<00:03:38.170> do<00:03:38.350> is<00:03:38.380> put<00:03:38.860> a

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
and another thing you could do is put a

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.860 
and another thing you could do is put a
quick<00:03:39.250> release<00:03:39.430> between<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.270> camera<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.690> the

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
quick release between the camera and the

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.690 
quick release between the camera and the
plate<00:03:41.320> that<00:03:41.560> will<00:03:41.680> not<00:03:41.860> only<00:03:42.040> raise<00:03:42.459> the

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
plate that will not only raise the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.000 
plate that will not only raise the
camera<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> little<00:03:43.180> more<00:03:43.570> so<00:03:44.500> if<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:44.680> wanted<00:03:44.920> to

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
camera a little more so if you wanted to

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.890 
camera a little more so if you wanted to
put<00:03:45.130> like<00:03:45.310> some<00:03:45.820> kind<00:03:46.090> of<00:03:46.120> gear<00:03:46.420> on<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:46.780> or

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
put like some kind of gear on it or

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.090 
put like some kind of gear on it or
something<00:03:47.700> that's<00:03:48.700> handy<00:03:49.120> but<00:03:49.270> it'll<00:03:49.540> also

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
something that's handy but it'll also

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.550 
something that's handy but it'll also
give<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:51.970> not<00:03:52.120> make<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.690> possible<00:03:53.020> for<00:03:53.350> you

give you a not make it possible for you
to<00:03:53.590> pull<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:53.920> camera<00:03:54.070> off<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.430> put<00:03:54.550> it<00:03:54.670> on<00:03:54.790> a

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
to pull the camera off and put it on a

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.540 
to pull the camera off and put it on a
tripod<00:03:55.620> for<00:03:56.620> me<00:03:56.770> this<00:03:56.920> works<00:03:57.190> really<00:03:57.400> well

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
tripod for me this works really well

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.250 
tripod for me this works really well
because<00:03:57.940> again<00:03:58.360> I<00:03:58.390> just<00:03:58.660> want<00:03:58.840> something<00:03:59.050> I

can fit into the camera bag what I do

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.120 
can fit into the camera bag what I do
like<00:04:02.380> about<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.739> plate<00:04:03.070> is<00:04:03.100> there's<00:04:03.610> two
