00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello everybody, let's continue 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.799
 integration tutorials 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.170
 with the database but she this 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.719
 tutorial we are going to create our function 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.929
 that will make the connection with our 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.119
 database as well here below 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.539
 our upgrade function 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:27.590
 let's create a new one with the new voith 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:38.690
 She does not have to return anything and we're going 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:38.690
 rename it as connecting to Serbian 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:49.070
 it will need a string of type 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.010
 connection line 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.010
 ready we already have our job done and 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.420
 here what we need we need 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:29.940
 that our connection, which is our 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:42.890
 connection is equal to new but that it 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:47.550
 connection connection line 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.110
 That's it, and now it's sparta 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.110
 this is enough 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.360
 connection ' an open point 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:16.360
 this with this from here we can 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.540
 connect to our to our database 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.290
 and how we need to call this 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:33.910
 connection only once 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:36.330
 we can come here o equal to it the line 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.330
 of connection 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.519
 well now let's do a test of 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.620
 connection to see if we can 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:50.459
 connect with our database 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.459
 I'm here with my haydee open and 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:10.850
 let's check the connection processes looks 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:14.330
 I am with two processes a process is 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:19.100
 of the raid and another process that I am 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:22.400
 using here more than the border 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.870
 I'll turn it off or upgrade here. 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.260
 now it has only touched on a process connected 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.840
 so come on, I'll do a test here. 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:44.150
 at this point of connection I'm going to give one of 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:46.700
 buggy buggy and connected only point log 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:53.240
 to see if it really was connected 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:55.370
 or not save the good back to me is 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.360
 unit beauty 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.060
 let's not play that first let's go 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.300
 check here or update here 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.530
 again processes 1 in only one 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:14.080
 process 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:20.510
 and I'll connect that now clown connected 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:25.600
 and see who has two processes now 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:29.770
 I came here and take the player and I saw that 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.770
 I asked to update a process 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:39.340
 good staff connected to our bank 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:41.330
 data all running perfectly 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.220
 until now 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.220
 get connected in the next tutorial videos
