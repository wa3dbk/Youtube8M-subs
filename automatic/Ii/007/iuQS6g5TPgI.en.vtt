00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
okay this is how you start your crosses

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.070 
okay this is how you start your crosses
with<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.380> starting<00:00:04.830> knot<00:00:05.359> what<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.390> do<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:06.930> go

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
with a starting knot what I do is I go

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.410 
with a starting knot what I do is I go
through<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.680> second<00:00:07.980> one<00:00:08.069> first<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:09.059> second

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
through the second one first the second

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.560 
through the second one first the second
cross<00:00:10.400> this<00:00:11.400> way<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.670> don't<00:00:11.910> have<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.360> much

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
cross this way I don't have that much

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.880 
cross this way I don't have that much
string<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.610> weave<00:00:14.610> across<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.299> top<00:00:15.480> one

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
string to weave across on the top one

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.109 
string to weave across on the top one
so<00:00:16.890> if<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.070> were<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.490> top<00:00:17.670> one<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.970> then

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
so if I were to do the top one and then

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.550 
so if I were to do the top one and then
the<00:00:18.240> second<00:00:18.630> one<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.960> all<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.260> string<00:00:19.529> to

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the second one I have all that string to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.550 
the second one I have all that string to
do<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> second<00:00:20.279> one

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
do on the second one

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:29.620 
do on the second one

but<00:00:30.230> however<00:00:30.500> you<00:00:30.800> do<00:00:31.070> it<00:00:32.829> once<00:00:33.829> you<00:00:33.920> have<00:00:34.160> your

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
but however you do it once you have your

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.600 
but however you do it once you have your
first<00:00:37.510> cross<00:00:38.510> in<00:00:39.010> you<00:00:40.010> need<00:00:40.100> to<00:00:40.190> find<00:00:40.430> where

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
first cross in you need to find where

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.119 
first cross in you need to find where
you're<00:00:40.730> starting<00:00:40.940> that's<00:00:41.210> going<00:00:41.540> to<00:00:41.600> go<00:00:42.129> okay

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
you're starting that's going to go okay

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.259 
you're starting that's going to go okay
if<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:44.239> get<00:00:44.360> your<00:00:44.600> starting<00:00:45.379> knot<00:00:45.530> tied<00:00:46.430> which

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
if you get your starting knot tied which

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.030 
if you get your starting knot tied which
there's<00:00:47.659> a<00:00:47.720> couple<00:00:47.900> ways<00:00:48.019> to<00:00:48.230> do<00:00:48.350> it<00:00:48.379> consult

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
my other videos on how to do that

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.759 
my other videos on how to do that
there's<00:00:50.540> a<00:00:50.600> bulky<00:00:50.960> not<00:00:51.110> in<00:00:51.320> a<00:00:51.409> standard

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
starting knot and I'm sure there's many

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.369 
starting knot and I'm sure there's many
others<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:54.729> like<00:00:55.729> to<00:00:55.850> use<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.210> bulky<00:00:56.510> nut<00:00:56.690> I'm

others I like to use the bulky nut I'm
going<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.620> do<00:00:57.710> that<00:00:57.860> real<00:00:58.070> quick<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:58.750> again<00:00:59.750> if

but<00:01:10.860> however<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.759> do<00:01:11.909> your<00:01:12.060> starting<00:01:12.420> knot

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
but however you do your starting knot

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.840 
but however you do your starting knot
you<00:01:12.689> want<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.930> pull<00:01:13.140> pull<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.250> tight<00:01:14.460> from<00:01:14.640> both

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
you want to pull pull it tight from both

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.240 
you want to pull pull it tight from both
sides<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.539> I'm<00:01:16.289> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.439> do<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.770> use<00:01:17.219> a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
sides so I'm going to do is use a

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.709 
sides so I'm going to do is use a
starting<00:01:17.670> clamp<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.000> hold<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> tail

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
starting clamp to hold on to the tail

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.830 
starting clamp to hold on to the tail
and<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:20.100> pull<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> other<00:01:20.939> side<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.689> my

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and then pull on the other side with my

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.359 
and then pull on the other side with my
hand<00:01:26.179> okay<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:28.200> gets<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.619> bulked<00:01:29.009> up<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
hand okay this gets it bulked up and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.059 
hand okay this gets it bulked up and
tied<00:01:29.909> properly<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.259> tie<00:01:31.439> from<00:01:31.679> just<00:01:31.860> one

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
tied properly if you tie from just one

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.069 
tied properly if you tie from just one
side<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.610> other<00:01:32.640> side<00:01:32.819> might<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.390> get<00:01:33.600> might

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
side the other side might not get might

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.529 
side the other side might not get might
not<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.380> gotten<00:01:34.819> pulled<00:01:35.819> as<00:01:35.969> snug<00:01:36.210> as<00:01:36.240> it

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
not have gotten pulled as snug as it

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.350 
not have gotten pulled as snug as it
needed<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:37.219> so<00:01:38.219> this<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.060> bulk<00:01:39.270> it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
needed to be so this is just to bulk it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.940 
needed to be so this is just to bulk it
up<00:01:39.509> before<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.990> start<00:01:40.020> applying<00:01:40.439> real

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
up before you start applying real

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.309 
up before you start applying real
tension<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.640> with<00:01:41.819> the<00:01:41.909> tension<00:01:42.119> head<00:01:42.390> okay

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
tension to it with the tension head okay

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.320 
tension to it with the tension head okay
now<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.679> you<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.039> starting<00:01:44.549> starting

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
now if you have a starting starting

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.830 
now if you have a starting starting
clamp<00:01:45.619> one<00:01:46.619> thing<00:01:46.830> that<00:01:47.009> may<00:01:47.099> help<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.909> put

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
clamp one thing that may help is to put

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.569 
clamp one thing that may help is to put
the<00:01:49.020> starting<00:01:49.349> clamp<00:01:49.590> on<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.099> tail<00:01:50.340> up

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
the starting clamp on the tail up

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.370 
the starting clamp on the tail up
against<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> knot<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.569> also<00:01:51.810> keeps<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
against the knot this also keeps the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.789 
against the knot this also keeps the
knot<00:01:52.530> from<00:01:52.770> sliding<00:01:53.099> into<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.429> grommet<00:01:56.509> but

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
knot from sliding into the grommet but

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.809 
knot from sliding into the grommet but
once<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.920> had<00:01:59.069> that<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> you're<00:02:00.000> ready<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.329> go

once you had that and you're ready to go

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.630 
once you had that and you're ready to go
full<00:02:02.819> tension<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.860> okay<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.099> if<00:02:05.220> you<00:02:05.340> want

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
full tension on it okay and if you want

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.550 
full tension on it okay and if you want
and<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:05.970> is<00:02:06.030> something<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.599> do<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.409> can

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
and this is something that I do you can

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.809 
and this is something that I do you can
pull<00:02:07.739> tension<00:02:07.979> on<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.310> twice<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:10.579> the<00:02:11.579> first

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
pull tension on it twice the the first

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.180 
pull tension on it twice the the first
one<00:02:12.060> will<00:02:12.209> help<00:02:12.360> get<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.170> knot<00:02:13.380> bulked<00:02:14.040> up

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
one will help get the the knot bulked up

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.370 
one will help get the the knot bulked up
and<00:02:14.459> then<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.389> second<00:02:15.690> one<00:02:15.810> will<00:02:15.930> actually

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
and then the second one will actually

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.740 
and then the second one will actually
just<00:02:16.739> be<00:02:16.829> applying<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:18.120> full<00:02:18.359> amount<00:02:18.600> of

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
just be applying the full amount of

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.050 
just be applying the full amount of
tension<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.350> string<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.859> not<00:02:20.459> balancing

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
tension to the string and not balancing

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.670 
tension to the string and not balancing
it<00:02:21.180> between<00:02:21.389> the<00:02:21.600> string<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.049> tightening<00:02:22.560> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
it between the string and tightening the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.830 
it between the string and tightening the
knot<00:02:22.829> so<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.000> that's<00:02:24.180> that's<00:02:24.389> just<00:02:24.480> an<00:02:24.690> option

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
knot so and that's that's just an option

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.270 
knot so and that's that's just an option
you<00:02:25.139> can<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.590> if<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.799> want<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.069> is

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
you can do that if you want this is

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.819 
you can do that if you want this is
something<00:02:26.519> I<00:02:26.609> do<00:02:26.720> have<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> nature<00:02:28.079> around<00:02:28.680> at

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
something I do have a nature around at

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.830 
something I do have a nature around at
second<00:02:29.190> nature<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:29.670> once<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.239> apply<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
second nature but once you apply the

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.240 
second nature but once you apply the
tension<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.350> you're<00:02:31.440> ready<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.739> go<00:02:31.889> you<00:02:31.950> can

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
tension and you're ready to go you can

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:44.360 
tension and you're ready to go you can
just<00:02:32.870> start<00:02:33.870> clamping

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.820 

now<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.430> can<00:02:45.730> let<00:02:45.850> go<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:47.020> starting<00:02:47.620> clamp

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
now you can let go of the starting clamp

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.260 
now you can let go of the starting clamp
that<00:02:47.920> only<00:02:48.130> has<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.430> be<00:02:48.550> on<00:02:48.670> there<00:02:48.880> for<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
that only has to be on there for the

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.400 
that only has to be on there for the
tensioning<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.840> doesn't<00:02:50.050> have<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.230> be<00:02:50.319> on

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
tensioning it doesn't have to be on

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.210 
tensioning it doesn't have to be on
there<00:02:50.560> anymore<00:02:51.000> then<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.209> trim<00:02:52.600> your<00:02:52.750> tail

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
there anymore then you trim your tail

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.050 
there anymore then you trim your tail
and<00:02:54.220> you're<00:02:54.520> good<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.670> go

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
and you're good to go

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.570 
and you're good to go
use<00:02:55.450> finish<00:02:55.959> across<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.410> when<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.310> get<00:02:57.430> to

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
use finish across this when you get to

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.250 
use finish across this when you get to
the<00:02:57.670> bottom<00:02:57.819> use<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.240> finishing<00:02:58.600> that<00:02:58.690> and

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
the bottom use the finishing that and

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.550 
the bottom use the finishing that and
that's<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.620> thank<00:03:00.459> you
