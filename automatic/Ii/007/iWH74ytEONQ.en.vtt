00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.920
 house but it is a classic that was marked 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.230
 by the mathematics of 9 and 26 the fans 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.780

 The ball barely rolled and lucas silva took the ball. 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.280
 first uh of the fans alex silva 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.310
 invaded the area but did not hit the pass 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.560
 for the companion next to play esp 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.220
 everton brook arrived in the face of 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.470
 victor but missed the dig 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.080
 the cruise was better at departure 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.960
 the bacillus michel Julio Baptist filled 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.579
 the foot for defense of victor julio batista 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.590
 was really inspired 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.970
 He tried the bike but Victor 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.250
 held in two strokes 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.740
 in the second stage the cruise came back 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.939
 pressing and vitor went to get the kick 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.310
 from everton ribeiro 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.290
 now it was ricardo goulart's turn 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.180
 missed another good chance at the 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.340
 area 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.259
 as the 0 to 0 was in his favor the cruise 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.420
 started to administer and almost 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.350
 surprised by the most controversial move of the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.630
 match 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.930
 Two minutes from the end, Joe was knocked over. 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.479
 for ten votes he even scored a penalty 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.369
 but came back after signaling the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.350
 assistant 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.840
 end of the game for having done the best 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.340
 campaign in the first phase the draw without 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.340
 goals gave title to the cruise 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.569
 the president of athletic alexandre kalil 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.830
 was revolted and was satisfied with the 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.410
 judge after the game 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.090
 the outburst did not help the supporter 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.030
 could celebrate another one. 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.030
 Minas Gerais championship the 36th of its collection 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:16.680
 sad because the intention was 20 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.260
 make a good game win the victory 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.450
 unfortunately we could not get first 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.280
 much better cruise time on departure 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.349
 the second game an open game 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.230
 the athletic throwing himself a little to 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.420
 front in search of the result 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.269
 unfortunately we were not lucky enough to 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.690
 make the goal but now is to raise the 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.730
 head full confidence because we 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.349
 many competitions throughout the year and the 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.880
 mentality has to be the 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.670
 winning mentality 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.110
 only great for working and with 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.849
 motivation with the 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.890
 work that the martyr always emphasizes 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.170
 I think this makes us 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.209
 close to each title each 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.709
 the goal we are aiming for today 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.480
 was no different from all 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.010
 competitions that we will play is 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.959
 difficult mexico people are aware 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.790
 that the team has quality then the 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.590
 people are hoping to give the best of 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.670
 that we can search out the titles 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.739
 passing forever looking at the title 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.329
 because the cruise is a great team and 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.329
 has almost as many children
