00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
here and what I do is I just dump it

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.460 
here and what I do is I just dump it
into<00:03:04.420> some<00:03:04.900> tin<00:03:05.230> foil<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:07.079> just<00:03:08.079> kind<00:03:08.319> of

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
into some tin foil and just kind of

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.960

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319
