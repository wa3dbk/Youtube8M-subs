00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.230
 hi guys i came back with another 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.670
 video and in this video 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.860
 I want to do the second TV series on 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.530
 return of the first video I had made 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.610
 and so it was called Chinese doctors say 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.350
 our 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.960
 this remains a we say our but 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.189
 this time we talk says parabens anyway 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.949
 if you are interested in going to see that 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.779
 video I put the link here we say that 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.619
 I wanted to shoot this for a long time 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.260
 video 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.850
 just one thing and the other, but scores 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.540
 by laporta you do n't think about it by saying no 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.719
 I turned but I decided to shoot it 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.640
 when a girl while i was saying a 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.559
 video of favorites with a thing of 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.930
 he said that I was fine 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.329
 among other things , I still use it almost 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.600
 over the use them just yesterday the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.730
 germany soft and the girl in question 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.449
 he had written to me not to use with the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.690
 cream because it contains silicones and me 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.850
 I wanted to have my say about it 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.510
 surely everyone's own way 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.299
 to think 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.950
 nobody judges anyone and everyone thinks 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.250
 as he wishes, as he sees fit and on 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.720
 saying I personally think so 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.140
 they can't go on without having done with 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.939
 the flakes are keeping them alive 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.390
 look at the cool euro pokerine at the one bar 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.390
 Chinese 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.860
 if you notice the children why not 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.070
 they have brittle and damaged hair 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.579
 burned yet they use the same donuts 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.530
 which means that they are taboo no I believe 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.229
 my niece who has long stations 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.630
 how much my hair is as long as 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.210
 my stations all natural and healthy 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.790
 my sister too uses brands of 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.700
 commercial conditioner shampoos like those 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.100
 which can be found at the supermarket 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.740
 glis fruits can be read on crutches 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.159
 hamsik not just the specific ones used 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.640
 however the trade marks on those between 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.440
 best- known quotes not yet 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.860
 I believe from the slightest appeals 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:20.110
 that hair can burn if yes 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.060
 misuses diverts coloration roads and things 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.830
 such 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.470
 I don't think they are the least 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.310
 silicones contained in the ten inside 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.530
 of others as well as in tricks and then 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.930
 by the way turning on youtube 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.560
 I don't remember the video of who was there 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:45.400
 one girl said it made sense 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:48.819
 expressive forms on the belly but curly 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.209
 if you type rossato and there was nothing going 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:57.790
 girl he used for a period of 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:00.959
 all homemade d.bo all and creams 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.880
 bio various things the end the beautiful is is 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.480
 filled the bubbles this because why 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.870
 I think some silicon in the end 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:15.190
 or something contained in the tricks 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:18.820
 I serve I die of ignorant I don't know look 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.870
 lynxes of the product I do not know that that para 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.450
 good for paraffin varalli na imposes of 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.739
 for myself I don't know ingredients like I read 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.150
 I do n't know anything 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:34.320
 here I do not believe so much is what gods 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:37.269
 vertices that one must be maniago 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.829
 incitement everybody thinks what 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:47.850
 he thinks the juice of the thing is over 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:50.890
 7 carrier does the juice of the thing is 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:55.069
 I wanted to know a little bit about all of you 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.959
 think and an appeal to the experts 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.999

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.849
 cinema I would love to know how 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:04.939
 works so scrupulously 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:09.799
 if any of you know how to learn to 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:11.900
 read product or type labels 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.469

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.680

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:20.389
 below that intrigues me a lot from this 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.789

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.880

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.590
