what's<00:00:01.859> up<00:00:01.980> guys<00:00:02.130> are<00:00:02.370> here<00:00:02.489> at<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.639> studio

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:02.969 
what's up guys are here at the studio

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.580 
what's up guys are here at the studio
which<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.330> actually<00:00:03.659> under<00:00:03.840> construction<00:00:04.439> and

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:04.590 
which is actually under construction and

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.289 
which is actually under construction and
we're<00:00:04.710> getting<00:00:04.770> some<00:00:05.069> final<00:00:05.430> shots<00:00:05.700> for<00:00:06.210> the

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
we're getting some final shots for the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:22.370 
we're getting some final shots for the
Iron<00:00:06.629> Man<00:00:06.779> effect<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.259> chalk<00:00:07.440> warfare<00:00:07.799> 3

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.320 

after<00:00:23.190> production<00:00:23.700> we<00:00:23.790> actually<00:00:24.060> realize

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
after production we actually realize

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.000 
after production we actually realize
that<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.960> use<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.200> new<00:00:25.500> technique<00:00:25.830> of

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
that we can use a new technique of

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.720 
that we can use a new technique of
motion<00:00:26.790> capturing<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.480> an<00:00:27.600> Xbox<00:00:27.870> Kinect

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
motion capturing with an Xbox Kinect

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.460 
motion capturing with an Xbox Kinect
originally<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:29.850> wanted<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.180> do<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:31.020> normal

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
originally we wanted to do just normal

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.200 
originally we wanted to do just normal
keyframing<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.430> were<00:00:32.520> afraid<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.820> that

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
keyframing but we were afraid that that

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.610 
keyframing but we were afraid that that
wasn't<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> give<00:00:34.020> us<00:00:34.080> the<00:00:34.170> results<00:00:34.530> we

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
wasn't going to give us the results we

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.690 
wasn't going to give us the results we
actually<00:00:34.950> wanted<00:00:35.220> and<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.400> was<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.580> bit

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
actually wanted and I was a bit

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.979 
actually wanted and I was a bit
skeptical<00:00:36.210> about<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.600> because<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.900> was

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
skeptical about this because I was

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.720 
skeptical about this because I was
afraid<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.410> would<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.530> glitchy<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.460> watched

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
afraid it would be glitchy I watched

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.570 
afraid it would be glitchy I watched
some<00:00:38.879> results<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.270> YouTube<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:40.309> when<00:00:41.309> done

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
some results on YouTube but when done

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.890 
some results on YouTube but when done
the<00:00:41.730> proper<00:00:41.940> conditions<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.660> actually

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
the proper conditions you can actually

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.240 
the proper conditions you can actually
get<00:00:43.020> some<00:00:43.140> pretty<00:00:43.320> accurate<00:00:43.770> results<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
get some pretty accurate results and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.860 
get some pretty accurate results and
I'll<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.550> walk<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.760> through<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.480> workflow

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I'll just walk you through the workflow

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.479 
I'll just walk you through the workflow
I<00:00:45.900> have<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.470> right<00:00:46.530> now<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.220> we<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
I have going on right now so we have the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.490 
I have going on right now so we have the
Xbox<00:00:47.700> Kinect<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.809> hooked<00:00:49.020> directly<00:00:49.140> up

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
Xbox Kinect and it's hooked directly up

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.979 
Xbox Kinect and it's hooked directly up
to<00:00:49.590> my<00:00:49.710> laptop<00:00:50.010> which<00:00:50.820> has<00:00:50.970> the<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> pi<00:00:51.420> recorder

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
to my laptop which has the I pi recorder

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.320 
to my laptop which has the I pi recorder
and<00:00:52.170> studio<00:00:52.620> version<00:00:53.100> software<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> link

and studio version software on it link

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.670 
and studio version software on it link
will<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:54.600> description<00:00:54.809> check<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.530> out

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
will be the description check that out

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.290 
will be the description check that out
in<00:00:55.860> our<00:00:56.159> case<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.519> also<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.850> our<00:00:56.879> t2<00:00:57.269> i

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
in our case we also have our t2 i

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.799 
in our case we also have our t2 i
recording<00:00:58.019> full<00:00:58.559> HD<00:00:59.010> video<00:00:59.600> that's<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.720> to

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
recording full HD video that's going to

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.590 
recording full HD video that's going to
be<00:01:00.900> synced<00:01:01.229> up<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.769> the<00:01:02.220> Kinect<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:03.300> Kinect

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
be synced up with the Kinect the Kinect

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.240 
be synced up with the Kinect the Kinect
actually<00:01:03.930> has<00:01:04.050> a<00:01:04.080> 24<00:01:04.710> millimeter<00:01:04.890> focal

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
actually has a 24 millimeter focal

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.450 
actually has a 24 millimeter focal
length<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.810> our<00:01:07.080> 24<00:01:08.040> millimeter

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
length so we have our 24 millimeter

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.310 
length so we have our 24 millimeter
equivalent<00:01:08.760> lens<00:01:09.210> which<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.450> about<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.720> 15<00:01:10.170> with

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
equivalent lens which is about a 15 with

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.200 
equivalent lens which is about a 15 with
our<00:01:10.440> crop<00:01:10.650> sensor<00:01:10.979> hooked<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.700> right<00:01:11.880> above<00:01:12.060> it

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
our crop sensor hooked up right above it

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.570 
our crop sensor hooked up right above it
recording<00:01:12.960> at<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.110> same<00:01:13.320> time<00:01:13.590> now<00:01:14.400> what<00:01:14.520> we

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
recording at the same time now what we

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.860 
recording at the same time now what we
first<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.120> a<00:01:15.180> clean<00:01:15.390> plate<00:01:15.659> and

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
first do is we get a clean plate and

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.440 
first do is we get a clean plate and
analyze<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.409> background<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.090> then<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.299> have

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
analyze the background and then we have

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.180 
analyze the background and then we have
our<00:01:18.570> subject<00:01:18.780> moving<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.290> frame<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.710> do<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> t

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
our subject moving a frame and do a t

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.700 
our subject moving a frame and do a t
pose<00:01:20.430> hold<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> few<00:01:21.750> seconds<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.290> then

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
pose hold for a few seconds and then

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.310 
pose hold for a few seconds and then
relax<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.700> run<00:01:23.940> through<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.120> motions<00:01:24.540> once

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
relax and run through the motions once

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.990 
relax and run through the motions once
we're<00:01:25.440> done<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:25.710> stop<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> recording<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.610> now

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
we're done we stop the recording and now

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.999 
we're done we stop the recording and now
we<00:01:27.060> open<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.689> studio<00:01:28.049> version<00:01:28.469> from<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.829> pi

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
we open up the studio version from I pi

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.760 
we open up the studio version from I pi
and<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.119> line<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.420> our<00:01:30.689> actor<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and we can line up our actor with the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.440 
and we can line up our actor with the
video<00:01:32.189> feed<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.850> received<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
video feed that we received from the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.719 
video feed that we received from the
Kinect<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.990> click<00:01:34.829> refit<00:01:35.219> to<00:01:35.369> adjust<00:01:35.610> the

Kinect and click refit to adjust the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
Kinect and click refit to adjust the
model<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> position<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.350> feed<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
model to the position of the feed and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.340 
model to the position of the feed and
click<00:01:38.520> track<00:01:38.759> forward<00:01:39.149> and<00:01:39.810> now<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.320> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
click track forward and now you see that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.380 
click track forward and now you see that
our<00:01:40.500> model<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.829> tracking<00:01:41.219> forward<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
our model is tracking forward with the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.020 
our model is tracking forward with the
video<00:01:42.659> feed<00:01:42.930> from<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.259> Kinect<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.030> after

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
video feed from the Kinect and after

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.029 
video feed from the Kinect and after
that's<00:01:45.149> done<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.539> do<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> further<00:01:46.439> jitter

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
that's done we can do a further jitter
