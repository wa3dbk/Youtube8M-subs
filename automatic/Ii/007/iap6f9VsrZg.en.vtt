increasingly<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.710> number<00:00:29.040> of<00:00:29.160> international

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760

visitors that makes it out to Dubai so

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.880 
visitors that makes it out to Dubai so
which<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.970> good<00:00:33.210> news<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.380> represent

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
which is good news to see it represent

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.370 
which is good news to see it represent
the<00:00:35.190> region<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.910> all<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.540> its<00:00:36.690> potential

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.790 

I<00:00:39.470> think<00:00:40.250> Dubai<00:00:40.580> Porsche<00:00:41.180> has<00:00:41.390> established

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
I think Dubai Porsche has established

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.720 
I think Dubai Porsche has established
itself<00:00:42.800> as<00:00:43.300> a<00:00:44.770> very<00:00:45.770> important<00:00:46.720> show<00:00:47.720> and

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
itself as a very important show and

00:00:48.730 --> 00:01:00.560 
itself as a very important show and
every<00:00:49.730> year<00:00:49.910> at<00:00:50.180> attract<00:00:50.810> more<00:00:51.850> exhibitors

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.299 

I<00:01:01.070> think<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:03.020> show<00:01:04.020> here<00:01:04.350> continues<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
I think the the show here continues to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.000 
I think the the show here continues to
receive<00:01:05.820> warm<00:01:06.510> response<00:01:06.930> not<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.530> from<00:01:07.710> UE

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
receive warm response not just from UE

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.700 
receive warm response not just from UE
but<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> surrounding<00:01:08.880> region<00:01:09.480> we<00:01:10.050> see<00:01:10.080> that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
