to<00:02:06.349> use<00:02:07.349> the<00:02:07.679> oven<00:02:08.459> on<00:02:08.880> top<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.330> wood<00:02:09.450> stove

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.100 
to use the oven on top of the wood stove
that<00:02:09.780> would<00:02:09.989> require<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.410> lot<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.310> heat<00:02:11.520> and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
that would require a lot of heat and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.270 
that would require a lot of heat and
honestly<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.290> would<00:02:13.409> be<00:02:13.530> too<00:02:13.739> much<00:02:13.920> for<00:02:14.219> me
