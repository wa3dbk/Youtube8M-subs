the<00:01:03.510> house<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.930> put<00:01:04.110> together<00:01:04.489> there's<00:01:05.489> two

the house is put together there's two

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.520 
the house is put together there's two
boards<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.240> fit<00:01:06.420> together<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
boards that fit together like this and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.680 
boards that fit together like this and
then<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.250> are<00:01:08.280> green<00:01:08.700> rooms<00:01:09.030> red<00:01:09.420> rooms

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
then there are green rooms red rooms

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.240 
then there are green rooms red rooms
blue<00:01:10.020> rooms<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.470> white<00:01:10.590> rooms<00:01:10.770> each<00:01:10.950> room<00:01:11.130> has

a<00:01:11.280> different<00:01:11.460> distinctive<00:01:12.090> pattern<00:01:12.540> each<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
a different distinctive pattern each of

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.510 
a different distinctive pattern each of
these<00:01:13.440> rooms<00:01:13.710> you'll<00:01:13.920> see<00:01:14.100> here<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
these rooms you'll see here that the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.300 
these rooms you'll see here that the
board<00:01:14.730> actually<00:01:14.880> has<00:01:15.150> holes<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
board actually has holes in it that you

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.070 
board actually has holes in it that you
can<00:01:17.340> poke<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.910> way<00:01:18.000> through<00:01:18.300> and<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
can poke all the way through and at the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.480 
can poke all the way through and at the
beginning<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> game<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.770> split<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
beginning of the game you split the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.270 
beginning of the game you split the
tiles<00:01:20.850> evenly<00:01:21.510> between<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.530> players<00:01:22.920> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
tiles evenly between the players and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.610 
tiles evenly between the players and
then<00:01:23.760> they<00:01:23.880> place<00:01:24.180> them<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.570> board<00:01:24.870> and<00:01:25.200> I

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
then they place them on the board and I

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.690 
then they place them on the board and I
guess<00:01:25.830> that's<00:01:26.010> supposed<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.340> be<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> whole

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
guess that's supposed to be a whole

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.160 
guess that's supposed to be a whole
strategic<00:01:26.940> thing<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.750> that's<00:01:27.870> just<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
strategic thing and that's just a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.900 
strategic thing and that's just a
ridiculous<00:01:28.680> waste<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.040> time<00:01:29.190> I<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.580> throw

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
ridiculous waste of time I just throw

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.550 
ridiculous waste of time I just throw
them<00:01:30.030> out<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.300> randomly<00:01:30.560> because

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
them out and randomly because

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.780 
them out and randomly because
essentially<00:01:31.950> when<00:01:32.190> both<00:01:32.430> players<00:01:32.700> are

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
essentially when both players are

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.270 
essentially when both players are
placing<00:01:33.180> them<00:01:33.300> out<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:34.320> pretty<00:01:34.920> random

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
placing them out it's pretty random

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880 
placing them out it's pretty random
anyway<00:01:35.940> so<00:01:36.930> what<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:37.740> this

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
anyway so what you do is you do this

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.580 
anyway so what you do is you do this
you're<00:01:38.700> going<00:01:38.940> to<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.300> two<00:01:39.960> or<00:01:39.990> four<00:01:40.320> players

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you're going to have two or four players

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.340 
you're going to have two or four players
if<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.670> two-player<00:01:42.119> game<00:01:42.150> one<00:01:42.900> person<00:01:43.260> is

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
if it's a two-player game one person is

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.690 
if it's a two-player game one person is
the<00:01:43.500> ghost<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.830> other<00:01:43.979> person's<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.430> hunter

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
the ghost the other person's a hunter

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.910 
the ghost the other person's a hunter
otherwise<00:01:45.510> if<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.440> four<00:01:46.650> player<00:01:46.860> game

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
otherwise if it's a four player game

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
otherwise if it's a four player game
each<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.840> two<00:01:49.020> ghost<00:01:49.320> players<00:01:49.590> gets<00:01:50.550> two

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
each of the two ghost players gets two

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.249 
each of the two ghost players gets two
of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.150> different<00:01:51.420> colored<00:01:51.690> ghosts<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:52.170> then

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
of the different colored ghosts and then

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
of the different colored ghosts and then
there's<00:01:52.440> two<00:01:52.590> hundreds<00:01:52.920> etc<00:01:53.400> then<00:01:54.300> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
there's two hundreds etc then the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690 
there's two hundreds etc then the
hunters<00:01:54.840> close<00:01:55.200> their<00:01:55.500> eyes<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.490> time

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
hunters close their eyes and it's time

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.749 
hunters close their eyes and it's time
for<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> ghosts<00:01:57.540> tied<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.130> example<00:01:59.550> I

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
for the ghosts tied so for example I

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.609 
for the ghosts tied so for example I
have<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.660> white<00:02:00.869> ghost<00:02:01.110> must<00:02:01.410> go<00:02:01.530> under

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
have a the white ghost must go under

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.590 
have a the white ghost must go under
white<00:02:01.920> room<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.400> can<00:02:02.520> put<00:02:03.000> him<00:02:03.119> here<00:02:03.420> now

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
white room so I can put him here now

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.190 
white room so I can put him here now
these<00:02:04.410> ghosts<00:02:05.360> barely<00:02:06.360> fit<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.900> thing<00:02:06.960> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
these ghosts barely fit in this thing I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.040 
these ghosts barely fit in this thing I
mean<00:02:07.230> they<00:02:07.530> are<00:02:07.620> a<00:02:07.650> tight<00:02:08.130> tight<00:02:08.519> fit<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.119> I

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
mean they are a tight tight fit and I

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.690 
mean they are a tight tight fit and I
think<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.709> need<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:11.010> really<00:02:11.220> careful<00:02:11.430> by

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
think you need to be really careful by

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.830 
think you need to be really careful by
which<00:02:12.000> way<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.239> put<00:02:12.269> them<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.750> need

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
which way you put them in and you need

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.509 
which way you put them in and you need
to<00:02:12.930> make<00:02:13.019> sure<00:02:13.170> they're<00:02:13.320> flat<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.430> when

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
to make sure they're flat so that when

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:15.949 
to make sure they're flat so that when
you<00:02:14.610> put<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.850> tile<00:02:15.060> back<00:02:15.300> down<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.720> can't

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
you put the tile back down you can't

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.740 
you put the tile back down you can't
tell<00:02:16.230> if<00:02:16.350> there's<00:02:16.500> a<00:02:16.590> ghost<00:02:16.860> underneath<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.750> so

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
tell if there's a ghost underneath it so

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.540 
tell if there's a ghost underneath it so
you'll<00:02:18.900> do<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.440> putting<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.160> ghost<00:02:20.400> under

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
you'll do this and putting a ghost under

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.699 
you'll do this and putting a ghost under
each<00:02:20.790> one<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.630> let's<00:02:21.959> say<00:02:22.110> maybe<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.440> put<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
each one so let's say maybe I put the

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.250 
each one so let's say maybe I put the
green<00:02:22.920> ghost<00:02:23.250> here<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> white<00:02:25.050> goes

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
green ghost here and the white goes

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.050 
green ghost here and the white goes
there<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:26.430> blue<00:02:26.640> goes<00:02:26.910> down<00:02:27.180> here<00:02:27.660> now

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
there and the blue goes down here now

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.360 
there and the blue goes down here now
what<00:02:30.260> you've<00:02:31.260> hid<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.560> ghost<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:32.040> tell<00:02:32.220> the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
what you've hid the ghost you tell the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.009 
what you've hid the ghost you tell the
ghost<00:02:32.519> hunters<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.090> open<00:02:33.360> their<00:02:33.480> eyes<00:02:33.510> and

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
ghost hunters to open their eyes and

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.320 
ghost hunters to open their eyes and
then<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.709> game<00:02:34.920> begins<00:02:35.400> now<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:36.000> works<00:02:36.180> very

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
then the game begins now it works very

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.780 
then the game begins now it works very
easily<00:02:36.480> what<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.709> on<00:02:37.950> your<00:02:38.190> turn<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
easily what you do on your turn on the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.720 
easily what you do on your turn on the
ghost<00:02:39.000> turn<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.570> they<00:02:40.340> destroy<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.519> tile

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
ghost turn is they destroy the tile

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.080 
ghost turn is they destroy the tile
that's<00:02:42.030> adjacent<00:02:43.100> diagonally<00:02:44.100> or<00:02:44.130> directly

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
that's adjacent diagonally or directly

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.300 
that's adjacent diagonally or directly
adjacent<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.570> any<00:02:45.720> ghost<00:02:46.019> they<00:02:46.170> control<00:02:46.560> so

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
adjacent to any ghost they control so

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.979 
adjacent to any ghost they control so
since<00:02:47.549> we<00:02:47.670> have<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.850> ghost<00:02:48.090> here<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.600> could

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
since we have a ghost here I could

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.509 
since we have a ghost here I could
destroy<00:02:49.290> any<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.620> these<00:02:49.739> rooms<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.190> destroy

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
destroy any of these rooms so I destroy

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.509 
destroy any of these rooms so I destroy
the<00:02:50.700> six<00:02:51.290> now<00:02:52.290> each<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.860> rooms<00:02:53.070> has<00:02:53.340> it

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
the six now each of the rooms has it

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.460 
the six now each of the rooms has it
destroyed<00:02:53.880> side<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.570> non<00:02:54.780> destroyed<00:02:55.200> side

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
destroyed side and a non destroyed side

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.350 
destroyed side and a non destroyed side
and<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.220> put<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.549> destroyed<00:02:56.940> side<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.209> front

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
and so I put the destroyed side in front

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.620 
and so I put the destroyed side in front
of<00:02:57.420> me

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
of me

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.930 
of me
we<00:02:57.870> just<00:02:58.080> got<00:02:58.230> six<00:02:58.530> points<00:02:58.860> as<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.130> ghosts<00:02:59.519> so

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
we just got six points as the ghosts so

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.090 
we just got six points as the ghosts so
now<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.269> hunters<00:03:00.600> turn<00:03:00.900> now<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.769> hunter

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
now it's the hunters turn now the hunter

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.940 
now it's the hunters turn now the hunter
knows<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:03.060> there's<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.330> ghost<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:04.380> one<00:03:04.830> of

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
knows that there's a ghost in one of

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.140 
knows that there's a ghost in one of
these<00:03:05.070> spots<00:03:05.280> because<00:03:05.519> it's<00:03:05.670> directly<00:03:06.030> next

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
these spots because it's directly next

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.050 
these spots because it's directly next
to<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.560> hunter<00:03:07.860> thinks<00:03:08.160> all<00:03:08.850> right

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
to that so the hunter thinks all right

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.110 
to that so the hunter thinks all right
probably<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.500> would<00:03:11.160> put<00:03:11.310> underneath<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.819> low

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
probably I would put underneath a low

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.809 
probably I would put underneath a low
one<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:12.630> he<00:03:12.810> destroys<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.470> room<00:03:13.709> here<00:03:14.040> which

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
one so he destroys this room here which

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.010 
one so he destroys this room here which
is<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.599> 1<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.150> it's<00:03:18.150> destroyed<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.840> ghost

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
is a 1 and so it's destroyed the ghost

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.020 
is a 1 and so it's destroyed the ghost
hunters<00:03:19.260> also<00:03:19.470> these<00:03:19.709> story<00:03:19.950> rooms<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:21.000> I

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
hunters also these story rooms and so I

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.480 
hunters also these story rooms and so I
get<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:21.870> now<00:03:21.990> it's<00:03:22.140> my<00:03:22.290> turn<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.740> rather

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
get that so now it's my turn and rather

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.980 
get that so now it's my turn and rather
than<00:03:23.700> do<00:03:23.880> another<00:03:24.120> one<00:03:24.300> that's<00:03:24.390> next<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.870> this

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
than do another one that's next to this

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.410 
than do another one that's next to this
one<00:03:25.640> boy<00:03:26.640> I've<00:03:26.760> already<00:03:26.970> forgot<00:03:27.180> where<00:03:27.300> I<00:03:27.330> put

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
at the end you have to memorize where

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.100 
at the end you have to memorize where
your<00:03:29.940> ghosts<00:03:30.240> are<00:03:30.360> so<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.540> have<00:03:30.630> a<00:03:30.690> ghost<00:03:30.870> down

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.580 
destroyed they've actually captured the
ghost<00:03:47.819> and<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.300> can<00:03:48.510> no<00:03:48.599> longer<00:03:48.840> use<00:03:49.080> that<00:03:49.110> ghost

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
ghost and I can no longer use that ghost

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.280 
ghost and I can no longer use that ghost
to<00:03:49.739> capture<00:03:50.130> rooms<00:03:50.400> also<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.810> ghost<00:03:52.020> hunter

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
to capture rooms also the ghost hunter

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.350 
to capture rooms also the ghost hunter
has<00:03:52.500> now<00:03:52.739> basically<00:03:53.250> eliminated<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> fact

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
has now basically eliminated the fact

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.820 
has now basically eliminated the fact
that<00:03:54.510> there<00:03:54.660> are<00:03:54.750> any<00:03:54.900> ghosts<00:03:55.290> underneath<00:03:55.620> any

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
that there are any ghosts underneath any

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.170 
that there are any ghosts underneath any
of<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.040> other<00:03:56.190> white<00:03:56.370> tiles<00:03:56.640> because<00:03:57.030> they

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
of the other white tiles because they

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
of the other white tiles because they
found<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.569> white<00:03:57.720> ghost

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
found the white ghost

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.220 
found the white ghost
this<00:03:59.129> will<00:03:59.340> continue<00:03:59.670> as<00:04:00.030> tiles<00:04:00.660> come<00:04:00.930> off<00:04:01.080> the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
this will continue as tiles come off the

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.670 
this will continue as tiles come off the
board<00:04:01.470> until<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.569> hero<00:04:03.930> or<00:04:04.379> the<00:04:04.500> ghost

board until the the hero or the ghost

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.589 
board until the the hero or the ghost
hunters<00:04:04.980> have<00:04:05.160> found<00:04:05.340> all<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.790> ghosts<00:04:06.239> at

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
hunters have found all the ghosts at

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.220 
hunters have found all the ghosts at
that<00:04:07.290> point<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:08.310> ghosts<00:04:08.819> are<00:04:09.120> going<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.870> total

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
that point the ghosts are going to total

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.190 
that point the ghosts are going to total
up<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.530> tiles<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.160> they<00:04:11.340> have<00:04:11.640> they<00:04:12.450> need<00:04:12.989> to

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
up the tiles that they have they need to

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.680 
up the tiles that they have they need to
get<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.440> certain<00:04:14.040> amount<00:04:14.540> depending<00:04:15.540> on<00:04:15.629> the

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
get a certain amount depending on the

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.380 
get a certain amount depending on the
number<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:15.930> players<00:04:16.140> in<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:17.270> two-player<00:04:18.270> game

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
number of players in a two-player game

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.380 
number of players in a two-player game
then<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.560> ghosts<00:04:19.890> need<00:04:20.039> to<00:04:20.099> do<00:04:20.239> 50,000<00:04:21.239> points

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
then the ghosts need to do 50,000 points

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.600 
then the ghosts need to do 50,000 points
of<00:04:21.599> damage<00:04:21.720> so<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:22.380> is<00:04:22.560> one<00:04:22.740> that's<00:04:22.919> 10,000

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
of damage so this is one that's 10,000

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.909 
of damage so this is one that's 10,000
so<00:04:23.669> you<00:04:23.760> need<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:23.940> get<00:04:24.060> basically<00:04:24.470> 50<00:04:25.470> points

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
so you need to get basically 50 points

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.630 
so you need to get basically 50 points
and<00:04:26.099> in<00:04:26.910> a<00:04:27.150> 4<00:04:27.450> player<00:04:27.660> game<00:04:27.720> it's<00:04:28.640> 45,000

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
and in a 4 player game it's 45,000

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.870 
and in a 4 player game it's 45,000
points<00:04:30.030> now<00:04:30.960> you<00:04:31.020> can<00:04:31.289> also<00:04:31.530> play<00:04:31.979> a<00:04:32.280> version

what<00:05:00.750> do<00:05:00.810> you<00:05:00.870> think<00:05:01.080> of<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.229> phantom<00:05:01.500> society

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
what do you think of the phantom society

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.170 
what do you think of the phantom society
I<00:05:02.159> thought<00:05:02.970> it<00:05:03.120> was<00:05:03.240> a<00:05:03.270> lot<00:05:03.599> of<00:05:03.630> fun<00:05:04.080> trying<00:05:04.620> to

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
I thought it was a lot of fun trying to

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.899 
I thought it was a lot of fun trying to
cleverly<00:05:06.180> hide<00:05:06.479> your<00:05:06.870> ghost<00:05:07.460> being<00:05:08.460> strategic

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
cleverly hide your ghost being strategic

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.050 
cleverly hide your ghost being strategic
and<00:05:09.690> trying<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.470> make<00:05:10.950> them<00:05:11.190> confused<00:05:11.820> of

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
and trying to make them confused of

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.680 
and trying to make them confused of
where<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.659> ghost<00:05:12.900> really<00:05:13.140> is<00:05:13.430> I<00:05:14.539> noticed<00:05:15.539> it

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
where the ghost really is I noticed it

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.330 
where the ghost really is I noticed it
was<00:05:15.870> harder<00:05:16.260> to<00:05:16.289> be<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.650> ghost<00:05:16.860> than<00:05:17.130> the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
was harder to be the ghost than the

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.840 
was harder to be the ghost than the
hunters<00:05:17.790> I<00:05:18.090> think<00:05:18.870> so<00:05:19.190> now<00:05:20.190> we<00:05:20.250> played<00:05:20.669> this

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
hunters I think so now we played this

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.879 
hunters I think so now we played this
both<00:05:21.150> as<00:05:21.419> a<00:05:21.449> two-player<00:05:22.110> game<00:05:22.350> just<00:05:22.590> melody

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
both as a two-player game just melody

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.620 
both as a two-player game just melody
and<00:05:23.010> I<00:05:23.100> am<00:05:23.310> we<00:05:23.490> also<00:05:23.729> played<00:05:23.910> as<00:05:24.030> a<00:05:24.090> four<00:05:24.360> player

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
and I am we also played as a four player

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.060 
and I am we also played as a four player
game<00:05:24.660> which<00:05:25.020> of<00:05:25.169> those<00:05:25.260> do<00:05:25.440> you<00:05:25.500> prefer

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
game which of those do you prefer

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.340 
game which of those do you prefer
a<00:05:26.160> four-player<00:05:26.970> game<00:05:27.150> really<00:05:27.750> see<00:05:28.050> I<00:05:28.080> was

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
a four-player game really see I was

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.840 
a four-player game really see I was
gonna<00:05:28.440> say<00:05:28.680> I<00:05:28.710> thought<00:05:28.980> the<00:05:29.100> two-player<00:05:29.580> game

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
gonna say I thought the two-player game

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.080 
gonna say I thought the two-player game
was<00:05:30.000> better<00:05:30.150> because<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:31.170> four<00:05:31.380> player<00:05:31.620> game

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
was better because the four player game

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.160 
was better because the four player game
you<00:05:33.090> had<00:05:33.180> to<00:05:33.270> remember<00:05:33.540> which<00:05:33.720> ghosts<00:05:33.990> were

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
you had to remember which ghosts were

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.600 
you had to remember which ghosts were
here<00:05:34.410> is<00:05:34.500> you<00:05:34.860> know<00:05:34.950> it's<00:05:35.100> kind<00:05:35.280> of<00:05:35.340> funny<00:05:35.520> you

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
here is you know it's kind of funny you

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.370 
here is you know it's kind of funny you
have<00:05:35.850> to<00:05:35.940> remember<00:05:36.090> where<00:05:36.390> the<00:05:36.420> four<00:05:36.840> ghosts

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
have to remember where the four ghosts

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.700 
have to remember where the four ghosts
are<00:05:38.240> III<00:05:39.240> kept<00:05:39.720> forgetting<00:05:39.930> all<00:05:40.290> the<00:05:40.410> time<00:05:40.560> you

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
are III kept forgetting all the time you

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.560 
are III kept forgetting all the time you
could<00:05:40.800> ask<00:05:40.980> her<00:05:41.190> where<00:05:41.490> my<00:05:41.640> ghosts<00:05:42.060> were<00:05:42.270> I

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
could ask her where my ghosts were I

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.600 
could ask her where my ghosts were I
even<00:05:43.110> turned<00:05:43.320> one<00:05:43.560> over<00:05:43.830> one<00:05:43.980> time<00:05:44.190> that<00:05:44.370> was

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
even turned one over one time that was

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.330 
even turned one over one time that was
one<00:05:44.820> of<00:05:44.910> my<00:05:45.000> ghosts<00:05:45.450> which<00:05:46.020> is<00:05:46.200> IO<00:05:46.410> I<00:05:46.890> prefer

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
one of my ghosts which is IO I prefer

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.800 
one of my ghosts which is IO I prefer
for<00:05:47.550> players<00:05:47.850> that<00:05:47.970> way<00:05:48.240> you<00:05:48.300> can<00:05:48.510> only<00:05:48.630> have

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
for players that way you can only have

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.730 
for players that way you can only have
to<00:05:48.930> remember<00:05:49.140> -<00:05:49.410> ah<00:05:50.570> okay<00:05:51.570> now<00:05:51.960> I<00:05:51.990> think<00:05:52.230> the

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
to remember - ah okay now I think the

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.230 
to remember - ah okay now I think the
melody<00:05:53.040> mentioned<00:05:53.340> that<00:05:53.400> it's<00:05:53.820> harder<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.150> be

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
melody mentioned that it's harder to be

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.430 
melody mentioned that it's harder to be
the<00:05:54.360> ghost<00:05:54.570> and<00:05:54.900> I<00:05:54.990> think<00:05:55.200> that's<00:05:55.350> definitely

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
the ghost and I think that's definitely

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.320 
the ghost and I think that's definitely
true<00:05:56.040> because<00:05:56.580> if<00:05:56.700> you<00:05:56.760> use<00:05:56.880> any<00:05:57.060> kind<00:05:57.210> of

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
true because if you use any kind of

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.700 
true because if you use any kind of
logic<00:05:57.660> at<00:05:57.750> all<00:05:57.810> you<00:05:57.960> have<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.140> really<00:05:58.440> work

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
logic at all you have to really work

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.790 
logic at all you have to really work
hard<00:05:58.950> to<00:05:59.250> turn<00:06:00.000> over<00:06:00.240> ghosts<00:06:00.840> and<00:06:01.050> obviously

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
hard to turn over ghosts and obviously

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.370 
hard to turn over ghosts and obviously
you're<00:06:01.980> going<00:06:02.160> for<00:06:02.340> the<00:06:02.430> sixes<00:06:02.790> and<00:06:02.940> the<00:06:03.030> fives

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
you're going for the sixes and the fives

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.770 
you're going for the sixes and the fives
turning<00:06:04.380> them<00:06:04.530> over<00:06:04.680> destroying<00:06:05.190> those<00:06:05.340> rooms

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
turning them over destroying those rooms

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.370 
turning them over destroying those rooms
and<00:06:06.780> but<00:06:07.020> if<00:06:07.110> you<00:06:07.820> you<00:06:08.820> know<00:06:08.970> if<00:06:09.210> you<00:06:09.690> don't<00:06:10.020> go

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
and but if you you know if you don't go

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.870 
and but if you you know if you don't go
for<00:06:10.620> those<00:06:10.740> sixes<00:06:11.220> and<00:06:11.370> fives<00:06:11.430> and<00:06:11.760> turn<00:06:11.850> over

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
for those sixes and fives and turn over

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.100 
for those sixes and fives and turn over
low<00:06:12.120> numbers<00:06:12.420> you're<00:06:12.540> taking<00:06:12.840> the<00:06:12.900> chance

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
low numbers you're taking the chance

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.720 
low numbers you're taking the chance
that<00:06:13.290> they<00:06:13.410> will<00:06:13.530> just<00:06:13.740> by<00:06:13.920> accident<00:06:14.160> find

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
that they will just by accident find

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.830 
that they will just by accident find
your<00:06:14.880> ghost<00:06:16.340> it's<00:06:17.340> a<00:06:17.490> very<00:06:17.910> simple<00:06:18.360> game<00:06:18.510> I

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
your ghost it's a very simple game I

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.470 
your ghost it's a very simple game I
think<00:06:19.080> it<00:06:19.320> takes<00:06:19.560> ten<00:06:20.130> minutes<00:06:20.160> maybe<00:06:20.670> maybe

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
think it takes ten minutes maybe maybe

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.240 
think it takes ten minutes maybe maybe
longer<00:06:22.050> I<00:06:22.080> guess<00:06:22.320> if<00:06:22.470> your<00:06:22.590> full<00:06:22.770> night<00:06:22.920> but

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
longer I guess if your full night but

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.560 
longer I guess if your full night but
you<00:06:23.340> can<00:06:23.460> play<00:06:23.580> multiple<00:06:23.970> times<00:06:24.180> and<00:06:24.390> like<00:06:24.450> I

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
you can play multiple times and like I

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.480 
you can play multiple times and like I
said<00:06:24.630> the<00:06:25.230> best<00:06:25.410> way<00:06:25.650> I<00:06:25.680> think<00:06:25.830> the<00:06:26.130> play<00:06:26.310> is

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
said the best way I think the play is

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.570 
said the best way I think the play is
ghost<00:06:27.300> verse<00:06:27.840> human<00:06:28.590> and<00:06:28.770> then<00:06:29.100> you<00:06:29.250> switch

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
ghost verse human and then you switch

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.250 
ghost verse human and then you switch
and<00:06:29.850> see<00:06:30.030> who<00:06:30.120> gets<00:06:30.240> the<00:06:30.420> higher<00:06:30.570> score<00:06:30.900> the

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
and see who gets the higher score the

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260 
and see who gets the higher score the
whole<00:06:31.440> bidding<00:06:31.860> thing<00:06:32.100> is<00:06:32.280> a<00:06:32.310> waste<00:06:32.880> of<00:06:33.090> time

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
whole bidding thing is a waste of time

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.090 
whole bidding thing is a waste of time
it's<00:06:33.600> just<00:06:33.690> a<00:06:33.870> lot<00:06:34.110> faster<00:06:34.530> to<00:06:34.560> do<00:06:34.710> that

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 
it's just a lot faster to do that

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.160 
it's just a lot faster to do that
the<00:06:35.970> components<00:06:36.390> are<00:06:36.450> good<00:06:36.600> for<00:06:36.930> the<00:06:37.020> most

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.170 
the components are good for the most

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.850 
the components are good for the most
part<00:06:37.820> those<00:06:38.820> had<00:06:39.000> big<00:06:39.240> heads<00:06:39.510> yeah<00:06:40.380> and<00:06:40.740> my

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
part those had big heads yeah and my

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.020 
part those had big heads yeah and my
only<00:06:41.040> probably<00:06:41.340> come<00:06:41.520> on<00:06:41.580> it's<00:06:41.670> like<00:06:41.730> I<00:06:41.850> said

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
only probably come on it's like I said

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.870 
only probably come on it's like I said
is<00:06:42.150> pushing<00:06:42.630> those<00:06:42.780> tokens<00:06:43.410> in<00:06:43.620> was<00:06:44.370> really

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
is pushing those tokens in was really

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.700 
is pushing those tokens in was really
tight<00:06:45.090> fit<00:06:45.330> because<00:06:45.870> you're<00:06:46.200> covering<00:06:46.590> them

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
tight fit because you're covering them

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.140 
tight fit because you're covering them
up<00:06:46.800> anyway<00:06:47.190> I<00:06:47.220> didn't<00:06:47.550> see<00:06:47.640> why<00:06:47.820> you<00:06:47.880> couldn't

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
up anyway I didn't see why you couldn't

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.340 
up anyway I didn't see why you couldn't
they<00:06:48.390> couldn't<00:06:48.510> have<00:06:48.720> made<00:06:48.810> them<00:06:48.960> smaller<00:06:49.260> I

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
they couldn't have made them smaller I

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.810 
they couldn't have made them smaller I
don't<00:06:49.710> think<00:06:49.830> they<00:06:49.890> needed<00:06:50.070> to<00:06:50.190> fit<00:06:50.340> in<00:06:50.430> snugly

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
don't think they needed to fit in snugly

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.970 
don't think they needed to fit in snugly
at<00:06:50.940> all<00:06:51.090> so<00:06:51.870> that's<00:06:52.080> kind<00:06:52.320> of<00:06:52.380> a<00:06:52.470> bummer<00:06:52.710> but<00:06:52.890> it

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
at all so that's kind of a bummer but it

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.860 
at all so that's kind of a bummer but it
does<00:06:53.100> fit<00:06:53.250> all<00:06:53.400> in<00:06:53.430> the<00:06:53.550> Box<00:06:53.730> very<00:06:53.940> nicely<00:06:54.210> the

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
does fit all in the Box very nicely the

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.660 
does fit all in the Box very nicely the
the<00:06:55.170> artwork<00:06:55.590> is<00:06:55.770> great<00:06:56.010> I<00:06:56.040> think<00:06:56.190> the<00:06:56.400> art<00:06:56.520> for

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:56.670 
the artwork is great I think the art for

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.740 
the artwork is great I think the art for
each<00:06:56.820> room<00:06:57.120> is<00:06:57.270> different

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
each room is different

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.270 
each room is different
including<00:06:58.110> a<00:06:58.170> front<00:06:58.410> and<00:06:58.560> backs<00:06:58.800> and<00:06:59.010> that's<00:06:59.160> a

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
including a front and backs and that's a

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.820 
including a front and backs and that's a
cool<00:06:59.490> mechanic<00:06:59.670> but<00:07:00.630> it's<00:07:00.930> like<00:07:01.170> I<00:07:01.410> think<00:07:01.620> of

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
cool mechanic but it's like I think of

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.670 
cool mechanic but it's like I think of
this<00:07:01.920> as<00:07:01.980> minesweeper<00:07:02.970> the<00:07:03.660> multiplayer<00:07:04.320> game

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 
this as minesweeper the multiplayer game

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.670 
this as minesweeper the multiplayer game
what<00:07:05.640> are<00:07:05.700> your<00:07:05.790> final<00:07:05.970> thoughts<00:07:06.470> it<00:07:07.470> was<00:07:07.620> a

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
what are your final thoughts it was a

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.240 
what are your final thoughts it was a
lot<00:07:07.980> of<00:07:08.010> fun<00:07:08.460> can't<00:07:08.910> wait<00:07:09.090> to<00:07:09.210> play<00:07:09.360> it<00:07:09.540> again
