00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.050
 one two three four! 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.990
 Upgrade your engine! 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.980
 Itâ€™s time for scottykilmer.com. 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.090
 Can we solve it? 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.362
 Can we? 

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:24.880
 I found a problem with car manufacturing 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.630
 Fool is even good mechanics, this is what it is. 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.570
 So the car is like a human. 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.060
 They must breathe, so make sure the filter is clean, 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.040
 But they also have to breathe out 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.000
 Your car breathes out through the tailpipe. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.670
 If the exhaust system is blocked, it will not operate correctly. 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.870
 In modern cars, this is usually the catalytic converter. 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.550
 That is blocked, so I am going to tell you how to check it. 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.187
 Since the catalytic converter is at the bottom of the car, 

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:55.020
 We are talking about it and we can see it better. 

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:00.550
 That is the catalytic converter. 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.630
 But it is a sealed unit, so how do you check it? 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.277
 Well, I am going to drill and measure 

00:01:06.277 --> 00:01:08.110
 The exhaust pressure is in this small size, 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.260
 It will tell us if it is blocked 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.484
 First, you drill a 1/4 hole in a tube. 

00:01:13.484 --> 00:01:14.380
 Hey, hey! 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.130
 Scotty is what you are doing in my car! 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.360
 I have these small metal plugs filled with holes 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.170
 When I finish 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.670
 Then you insist on measuring in the hole 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.580
 Measure the pressure catalytic converter behind the pressure. 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.785
 We will start the engine to see what pressure it is. 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.075
 Well, the pressure behind it is less than a pound. 

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:37.670
 It's in green, so that's fine. 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.745
 Now I have to drill a hole in front of the cat. 

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:41.036
 And measure the pressure there. 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.610
 Now I hooked the hose in front 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.980
 The catalytic converter has a pressure of nearly 15 pounds. 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.780
 This means that pressure is increasing 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.238
 Catalytic converter in front of 

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.480
 Because it is blocked 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.350
 It requires a new catalytic converter. 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.380
 This is a skill of a mechanic. 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.200
 If your car is missing more than 70,000 miles 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.060
 Or less than seven years old, there is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.460
 The federal warranty covers catalytic converters. 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.870
 You can get one for free 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.479
 If it is older than this or you have more mileage, 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.220
 Go to the discount muffler store, they 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.200
 Can weld a universal cat and save you 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.340
 A lot of money. 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.280
 So don't let your mechanics make simple work complicated. 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.760
 Now you know that this looks like a simple job for the average person. 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.530
 It only takes a few minutes to check the catalytic converter. 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.100
 And remember, if you have any car problems, just 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.754
