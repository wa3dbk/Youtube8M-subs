that is at the end of this video first
I'll<00:00:16.269> start<00:00:16.570> off<00:00:16.869> with<00:00:19.560> horizontal<00:00:20.560> line<00:00:20.739> like

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
I'll start off with horizontal line like

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:27.749 
I'll start off with horizontal line like
that<00:00:20.980> and<00:00:22.319> on<00:00:23.319> this<00:00:24.039> side<00:00:24.369> I'll<00:00:24.609> draw<00:00:24.999> a<00:00:26.759> small

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
that and on this side I'll draw a small

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.240 
that and on this side I'll draw a small
curve<00:00:28.210> like<00:00:28.659> that<00:00:30.539> I'm<00:00:31.539> going<00:00:31.839> to<00:00:31.869> go<00:00:32.020> up<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
curve like that I'm going to go up and

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.350 
curve like that I'm going to go up and
I'll<00:00:33.850> curve<00:00:34.210> the<00:00:34.720> other<00:00:35.020> way<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:37.120> now

may be goodness is dripping over the
edge<00:00:53.230> of<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.680> glass<00:00:54.690> well<00:00:55.690> made<00:00:55.840> some<00:00:56.140> some<00:00:56.770> of

there's a highlight on that side all

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.560 
there's a highlight on that side all
right<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> actual<00:01:16.020> cup<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.830> glass

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
right as for the actual cup for glass

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.210 
right as for the actual cup for glass
I'll<00:01:18.570> draw<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.020> straight<00:01:19.350> line<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.799> down<00:01:19.830> but

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
I'll draw a straight line going down but

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.800 
I'll draw a straight line going down but
it's<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.550> down<00:01:20.729> at<00:01:20.940> an<00:01:21.240> angle<00:01:23.540> I'll<00:01:24.540> draw

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
it's going down at an angle I'll draw

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.719 
it's going down at an angle I'll draw
another<00:01:24.840> line<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.740> down<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:27.110> and

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
another line going down like this and

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.160 
another line going down like this and
for<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> bottom<00:01:30.149> part<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> glass

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
for the bottom part of the glass

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.219 
for the bottom part of the glass
I'll<00:01:31.890> keep<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.280> too<00:01:32.430> curved<00:01:32.869> to<00:01:33.869> make<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> look

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
I'll keep it too curved to make a look

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.499 
I'll keep it too curved to make a look
more<00:01:34.409> 3d<00:01:36.440> okay<00:01:37.470> draw<00:01:37.920> another<00:01:38.390> curved<00:01:39.390> line

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
more 3d okay draw another curved line

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.460 
more 3d okay draw another curved line
and<00:01:41.840> for<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.929> top<00:01:43.200> part<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:44.060> destroying<00:01:45.470> I'll

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and for the top part of destroying I'll

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.070 
and for the top part of destroying I'll
make<00:01:46.800> one<00:01:47.190> big<00:01:47.490> curve<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.539> this<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
make one big curve so this is going to

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.840 
make one big curve so this is going to
be<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.350> scrumptious<00:01:49.950> strawberry<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.850> I'm

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
stripes are also curved too that makes

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.379 
stripes are also curved too that makes
the<00:02:40.389> straw<00:02:40.629> look<00:02:40.810> more<00:02:41.260> 3d<00:02:44.849> okay<00:02:45.849> for<00:02:46.269> the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
going to be grinning so I summarized the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.530 
going to be grinning so I summarized the
teeth<00:02:55.810> by<00:02:56.260> drawing<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.919> small<00:02:57.700> little<00:02:58.359> line

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
teeth by drawing a small little line

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:07.319 
teeth by drawing a small little line
inside<00:03:02.730> big<00:03:03.730> cheek<00:03:04.030> curves<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:06.150> I'll<00:03:07.150> draw

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
inside big cheek curves and I'll draw

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.920 
inside big cheek curves and I'll draw
one<00:03:07.359> fun2draw<00:03:07.989> eye<00:03:08.139> on<00:03:08.319> top<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.709> each<00:03:08.859> curve<00:03:09.930> so

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
one fun2draw eye on top of each curve so

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.159 
one fun2draw eye on top of each curve so
there's<00:03:11.169> the<00:03:11.290> first<00:03:11.530> line<00:03:12.480> for<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.569> eye<00:03:13.750> and

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:14.169 
there's the first line for the eye and

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.440 
there's the first line for the eye and
here<00:03:14.650> comes<00:03:14.859> the<00:03:14.980> second<00:03:15.310> one<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.939> that<00:03:16.090> forms

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
here comes the second one so that forms

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.030 
here comes the second one so that forms
the<00:03:16.569> leaf<00:03:16.780> shape<00:03:17.079> I'll<00:03:17.769> draw<00:03:18.040> one<00:03:18.189> more<00:03:18.489> curve

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
the leaf shape I'll draw one more curve

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.530 
the leaf shape I'll draw one more curve
so<00:03:21.040> now<00:03:21.189> we<00:03:21.250> have<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.609> side<00:03:21.879> of<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.150> eye<00:03:22.180> and

letter<00:04:55.620> views<00:04:55.979> that<00:04:56.310> are<00:04:56.340> upside<00:04:56.729> down<00:04:57.800> so

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
letter views that are upside down so

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.480 
letter views that are upside down so
we'll<00:04:58.979> draw<00:04:59.250> three<00:04:59.610> across<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.120> top<00:05:01.070> and<00:05:02.070> if

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490
