00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.680
 imc was founded in 2004 is the main idea behind the project was 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.650
 imploded concept of traditional videogames and create the simulator with 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.650
 desired conditions 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.789
 were 1 816 motoring is a fascinating sport and very comfort without 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:25.850
 seams the mind 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.949
 most people have no idea of ​​the work of the pilots inside the car 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.879
 since it is an expensive sport inaccessible to the general public 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.760
 it was sad 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.070
 the simulator offers the opportunity to experience the experience of running adjust the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.250
 recognizing the best track of various tracks even 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.650
 way to drive 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.490
 racing against other riders online you have the chance to hone the drop 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.180
 days past 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.470
 alexandra costa 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.490
 from the year 2010 to invest sooner noticed the officer of the nascar 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.680
 pilots like I went wrong junior I will be here testing 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.790
 in similar simulators there is a little of the line 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.430
 about 10 changed ideas to $ 12 thousand over $ 250 you 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.410
 can run 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.030
 the simulator looks like 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.310
 Let's go first, then. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.700
 the simulator that gave July already in cement 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.170
 besides choosing the car and the track is the program allows you to do all 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.170
 possible adjustments to chassis and suspension 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.630
 but for those who do not want or have no way of being chief mechanics, 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.590
 have a problem 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.560
 in the last ten years we have finally offered the setap 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.300
 for each track 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.700
 designed for easy pilotage 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.150
 and also ended the most advanced 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.330
 you can adapt and it will be up to your riding style without mourning guard and until 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
 even comparative the usufructuary 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.750
 it was interesting twice 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.020
 you can not compete before 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 and take your license or compete with others 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.600
 amateurs 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.860
 the simulator 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.170
 You have to take your leave, for example, it would not be today. 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.710
 I had three, I'd be doing two tenths before I got my wallet. 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.689
 rs driver to race through the gap 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.159
 against other pilots 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.569
 today more than 12 thousand participants online 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.519
 and 40% of them out of the stadiums 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.359
 Europeans and Australians make the majority of this group 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.839
 but also to many South Americans 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:32.050
 this number should increase further 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.050
 the official nasa sanctioned championship 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:41.369
 the slowness was January fry dogs that ask for raise and indian landmarks 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.369
 ambrose with liberal are part of the school committee 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.890
 pictures we worked hard to make a faithful reproduction of the 13 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.539
 reviews 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.689
 from there the process consists of spreading the laser to the tracks at all angles 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.519
 traveled by a car 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.099
 we took eight hours to scan 800 meters of floor to level of accuracy 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.479
 can be measured from uncertainties 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.069
 Reserve 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.379
 yea 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.200
 so if you know the oval circuit of our system you basically 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.819
 knows the track 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.710
 if someday you can run real in the same place 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.899
 You already know exactly what to expect. 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.899
 I'm going to make the best outline of the streets of Bahia and Sergipe. 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.109
 with the clues also come the need of the behavior of the boys that is the 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.679
 as accurate as possible for ancient models the lotus fans the engineers 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:36.969
 used information from pilots and trainers who worked on the case 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.699
 but for newer models 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.680
 it is possible to give details provided by manufacturers 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.539
 and features like skin 3 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:49.419
 the arrest warrant, what we do is to rebuild a car piece by piece 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.719
 all formations 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.169
 calculating the laws related to these products 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:59.139
 we calculate the profile ratio of each type of tire per 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.139
 suspension according to speed at each different visit 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:06.539
 the result motivated the pain closely resembles the result the actual 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:09.779
 you can calculate the field reaction 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.069
 aveirense relation to the speed of the car 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.969
 center of gravity on the curve 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:15.739
 and other variables 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.620
 dispute is calculated by dividing equally afterwards by 

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:22.159
 so the real feel of driving 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.569
 we have to turn everything into detail-level numbers that I 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.569
 never expected 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.020
 big companies 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.249
 I believe that our differential will be attention to detail 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:37.430
 although there is no tire wear on the tracks 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.610
 until the aerodynamics of the cases 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.890
 we lost all suspension details 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.010
 so that the car behaves in the same way that it would behave in reality 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.610
 since we believe that it is more fun to learn to fly the ones to play 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.889
 video game
