00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.530
 to say activity does yours 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.930
 character throws him up level 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.320
 through a quest chain that is there 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.860

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.840
 nice db squash juice after one 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.180
 nice squeeze of balls I don't know 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.130
 not even how many days do you arrive at 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.870
 maximum level and will say chaos 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.240
 now it's fun 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.820
 they are strong maximum level all split 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.740
 no if you do not do a minimum of 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.950
 equipment of his carmina 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.280
 slaughter is not even known who said then 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.240
 a TV that really moved basic 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.730
 useless in practice kakÃ  if you accuse them 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.160
 random keys on the keyboard 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.520
 hoping the opponent will die before 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.190
 that there is no tactic is a tender end 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.770
 who gives me a muscle spasm on 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.300
 keyboard 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.160
 not to mention the fact that if it does not open 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.490
 the wallet is useless already playing 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.470
 with legends the success of your character is 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.770
 directly proportional to the quantity 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:14.530
 of money you vote in the trash but then 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:20.920
 oh god you got it right with the 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:23.650
 name dried up on the floor really good 10 e 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.210
 praise for the name looks but now comes 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.060
 the main course boys 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.610
 the appetizer is finished the icing on the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.060
 cake this is not a icing on the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.130
 cake is the icing on the cake there are 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.650
 these instances in the game practically yes 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.510
 they deal with dungeon caves as I have to 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.910
 call where you have to go with a 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.400
 parquet of people to kill various 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.630
 monsters and final bosses in the hope of 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.989
 find an object for yours 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.970
 character so far 10 goes well is normal 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.130
 in the end, however, to hear these 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.290
 statistics 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.420
 the game is divided into five classes of 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.110
 where everyone wears armor and uses 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.910
 different weapons 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.380
 counting that in an instance 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.100
 possibility to find an object for the 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.930
 your class and how to guess at the first one 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.690
 try the number of those in the ass 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.500
 of the neighbor's dog seriously e 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.690
 as is such a thing as a type 1 out of 100 but 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.489
 I'm saying random numbers is i 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.500
 Game moderators due to 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.769
 complaints from players have 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.720
 had to play 100 bags and kill them 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:29.019
 everyone to see things left in 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:33.160
 earth and over 100 have too much alone 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.630
 an orange, but as it does now far 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.880
 can you say ok 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.070
 Oh well 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.640
 in short, I distance myself sooner or later though 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.670
 something no no now comes the beauty 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.340
 after you have finished distance you must 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.250
 wait up to 12 hours to be able to do so 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.340
 redo the time it takes to finish 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.620
 once at a distance and on average 3 hours 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.430
 then without counting casini people who die 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.320
 people who fuck up so it's a waste 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.720
 of total time if you have an object 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.020
 exactly what you need for your class 12 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.620
 hours that are those of rejection 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.940
 of the instance plus three hours to do the in 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:23.370
 room we are 15 hours a hundred times 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:27.020
 it's 1500 hours to find an item 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.020
 waste of life so complete 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:36.450
 you guys now that you have assisted in a 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.640
 a game of unclean ugliness 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.020
 first of all I apologize I feel in 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.700
 blame for getting through 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.920
 a traumatic experience watching 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.660
 then these video clips for 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.790
 counterbalance your mood 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.200
 and risk your mental health 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.240
 I will assist you in something more 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.020
 pleasant relaxing and mentally 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.020
 stimulant
