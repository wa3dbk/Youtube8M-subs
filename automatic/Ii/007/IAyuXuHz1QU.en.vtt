and<00:01:24.810> once<00:01:24.930> again<00:01:25.050> you'll<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.680> simulation

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
and once again you'll see the simulation

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.600 
and once again you'll see the simulation
slow<00:01:26.580> down<00:01:26.820> at<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.720> point<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.050> impact<00:01:28.490> but<00:01:29.490> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
slow down at the point of impact but you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.310 
slow down at the point of impact but you
can<00:01:29.760> see<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.330> radial<00:01:30.690> field<00:01:30.870> is<00:01:31.020> having

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
can see that the radial field is having

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.520 
can see that the radial field is having
an<00:01:31.410> effect<00:01:31.710> now

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
an effect now

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.109 
an effect now
in<00:01:33.590> fact<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.979> radial<00:01:34.280> field<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:34.610> having<00:01:34.880> too

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
in fact the radial field is having too

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.840 
in fact the radial field is having too
much<00:01:35.299> effect<00:01:35.750> it's<00:01:36.500> pushing<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.100> shards<00:01:37.640> on

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
much effect it's pushing the shards on

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.240 
much effect it's pushing the shards on
every<00:01:38.479> frame<00:01:38.840> because<00:01:39.409> it<00:01:39.530> has<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.650> constant

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
every frame because it has a constant

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.190 
every frame because it has a constant
magnitude<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:41.000> that<00:01:41.510> is<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.780> effect<00:01:42.110> of

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
magnitude and that is the effect of

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.710 
magnitude and that is the effect of
causing<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.680> shards<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.250> fly<00:01:43.610> out<00:01:43.909> in<00:01:44.210> a

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
causing the shards to fly out in a

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.930 
causing the shards to fly out in a
really<00:01:44.990> unnatural<00:01:45.320> fashion<00:01:46.159> let's<00:01:46.759> do

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
really unnatural fashion let's do

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:56.990 
really unnatural fashion let's do
another<00:01:47.060> play<00:01:47.450> blast<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:47.990> we<00:01:48.110> can<00:01:48.259> compare

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.110 

here's<00:01:58.000> that<00:01:58.180> play<00:01:58.390> blast<00:01:58.660> now

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
here's that play blast now

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.970 
here's that play blast now
and<00:02:00.240> here<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.080> can<00:02:01.200> see<00:02:01.470> more<00:02:01.680> clearly

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
and here you can see more clearly

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.950 
and here you can see more clearly
because<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.640> running<00:02:03.090> at<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.300> constant<00:02:03.450> rate

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
because it's running at a constant rate

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.840 
because it's running at a constant rate
of<00:02:04.170> speed<00:02:04.500> I'll<00:02:05.490> loop<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:07.640> because<00:02:08.640> the

of speed I'll loop that because the

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.210 

now<00:07:12.540> as<00:07:12.720> you<00:07:12.870> can<00:07:13.020> see<00:07:13.080> having<00:07:13.620> change<00:07:13.980> those

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 
now as you can see having change those

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.490 
now as you can see having change those
attributes<00:07:14.730> I<00:07:14.880> get<00:07:15.030> a<00:07:15.060> much<00:07:15.330> different<00:07:15.630> result

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
attributes I get a much different result

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.470 
attributes I get a much different result
shards<00:07:17.830> of<00:07:17.950> the<00:07:18.070> bricks<00:07:18.340> don't<00:07:19.240> move<00:07:19.420> very

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.480 
shards of the bricks don't move very

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.330 
shards of the bricks don't move very
much<00:07:19.840> because<00:07:20.380> they<00:07:20.530> have<00:07:20.740> a<00:07:20.770> high<00:07:21.010> friction

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:21.340 
much because they have a high friction

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.450 
much because they have a high friction
and<00:07:21.820> a<00:07:21.940> low<00:07:22.150> bounciness<00:07:22.950> at<00:07:23.950> this<00:07:24.130> point<00:07:24.370> I

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.460 
and a low bounciness at this point I

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.100 
and a low bounciness at this point I
would<00:07:24.520> go<00:07:24.730> back<00:07:24.760> into<00:07:25.150> these<00:07:25.300> attributes<00:07:25.540> and

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.110 
would go back into these attributes and

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.140 
would go back into these attributes and
experiment<00:07:26.800> with<00:07:26.860> their<00:07:27.130> values<00:07:27.640> in<00:07:27.850> order<00:07:28.060> to

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.150 
experiment with their values in order to

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.900 
experiment with their values in order to
get<00:07:28.300> the<00:07:28.450> look<00:07:28.600> that<00:07:28.660> I<00:07:28.840> want<00:07:29.190> in<00:07:30.190> order<00:07:30.460> to<00:07:30.700> see

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910 
get the look that I want in order to see

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.300 
get the look that I want in order to see
the<00:07:31.420> result<00:07:31.810> in<00:07:32.020> real<00:07:32.260> time<00:07:32.530> you'll<00:07:32.980> have<00:07:33.160> to

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:33.310 
the result in real time you'll have to

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.600 
the result in real time you'll have to
do<00:07:33.430> a<00:07:33.460> play<00:07:33.670> blast<00:07:33.940> once<00:07:34.180> again

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610 
do a play blast once again

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.550 
do a play blast once again
