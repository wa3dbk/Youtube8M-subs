00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
really get many shipments of these

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.740 
really get many shipments of these
anymore

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750

in<00:01:57.869> very<00:01:58.020> high<00:01:58.140> demand<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.590> mean<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.860> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
in very high demand I mean it's a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.940 
in very high demand I mean it's a
GameCube<00:01:59.250> controller<00:02:00.320> however<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.920> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
GameCube controller however this is a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.789 
GameCube controller however this is a
really<00:02:02.310> good<00:02:02.460> controller<00:02:02.909> I'm<00:02:03.869> impressed

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
really good controller I'm impressed

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.490 
really good controller I'm impressed
now<00:02:05.729> game<00:02:06.659> key<00:02:06.810> was<00:02:06.930> one<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.140> my<00:02:07.200> favorite

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
now game key was one of my favorite

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.710 
now game key was one of my favorite
systems<00:02:07.649> as<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.220> system<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.580> grew<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.690> I

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
systems as the system I grew up on so I

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.300 
systems as the system I grew up on so I
can't<00:02:10.140> say<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.739> better<00:02:10.950> than<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
can't say this is better than the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.040 
can't say this is better than the
standard<00:02:11.700> controller

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
standard controller

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.130 
standard controller
it's<00:02:14.050> actually<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:15.370> about<00:02:15.640> even<00:02:16.140> there's

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
it's actually just about even there's

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.750 
it's actually just about even there's
some<00:02:17.350> things<00:02:17.620> about<00:02:17.800> this<00:02:18.069> controller<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.700> I

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
some things about this controller that I

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.760 
some things about this controller that I
like<00:02:19.060> much<00:02:19.360> more<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.930> standard<00:02:20.140> GameCube

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
like much more of the standard GameCube

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.770 
like much more of the standard GameCube
controller<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.370> there's<00:02:22.330> some<00:02:22.450> things<00:02:22.690> that

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
controller and there's some things that

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.930 
controller and there's some things that
I<00:02:22.959> don't<00:02:23.290> like<00:02:23.560> much<00:02:23.890> about<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.550> controller

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
I don't like much about this controller

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.820 
I don't like much about this controller
compared<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.630> standard<00:02:25.840> GameCube

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
compared to the standard GameCube

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.309 
compared to the standard GameCube
controller<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.250> have<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.790> standard<00:02:28.319> GameCube

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
controller I have a standard GameCube

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.150 
controller I have a standard GameCube
controller<00:02:29.790> right<00:02:30.790> here<00:02:30.850> for<00:02:31.420> comparison

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
controller right here for comparison

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.220 
controller right here for comparison
just<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.310> can<00:02:33.520> get<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.670> quick<00:02:33.940> look<00:02:34.239> one

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
just so you can get a quick look one

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.170 
just so you can get a quick look one
notable<00:02:35.530> difference<00:02:35.890> is<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.370> analog<00:02:36.790> stick

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
notable difference is the analog stick

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.479 
notable difference is the analog stick
has<00:02:37.510> these<00:02:37.720> ridges<00:02:38.620> here<00:02:38.650> on<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
has these ridges here on the on the

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.390 
has these ridges here on the on the
regular<00:02:39.819> one<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.150> this<00:02:40.569> one<00:02:40.720> has<00:02:40.840> more<00:02:41.080> of<00:02:41.140> a

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
regular one and this one has more of a

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.350 
regular one and this one has more of a
playstation<00:02:42.900> matte<00:02:43.900> finish<00:02:44.530> kind<00:02:44.920> of<00:02:45.360> texture

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
playstation matte finish kind of texture

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.770 
playstation matte finish kind of texture
on<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.560> analog<00:02:48.250> stick<00:02:48.519> also<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.180> C<00:02:49.390> stick<00:02:49.630> on

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
on that analog stick also the C stick on

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.380 
on that analog stick also the C stick on
this<00:02:49.900> has<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.170> rubber<00:02:50.700> finish<00:02:51.700> rubber<00:02:52.030> grip

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
this has a rubber finish rubber grip

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.570 
this has a rubber finish rubber grip
this<00:02:52.780> one<00:02:52.989> does<00:02:53.200> not<00:02:53.230> have<00:02:53.470> any<00:02:53.650> rubber<00:02:53.860> it

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
this one does not have any rubber it

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.100 
this one does not have any rubber it
does<00:02:54.760> have<00:02:54.940> an<00:02:55.030> indent<00:02:55.390> which<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.900> one

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
does have an indent which this one

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.160 
does have an indent which this one
doesn't<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:58.090> is<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.269> primary<00:02:58.690> differences

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
doesn't this is the primary differences

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.350 
doesn't this is the primary differences
however<00:02:59.560> there's<00:02:59.920> also<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.459> second<00:03:01.150> trigger

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
however there's also a second trigger

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.840 
however there's also a second trigger
button<00:03:01.750> up<00:03:02.170> here<00:03:02.530> as<00:03:02.680> well<00:03:02.890> as<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.100> word<00:03:03.250> turbo

button up here as well as the word turbo

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.620 
button up here as well as the word turbo
I<00:03:04.920> will<00:03:05.920> get<00:03:06.069> that<00:03:06.190> later<00:03:06.459> in<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.760> review<00:03:06.910> but

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
I will get that later in the review but

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.559 
I will get that later in the review but
that<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.200> significant<00:03:09.160> difference<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.670> the

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
that is a significant difference to the

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.180 
that is a significant difference to the
game<00:03:10.959> view<00:03:11.110> controller<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.680> happens<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.100> be

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
game view controller this happens to be

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.970 
game view controller this happens to be
the<00:03:12.310> orange<00:03:12.580> spice<00:03:12.910> GameCube<00:03:13.510> controller<00:03:13.980> but

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
the orange spice GameCube controller but

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.220 
the orange spice GameCube controller but
it's<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.400> same<00:03:15.580> as<00:03:15.790> all<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.030> other<00:03:16.269> GameCube

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
it's the same as all the other GameCube

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.860 
it's the same as all the other GameCube
controllers<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.820> I'd<00:03:22.360> like<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.570> talk<00:03:22.750> about

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
controllers so I'd like to talk about

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.030 
controllers so I'd like to talk about
first<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.560> analog<00:03:23.950> sticks<00:03:25.350> these<00:03:26.350> are<00:03:26.590> half

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
first the analog sticks these are half

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.870 
first the analog sticks these are half
and<00:03:27.250> half<00:03:27.370> for<00:03:27.400> me<00:03:27.610> I<00:03:28.530> really<00:03:29.530> like<00:03:29.739> the<00:03:30.489> analog

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
and half for me I really like the analog

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.410 
and half for me I really like the analog
sticks<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.360> tightness<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.900> them<00:03:32.110> and<00:03:33.420> they're

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
sticks the tightness of them and they're

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.060 
sticks the tightness of them and they're
pretty<00:03:34.510> much<00:03:34.720> identical<00:03:34.900> really<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.950> the

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
pretty much identical really to the

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.670 
pretty much identical really to the
regular<00:03:36.430> GameCube<00:03:36.790> controllers<00:03:37.410> now<00:03:38.410> because

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
regular GameCube controllers now because

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.620 
regular GameCube controllers now because
I<00:03:38.769> grew<00:03:38.980> up<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.190> GameCube<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.760> don't<00:03:40.030> like<00:03:40.299> this

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
I grew up on GameCube I don't like this

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.569 
I grew up on GameCube I don't like this
rubber<00:03:41.140> grip<00:03:41.470> as<00:03:41.620> much<00:03:41.829> as<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.070> standard<00:03:42.400> game

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
rubber grip as much as the standard game

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.270 
rubber grip as much as the standard game
view<00:03:42.760> controller<00:03:42.790> grip<00:03:43.380> but<00:03:44.380> if<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.650> are<00:03:44.920> more

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
view controller grip but if you are more

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.650 
view controller grip but if you are more
of<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.400> PlayStation<00:03:45.940> fan<00:03:46.120> you're<00:03:46.299> gonna<00:03:46.390> love

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
of a PlayStation fan you're gonna love

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.390 
of a PlayStation fan you're gonna love
this<00:03:46.870> analog<00:03:47.290> stick<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.530> lot<00:03:47.739> more<00:03:48.010> because<00:03:48.310> it

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
this analog stick a lot more because it

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.680 
this analog stick a lot more because it
really<00:03:48.640> does<00:03:48.790> feel<00:03:49.000> exactly<00:03:49.540> like<00:03:49.660> a

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
really does feel exactly like a

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.890 
really does feel exactly like a
PlayStation<00:03:51.660> however<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:53.530> C<00:03:54.040> stick<00:03:54.900> because

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
PlayStation however the C stick because

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.990 
PlayStation however the C stick because
it<00:03:56.230> has<00:03:56.380> no<00:03:56.590> rubber<00:03:56.799> grip<00:03:57.100> now<00:03:57.280> it's<00:03:57.519> quite

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
it has no rubber grip now it's quite

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.150 
it has no rubber grip now it's quite
easy<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.079> know<00:03:59.170> move<00:03:59.410> around<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.980> does

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
easy to you know move around it does

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.039 
easy to you know move around it does
have<00:04:00.340> a<00:04:00.370> nice<00:04:00.640> indent<00:04:01.269> for<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.660> so<00:04:01.870> you<00:04:01.930> can

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
have a nice indent for you so you can

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.180 
have a nice indent for you so you can
definitely<00:04:02.200> place<00:04:02.560> your<00:04:02.739> thumb<00:04:02.950> in<00:04:03.070> there

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
definitely place your thumb in there

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.729 
definitely place your thumb in there
well<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.640> have<00:04:04.450> full<00:04:04.720> control<00:04:05.019> over<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.440> but

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
well and have full control over you but

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.310 
well and have full control over you but
the<00:04:05.859> problem<00:04:06.040> is<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:06.940> doesn't<00:04:07.000> feel<00:04:07.600> symmetric

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
the problem is it doesn't feel symmetric

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.349 
the problem is it doesn't feel symmetric
and<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:09.280> kind<00:04:09.579> of<00:04:09.609> gives<00:04:09.790> you<00:04:09.910> an<00:04:09.970> odd<00:04:10.060> feeling

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
and it kind of gives you an odd feeling

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.420 
and it kind of gives you an odd feeling
when<00:04:11.320> you're<00:04:11.440> using<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.799> controller<00:04:12.130> you<00:04:12.280> get

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
when you're using the controller you get

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.890 
when you're using the controller you get
used<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:12.700> it<00:04:12.790> over<00:04:12.910> time<00:04:13.180> but<00:04:13.329> it's<00:04:13.660> just<00:04:13.750> a

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
used to it over time but it's just a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.539 
used to it over time but it's just a
little<00:04:14.049> weird<00:04:14.290> if<00:04:14.920> you're<00:04:15.100> gonna<00:04:15.220> have<00:04:15.370> rubber

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
little weird if you're gonna have rubber

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.069 
little weird if you're gonna have rubber
on<00:04:15.700> this<00:04:15.820> one<00:04:16.000> night<00:04:16.180> why<00:04:16.390> not<00:04:16.570> that<00:04:16.780> one<00:04:16.959> I

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
on this one night why not that one I

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.789 
on this one night why not that one I
don't<00:04:17.169> really<00:04:17.470> don't<00:04:17.680> understand<00:04:18.100> that<00:04:19.799> now

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
don't really don't understand that now

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.770 
don't really don't understand that now
one<00:04:21.130> thing<00:04:21.310> I<00:04:21.370> do<00:04:21.430> like<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.760> lot<00:04:22.030> better<00:04:22.240> than

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
one thing I do like a lot better than

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.120 
one thing I do like a lot better than
the<00:04:22.930> standard<00:04:23.229> games.you<00:04:23.500> controller<00:04:23.950> is<00:04:24.010> the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
the standard games.you controller is the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.370 
the standard games.you controller is the
buttons

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
buttons

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.880 
buttons
the<00:04:26.380> buns<00:04:26.590> I<00:04:31.410> don't<00:04:32.410> know<00:04:32.500> if<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.620> can<00:04:32.770> hear

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
the buns I don't know if you can hear

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.790 
the buns I don't know if you can hear
that<00:04:33.100> but<00:04:33.460> uh<00:04:33.490> they<00:04:34.210> click<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.600> lot<00:04:34.840> more<00:04:35.080> they

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
that but uh they click a lot more they

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.680 
that but uh they click a lot more they
come<00:04:36.070> out<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.280> bit<00:04:36.610> more<00:04:36.820> than<00:04:37.180> on<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.390> regular

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
come out a bit more than on the regular

come out a bit more than on the regular
game<00:04:37.840> view<00:04:38.020> controller<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.950> then<00:04:39.130> they<00:04:39.280> push

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
game view controller and then they push

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.240 
game view controller and then they push
in<00:04:39.640> a<00:04:39.670> bit<00:04:39.850> more<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:41.590> gives<00:04:41.770> you<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.920> night<00:04:42.220> a

in a bit more and it gives you a night a
really<00:04:42.820> nice<00:04:43.060> clicking<00:04:43.750> feeling<00:04:44.230> which<00:04:47.790> the

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
really nice clicking feeling which the

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.060 
really nice clicking feeling which the
original<00:04:48.970> GameCube<00:04:49.630> controller<00:04:50.230> doesn't

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
original GameCube controller doesn't

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.950 
original GameCube controller doesn't
really<00:04:51.460> have<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:51.910> buttons<00:04:52.570> don't<00:04:52.720> really

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
really have the buttons don't really

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.780 
really have the buttons don't really
click<00:04:53.140> at<00:04:53.290> all<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:53.680> there's<00:04:54.340> just<00:04:54.490> something

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
click at all and there's just something

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.030 
click at all and there's just something
satisfying<00:04:55.480> and<00:04:55.780> responsive<00:04:56.560> about<00:04:56.830> this

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
satisfying and responsive about this

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.810 
satisfying and responsive about this
click<00:04:57.510> that<00:04:58.510> buttons<00:04:58.930> make<00:04:59.080> on<00:04:59.260> controllers

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
click that buttons make on controllers

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.170 
click that buttons make on controllers
and<00:05:00.820> uh<00:05:01.260> not<00:05:02.260> many<00:05:02.440> controllers<00:05:02.740> have<00:05:03.610> really

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
and uh not many controllers have really

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.670 
and uh not many controllers have really
clicky<00:05:04.510> buttons<00:05:04.870> like<00:05:04.990> that<00:05:05.140> anymore<00:05:05.320> but<00:05:05.620> I

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
clicky buttons like that anymore but I

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.120 
clicky buttons like that anymore but I
like<00:05:05.860> clicky<00:05:06.160> buttons<00:05:07.860> possibly<00:05:08.860> a<00:05:08.890> thing

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
like clicky buttons possibly a thing

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.890 
like clicky buttons possibly a thing
that<00:05:09.310> some<00:05:09.460> people<00:05:09.730> wouldn't<00:05:09.880> like<00:05:10.060> but<00:05:10.330> you

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
that some people wouldn't like but you

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.560 
that some people wouldn't like but you
know<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:11.169> prefer<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.590> buttons<00:05:12.360> next<00:05:13.360> is<00:05:13.480> the

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
know I prefer the buttons next is the

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.890 
know I prefer the buttons next is the
d-pad<00:05:14.190> d-pad<00:05:15.190> isn't<00:05:15.460> nearly<00:05:15.730> as<00:05:16.030> good<00:05:16.210> it<00:05:16.660> has

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
d-pad d-pad isn't nearly as good it has

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.460 
d-pad d-pad isn't nearly as good it has
the<00:05:17.800> standard<00:05:18.550> game<00:05:18.910> view<00:05:19.090> controller<00:05:19.470> it's

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
the standard game view controller it's

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.020 
the standard game view controller it's
just<00:05:20.650> there's<00:05:21.280> no<00:05:21.460> argument

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
just there's no argument

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.170 
just there's no argument
it<00:05:22.570> just<00:05:22.810> feels<00:05:23.080> much<00:05:23.440> looser<00:05:23.919> I<00:05:24.130> mean<00:05:24.970> look<00:05:25.120> at

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
it just feels much looser I mean look at

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.700 
it just feels much looser I mean look at
this<00:05:25.300> you<00:05:25.419> can<00:05:25.540> wiggle<00:05:25.750> it<00:05:25.990> around<00:05:26.050> so<00:05:26.530> much

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
this you can wiggle it around so much

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.520 
this you can wiggle it around so much
without<00:05:26.890> even<00:05:27.310> going<00:05:27.550> in<00:05:27.640> a<00:05:27.730> single<00:05:28.000> direction

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
without even going in a single direction

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.150 
without even going in a single direction
it's<00:05:29.530> just<00:05:29.770> not<00:05:29.919> a<00:05:29.950> very<00:05:30.070> good<00:05:30.280> d-pad<00:05:30.700> at<00:05:30.820> all

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
it's just not a very good d-pad at all

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.040 
it's just not a very good d-pad at all
now<00:05:33.160> trigger<00:05:33.910> button<00:05:34.180> is<00:05:34.270> basically<00:05:34.660> the<00:05:34.870> same

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
now trigger button is basically the same

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.770 
now trigger button is basically the same
they<00:05:35.830> actually<00:05:36.160> don't<00:05:36.580> click<00:05:37.000> as<00:05:37.120> much<00:05:37.360> as<00:05:37.600> the

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
they actually don't click as much as the

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.300 
they actually don't click as much as the
standard<00:05:38.229> GameCube<00:05:38.590> controllers<00:05:38.979> trigger

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
standard GameCube controllers trigger

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.580 
standard GameCube controllers trigger
buttons<00:05:39.610> which<00:05:39.760> is<00:05:39.880> weird<00:05:40.120> because<00:05:40.590> these

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
buttons which is weird because these

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.120 
buttons which is weird because these
four<00:05:42.010> buttons<00:05:42.160> do<00:05:42.550> click<00:05:42.820> even<00:05:43.330> more<00:05:44.100> but<00:05:45.100> uh

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
four buttons do click even more but uh

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.190 
four buttons do click even more but uh
that's<00:05:46.090> not<00:05:46.300> problem<00:05:46.540> the<00:05:46.690> trigger<00:05:46.930> buttons

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
that's not problem the trigger buttons

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.600 
that's not problem the trigger buttons
are<00:05:47.290> totally<00:05:47.590> fine<00:05:47.770> they're<00:05:47.950> just<00:05:47.979> the<00:05:48.370> same

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
are totally fine they're just the same

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.080 
are totally fine they're just the same
basically<00:05:49.560> Z<00:05:50.560> button<00:05:50.800> it's<00:05:51.160> not<00:05:51.310> blue<00:05:51.610> but<00:05:51.910> you

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
basically Z button it's not blue but you

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.650 
basically Z button it's not blue but you
know<00:05:52.210> still<00:05:52.840> functions<00:05:53.290> the<00:05:53.410> same<00:05:53.620> way<00:05:54.660> you

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
know still functions the same way you

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.870 
know still functions the same way you
can<00:05:55.780> probably<00:05:55.990> hear<00:05:56.229> that<00:05:56.440> that<00:05:56.650> uh<00:05:56.680> is<00:05:57.100> the<00:05:57.490> Z

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880

different games so the turbo button is a

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.100 
different games so the turbo button is a

of the controllers features are worse

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.180 
of the controllers features are worse
than<00:07:16.300> the<00:07:16.419> standard<00:07:16.860> GameCube<00:07:17.860> controller

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190

it's<00:07:21.070> score<00:07:21.400> a<00:07:21.430> lot<00:07:21.669> and<00:07:21.940> uh<00:07:22.140> it<00:07:23.140> definitely

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.470 
it's score a lot and uh it definitely

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.260 
it's score a lot and uh it definitely
makes<00:07:23.590> it

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270 
makes it

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.900 
makes it
I'd<00:07:25.270> say<00:07:25.540> literally<00:07:26.530> just<00:07:26.890> as<00:07:27.130> good<00:07:27.310> as<00:07:27.550> the

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:27.910 
I'd say literally just as good as the

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.780 
I'd say literally just as good as the
standard<00:07:28.210> GameCube<00:07:28.600> controller<00:07:29.790> obviously

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:30.790

there's<00:07:31.270> some<00:07:31.360> differences<00:07:31.810> but<00:07:32.380> overall<00:07:33.070> it

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:33.580 
there's some differences but overall it

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.510 
there's some differences but overall it
is<00:07:34.270> just<00:07:34.720> as<00:07:34.990> good<00:07:35.290> not<00:07:35.650> worse<00:07:35.919> not<00:07:36.460> better

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 
is just as good not worse not better

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.640 
is just as good not worse not better
