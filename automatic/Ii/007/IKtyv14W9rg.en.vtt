00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.559
 stay now 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.559
 Mannheim 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.839
 No 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.009
 Enlightenment does this as easy and today I want to show you 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.019
 how to create ringtones without 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.630
 Limitation of the length 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.990
 and percent for each also applies to the iPod Touch and that would have to 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.880
 here Tonight i pick you a song - man on the ground 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.540
 and then 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.830
 be advised on binding Sachs 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.650
 then the teams at copied ass 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.650
 and clean up the speech that works 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.740
 from there the tester flies no 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.770
 and 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.100
 Now you just have to click to smoke and that from m4a to m4e 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.420
 collected 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.850
 So Tempelhof is doing and scoring ten points and then getting it over 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.190
 you want to be shown as well as yours 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.710
 constantly after that joins the penitent yes 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.450
 it is so important with if the SCP or whatever 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.640
 about etc 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.900
 Takes three branches well and 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.800
 the password 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.610
 front you connect with your device 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.610
 and perpetrators after the Porr 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.280
 Percent at below 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.190
 is the EHC 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.540
 and the parents there ring meeting us out 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.510
 from there are all ringtones and then just tilted to 11 6 for moving 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.179
 so 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.490
 my life is the topic 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.730
 Zaman side 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.830
 out there and became a spokesperson for the song Desktop GE is back tipping the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.320
 Stock earns 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.730
 Voss encounters trick f6 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.730
 then that shifts that 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.910
 then that shifts that over to the ringtones 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.519
 and then just open here 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:13.659
 OKI click 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.549
 and that Letizia put part on fire 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.779
 the nice thing is that it is synonymous on the iPod should not really 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:23.499
 Ringtones on it can and you can not have a maximum limit 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.669
 and you can take every piece of your iTunes 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.169
 that he got it right the year I found it myself 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:36.189
 yes and now 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.499
 yes it is in the dim and 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.189
 look gorgeous 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.129
 gives another right click and update and knows the sessions too 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.359
 do 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.359
 then you go purchases in reverse 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.679
 around and also the device could quite quite in the barrel Bourque lies 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.679
 and selects with timer 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.259
 under pari Time Rendeler Klika on it 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.659
 and then you see you were already wearing the basket 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:06.460
 and 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.460
 recorded this Namborn choir so disparagingly called 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.239
 The same is true, sitting there gold could click on the child like that 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.639
 as that is not a problem that works wonderfully 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.930
 then just stand alone one can stop the top act works too 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:30.789
 on the iPhone with Derek ringtones 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:33.789
 you just want to have 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.219
 So you can take every song as if you were going to learn everything correctly 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.459
 So I find it a very great feature 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.809
 This has been found out because that is really useful 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.389
 and you do not have to buy one then you will try 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.230
 yes I wish a lot of fun with it 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.409
 under the handlebars but with my videos
