00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 paar intolerant welcome to the first 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.230
 2015 video here is good for you 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.460
 recording the first 2015 video 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.040
 and this video to clarify some 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.219
 things that are going to happen on our channel 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.500
 Okay, first, I want to thank you for 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.539
 everything you have done for me and for 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.510
 because we have made the canal grow 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.430
 both the channel has reached a point where 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.800
 has partnered with secitec 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.000
 you may have seen some videos in 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 partnership with secitec 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.599
 then the format of things will change a 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.969
 little is going to happen 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.969
 I intend to make videos of higher 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.950
 level is now to leave the bottom 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.559
 level for other channels there are several 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.090
 other channels are growing there 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.170
 inspired by the electronic album is a 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.210
 honor up and then on the bottom 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.010
 level of basic electronics I prefer 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.750
 leave them and take the part 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.449
 that I have the most horny that is part of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.539
 sp already crf that was already trying 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.879
 came in. They said the time it took 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.440
 system offer a very legal partnership 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.870
 for us in that we will be able to 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.210
 lots of instrumentation videos 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.119
 so I believe that in 2015, people 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.810
 will have more days of instrumentation 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.909
 Teaching you will teach 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.320
 equipment showing equipment 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.560
 feature specifications 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.470
 how to use them on the bench 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.659
 for project development also 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.360
 in several equipments until I have already received 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.970
 they are drf you know are from really cool stuff 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.130
 for the analysis of high signal 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.560
 Frequently this kind of thing 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.710
 so I want to list and if this 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.150
 history of equipment with mine 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.640
 desire to make these videos loud 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.770
 level and raise the channel level slightly 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.240
 only that at the same time I do not want to leave 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.549
 to make believe that making a framework 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.020
 I think I thought that was very cool. 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.040
 It's a subject that most rocked the channel. 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.390
 until today 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.369
 so what is likely to happen 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.090
 I'm going to post a high-level video like this 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.219
 and any doubts you have 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.140
 specific information about components and 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.920
 You did not understand the answer in the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.750
 comments 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 and then I'll make a video about it 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.840
 of that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.290
 so I make a high-level video 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.080
 You'll understand what's left of the gap. 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.170
 I make videos from there to fill these 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.730
 gaps 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.250
 so will a business stay under 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.140
 demand will then favor more people 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.510
 but we will be happy 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.200
 I'll be much happier this is what 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.670
 interest 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.290
 very cool this partnership with secitec 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.940
 thank you very much, we will have 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.730
 the care of knowing equipment that 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.739
 I could not buy things here 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.750
 the market price are very expensive the 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.010
 High-level laboratory has people 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.690
 from very rare equipment in our 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.550
 Lab this is really cool 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.860
 about the hdl course I 'm due 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.000
 To you and I apologize but I think 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.410
 is a good opportunity to return the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.860
 course I was not liking that 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.660
 format that format is not me 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.150
 leaving happy, I never liked it 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.260
 of that thing of video recording and 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.440
 this kind of thing 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.720
 the look on the computer of the type of thing 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.799
 then the hdl course will return from a 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.500
 very cool way 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.299
 he will come back on demand too he 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.760
 will come back on demand also based 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.260
 the needs that we will have in our 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.660
 implementations that we will make of 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.269
 high level so for example I received 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.950
 there is a spectrum analyzer and up to 6.2 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.269
 say that this technician gave as a gift 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.739
 to make video that happens to us 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.280
 can generate signals to be able to make 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.620
 classrooms 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.959
 I think it's a good approach to 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.910
 do something fpga to generate these 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.950
 signs for our own classes and is 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.989
 in those moments that I will focus on html 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.120
 and I'm going to teach more practical classes 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.320
 to development because those classes 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.090
 no matter how much I passed 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.459
 content that maybe I 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.410
 do you like or was not 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.630
 really teaching I was teaching 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.519
 What the book teaches I want to teach the 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.480
 that we need to know to do the 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.660
 things work 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.209
 then this is another change part of the 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.070
 videos of the system is I will not post on 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.440
 channel goes straight to their website that the 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.130
 partnership, what I'm going to make videos for 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.709
 they 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.220
 their equipment to put in the 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.190
 their website and encompassing that I go 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.010
 make videos of certain pro channel content 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.930
 and it 's a change that happens to happen 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.239
 seen the growth that the channel was 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.859
 having a very legal growth 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.769
 A lot of people think that it will be very 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.630
 happy and you will like it will be happy 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.989
 because you are part of this after all 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.789
 but a lot of people will not like I ask 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.110
 sorry for those who do not like 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.379
 fine 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.259
 It was very good that if someone leaves me 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.639
 I will understand but I think it is 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.129
 too bad because you 're going to learn things 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.759
 that we would not have the opportunity to 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.490
 learn 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.650
 without this partnership, that's it. 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.810
 Thank you earned and the next video I 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.530
 doing will be straight on show things 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.300
 ball 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.300
 big hug and see you
