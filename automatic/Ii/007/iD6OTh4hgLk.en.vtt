 Hi guys, this is SUNSfan with an intro to Specter. 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.600
 Specter is a hard carry that is usually armed a little tank to punish 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.000
 to the teams that attack him. 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.100
 Spectral Dagger allows Specter to launch a path of shadows of 2000 range 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.000
 It deals up to 200 damage to any enemy it encounters. 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.500
 Enemies will lose 18% movement speed while Specter earns 18%. 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.900
 Also, if you walk on the shadows you will have zero collision for a short period of time. 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.000
 What this means is that you can traverse units and terrain (it works very well as an escape). 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.600
 Desolate is a passive ability that, at level 4, will give you +50 pure damage if you find only one enemy. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 What this means is that the ability only works if the enemy does not have allies 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.700
 in a range of 325. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 This also works with illusions, which will be very important when we talk about the ultimate. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Dispersion is a passive skill that helps to justify the tank build that most choose. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.000
 At level 4 it will reflect 22% of any damage to enemies in a range of 1000. 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.000
 Note that the reflected damage is not received, so it is a good tanking mechanism. 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.000
 Haunt is ultimate global that creates an illusion of yours next to all the enemy heroes in the whole map. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 These illusions are not controllable, receive 200% damage and deal 40% damage. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 These illusions will only attack the hero they have assigned and will last up to 7 seconds. 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.000
 Just remember that, as we said before, Desolate also works on all these illusions. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 The good thing about this skill is that you can take the place of any of these illusions 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 during the period of 7 seconds. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.500
 Doing this will immediately end your ultimate. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 This ability serves as a great escape or to start fights. 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500
