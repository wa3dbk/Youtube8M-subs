the producer was like hey we should make

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.870 
the producer was like hey we should make
a<00:04:16.700> hard<00:04:17.150> hitting<00:04:17.450> club<00:04:18.440> banger<00:04:19.040> i<00:04:19.280> would<00:04:19.640> say

a hard hitting club banger i would say

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.970 
a hard hitting club banger i would say
probably<00:04:20.410> not<00:04:26.530> he<00:04:27.530> was<00:04:27.650> like<00:04:27.740> let<00:04:27.950> me

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
probably not he was like let me

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.440 
probably not he was like let me
something<00:04:28.340> so<00:04:28.550> I<00:04:28.580> played<00:04:28.790> him<00:04:28.850> on<00:04:28.970> ahead<00:04:29.150> and

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
something so I played him on ahead and

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.450 
something so I played him on ahead and
we<00:04:29.660> just<00:04:29.810> look<00:04:30.530> for<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:30.950> think<00:04:31.190> it's<00:04:31.310> really

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
we just look for it I think it's really

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.040 
we just look for it I think it's really
helpful<00:04:31.760> when<00:04:31.910> someone<00:04:32.270> comes<00:04:32.420> in<00:04:32.600> with<00:04:32.810> an

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
helpful when someone comes in with an

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.130 
helpful when someone comes in with an
idea<00:04:33.370> already<00:04:34.370> predetermined<00:04:35.300> just<00:04:35.780> because

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
idea already predetermined just because

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.500 
idea already predetermined just because
it's<00:04:36.410> then<00:04:36.770> especially<00:04:37.340> first<00:04:37.820> song<00:04:38.000> for<00:04:38.330> them

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
it's then especially first song for them

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.450 
it's then especially first song for them
so<00:04:39.050> it's<00:04:39.200> we<00:04:39.740> don't<00:04:39.919> feel<00:04:40.100> like<00:04:40.280> we're

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
so it's we don't feel like we're
