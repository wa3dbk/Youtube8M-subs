so<00:00:45.329> unlike<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.690> flip<00:00:46.289> shell<00:00:46.469> case<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
so unlike the flip shell case for the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.010 
so unlike the flip shell case for the
z10<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.520> obviously<00:00:47.850> flipped<00:00:48.510> across<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
z10 that obviously flipped across the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.700 
z10 that obviously flipped across the
screen<00:00:50.390> the<00:00:51.390> q10<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:52.010> opens<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.180> so

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
screen the q10 one opens up like so so

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.689 
screen the q10 one opens up like so so
this<00:00:55.710> would<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> top<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.460> device

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
this would be the top of the device

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.119 
this would be the top of the device
opens<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> throw<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> q10<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.480> there<00:01:01.460> and

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
opens up so throw the q10 in there and

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.230 
opens up so throw the q10 in there and
check<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.189> out<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> how's<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> nice<00:01:07.560> back<00:01:08.240> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
