00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
itself spend it away from the flysheet

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.910 
itself spend it away from the flysheet
just<00:00:29.060> allows<00:00:29.240> greater<00:00:29.539> ventilation<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:30.680> also

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
just allows greater ventilation and also

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.470 
just allows greater ventilation and also

touring as well let's go and take a look
at<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.699> other<00:01:04.820> sizes<00:01:06.430> so<00:01:07.430> here<00:01:07.549> here<00:01:07.760> we<00:01:07.880> are

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
at the other sizes so here here we are

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.900 
at the other sizes so here here we are
inside<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.420> Amiga<00:01:08.780> 350<00:01:09.640> exactly<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.730> same

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
inside the Amiga 350 exactly the same

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.180 
inside the Amiga 350 exactly the same
features<00:01:11.480> as<00:01:11.750> we<00:01:11.840> have<00:01:11.990> in<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.200> 250<00:01:12.620> but

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
features as we have in the 250 but

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.320 
features as we have in the 250 but
obviously<00:01:13.490> this<00:01:13.580> can<00:01:13.820> then<00:01:13.940> house<00:01:14.120> up<00:01:14.300> to

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
obviously this can then house up to
