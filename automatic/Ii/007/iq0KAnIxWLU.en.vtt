00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.730
 station for this qualif who has to do 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.400
 pleasure at home in marseille qualifs 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.580
 it's something you know your there 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.410
 that you know you are a ranking that 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.369
 you're a little annoyed by the clicks if 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.199
 you want to enter the paintings 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.640
 I'll just have you tell us a 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.000
 a little bit of what it's like to bang 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.699
 Qualify to lose at the entrance of the painting 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.460
 Finally, how are you doing? 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.920
 hard for you or not at what level we 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.160
 oath first no I'm gonna get out 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.559
 I am not someone of trévé 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.870
 spendthrift so I'm doing this I'm doing myself 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.140
 pleasure when I want but yeah 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.649
 it is true that we are on a circuit a 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.200
 little different from what we see necessarily 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.030
 on TV but not honestly 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.230
 my side I'm doing pretty well I 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.100
 do stuff I'm my little 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.140
 career i'm fine today like 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.780
 it inevitably I want to cross 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.250
 more steps 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.630
 here are the turning points the great priest I 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.910
 do not do a lot of gambling it's true that 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.250
 I favor challengers tournaments 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.970
 throughout the year 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.580
 maybe that's an error I 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.710
 maybe should sometimes play more 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.050
 often this kind of tournament I have 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.410
 played in Australia also coming out of 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.580
 qualifications I'm going out qualifying here 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.250
 it feels good it feels good 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.590
 necessarily it helps financially for 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.680
 being able to do two tournaments allows himself to 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.030
 do other tours so I 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.820
 start doing it feels good that 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.680
 journey she a coach no I travel 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.869
 mainly those I catch up with 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.850
 with lionel zimbler who is very often 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.320
 with with Benoit on the circuit you 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.320
 so fickle 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.539
 I often go alone in tournament but and 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.430
 you pay him or not yes of course but 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.740
 it's really about tournaments like 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.630
 this one for example we know we'll say 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.250
 you're not at home in marseille n 10 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.190
 have been to the new orleans on Thursday 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.869
 pledged your hotel is paid during the 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.270
 tournament starts to travel in these cases 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.950
 there yes in these cases the tournament takes 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.500
 charge supports hosting 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.849
 even if you're in qualifying yeah in the 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.410
 250 ouadhias and 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.770
 I have no west is whipping his expenses into 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.050
 charge 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.340
 So yeah it is supported here 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.510
 I actually did I walk which I 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.319
 sleep at home but it's true in all 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.890
 the 250 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.030
 we are cared for so therefore the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.440
 local on their behalf 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.319
 if it is also supported 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.790
 also to save on some but 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.140
 it's true that a has less and less where 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.060
 there is no accommodation that is taken 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.010
 is taken into account as in india where 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.780
 I was the last two weeks where 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.959
 this was it for my pocket 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.290
 but not theirs together as I the 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.730
 said financially that's okay it's 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.610
 because precisely you choose this 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.680
 two friends circuit second 10 may 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.230
 challenger allows for maybe closing a 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.099
 result I do not know finally way maybe 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.130
 that again the level is very high 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.480
 today it's true that since two 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.549
 three years the level is really 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.670
 know I could I lie tightened it 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.680
 is playing 3,400 guys or is really very 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.200
 very little difference after why I 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.849
 play more the big price chargers I have 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.069
 no I have not run by hate 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:20.140
 answer today 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:21.940
 but no it's true that I'm putting you there 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.769
 that he does not call today her this 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.940
 side there I contact you so because 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.940
 the cheeks the people watching the 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.920
 tennis the federer nadal who have 45 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.540
 million of prize money maybe it's 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.010
 not your case 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.069
 no but you succeeded in town would 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.650
 comfortably blood is exactly 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.620
 but no I have my little life I have my 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.069
 little cloud 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.269
 I have my little apartment here in Marseille 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.610
 am very good today 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.069
 like that you have a lot in your case 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.330
 where is there who is 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.549
 that they are like you I say they 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.319
 are at the door of the top 100 and who 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.670
 are trying to pierce that's so I 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.510
 do not really know I think we have a 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.370
 ranking where we are submitting 206 have 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.959
 do not do anything we can 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.890
 go out 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.090
 after that it's true that when we really 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.750
 the top 100 but it's true that at a 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.959
 huge difference 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.000
 but after everyone manages his career at his 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.500
 way they go can be 200 and the guy 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.060
 can do anything slammed a 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.329
 beautiful missed the boat and actually he 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.669
 will say it's financially hard 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.039
 months ago I'm doing it I have my head on 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.870
 shoulders I do not do anything when 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.639
 I want to please me 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.470
 please 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.220
 but here I am trying to lead my career 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.790
 the best possible 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.010
 to be able to continue long 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.660
 term a few more years to to 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.680
 to go to tournaments 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.800
 points a little to the right on the left 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.570
 so no no I am I am very 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.190
 well today like that she besides 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.420
 later the tide to maturity at age 31 it's up to 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.190
 to say that you still have 8 9 years of 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.470
 more requests 9 May we mean 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.050
 yeah if I can play up to 35 36 years 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.630
 I will do it with pleasure 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.190
 I became aware maybe these two 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.620
 last years that we had a chance 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.710
 amazing to be able to do this job there 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.060
 something that maybe at age 25 I got 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.900
 did not necessarily return when there was 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.120
 times when I get drunk and 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.070
 I sent a little in every sense of 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.140
 three months and it's true that 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.700
 expensive so far but it's 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.350
 true that these are the last years 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.870
 as I say I'm maturing 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.110
 it's a career not last a whole 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.500
 night 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.930
 so here I am closer to the end 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.410
 than from the beginning but I think the most 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.760
 beautiful years are before me and in all 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.880
 case I take a lot more fun 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.530
 today that carey queerica francs 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.330
 sir fathers listen to me ashamed and 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.419
 full of beautiful years thank you for this 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.419
 testimony
