 category and is open all year 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.650
 in low season we are 8 workers 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.390
 without counting the bar staff 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.260
 restaurant that is rented and then 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.450
 In high season 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.670
 that figure doubles 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.220
 with the main innovation well after 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.570
 reports cite everything that has been the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.910
 teacher in everything that is the process of 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.250
 camping management after almost 40 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.360
 years of doing everything by hand it was time 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.270
 a little bit of adapting to the new 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.969
 technologies 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.859
 we acquired all the software and 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.530
 hardware needed to carry everything 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:24.460
 more computerized we acquired a 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.260
 campsite management software 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.810
 with that software with this program 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.549
 we can make the entrances and the exits 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.630
 of the clients and we can issue 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.830
 invoices we keep statistics 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.530
 necessary and official is much more 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.560
 detailed we can send to miss it 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.150
 lists of clients and everything because much 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.150
 more easier faster 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.080
 for difficulty at first a little 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.630
 change of mentality of working from 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.390
 do everything by hand to think that the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.460
 IT was not going to give more work 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.020
 then it was the main thing then otherwise 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.930
 it's not a little then decide what kind of 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.330
 software you need equipment to acquire 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.830
 but good you inform yourself on the internet or 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.260
 well in tourism magazines that we 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.210
 they arrive at the office asking 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.950
 changes around and if it enters 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.950
 budget can be indicated step 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.569
 we are happy good directly from 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.760
 economic benefit not but in the end if 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.459
 it comes down to that because if the program 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.129
 Innovation management allows you 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.079
 improve customer service improve 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.819
 management and all that results in the 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.280
 quality because in the end it is the client what 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.389
 sees it repeats not only that it repeats but that 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.389
 same as it can bring more customers 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.709
 despite modernizing its facilities 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.480
 to this campsite he says manually he's left 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.040
 much to do and is that innovation 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.940
 it has become essential 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.940
 as well 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.040
 in general if we still want 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.080
 deepen a bit with the software that 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.340
 we have and exploit all the 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.070
 possibilities that you have for example 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.530
 we want to incorporate ideas to all 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.440
 workers to control directly 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.380
 on a plot the camping situation 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.120
 can also put control of 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.370
 car license plates still not what 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.420
 we have but you can and then apart 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.310
 We want to provide the campsite with a 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.060
 good wifi service 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.060
 and video surveillance
