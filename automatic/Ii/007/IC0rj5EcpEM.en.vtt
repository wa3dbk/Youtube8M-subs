buildings<00:00:36.940> are<00:00:37.870> undamaged<00:00:38.829> when<00:00:39.790> you<00:00:40.000> fly<00:00:40.210> a

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
buildings are undamaged when you fly a

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.470 
buildings are undamaged when you fly a
mission<00:00:40.450> but<00:00:41.110> we're<00:00:41.829> in<00:00:41.950> a<00:00:42.040> war<00:00:42.250> zone<00:00:42.280> so<00:00:43.030> it

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
mission but we're in a war zone so it

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.720 
mission but we're in a war zone so it
would<00:00:43.600> be<00:00:43.750> nice<00:00:43.990> to<00:00:44.020> be<00:00:44.410> able<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:44.770> just<00:00:45.040> destroy

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
would be nice to be able to just destroy

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.390 
would be nice to be able to just destroy
some<00:00:46.090> buildings<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.590> distraction<00:00:48.160> brush

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
some buildings the distraction brush

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.130 
some buildings the distraction brush
allows<00:00:48.970> us<00:00:49.270> to<00:00:50.170> create<00:00:50.440> areas<00:00:51.040> of<00:00:51.250> damage<00:00:51.400> and

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
allows us to create areas of damage and

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.910 
allows us to create areas of damage and
you<00:00:53.140> can<00:00:53.260> have<00:00:53.760> some<00:00:54.760> or<00:00:55.140> most<00:00:56.140> or<00:00:56.560> even<00:00:56.590> all

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
buildings in any given area destroyed

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.799 
buildings in any given area destroyed
before<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.480> mission<00:01:01.750> begins<00:01:03.390> now<00:01:04.390> when

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
before the mission begins now when

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:05.760 
before the mission begins now when
should<00:01:05.110> we<00:01:05.290> use<00:01:05.320> it

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
should we use it

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.969 
should we use it
well<00:01:06.299> given<00:01:07.299> that<00:01:07.450> we're<00:01:07.600> flying<00:01:07.960> usually<00:01:08.770> in

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
well given that we're flying usually in

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.700 
well given that we're flying usually in
a<00:01:09.070> war<00:01:09.280> zone<00:01:09.310> it's<00:01:10.000> probably<00:01:10.540> a<00:01:10.570> good<00:01:11.049> idea<00:01:11.110> to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
a war zone it's probably a good idea to

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.289 
a war zone it's probably a good idea to
use<00:01:11.920> it<00:01:11.950> in<00:01:12.250> every<00:01:12.640> mission<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:13.570> you<00:01:13.720> make

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
use it in every mission that you make

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.050 
use it in every mission that you make
now<00:01:16.299> how<00:01:16.780> do<00:01:16.840> you<00:01:17.020> use<00:01:17.109> it<00:01:17.469> well<00:01:17.920> I've<00:01:18.249> got<00:01:18.880> the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
now how do you use it well I've got the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.410 
now how do you use it well I've got the
Stalingrad<00:01:19.659> map<00:01:20.200> up<00:01:20.499> now<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.429> let's<00:01:21.969> zoom<00:01:22.270> in

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420

it<00:02:26.069> very<00:02:26.489> quickly<00:02:27.000> brush<00:02:27.689> size<00:02:27.959> up<00:02:28.469> maybe<00:02:29.340> you

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
it very quickly brush size up maybe you

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.250 
it very quickly brush size up maybe you
want<00:02:29.609> to<00:02:29.700> give<00:02:29.819> like<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.060> base<00:02:30.390> destruction

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
want to give like a base destruction

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
want to give like a base destruction
level<00:02:31.560> for<00:02:31.920> us<00:02:32.250> for<00:02:33.090> an<00:02:33.180> area<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.439> maybe<00:02:34.739> like

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
level for us for an area so maybe like

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.910 
level for us for an area so maybe like
about<00:02:35.579> 30<00:02:35.909> percent<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.780> click<00:02:37.439> back<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.799> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
about 30 percent and click back on the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.250 
about 30 percent and click back on the
map<00:02:38.129> paint<00:02:38.970> destruction<00:02:39.569> just<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:40.049> that

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
map paint destruction just like that

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.440 
map paint destruction just like that
easiest<00:02:41.010> way<00:02:41.189> even<00:02:41.549> all<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.849> way<00:02:41.970> over<00:02:42.239> here

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
easiest way even all the way over here

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.530 
easiest way even all the way over here
now<00:02:43.700> if<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.849> want<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.060> get<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> little<00:02:45.329> more

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
now if you want to get a little more

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.899 
now if you want to get a little more
details<00:02:46.189> why<00:02:47.189> not<00:02:47.430> zoom<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:48.260> maybe<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:50.129> area

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
details why not zoom in maybe this area

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.000 
details why not zoom in maybe this area
which<00:02:51.090> we've<00:02:51.239> given<00:02:51.480> about<00:02:51.919> 15<00:02:52.919> percent

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
which we've given about 15 percent

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.280 
which we've given about 15 percent
destruction<00:02:53.700> maybe<00:02:53.909> this<00:02:54.090> area<00:02:54.450> needs<00:02:55.139> a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
destruction maybe this area needs a

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.399 
destruction maybe this area needs a
little<00:02:55.439> more<00:02:55.739> as<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.870> riding<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.959> war<00:02:58.109> zones

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
little more as and riding the war zones

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.440 
little more as and riding the war zones
so<00:02:58.709> we'll<00:02:58.829> bring<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.459> up<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.700> Layton<00:02:59.879> 95

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
so we'll bring it up to Layton 95

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.679 
so we'll bring it up to Layton 95
percent<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.549> bring<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.639> brush<00:03:02.879> size<00:03:03.090> way

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
percent and bring the brush size way

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.099 
percent and bring the brush size way
down<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:05.030> let's<00:03:06.030> click<00:03:06.389> it<00:03:06.510> back<00:03:06.629> on<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.900> map

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
down and let's click it back on the map

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.500 
down and let's click it back on the map
press<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.799> F<00:03:07.919> key<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.519> paint<00:03:09.269> some

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
press the F key and paint some

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.319 
press the F key and paint some
destruction<00:03:09.900> easy<00:03:10.859> as<00:03:11.099> that<00:03:11.250> right<00:03:11.489> not<00:03:12.120> too

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
destruction easy as that right not too

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:12.740 
destruction easy as that right not too
bad

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
bad

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.189 
bad
now<00:03:14.299> one<00:03:15.299> further<00:03:15.870> thing<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.409> that<00:03:17.250> if<00:03:17.760> we<00:03:18.199> zoom

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
now one further thing is that if we zoom

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.240 
now one further thing is that if we zoom
right<00:03:19.709> out<00:03:19.859> again<00:03:20.989> we<00:03:21.989> could<00:03:22.470> if<00:03:22.769> we<00:03:23.010> really

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
right out again we could if we really

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.390 
right out again we could if we really
wanted<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.579> paint<00:03:25.159> destruction<00:03:26.159> for<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
wanted to paint destruction for the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.330 
wanted to paint destruction for the
entire<00:03:26.819> map<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:28.709> might<00:03:28.919> be<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.069> good<00:03:29.190> idea

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
entire map and it might be a good idea

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.129 
entire map and it might be a good idea
in<00:03:29.729> that<00:03:29.819> case<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.389> bring<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.690> brush<00:03:30.870> size<00:03:31.109> to

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
in that case to bring the brush size to

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.890 
in that case to bring the brush size to
the<00:03:31.590> maximum<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.849> destruction<00:03:33.359> level<00:03:33.690> well

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
the maximum the destruction level well

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.180 
the maximum the destruction level well
again<00:03:34.169> you<00:03:34.379> probably<00:03:34.500> ought<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.799> sit<00:03:35.010> like<00:03:35.159> a

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
again you probably ought to sit like a

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.119 
again you probably ought to sit like a
base<00:03:35.489> level<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:36.060> might<00:03:36.359> even<00:03:36.510> be<00:03:36.750> like<00:03:36.930> 25%<00:03:37.470> or

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
base level it might even be like 25% or

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.539 
base level it might even be like 25% or
in<00:03:38.569> this<00:03:39.620> selling<00:03:40.620> grad<00:03:40.769> situation<00:03:41.340> may<00:03:41.489> be

in this selling grad situation may be

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.349 
in this selling grad situation may be
more<00:03:41.819> but<00:03:42.629> I<00:03:42.959> can<00:03:43.169> go<00:03:43.319> around<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:44.010> again<00:03:44.699> click

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
more but I can go around and again click

more but I can go around and again click
on<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.629> map<00:03:45.810> F<00:03:46.139> key<00:03:46.440> down<00:03:46.620> paint<00:03:47.489> destruction

on the map F key down paint destruction

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.640 
on the map F key down paint destruction
on<00:03:48.299> all<00:03:48.810> these<00:03:48.989> little<00:03:49.199> towns<00:03:49.530> here<00:03:49.949> and

it's done very quickly you do the whole
mapping<00:03:54.140> like<00:03:54.349> what<00:03:54.620> a<00:03:54.890> minute<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.610> then<00:03:56.180> go

there's a problem and that's where the

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.009 
there's a problem and that's where the
bug<00:04:07.909> comes<00:04:08.329> in<00:04:08.540> if<00:04:09.340> you<00:04:10.450> zoom<00:04:11.450> in<00:04:11.480> on<00:04:11.599> selling

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
bug comes in if you zoom in on selling

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.170 
bug comes in if you zoom in on selling
right<00:04:12.200> again<00:04:12.470> if<00:04:12.769> you<00:04:13.489> put<00:04:15.609> targets<00:04:16.609> for

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
right again if you put targets for

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.189 
right again if you put targets for
example<00:04:17.570> defense<00:04:17.930> ground<00:04:18.880> onto<00:04:19.880> an<00:04:20.419> area<00:04:21.049> that

example defense ground onto an area that

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.000 
example defense ground onto an area that
has<00:04:21.380> destruction<00:04:22.510> all<00:04:23.510> right<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:24.410> that

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
has destruction all right so that

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.779 
has destruction all right so that
because<00:04:25.880> of<00:04:26.000> this<00:04:26.120> bug<00:04:26.389> the<00:04:26.660> area<00:04:27.110> under<00:04:27.800> the

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
because of this bug the area under the

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.020 
because of this bug the area under the
targets<00:04:29.330> will<00:04:30.169> not<00:04:30.770> have<00:04:31.010> distraction<00:04:31.669> in<00:04:31.970> the

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
targets will not have distraction in the

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.750 
targets will not have distraction in the
mission<00:04:32.830> it's<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.979> bit<00:04:34.130> of<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.250> bummer<00:04:34.430> but

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
mission it's a bit of a bummer but

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.950 
mission it's a bit of a bummer but
that's<00:04:34.940> just<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.240> way<00:04:35.360> it<00:04:35.479> is<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.930> that

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
that's just the way it is and that

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.620 
that's just the way it is and that
applies<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.680> defense<00:04:37.340> ground<00:04:37.699> and<00:04:38.090> also

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
applies to defense ground and also

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.340 
applies to defense ground and also
destroy<00:04:39.260> ground<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:40.570> what<00:04:41.570> can<00:04:41.690> you<00:04:41.840> do<00:04:42.020> well

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
destroy ground so what can you do well

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.520 
destroy ground so what can you do well
if<00:04:42.650> you<00:04:43.449> have<00:04:44.449> an<00:04:44.570> area<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.020> you<00:04:45.139> really<00:04:45.169> want

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
if you have an area that you really want

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.700 
if you have an area that you really want
destroyed<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:46.430> will<00:04:46.639> not<00:04:46.820> be<00:04:47.000> able<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.710> use

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
destroyed you will not be able to use

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.980 
destroyed you will not be able to use
destroy<00:04:49.280> ground<00:04:49.550> or<00:04:49.940> defend<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:50.810> fence

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
destroy ground or defend the fence

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.690 
destroy ground or defend the fence
ground<00:04:51.380> targets<00:04:52.340> in<00:04:53.090> those<00:04:53.389> areas<00:04:53.900> if<00:04:54.889> the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
ground targets in those areas if the

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.339 
ground targets in those areas if the
targets<00:04:56.060> are<00:04:56.180> important<00:04:56.630> then<00:04:56.810> hopefully

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
targets are important then hopefully

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:58.990 
targets are important then hopefully
having<00:04:57.530> destruction<00:04:58.099> is<00:04:58.220> not<00:04:58.340> so<00:04:58.580> important

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
having destruction is not so important

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.320 
having destruction is not so important
all<00:04:59.180> right<00:04:59.360> so<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.349> bit<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.620> trade-off<00:05:00.950> there

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
all right so a bit of a trade-off there

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.870 
all right so a bit of a trade-off there
