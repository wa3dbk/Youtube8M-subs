00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
right hand side and of course as I

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.649 
right hand side and of course as I
mentioned<00:01:35.130> before<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.610> rotatable<00:01:36.180> d-pad

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
mentioned before this rotatable d-pad

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.320 
mentioned before this rotatable d-pad
which<00:01:36.690> I<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.440> don't<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.369> 360

which I actually don't have a 360
controller<00:01:39.360> with<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.170> d-pad<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.979> so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
controller with this d-pad on it so

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.969 
controller with this d-pad on it so
that's<00:01:42.030> gonna<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.360> interesting<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.680> how

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that's gonna be interesting to see how

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.670 
that's gonna be interesting to see how
works<00:01:44.909> out<00:01:45.150> for<00:01:45.420> me<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> mean<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.049> don't<00:01:46.439> play<00:01:46.619> too

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
works out for me I mean I don't play too

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.649 
works out for me I mean I don't play too
many<00:01:47.100> fighters<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> huge<00:01:48.420> perk

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
many fighters so it's not a huge perk

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.960 
many fighters so it's not a huge perk
for<00:01:48.689> me<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.260> just<00:01:49.409> got<00:01:49.650> this<00:01:49.890> because<00:01:50.640> of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
for me I really just got this because of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.060 
for me I really just got this because of
the<00:01:51.060> fact<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.689> different<00:01:51.960> limited<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the fact that it's different limited and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.649 
the fact that it's different limited and
hey<00:01:53.220> there's<00:01:53.460> nothing<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.880> fresh<00:01:54.240> control

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
hey there's nothing like a fresh control

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.330 
hey there's nothing like a fresh control
you<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:54.930> controller<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.590> get<00:01:55.710> I'll<00:01:55.830> bust<00:01:56.130> it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you know controller to get I'll bust it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.740 
you know controller to get I'll bust it
up<00:01:56.460> there's<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> better<00:01:56.939> look<00:01:57.119> at<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.270> skull

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
up there's a better look at that skull

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.080 
up there's a better look at that skull
you<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.860> went<00:01:59.100> when<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.340> ragequit<00:01:59.580> on

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you know you went when you ragequit on

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.840 
you know you went when you ragequit on
those<00:02:00.270> games<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.950> having<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.250> fresh<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.700> is

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
those games so having a fresh one is

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.300 
those games so having a fresh one is
nice<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.330> why<00:02:03.720> not<00:02:03.900> get<00:02:04.110> one<00:02:04.350> that's<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:05.040> little

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
nice and why not get one that's a little

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.880 
nice and why not get one that's a little
bit<00:02:05.460> more<00:02:05.909> unique<00:02:06.150> than<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.080> standard

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
bit more unique than the standard

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.919 
bit more unique than the standard
