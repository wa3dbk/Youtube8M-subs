damage dealers and then your allies are
taking<00:01:35.970> damage<00:01:36.180> from<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.600> things<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.140> are

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
taking damage from the things that are

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.660 
taking damage from the things that are
supposed<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.770> helping<00:01:37.890> them<00:01:38.250> that's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
supposed to be helping them that's

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.700 
supposed to be helping them that's
that's<00:01:38.939> cool<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.720> they<00:01:39.869> put<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> big<00:01:40.259> emphasis

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that's cool so they put a big emphasis

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.399 
that's cool so they put a big emphasis
on<00:01:40.890> difficulty<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.850> requiring<00:01:42.780> lots<00:01:43.229> of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
on difficulty and requiring lots of

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.230 
on difficulty and requiring lots of
responsiveness<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.250> situational<00:01:45.090> awareness

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
responsiveness and situational awareness

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.560 
responsiveness and situational awareness
and<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.380> love<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.799> idea<00:01:47.210> but<00:01:48.210> there's<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and I love that idea but there's a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.510 
and I love that idea but there's a
problem<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.619> all<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> time<00:01:50.159> I've<00:01:50.310> sucked

cast<00:02:44.000> your<00:02:44.180> heel<00:02:44.510> but<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.140> game<00:02:45.380> just<00:02:45.590> didn't

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
cast your heel but the game just didn't

respond<00:02:46.760> as<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.360> should<00:02:47.390> have<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.140> that's

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
respond as it should have and that's

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.170 
respond as it should have and that's
what<00:02:48.739> I'm<00:02:48.830> worried<00:02:49.100> about<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.310> love<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.910> idea

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
what I'm worried about I love the idea

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.910 
what I'm worried about I love the idea
of<00:02:50.239> difficulty<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.019> love<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.560> idea<00:02:51.830> of

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
of difficulty I love the idea of

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.890 
of difficulty I love the idea of
requiring<00:02:52.370> an<00:02:52.640> elite<00:02:52.850> group<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:53.150> players<00:02:53.390> to

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
requiring an elite group of players to

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.509 
requiring an elite group of players to
really<00:02:54.200> push<00:02:54.410> through<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.680> get<00:02:54.980> top<00:02:55.190> times

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
really push through and get top times

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.120 
really push through and get top times
but<00:02:56.120> with<00:02:56.420> with<00:02:56.930> all<00:02:57.200> my<00:02:57.380> experience<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.920> can

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
but with with all my experience I can

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.460 
but with with all my experience I can
say<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.610> game's<00:02:58.820> combat<00:02:59.300> can<00:02:59.750> just<00:02:59.959> not<00:03:00.170> do

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
say the game's combat can just not do

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.800 
say the game's combat can just not do
what<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:00.800> supposed<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.310> do<00:03:01.519> sometimes<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.390> I

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
what it's supposed to do sometimes and I

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.330 
what it's supposed to do sometimes and I
really<00:03:03.080> feel<00:03:03.320> like<00:03:03.350> for<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.010> hardcore

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
really feel like for the hardcore

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.800 
really feel like for the hardcore
players<00:03:04.730> who<00:03:05.120> want<00:03:05.269> to<00:03:05.450> go<00:03:05.510> through<00:03:05.690> this

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
players who want to go through this

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.240 
players who want to go through this
stuff<00:03:06.019> they're<00:03:06.470> just<00:03:06.680> going<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:06.830> be<00:03:06.920> banging

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
stuff they're just going to be banging

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.470 
stuff they're just going to be banging
their<00:03:07.340> heads<00:03:07.519> around<00:03:07.640> against<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.300> wall

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
their heads around against the wall

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.729 
their heads around against the wall
because<00:03:08.630> they'll<00:03:08.870> be<00:03:08.959> like<00:03:09.080> we<00:03:09.470> should<00:03:09.709> have

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
because they'll be like we should have
