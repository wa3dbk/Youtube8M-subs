 The sensitive person feels the popularity and disappears into the water quickly 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.960
 The other guy who found the production team does not look as if he is an economist. 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:46.199
 The sparkling seals live mainly in the water 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.199
 The head is always out of the water because it is Saturday with a breath on the ship . 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.590

 Well after a while 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:16.240
 A woman with a hairy head in the water is still staring at the camera . 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:24.249
 5 But when I find the ship, I suddenly crawl into it. 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:26.249
 5 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:26.249

 Hide-and-seek with a seals that last more than half a day

 Is it no longer accessible 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:43.339
 I think I am more sensitive to the objects here than to the research objects. 

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:43.339
 If you look 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:55.200

00:05:46.260 --> 00:06:00.360
 Well, we'll live quite a distance away when the ball after saramagu 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:05.670
 Even though I'm far away , I do not give a distance anyway. 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:12.080
 In the bang study, Jack was looking at a 200mm camera 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:12.080

 Johnny spotted seals 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:24.170
 I decided to wait and keep the distance so I do not feel threatened by the seal . 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.690
 A spotted spot seal captured on the camera again 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:42.790
 But it still does not reveal the fullness of the hair 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:51.820
 There is a long-time underwater life 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.820

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.750
 around 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:13.000
 However, unlike the Baekryongdo seals that come out of the water to take a break 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:20.020
 The objects here are only showing their faces in the water. 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:24.970
 The situation here shows that you are only reaching your head in the water 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:29.500
 Anyway, this area feels so safe when you think about yourself. 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:35.260
 I'm not so good because the sun will yireolttae Thing 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:40.810
 When I come up to live and get sunshine, how long does it keep warm in the groove?
