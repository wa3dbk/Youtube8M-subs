00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:22.230
 and yes and yes 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.740
 I've already been two and a half months 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.090
 despite three of three to four months 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.500
 should have an appointment there soon now 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.750
 to see if I pass a new stage of 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.149
 treatment would be the beginning of 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.239
 muscle to be the last step before 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.420
 back to work with ball in two 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.980
 months and a half without being able to use the arms 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:50.610
 in that of making the physical part run 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.199
 bodyweight is also lower so as not to 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.780
 lose a lot of muscle mass and I will have 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.219
 to recover this and I hope the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.590
 medical releases as soon as possible to 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.620
 retire 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.210
 the expected date is an injury and 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.180
 you have to be extra careful 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.180
 We are looking for her and dark can suddenly 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.520
 I was a lineman would have it 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:19.030
 was in a more advanced stage but 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:24.520
 is running within the project's back 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.280
 tomorrow is difficult to have have hours giving 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.130
 An animated one has hours that discourages one 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.960
 bit because of the time stopped 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.580
 the limitations to go to workout but one 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.280
 of the things that I learned that we never 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.080
 can cheer problems will have as have 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.140
 yours I have mine only that we 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.820
 always think that they are the worst is when 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.350
 people see some things outside we see 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.300
 that our little heart so I try 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.720
 take this to life to achieve 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.470
 Every day has the motivation to go back to 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.000
 do what I like 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.000
 Today I'm private.
