they're slight most American about the
center<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.709> screen<00:02:48.920> now<00:02:49.510> again<00:02:50.510> my

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
center of the screen now again my

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.179 
center of the screen now again my
regular<00:02:52.040> sort<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.549> dust

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.110 

let's<00:02:57.189> do

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
let's do

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:07.820 
let's do
well<00:02:59.690> just<00:02:59.959> around<00:03:00.290> there<00:03:00.470> as<00:03:00.620> well

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.930 

maybe<00:03:08.490> some<00:03:08.940> problems<00:03:09.420> here

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
maybe some problems here

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.560 
maybe some problems here
for<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.330> moisture<00:03:12.880> just<00:03:13.880> dust<00:03:14.150> on<00:03:14.360> that

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
for a moisture just dust on that

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.830 
for a moisture just dust on that
connector<00:03:15.020> they're<00:03:16.660> coming<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.780> hear

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
connector they're coming to hear

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.280 
connector they're coming to hear
ok<00:03:20.379> there

again okay telltale signs of moisture

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.539 
again okay telltale signs of moisture
again<00:03:27.439> they<00:03:27.950> why<00:03:28.730> not<00:03:29.030> with<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:30.430> battery<00:03:31.430> that

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
again they why not with the battery that

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.149 
again they why not with the battery that
we<00:03:31.670> just<00:03:31.819> looked<00:03:32.000> at<00:03:32.379> as<00:03:33.379> more<00:03:33.769> moisture

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
we just looked at as more moisture

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.740 
we just looked at as more moisture
problems<00:03:37.000> okay<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.120> about<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.390> center<00:03:38.689> of

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
problems okay and about the center of

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.729 
problems okay and about the center of
the<00:03:38.840> screen<00:03:39.019> now<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:40.819> Gups<00:03:41.209> those<00:03:42.200> two<00:03:42.470> black

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
the screen now the Gups those two black

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.979 
the screen now the Gups those two black
components<00:03:42.950> there<00:03:43.670> this<00:03:44.540> one<00:03:44.780> on<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:45.019> left

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
components there this one on the left

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.580 
components there this one on the left
looks<00:03:47.989> like

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.509 

it's<00:03:51.069> been<00:03:51.310> affected<00:03:51.879> by<00:03:53.129> moisture<00:03:54.129> in<00:03:54.280> some

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
it's been affected by moisture in some

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.410 
it's been affected by moisture in some
way

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.559 

as<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.650> looked<00:03:59.550> like<00:03:59.700> he's<00:03:59.880> surrounded<00:04:00.270> by

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
as it looked like he's surrounded by

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.339 
as it looked like he's surrounded by
something<00:04:02.630> as<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.690> result<00:04:04.050> of<00:04:04.140> moisture<00:04:06.349> so

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
something as a result of moisture so

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.710 
something as a result of moisture so
that's<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.620> main<00:04:07.830> bar<00:04:08.069> of<00:04:08.190> nice<00:04:09.060> component

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
that's the main bar of nice component

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.190 
that's the main bar of nice component
really<00:04:09.989> is<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:11.700> dock<00:04:12.270> connector<00:04:13.020> that<00:04:13.140> goes

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
really is the dock connector that goes

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.310 
really is the dock connector that goes
in<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.560> bottom<00:04:13.980> of<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.340> iPhone<00:04:15.169> just<00:04:16.169> some

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
in the bottom of the iPhone just some

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.659 
in the bottom of the iPhone just some
dust<00:04:16.590> on<00:04:16.769> this<00:04:16.980> really<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.639> is<00:04:17.850> about<00:04:18.000> it

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
dust on this really and that is about it

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.039 
dust on this really and that is about it
but<00:04:20.669> certainly<00:04:20.940> what<00:04:21.150> is<00:04:21.600> going<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.810> be<00:04:21.900> done

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
but certainly what is going to be done

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.170 
but certainly what is going to be done
now<00:04:22.260> is<00:04:22.290> it's<00:04:23.010> just<00:04:23.100> going<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.400> be<00:04:23.460> allowed<00:04:23.910> to

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
now is it's just going to be allowed to

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.440 
now is it's just going to be allowed to
dry<00:04:24.450> out<00:04:25.280> some<00:04:26.280> components<00:04:26.880> will<00:04:26.970> be<00:04:27.000> warmed

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
dry out some components will be warmed

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:33.920 
dry out some components will be warmed
up<00:04:27.600> with<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:31.430> hairdryer<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.880> we'll<00:04:33.690> get<00:04:33.840> it
