00:00:27.424 --> 00:00:40.396
 Zombies in your meadow 

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:44.751
 We don't need zombies on it 

00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:47.516
 I know you: you are dead, high. 

00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:51.217
 And I want to bite off all the petals, 

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:55.075
 And then the brains to eat the one who planted us 

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:57.553
 I am only a sunflower, but look, 

00:00:57.553 --> 00:00:59.339
 How can I give the whole army! 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.114
 You love the taste of brains, 

00:01:01.114 --> 00:01:05.134
 You are not nice to us 

00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:09.491
 And I played football 

00:01:09.491 --> 00:01:14.250
 The cap is on me 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.512
 And I'm with a door flap 

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.357
 And we are all undead! 

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:35.232
 Zombies in your meadow 

00:01:35.232 --> 00:01:39.400
 We don't need zombies on it 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.737
 Maybe it's time to change everything. 

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:45.326
 I know that you have food - do not count. 

00:01:45.326 --> 00:01:48.952
 In the brain, only solid cholesterol. 

00:01:48.952 --> 00:01:51.967
 You're dead, so don't care 

00:01:51.967 --> 00:01:54.148
 We will take the strength from the sun, 

00:01:54.148 --> 00:01:59.794
 To protect your meadow night and day. 

00:01:59.794 --> 00:02:04.530
 I want a bike 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.889
 I'm with butter on my head 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:14.613
 I'll eat your brains 

00:02:14.613 --> 00:02:16.280
 And we are all undead! 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:29.589
 Zombies in your meadow 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:31.590
 We don't need zombies on it
