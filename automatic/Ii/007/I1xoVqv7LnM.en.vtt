00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.900
 and today we are here to teach the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.790

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.070
 the trick for those who like 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.780
 do something from the inside and stuff 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.390
 and it's getting dark 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.490
 basically we will use the block 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.980
 of the control block is a new one. 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.439
 item by item in current minecraft versions 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.119
 What are we going to learn today? 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.009
 people will learn to report to 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.070
 Some place because here and there too. 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.800
 confessed milk for having caught 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.719
 this block only you can only with the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.430
 command you need a command to 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.100
 pick up the command block is interesting 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:50.000
 will have to use the neighborhood of 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:55.350
 your name from your shai people in a room 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.980
 you expose 137 is already with your block 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.109
 there 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.789
 ok let's go there first expression of your 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.610
 structure you do it all is that 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.340
 you just wall what you want you 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.930
 know the structure here is mine. 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.030
 square and in the middle I'll put a 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:18.270
 button that we will make back 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.350
 It will put the support does not need any 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.350
 I like to play forward 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.470
 the command the support you do not need for 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.070
 To make you look beautiful when 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.619
 stay in the air of our button 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.759
 now we will need to do our 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.560
 scheme 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:45.030
 one day it you right power of ATP 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.950
 you will click with the right button will 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.509
 appear this business asks our 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.549
 This business here is very 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.180
 confused is not confessional 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.820
 you only cheat bar en and you will get 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.000
 you choose one of these options here 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.149
 at least one player is 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.700
 to steal would be for some player 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.509
 who hopes to steal from Syria all 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.910
 players 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.910
 then we will choose the option steals 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.050
 for who wants to be even imported ready to 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.310
 our structure is ready now only 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.940
 I hope you have to choose 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.190
 Where do you want the person to when 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.840
 click the button to be transported 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.090
 I want you to have contact here. 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:37.739
 for example when someone clicks on the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.640
 imported land to see if it pressed f3 and 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.510
 squeeze 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.610
 the time now you do not get an x and y 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.250
 211 lose nothing 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.920
 so we'll notice the xx is minus 261 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:57.510
 y is four years in four high and the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.519
 zÃ© is minus 172 is just our coordinates 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.209
 copying the coordinates is a risk for the 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.849
 front but we're already here 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.720
 there you have to give a space 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.840
 after beating space received 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.159
 coordinates that will imply here will be 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.380
 deported here 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:22.500
 so let's try to never test 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.390
 I was not able to score any more. 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.890
 It 's because of the color of nothing that 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.920
 I did it wrong 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.910
 good, that's it, so if you noticed that 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.420
 I liked it here 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.480
 I think you are beautiful there and I do not 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.950
 I think you dislike click write 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.460
 in the comments there because I think 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.940
 You just need to improve and I think it's 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.150
 that 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.150
 thank you for shire and even more went
