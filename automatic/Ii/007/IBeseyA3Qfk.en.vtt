one here just so that you can see what

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.080 
one here just so that you can see what
I'm<00:00:30.539> doing<00:00:30.920> and<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> pattern<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
I'm doing and with the pattern on the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.319 
I'm doing and with the pattern on the
outside<00:00:33.140> fold<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.350> square<00:00:35.280> twice<00:00:35.760> through<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
outside fold it square twice through the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.660 
outside fold it square twice through the
middle<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.930> then<00:00:37.070> with<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> pattern<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.550> the

middle and then with the pattern on the
inside<00:00:39.260> fold<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.410> diagonally<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.480> want<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.570> be

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
inside fold it diagonally you want to be

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.119 
inside fold it diagonally you want to be
as<00:00:42.750> accurate<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.620> line<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.010> here

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
as accurate as you can line in here

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.330 
as accurate as you can line in here
edges<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:46.230> then<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> pattern<00:00:47.250> on

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
edges up and then with the pattern on

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.709 
edges up and then with the pattern on
the<00:00:47.430> outside<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.940> should<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.510> able<00:00:48.660> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the outside you should just be able to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.060 
the outside you should just be able to
screw<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.289> into<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.649> little<00:00:49.910> square<00:00:50.910> there<00:00:52.070> and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
screw it into a little square there and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.770 
screw it into a little square there and
then<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.309> need<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.550> make<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> kite<00:00:54.059> shape<00:00:54.090> with

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
then we need to make a kite shape with

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.770 
then we need to make a kite shape with
the<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.800> top<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> kite<00:00:58.760> at<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.270> middle<00:01:00.629> of

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the the top of the kite at the middle of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.569 
the the top of the kite at the middle of
the<00:01:00.960> tea<00:01:01.140> bag<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.710> makes<00:01:01.949> any<00:01:02.100> sense

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the tea bag if that makes any sense

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.719 
the tea bag if that makes any sense
so<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> top<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.809> kite<00:01:04.019> shape<00:01:04.369> needs<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.610> be

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
so the top of the kite shape needs to be

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.399 
so the top of the kite shape needs to be
the<00:01:05.880> center<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> piece<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.840> paper<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> fold

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the center of the piece of paper so fold

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.109 
the center of the piece of paper so fold
the<00:01:10.650> edges<00:01:10.770> into<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> center<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the edges into the center there so that

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.020 
the edges into the center there so that
you've<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.390> your<00:01:12.540> little<00:01:12.659> kite<00:01:12.960> shape<00:01:14.030> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you've got your little kite shape you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.730 
you've got your little kite shape you
can<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:15.540> how<00:01:15.689> that's<00:01:15.900> been<00:01:16.140> done<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
can see there how that's been done and

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.710 
can see there how that's been done and
now<00:01:17.070> we're<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> score<00:01:17.939> across<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
now we're just going to score across the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.520 
now we're just going to score across the
top<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.259> kite<00:01:20.689> through<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.140> corners

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
top of the kite through the the corners

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.080 
top of the kite through the the corners
of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> kite<00:01:23.040> shape<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.670> we're<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.970> now

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
of the kite shape and we're going to now

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.620 
of the kite shape and we're going to now
fold<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.930> back<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.740> tricky<00:01:26.130> bit<00:01:26.630> so

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
fold this back this is the tricky bit so

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.679 
fold this back this is the tricky bit so
you<00:01:27.689> need<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.229> lift<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:30.030> bottom<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
you need to lift up the bottom of the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.390 
you need to lift up the bottom of the
kite<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.780> open<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:35.479> like<00:01:36.479> so

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
kite and open it out like so

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.890 
kite and open it out like so
folding<00:01:38.400> across<00:01:38.729> where<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.150> school<00:01:39.509> line<00:01:39.720> is

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
folding across where that school line is

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.319 
folding across where that school line is
with<00:01:40.079> your<00:01:40.200> finger<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.329> crease

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
with your finger and then just crease

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.389 
with your finger and then just crease
the<00:01:43.079> edges<00:01:43.409> back<00:01:43.619> down<00:01:46.009> rewind<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.130> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the edges back down rewind that and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.300 
the edges back down rewind that and
watch<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.670> again<00:01:47.759> if<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.000> need<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
watch it again if you need to so that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.399 
watch it again if you need to so that
there's<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.579> little<00:01:50.850> bit<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.420> need<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.720> do

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
there's that little bit you need to do

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.350 
there's that little bit you need to do
eight<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:53.009> those<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> cut<00:01:53.909> out<00:01:54.119> eight<00:01:54.329> of

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
eight of those so you cut out eight of

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.120 
eight of those so you cut out eight of
your<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:55.049> tea<00:01:55.740> bag<00:01:56.420> pieces<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.570> paper<00:01:58.130> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
your little tea bag pieces of paper and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.980 
your little tea bag pieces of paper and
fold<00:01:59.520> them<00:01:59.759> up<00:01:59.850> carefully<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.689> as<00:02:00.810> we've

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
fold them up carefully just as we've

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.800 
fold them up carefully just as we've
