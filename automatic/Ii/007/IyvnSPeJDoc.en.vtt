I'm<00:00:09.840> going<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.139> be<00:00:10.230> doing<00:00:10.349> things<00:00:10.650> while<00:00:11.099> I

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
I'm going to be doing things while I

so<00:00:12.750> you'll<00:00:13.469> see<00:00:13.590> my<00:00:13.710> fingers<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:15.890> probably<00:00:16.890> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
so you'll see my fingers and probably a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.890 
so you'll see my fingers and probably a
little<00:00:17.070> jerkiness<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:18.270> I'm<00:00:18.359> gonna<00:00:18.510> keep<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
little jerkiness but I'm gonna keep a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.390 
little jerkiness but I'm gonna keep a
white<00:00:19.109> background<00:00:19.710> because<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.070> looks<00:00:20.340> better

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
white background because it looks better

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.000 
white background because it looks better
on<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.970> video<00:00:21.240> usually<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> like<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.529> like<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
on the video usually a like I like a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.080 
on the video usually a like I like a
black<00:00:23.369> background<00:00:23.689> so<00:00:25.670> because<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> pictures

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
black background so because the pictures

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.339 
black background so because the pictures
the<00:00:27.449> drawings<00:00:27.779> look<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.990> lot<00:00:28.170> better

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the drawings look a lot better

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.349 
the drawings look a lot better
especially<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:29.310> amateurs<00:00:29.730> like<00:00:29.910> me<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.240> I'm

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
especially for amateurs like me but I'm

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.139 
especially for amateurs like me but I'm
going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> select<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.929> purple<00:00:31.260> color<00:00:32.149> which

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
going to select the purple color which

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.330 
going to select the purple color which
is<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:33.329> very<00:00:33.809> visible<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> tool<00:00:34.559> bar<00:00:34.739> down

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
is not very visible in the tool bar down

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.260 
is not very visible in the tool bar down
there<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:36.180> select<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> tube<00:00:36.930> tool<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.370> then

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
there you select the tube tool and then

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.500 
there you select the tube tool and then
I'm<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> lay<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.170> my<00:00:40.469> petals<00:00:41.510> nothing

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I'm going to lay out my petals nothing

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.860 
I'm going to lay out my petals nothing
too<00:00:42.629> fancy<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:43.710> very<00:00:44.250> simple<00:00:44.579> petals<00:00:44.940> then

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
too fancy just very simple petals then

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.310 
too fancy just very simple petals then
I'm<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.140> take<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.649> finger<00:00:47.039> tool<00:00:48.320> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
I'm going to take the finger tool and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.819 
I'm going to take the finger tool and
start<00:00:50.129> spreading<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> petals<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.960> take<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> look

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
start spreading the petals I take a look

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.479 
start spreading the petals I take a look
at<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.120> it's<00:00:54.120> an<00:00:54.210> awesome<00:00:54.420> effect<00:00:58.489> very

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
at that it's an awesome effect very

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.069 
at that it's an awesome effect very
simple<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.210> kind<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.600> spreading<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
simple it's kind of like spreading the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.820 
simple it's kind of like spreading the
paint<00:01:01.289> out<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:01.829> own<00:01:01.949> fingers<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:03.830> it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
paint out with your own fingers and it

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.560 
paint out with your own fingers and it
looks<00:01:05.070> very<00:01:05.280> professional<00:01:05.580> when<00:01:06.150> you're<00:01:06.299> done

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
looks very professional when you're done

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.370 
looks very professional when you're done
so<00:01:07.229> I'm<00:01:07.380> kind<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.680> giving<00:01:07.860> away<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.280> secret<00:01:08.820> here

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.469 

now<00:01:16.380> that's<00:01:17.189> what<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> start<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.390> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
now that's what I start with but as you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.390 
now that's what I start with but as you
can<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.900> outer<00:01:19.080> edges<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.770> still<00:01:20.070> kind

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
can see the outer edges are still kind

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.679 
can see the outer edges are still kind
of<00:01:21.470> surreal<00:01:22.470> they're<00:01:23.159> almost<00:01:23.280> too<00:01:23.520> perfect<00:01:23.700> so

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
of surreal they're almost too perfect so

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.010 
of surreal they're almost too perfect so
we<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.960> start<00:01:25.200> spreading<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.770> over<00:01:26.220> there

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.890 

and<00:01:31.159> very<00:01:32.159> quickly<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.659> sort<00:01:33.840> of

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
and very quickly you get the sort of

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.679 
and very quickly you get the sort of
shading<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.770> would<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
shading that you would get in in the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:52.780 
shading that you would get in in the
real<00:01:36.840> world<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.320> also<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.829> real<00:01:38.579> paintings

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.940 

give<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.909> little<00:01:54.119> bit<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:55.220> additional<00:01:56.390> angle

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
give it a little bit of additional angle

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.090 
give it a little bit of additional angle
and<00:02:01.369> voila<00:02:02.369> all<00:02:03.409> right<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.619> little<00:02:04.890> bit<00:02:05.009> of

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
and voila all right a little bit of

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:15.800 
and voila all right a little bit of
surrealism<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.929> after<00:02:10.349> all<00:02:10.470> art<00:02:14.810> there

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
surrealism this is after all art there

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.650 
surrealism this is after all art there
we<00:02:15.989> have<00:02:16.170> three<00:02:16.380> petals<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:21.239> great<00:02:21.420> thing

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
we have three petals and the great thing

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.479 
we have three petals and the great thing
is<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.810> if<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.140> make<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.349> mistake<00:02:22.530> here<00:02:23.160> let's

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
is that if I make a mistake here let's

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.890 
is that if I make a mistake here let's
say<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.700> do<00:02:23.849> that<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:26.220> can<00:02:26.370> either<00:02:26.459> undo<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
say I do that you can either undo and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.520 
say I do that you can either undo and
there<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.290> gone<00:02:28.470> or<00:02:29.780> my<00:02:30.780> finger<00:02:31.140> can<00:02:31.319> bring

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
there it's gone or my finger can bring

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.610 
there it's gone or my finger can bring
it<00:02:31.680> right<00:02:31.709> back<00:02:31.920> into<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.730> fold<00:02:33.590> which<00:02:34.590> is

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
it right back into the fold which is

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.270 
it right back into the fold which is
great<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:36.739> they're<00:02:37.739> back<00:02:37.980> on<00:02:38.280> track<00:02:40.010> right<00:02:41.010> so

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
great and they're back on track right so

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.120 
great and they're back on track right so
now<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.239> know<00:02:42.360> kind<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.130> okay-looking

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
tube again produce the size because I

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.080 
tube again produce the size because I
want<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.940> kind<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.180> slender<00:02:54.690> stem<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.380> do<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.700> I

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
want to kind of slender stem I do that I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:05.650 
want to kind of slender stem I do that I
take<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:58.019> finger<00:02:58.380> again<00:02:58.709> and<00:03:00.049> there<00:03:01.049> you<00:03:01.200> go
