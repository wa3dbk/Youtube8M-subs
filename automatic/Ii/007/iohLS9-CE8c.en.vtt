00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.740 

hello<00:00:02.280> my<00:00:02.460> name<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.639> Ian<00:00:02.970> Dean<00:00:03.270> today<00:00:03.629> I'm

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hello my name is Ian Dean today I'm

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.690 
hello my name is Ian Dean today I'm
going<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.020> be<00:00:04.140> talking<00:00:04.529> about<00:00:04.650> some<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.370> the

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
going to be talking about some of the

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.190 
going to be talking about some of the
tools<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:06.120> have<00:00:06.270> been<00:00:06.359> added<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.660> mesh<00:00:06.930> maker

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
tools that have been added to mesh maker

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.280 
tools that have been added to mesh maker
that<00:00:07.470> make<00:00:07.820> baking<00:00:08.820> very<00:00:09.179> large<00:00:09.540> scenes<00:00:09.990> a

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
that make baking very large scenes a

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.190 
that make baking very large scenes a
little<00:00:10.530> easier<00:00:11.179> so<00:00:12.179> let's<00:00:12.480> look<00:00:12.630> at<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.809> angry

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
little easier so let's look at the angry

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.490 
little easier so let's look at the angry
BOTS<00:00:13.500> scene<00:00:14.009> there's<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.519> think<00:00:14.580> about<00:00:15.500> 2600

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
BOTS scene there's I think about 2600

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.400 
BOTS scene there's I think about 2600
separate<00:00:17.130> meshes<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.150> scene<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.050> it

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
separate meshes in this scene so it

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.500 
separate meshes in this scene so it
would<00:00:19.529> be<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> lot<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.890> work<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:21.090> bake<00:00:21.270> this

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
would be a lot of work to bake this

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.380 
would be a lot of work to bake this
scene<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.990> go<00:00:22.140> through<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.949> find<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
scene to go through and and find the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.540 
scene to go through and and find the
various<00:00:25.050> objects<00:00:25.650> using<00:00:25.920> different<00:00:26.250> shaders

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
various objects using different shaders

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.900 
various objects using different shaders
and<00:00:26.939> group<00:00:27.420> those<00:00:27.599> together<00:00:28.340> is<00:00:29.340> there<00:00:29.699> an

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
and group those together is there an

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.600 
and group those together is there an
easier<00:00:30.300> way<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.040> let's<00:00:32.040> look<00:00:32.130> at<00:00:32.279> some<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
easier way so let's look at some of the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.560 
easier way so let's look at some of the
tools<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.059> make<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.930> manageable<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> first

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
tools that make this manageable so first

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.450 
tools that make this manageable so first
we<00:00:36.719> create<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.020> mesh<00:00:37.230> maker<00:00:37.469> object<00:00:38.100> because<00:00:38.309> it

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
we create a mesh maker object because it

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.360 
we create a mesh maker object because it
allows<00:00:38.760> us<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.000> access<00:00:39.270> those<00:00:39.750> tools<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.500> click

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
allows us to access those tools I click

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.650 
allows us to access those tools I click
on<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> first<00:00:42.000> thing<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.300> want<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> do

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
on it and the first thing I want to do

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.580 
on it and the first thing I want to do
is<00:00:42.809> run<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.170> report<00:00:44.270> open<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.960> list

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
is run this report open to this list

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.190 
is run this report open to this list
shaders<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.340> scene<00:00:47.789> report<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.870> what<00:00:49.050> this

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
shaders in scene report so what this

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.810 
shaders in scene report so what this
does<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.800> crawls<00:00:50.070> through<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> entire

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
does is it crawls through the entire

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.110 
does is it crawls through the entire
scene<00:00:51.270> finding<00:00:51.899> every<00:00:52.260> mesh<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.860> tells<00:00:53.760> us

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
scene finding every mesh and tells us

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.110 
scene finding every mesh and tells us
what<00:00:54.660> material<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.800> shader<00:00:56.219> uses<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.969> also

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
what material what shader uses it also

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.549 
what material what shader uses it also
analyzes<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.320> meshes<00:00:59.039> and<00:01:02.690> looks<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:04.019> things

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
analyzes the meshes and looks for things

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.130 
analyzes the meshes and looks for things
that<00:01:04.769> might<00:01:04.920> cause<00:01:05.129> problems<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:06.030> baking<00:01:06.510> so

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
that might cause problems with baking so

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.500 
that might cause problems with baking so
here's<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> report<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.790> far<00:01:09.030> too<00:01:09.240> large

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
here's the report it's a far too large

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510 
here's the report it's a far too large
to<00:01:09.930> look<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.439> here<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:10.799> designed<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> be

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
to look at and here it's designed to be

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.940 
to look at and here it's designed to be
copy<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.970> paste<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.390> into<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.689> spreadsheet<00:01:12.950> so

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
copy and paste it into a spreadsheet so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.480 
copy and paste it into a spreadsheet so
if<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.159> come<00:01:14.430> over<00:01:14.460> here<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.210> already<00:01:16.280> copy<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
if we come over here I already copy and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.030 
if we come over here I already copy and
pasted<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.259> look<00:01:19.590> at<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.920> you

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
pasted it in so if you look at it you

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.450 
pasted it in so if you look at it you
can<00:01:20.070> see<00:01:20.810> it's<00:01:21.810> organized<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.680> by<00:01:22.920> shader

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
can see it's organized this by shader

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.929 
can see it's organized this by shader
and<00:01:23.960> so<00:01:24.960> here's<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.500> diffuse<00:01:25.920> shader<00:01:25.950> these

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
and so here's the diffuse shader these

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.910 
and so here's the diffuse shader these
are<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> objects<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.750> use<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.229> tells<00:01:28.740> us

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
are the objects that use it tells us

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.429 
are the objects that use it tells us
what<00:01:29.100> light<00:01:29.400> map<00:01:29.790> those<00:01:30.479> objects<00:01:30.990> are<00:01:31.110> on

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
what light map those objects are on

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.620 
what light map those objects are on
whether<00:01:32.040> those<00:01:32.310> objects<00:01:32.729> are<00:01:32.850> static<00:01:33.299> or<00:01:33.450> not

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
whether those objects are static or not

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.840 
whether those objects are static or not
whether<00:01:34.290> they<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.560> overlapping<00:01:35.009> sub<00:01:35.400> -<00:01:35.670> out

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
whether they have overlapping sub - out

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.510 
whether they have overlapping sub - out
of<00:01:36.030> bound<00:01:36.240> view<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.990> v's<00:01:37.259> multiple<00:01:37.860> materials

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
of bound view you v's multiple materials

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.359 
of bound view you v's multiple materials
what<00:01:38.820> material<00:01:39.450> they<00:01:39.570> use<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.020> any<00:01:40.710> warnings

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
what material they use and any warnings

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.440 
what material they use and any warnings
that<00:01:41.759> mesh<00:01:42.090> Baker<00:01:42.390> generates<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:44.450> means

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that mesh Baker generates that means

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.520 
that mesh Baker generates that means
that<00:01:45.689> mesh<00:01:46.229> Baker<00:01:46.500> might<00:01:47.130> find<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.850> hard<00:01:48.060> so

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
that mesh Baker might find this hard so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.020 
that mesh Baker might find this hard so
for<00:01:49.530> here's<00:01:49.680> an<00:01:49.799> example<00:01:50.250> cliff<00:01:50.490> Rock<00:01:50.759> this

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
for here's an example cliff Rock this

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.580 
for here's an example cliff Rock this
has<00:01:51.210> uvz<00:01:51.600> outside<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> range<00:01:52.380> which<00:01:52.560> is

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
has uvz outside the range which is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.889 
has uvz outside the range which is
basically<00:01:53.070> tiling<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:56.390> master<00:01:57.390> baker<00:01:57.540> can

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
basically tiling so master baker can

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.530 
basically tiling so master baker can
only<00:01:58.049> include<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:59.250> other<00:01:59.540> objects

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
only include that with other objects

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.679 
only include that with other objects
these<00:02:01.140> are<00:02:01.740> all<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:03.079> a<00:02:04.700> light<00:02:05.700> map<00:02:05.939> use<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
these are all on a a light map use the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.770 
these are all on a a light map use the
same<00:02:06.869> light<00:02:07.049> map<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:08.179> there<00:02:09.179> are<00:02:09.330> objects

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
same light map but there are objects

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.540 
same light map but there are objects

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
that use different night map now this

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.490 
that use different night map now this
report<00:02:11.760> has<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.720> basically<00:02:13.230> or

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
report has is basically or

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.800 
report has is basically or
organized<00:02:13.830> into<00:02:14.580> objects<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.360> would<00:02:15.540> bake

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
organized into objects that would bake

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.890 
organized into objects that would bake
well<00:02:16.140> together<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:18.180> begs<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.570> question

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
well together so that begs the question

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.950 
well together so that begs the question
will<00:02:19.430> if<00:02:20.430> mesh<00:02:20.700> bigger<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.180> already<00:02:21.480> organize

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
will if mesh bigger can already organize

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.630 
will if mesh bigger can already organize
my<00:02:22.140> objects<00:02:22.500> into<00:02:22.830> objects<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.310> would<00:02:23.460> bake

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
my objects into objects that would bake

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.610 
my objects into objects that would bake
well<00:02:23.880> together<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.620> automatically

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
well together can it automatically

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.160 
well together can it automatically
generate<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.760> mesh<00:02:27.030> bakers<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.510> configure

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
generate the mesh bakers and configure

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.230 
generate the mesh bakers and configure
those<00:02:28.350> for<00:02:28.710> me<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.520> answer<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.820> yes<00:02:30.030> it

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
those for me and the answer is yes it

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.890 
those for me and the answer is yes it
can<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.620> that's<00:02:32.610> what<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.000> auto-generate

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
can so that's what this auto-generate

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.710 
can so that's what this auto-generate
baker's<00:02:34.350> tool<00:02:34.680> does<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:36.120> if<00:02:36.300> i<00:02:36.360> look<00:02:36.390> at<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
baker's tool does so if i look at the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.230 
baker's tool does so if i look at the
tools<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:38.280> first<00:02:38.520> thing<00:02:38.700> i<00:02:38.790> have<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:38.970> do<00:02:39.120> is

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
tools the first thing i have to do is

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.570 
tools the first thing i have to do is
pick<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.660> folder<00:02:40.260> where<00:02:40.770> all<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.250> combined

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
pick a folder where all the combined

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.960 
pick a folder where all the combined
material<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:43.610> generated<00:02:44.610> result

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
material and the generated result

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.280 
material and the generated result
materials<00:02:45.510> are<00:02:45.600> going<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.780> go<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:47.810> let's<00:02:48.810> pick

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
materials are going to go so let's pick

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.199 
materials are going to go so let's pick
that<00:02:49.320> folder<00:02:51.739> then<00:02:52.739> included<00:02:53.580> objects<00:02:53.970> must

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
that folder then included objects must

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.210 
that folder then included objects must
be<00:02:54.360> static

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
be static

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.300 
be static
so<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.590> works<00:02:58.770> very<00:02:58.980> well<00:02:59.070> on

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
so in this that that works very well on

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.670 
so in this that that works very well on
a<00:02:59.340> scene<00:02:59.610> like<00:02:59.820> this<00:03:00.060> where<00:03:00.510> unity<00:03:01.290> has<00:03:01.410> been

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
a scene like this where unity has been

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.740 
a scene like this where unity has been
good<00:03:02.400> about<00:03:02.690> flagging<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.840> obstacle<00:03:04.680> checks

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
good about flagging the obstacle checks

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.590 
good about flagging the obstacle checks
so<00:03:06.750> we<00:03:06.989> won't<00:03:07.170> pick<00:03:07.320> up<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.800> dynamic<00:03:08.280> ones

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
so we won't pick up the dynamic ones

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.850 
so we won't pick up the dynamic ones
light<00:03:09.600> mapping<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.380> case<00:03:10.590> let's

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
light mapping in this case let's

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.860 
light mapping in this case let's
preserve<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.520> light<00:03:11.700> mapping<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.360> then<00:03:12.810> I

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
preserve the light mapping and then I

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.190 
preserve the light mapping and then I
can<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.260> click<00:03:13.470> generate<00:03:14.100> bakers

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
can just click generate bakers

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.680 
can just click generate bakers
so<00:03:16.200> mesh<00:03:16.980> bakers<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.700> crawling<00:03:18.299> through<00:03:18.480> the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
so mesh bakers is crawling through the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.020 
so mesh bakers is crawling through the
scene<00:03:18.980> basically<00:03:19.980> doing<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.489> same<00:03:20.670> thing<00:03:20.910> it

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
scene basically doing the same thing it

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.880 
scene basically doing the same thing it
did<00:03:21.330> when<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.660> generated<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.230> report<00:03:22.350> except

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
did when it generated the report except

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.340 
did when it generated the report except
this<00:03:23.010> time<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.430> actually<00:03:23.549> creating<00:03:24.350> mesh

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
this time it's actually creating mesh

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.470 
this time it's actually creating mesh
bakers<00:03:25.739> it's<00:03:25.920> creating<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:27.150> combined

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
bakers it's creating the combined

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.570 
bakers it's creating the combined
material<00:03:28.019> assets<00:03:28.140> in<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.590> result<00:03:28.950> material

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
material assets in the result material

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.030 
material assets in the result material
and<00:03:30.390> it's<00:03:30.959> configuring<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.840> result<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
and it's configuring the the result the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.390 
and it's configuring the the result the
settings<00:03:35.430> on<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.670> result<00:03:35.970> material<00:03:36.480> assets

the<00:03:38.400> picking<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> shader<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.630> such<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:41.040> takes

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
the picking the shader and such it takes

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.430 
the picking the shader and such it takes
you<00:03:41.940> know<00:03:42.060> on<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.570> big<00:03:42.750> scene<00:03:42.959> like<00:03:43.110> this<00:03:43.230> it'll

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
you know on a big scene like this it'll

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.250 
you know on a big scene like this it'll
take<00:03:43.620> 30<00:03:43.920> seconds<00:03:44.459> or<00:03:44.610> so<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:49.110> pays

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
take 30 seconds or so and it pays

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.039 
take 30 seconds or so and it pays
attention<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.829> things<00:03:50.190> like<00:03:50.570> light<00:03:51.570> in<00:03:51.780> this

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
attention to things like light in this

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.600 
attention to things like light in this
case<00:03:52.260> light<00:03:52.500> mapping<00:03:54.049> okay<00:03:55.049> so<00:03:55.110> created<00:03:55.890> 65

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
case light mapping okay so created 65

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
bakers added two thousand nine hundred

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.750

and<00:03:59.459> seventy<00:04:00.239> nine<00:04:00.269> objects<00:04:01.049> so<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.040> can<00:04:02.519> see

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
and seventy nine objects so you can see

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.039 
and seventy nine objects so you can see
those<00:04:03.299> bakers<00:04:04.049> here<00:04:04.350> in<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.560> scene<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:06.200> I<00:04:07.200> can

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
those bakers here in the scene and I can

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.009 
those bakers here in the scene and I can
click<00:04:10.049> through<00:04:10.290> those<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:11.130> see<00:04:12.060> essentially

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
click through those and see essentially

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.409 
click through those and see essentially
what<00:04:13.260> it's<00:04:13.410> created<00:04:14.400> so<00:04:16.669> in<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.790> real<00:04:18.239> world

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
what it's created so in a real world

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.270 
what it's created so in a real world
case<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.840> would<00:04:18.989> probably<00:04:19.109> look<00:04:19.769> through<00:04:20.100> these

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
case I would probably look through these

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.909 
case I would probably look through these
there<00:04:20.790> are<00:04:20.940> some<00:04:21.690> bakers<00:04:22.140> in<00:04:22.320> here<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.890> I

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
there are some bakers in here that I

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.690 
there are some bakers in here that I
probably<00:04:23.280> don't<00:04:23.729> want<00:04:24.110> I<00:04:25.110> think

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
probably don't want I think

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.720 
probably don't want I think
it<00:04:27.330> probably<00:04:27.780> picks<00:04:28.140> it<00:04:28.320> up<00:04:28.410> so<00:04:29.130> then<00:04:29.340> I've

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
it probably picks it up so then I've

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.150 
it probably picks it up so then I've
done<00:04:29.820> that<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.270> next<00:04:30.300> step<00:04:30.630> is<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.260> bake<00:04:31.590> every

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
done that the next step is to bake every

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.730 
done that the next step is to bake every
