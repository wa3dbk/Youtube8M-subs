00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 and as a result of the video that I uploaded 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.830
 recently about how he cut me off 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.620
 I want to be able to thank you 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.719
 for the answer so pretty that I 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.790
 They gave you to think baby 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.190
 obviously we ask you for the video 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.560
 what you expected but it really is that I 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.199
 I felt really weird about uploading this video 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.900
 because I was not sure if they were going to 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.550
 say you're crazy how can you 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.740
 they cut your hair by yourself and it's going to 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.560
 happen that this was the reason why 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.149
 so long I did not upload it and many many 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.300
 many of you thanked me 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.370
 and they told me they understood me and said 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.739
 that felt the same way I did 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.329
 be with the disappointments of 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.940
 different times that they went to 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.649
 stylist and I really love when 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.850
 I only videos that are of help to 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.039
 you and that you can 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.530
 relate to this video and with me 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.590
 tragedy and the number one question in 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.059
 this video as it is now that it's time to 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.070
 cut my hair and I tried 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.500
 answer them as well as saying something 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.989
 fast but I thought it 's a good idea 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 because if there are so many of you 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.750
 who are 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.940
 that same question then it's worth it 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.030
 make them a video if we go with the signal 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.100
 number one that must be more than obvious 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.260
 Do not believe me that has happened to me so 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.760
 that's why I'm telling you not 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.790
 we have the common sense to say ay 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.860
 because my tips are already dry maybe that 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.900
 m a haircut many of the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.810
 Sometimes that is one of the first signs 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.850
 and that's the first we ignore and I 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.619
 I know many of you designs that 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.540
 nothing grows my super slow hair and 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.280
 cutting though is a bit is a 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.800
 martyrdom I feel I want to grow up 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.500
 long I really understand your dilemma but 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.170
 believe me if you let your hair 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.750
 grow in a way that is not healthy and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.270
 that your points are dry when you are 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.470
 well very long what is going to happen is that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.690
 those tips are spreading 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.250
 extending and at the end of accounts to 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.860
 finish with long hair but with 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.990
 horrible dots and your hair is not 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.420
 is going to have that body that you want 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.940
 that has to look beautiful like that 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.560
 rapunzel and it's more is very likely that 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.450
 that is the reason why your hair 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.489
 it is not growing and another way 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.849
 to see if your tips are asking for a 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.340
 screaming cut up your hair like this 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.400
 it does notice that it twists it and the tips 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.370
 that get out of here from the sides are 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.519
 items that are arched or open 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.069
 in the middle or in the form of and those are the 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.670
 you want to cut number 2 if you 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.880
 hair is looking super dead and 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.250
 without volume you get up and just like you 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.700
 you lift up so your hair stays 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.709
 lavas and nothing happens no longer have as 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.720
 to fit it you comb it from one side and 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.150
 from the other you change places the line 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.519
 whatever, and nothing works 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.950
 you have as well as who says a snooze 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.900
 that does not go away for nothing is a sign of 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.390
 that you should put the scissors because 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.150
 one thing is that your hair is heavy and 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.430
 be abundant like mine I have 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.620
 pretty hair and I know more or less 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.209
 now see the difference between that my 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.849
 hair is heavy and that 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.799
 definitely no longer has a body and 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.020
 he does not want to do anything and if you're thinking 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.990
 I remember when I cut it 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.820
 I was pretty settled and how nice I 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.680
 they had left my court it shows the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.750
 difference of note as you can 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.880
 handle much better that's where we should 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.490
 to realize that it's time baby 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.220
 when you are a lock of a single 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.440
 long and it goes well well well thick here 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.200
 up and then work has no more 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.080
 that a few three hairs are not 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.790
 all the hair completely long and it 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.070
 supposed to be we see only 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.380
 long in that fuse not only the 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.290
 dryness was killing his hair 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.600
 it's already splitting so much that it's 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.640
 eating is like rotting index 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.190
 because the hair gets on if you do not 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.350
 It does not moisturize it, it does not moisturize it 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.120
 gives her her haircut and she knows 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.030
 is going to start eating it to 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.980
 split and will start to arrive until 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.450
 up your hair and this can also 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.700
 be the reason why you are being 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.950
 falling can not only be genetic 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.690
 sometimes when we leave literal 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.790
 I spend so much time talking 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.070
 and that there are people who do not cut 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.270
 hair in more than six months until a 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.610
 year that 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.140
 I started a blunt I'm not 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.090
 saying that once a month because neither 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.070
 even I do that but at least 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.959
 every two months and I can not be 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.750
 of course it can also be a signal 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.630
 of poor nutrition so take your water 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.580
 comments vegetables eat fish those are 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.580
 things that will help strengthen your 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.060
 hair number 4 you are with your beau 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.700
 they are there, spending a lot of time and 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.520
 soon the stick gets you there by the 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.560
 hair and what happens that you can not 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.870
 draw not only because you want your 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.700
 gallant can pass your hands and in your 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.010
 visits of silk and that animal that 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.080
 dry tips is a direct signal and 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.420
 believe me now that I bring the firewoods 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.840
 oxygenated you know the peroxide 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.390
 dry and obviously it takes everything out 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.730
 is the pigment to your hair that makes 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.760
 the hair becomes thinner and more 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.620
 prone to becoming entangled and that before 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.350
 PachÃ³n dog so if you can not 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.630
 to pass even the comb then not only 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.060
 your hair is super dehydrated but 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.090
 urgently needs that at least 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.470
 you cut the tips that helps that you 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.570
 they become like who did 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.270
 regenerate and although we do not see it 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.220
 the strand of hair is restored and if 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.199
 you have this problem a lot about 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.180
 everything when you just woke up you 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.160
 I recommend that you sleep with a braid 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.770
 because usually if you sleep with your 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.330
 hair loose and if you sleep like a demon 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.580
 you're lucky way with hair 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.470
 braided so you do not get tangled up and that 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.060
 will help your courts do not have 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.130
 to be so followed because of that 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.020
 way it's not rubbed and it's going to be more 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.360
 easy that you give in networks the hair in 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.700
 the morning avoiding milestones and what 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.860
 they are bursting others being that what 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.770
 you can avoid you feel that it does not matter anymore 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.840
 when the masks and treatments and 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.060
 shampoo and conditioner you put on the 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.830
 hair and nothing is working 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.500
 because the masks even if they are 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.270
 natural as good as they are baby 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.740
 they're going to stop working they 're not going to 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.810
 serve at all because like 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.110
 that the skin when we expose 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.479
 our skin and we remove all that skin 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.699
 dead on top that serves us the 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:20.250
 hair is the same the dead ends 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:22.080
 are preventing your treatments and 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.340
 All that is absorbed well in your hair 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.410
 just as with the skin 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.090
 the hair is the same and if you notice that the 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.889
 color of your hair is no longer the same and 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.949
 no matter how many times I paint it, it is 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.210
 your color is all opaque and dead to 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.370
 Sometimes you do not even have to 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.470
 repaint simply by giving you a 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.510
 cut the color returns as well as to 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.970
 leave again feel alive with you 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.340
 shinny golden curls look like this all 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.340
 the pretty pieces if you want a way 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.590
 beautiful beautiful magazine take your water 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.690
 eat your vegetables if you are not taking 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.310
 water just like with skin nothing is going 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.410
 to work as always come your
