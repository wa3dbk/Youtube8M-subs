I<00:00:07.040> did<00:00:08.040> not<00:00:08.630> record<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:10.080> installation<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
I did not record the installation of the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.030 
I did not record the installation of the
batteries<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:12.200> wanted<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.320> have<00:00:13.710> full

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
batteries I wanted to have full

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.660 
batteries I wanted to have full
attention<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.849> what<00:00:15.240> what<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.570> was<00:00:15.750> doing<00:00:16.609> but<00:00:17.609> I

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
attention on what what I was doing but I

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.660 
attention on what what I was doing but I
will<00:00:18.000> tell<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:19.130> we<00:00:20.130> do<00:00:20.310> need<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.550> be

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
will tell you that we do need to be

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.620 
will tell you that we do need to be
careful<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:22.100> make<00:00:23.100> sure<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.000> follow

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
careful and make sure that you follow

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.679 
careful and make sure that you follow
the<00:00:24.840> directions<00:00:24.869> very<00:00:25.560> carefully<00:00:26.390> because<00:00:27.390> if

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
the directions very carefully because if

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.529 
the directions very carefully because if
you<00:00:27.840> look<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.580> it<00:00:29.580> appears<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
you look at this it appears that the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.290 
you look at this it appears that the
radio<00:00:30.949> they<00:00:31.949> were<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.399> seen<00:00:32.669> by<00:00:32.880> common

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
radio they were just seen by common

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.040 
radio they were just seen by common
sense<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> radio<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:35.540> facing<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.989> way

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
sense that the radio is facing this way

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.619 
sense that the radio is facing this way
and<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.530> turned<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.129> night<00:00:38.700> reality<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.420> is

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
and you turned it a night reality it is

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.020 
and you turned it a night reality it is
facing<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.530> way<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.469> this<00:00:43.550> side<00:00:44.550> which<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
facing this way so this side which is

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.029 
facing this way so this side which is
the<00:00:45.300> top<00:00:45.570> side<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.770> should<00:00:47.010> be

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the top side is the one that should be

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.990 
the top side is the one that should be
coming<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.899> should<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.760> bottom

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
coming out and should be this bottom

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.299 
coming out and should be this bottom
adjustment<00:00:54.110> is<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> one<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> pretty<00:00:56.129> much

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
adjustment is the one that pretty much

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.510 
adjustment is the one that pretty much
stays<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.820> place<00:00:57.500> now<00:00:58.500> you'll<00:00:58.649> notice<00:00:58.859> here<00:00:59.039> I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
stays in place now you'll notice here I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.200 
stays in place now you'll notice here I
have<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.859> something<00:01:01.859> connected<00:01:02.340> here<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.730> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
have a something connected here this is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.990 
have a something connected here this is
a<00:01:03.239> counterpoise<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.250> I'm<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> use<00:01:05.670> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
a counterpoise so if I'm going to use it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.630 
a counterpoise so if I'm going to use it
with<00:01:06.119> one<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:06.450> portable<00:01:06.810> antennas<00:01:07.580> they<00:01:08.580> do

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
with one of my portable antennas they do

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.810 
with one of my portable antennas they do
recommend<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.330> grounding<00:01:09.780> counterpoise<00:01:10.820> this

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
recommend a grounding counterpoise this

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.690 
recommend a grounding counterpoise this
is<00:01:12.030> actually<00:01:12.630> from<00:01:12.720> Buddy<00:01:12.990> Pole<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.250> just

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
is actually from Buddy Pole so I just

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.120 
is actually from Buddy Pole so I just
went<00:01:14.880> ahead<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.150> connected<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.689> that

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
went ahead and connected it to that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.289 
went ahead and connected it to that
connector<00:01:17.130> there<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.520> do<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> pigtail

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
connector there I do have a pigtail

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.890 
connector there I do have a pigtail
which<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> BNC<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:21.140> so2<00:01:22.140> 39<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> PL<00:01:24.270> 259

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
which is a BNC to so2 39 so that PL 259

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.920 
which is a BNC to so2 39 so that PL 259
fits<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.130> first<00:01:26.909> thing<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.119> did<00:01:27.299> after<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.720> put

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
fits in so first thing I did after I put

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.069 
fits in so first thing I did after I put
the<00:01:28.020> batteries<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.979> real<00:01:29.159> careful<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
the batteries in it be real careful to

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.510 
the batteries in it be real careful to
because<00:01:31.079> when<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.890> went<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.189> put<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.400> back

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
because when I went to put it back

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.080 
because when I went to put it back
together

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
together

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.179 
together
there<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.689> some<00:01:34.079> kind<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> red<00:01:34.530> wire<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.100> I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
there was some kind of red wire and I

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.890 
there was some kind of red wire and I
noticed<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> wasn't<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.450> back<00:01:36.479> together

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
noticed it wasn't going back together

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.600 
noticed it wasn't going back together
good<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.439> was<00:01:37.530> being<00:01:37.770> pinched<00:01:38.159> right<00:01:38.220> here

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
good and it was being pinched right here

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.819 
good and it was being pinched right here
there<00:01:39.509> are<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> lot<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.869> wires<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.320> things<00:01:40.680> in

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
there are a lot of wires and things in

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.789 
there are a lot of wires and things in
there<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.670> most<00:01:41.880> difficult<00:01:42.799> batteries

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
there and the most difficult batteries

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.319 
there and the most difficult batteries
to<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:44.970> really<00:01:45.090> really

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
to get in if you don't really really

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.230 
to get in if you don't really really
crack<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.049> open<00:01:46.430> which<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.610> shows<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.030> pretty

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
crack it open which it shows it pretty

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
crack it open which it shows it pretty
open<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> owner's<00:01:49.439> manual<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:49.950> here

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
open in the owner's manual right here

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.690 
open in the owner's manual right here
but<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.390> didn't<00:01:51.750> really<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
but I didn't really want to do that the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.789 
but I didn't really want to do that the
most<00:01:54.090> difficult<00:01:54.540> ones<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.320> ones<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
most difficult ones is the ones with the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.340 
most difficult ones is the ones with the
springs<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> top<00:01:56.780> because<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:58.229> to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
springs on the top because you have to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.770 
springs on the top because you have to
kind<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.070> fit<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.460> finger<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.969> push<00:02:00.450> them<00:02:00.659> in

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
kind of fit your finger in push them in

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.990 
kind of fit your finger in push them in
and<00:02:00.930> push<00:02:01.079> down<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.070> just<00:02:02.100> put<00:02:02.399> my<00:02:02.520> hand<00:02:02.790> in

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and push down but I just put my hand in

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.260 
and push down but I just put my hand in
there<00:02:03.560> luckily<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:05.030> monster<00:02:06.030> hands

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
there luckily I don't have monster hands

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.789 
there luckily I don't have monster hands
but<00:02:06.509> they<00:02:06.600> are<00:02:06.719> bigger<00:02:06.990> than<00:02:07.170> probably

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
but they are bigger than probably

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.449 
but they are bigger than probably

so<00:02:09.179> my<00:02:10.079> ex<00:02:10.259> while<00:02:10.469> probably<00:02:10.769> would<00:02:11.009> even

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
so my ex while probably would even

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.319 
so my ex while probably would even
better<00:02:11.310> putting<00:02:11.549> the<00:02:11.609> batteries<00:02:11.969> in<00:02:12.150> but

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:12.329 
better putting the batteries in but

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.259 
better putting the batteries in but
first<00:02:12.810> thing<00:02:13.019> I<00:02:13.079> did<00:02:13.260> when<00:02:13.379> I<00:02:13.439> fired<00:02:13.829> it<00:02:13.950> up

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
first thing I did when I fired it up

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.849 
first thing I did when I fired it up
they<00:02:15.269> turned<00:02:15.540> right<00:02:15.629> on<00:02:15.930> first<00:02:16.620> thing<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.799> did

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
they turned right on first thing I did

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.369 
they turned right on first thing I did
was<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.129> turned<00:02:17.189> off<00:02:17.609> the<00:02:17.640> backlight<00:02:18.379> the

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
was I turned off the backlight the

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.860 
was I turned off the backlight the
backlight<00:02:20.129> is<00:02:20.340> what<00:02:20.969> is<00:02:21.090> going<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.299> draw<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
backlight is what is going to draw the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.199 
backlight is what is going to draw the
most<00:02:22.079> current<00:02:22.469> on<00:02:22.650> receive<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.400> turn<00:02:23.969> it<00:02:24.090> off

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
most current on receive I turn it off

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.039 
most current on receive I turn it off
the<00:02:24.359> backlight

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
the backlight

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.809 
the backlight
you<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.530> are<00:02:25.769> not<00:02:25.950> drawing<00:02:26.250> much<00:02:26.459> current

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
you really are not drawing much current

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.990 
you really are not drawing much current
at<00:02:26.909> all<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.810> right<00:02:28.109> now<00:02:28.530> I'm<00:02:29.340> on<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.609> 40<00:02:29.849> meter

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
at all so right now I'm on the 40 meter

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.830 
at all so right now I'm on the 40 meter
band<00:02:30.209> let's<00:02:30.689> just<00:02:30.870> do<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.049> a<00:02:31.469> tune-up<00:02:32.400> here<00:02:33.389> see

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
band let's just do a a tune-up here see

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.390 
band let's just do a a tune-up here see
how<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.049> works<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:34.379> battery<00:02:34.620> power<00:02:37.159> huh<00:02:38.189> I<00:02:40.400> had

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
how it works on battery power huh I had

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.199 
how it works on battery power huh I had
no<00:02:41.579> clue<00:02:41.639> as<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.030> why<00:02:43.700> well<00:02:44.700> probably<00:02:44.970> because

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
no clue as to why well probably because

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.170 
no clue as to why well probably because
my<00:02:45.329> batteries<00:02:45.689> just<00:02:45.720> went<00:02:46.079> out<00:02:46.819> so<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:47.909> can

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
my batteries just went out so you can

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.559 
my batteries just went out so you can
see<00:02:48.359> that<00:02:48.689> obviously<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:50.120> didn't<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.299> full

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
see that obviously I didn't have a full

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.690 
see that obviously I didn't have a full
charge<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.109> these<00:02:52.260> batteries<00:02:52.439> that<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.280> this

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
charge on these batteries that this this

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.509 
charge on these batteries that this this
battery<00:02:54.120> set<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.530> one<00:02:55.769> set<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.280> have

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
battery set is the one set that I have

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.339 
battery set is the one set that I have
that<00:02:56.849> does<00:02:57.030> not<00:02:57.209> have<00:02:57.419> the<00:02:57.540> long-term<00:02:57.900> storage

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
that does not have the long-term storage

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.909 
that does not have the long-term storage
but<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.709> has<00:02:58.889> higher<00:02:59.159> milliamp<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:01.049> these<00:03:01.739> are

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
but it has higher milliamp so these are

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.899 
but it has higher milliamp so these are
the<00:03:02.010> kind<00:03:02.219> of<00:03:02.280> things<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:02.700> are<00:03:02.819> actually

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
the kind of things that are actually

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.670 
the kind of things that are actually
really<00:03:03.269> good<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.569> do<00:03:03.810> on<00:03:03.840> video<00:03:04.260> because<00:03:04.560> you

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
really good to do on video because you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.159 
really good to do on video because you
can<00:03:04.829> see<00:03:05.099> well<00:03:05.969> if<00:03:06.359> your<00:03:06.540> battery's<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> little

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
can see well if your battery's a little

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.649 
can see well if your battery's a little
weak<00:03:07.349> and<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:07.799> takes<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:08.909> something<00:03:09.480> that

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
weak and you takes you something that

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.170 
weak and you takes you something that
I'm<00:03:10.079> just<00:03:10.290> going<00:03:10.439> to<00:03:10.530> take<00:03:10.709> some<00:03:10.739> current<00:03:11.250> boom

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
I'm just going to take some current boom

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.360 
I'm just going to take some current boom
you<00:03:12.510> know<00:03:12.629> they<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:12.810> they<00:03:13.650> died<00:03:13.859> out<00:03:13.889> now

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
you know they just they died out now

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.640 
you know they just they died out now

if you notice that if you caught that it

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.050 
if you notice that if you caught that it
said<00:03:28.079> battery<00:03:28.409> low<00:03:28.729> and<00:03:29.729> long<00:03:29.849> how<00:03:30.000> to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
said battery low and long how to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.640 
said battery low and long how to
duplicate<00:03:30.419> that<00:03:30.479> let's<00:03:31.169> just<00:03:31.290> see<00:03:31.409> if<00:03:31.470> we<00:03:31.500> get

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
duplicate that let's just see if we get

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:43.430 
duplicate that let's just see if we get
a<00:03:31.680> signal<00:03:31.919> in

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.500 

now<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.650> is<00:03:44.770> full<00:03:45.100> blast<00:03:45.340> on<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.820> audio<00:03:46.180> and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
now that is full blast on the audio and

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.050 
now that is full blast on the audio and
that's<00:03:47.350> one<00:03:47.560> thing<00:03:47.710> I've<00:03:47.830> noticed<00:03:48.010> on<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.580> kx3

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
that's one thing I've noticed on the kx3

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.530 
that's one thing I've noticed on the kx3
is<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:50.910> probably<00:03:51.910> better<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.180> get<00:03:52.420> the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
is that probably better to get the

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.560 
is that probably better to get the
headset<00:03:53.490> I<00:03:54.490> don't<00:03:55.000> know<00:03:55.090> if<00:03:55.210> I'm<00:03:55.330> gonna<00:03:55.450> buy

I<00:04:12.910> don't<00:04:13.180> know<00:04:13.330> but<00:04:13.570> you<00:04:13.750> can<00:04:14.080> see<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.740> mean

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
I don't know but you can see that I mean

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.000 
I don't know but you can see that I mean
that's<00:04:15.400> full<00:04:15.580> blast<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:17.650> don't<00:04:17.709> know<00:04:17.890> if

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
that's full blast and I don't know if

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.740 
that's full blast and I don't know if
that's<00:04:18.190> less<00:04:18.489> than<00:04:18.519> it<00:04:19.180> was<00:04:19.299> its<00:04:19.450> own<00:04:19.540> battery

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
that's less than it was its own battery

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.400 
that's less than it was its own battery
but<00:04:20.489> there<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.640> not<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:21.850> ton<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.330> audio<00:04:22.870> that

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
but there is not a ton of audio that

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.890 
but there is not a ton of audio that
comes<00:04:23.440> out<00:04:23.800> of<00:04:23.950> this<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.880> rig<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:25.450> if<00:04:25.720> you're

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
comes out of this this rig so if you're

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.330 
comes out of this this rig so if you're
going<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.080> be<00:04:26.200> portable<00:04:26.590> somewhere<00:04:27.160> where

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
going to be portable somewhere where

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.810 
going to be portable somewhere where
there's<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:28.050> exterior<00:04:29.050> noise<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:30.430> may<00:04:30.610> be<00:04:30.670> an

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
there's a exterior noise it may be an

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.940 
there's a exterior noise it may be an
issue<00:04:31.000> unless<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.510> have<00:04:31.690> a<00:04:31.720> headset<00:04:32.230> on<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.740> no

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
issue unless you have a headset on so no

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.800 
issue unless you have a headset on so no
big<00:04:33.160> deal<00:04:33.370> I<00:04:33.640> mean<00:04:34.210> there's<00:04:34.540> going<00:04:34.690> to<00:04:34.750> be

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
big deal I mean there's going to be

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.410 
big deal I mean there's going to be
little<00:04:35.110> things<00:04:35.800> like<00:04:35.980> that<00:04:36.040> that<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:37.270> know

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
little things like that that you know

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.950 
little things like that that you know
may<00:04:38.110> be<00:04:38.140> a<00:04:38.770> little<00:04:39.190> bit<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.490> peppy<00:04:39.910> but<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.450> mean

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
may be a little bit of peppy but I mean

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.990 
may be a little bit of peppy but I mean
look<00:04:41.200> it<00:04:41.590> they<00:04:41.919> designed<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.520> draw<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:42.820> low

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
look it they designed it to draw a low

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.110 
look it they designed it to draw a low
current<00:04:43.710> you<00:04:44.710> saw<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.040> batteries<00:04:45.550> go<00:04:45.760> out<00:04:45.940> but

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
current you saw the batteries go out but

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.790 
current you saw the batteries go out but
yet<00:04:46.390> I<00:04:46.450> was<00:04:46.570> still<00:04:46.630> able<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:47.050> start<00:04:47.380> it<00:04:47.560> so<00:04:47.590> an

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
yet I was still able to start it so an

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.620 
yet I was still able to start it so an
emergency<00:04:48.310> situation<00:04:48.550> at<00:04:49.090> least<00:04:49.210> I'd<00:04:49.360> be<00:04:49.390> able

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
emergency situation at least I'd be able

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.220 
emergency situation at least I'd be able
to<00:04:49.720> receive<00:04:50.050> for<00:04:50.320> a<00:04:50.350> longer<00:04:50.680> period<00:04:50.710> of<00:04:51.010> time

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
to receive for a longer period of time

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:00.320 
to receive for a longer period of time
let's<00:04:53.230> just<00:04:53.410> see<00:04:53.560> what<00:04:53.680> else<00:04:53.710> we<00:04:53.950> got

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.390 

not<00:05:00.900> much<00:05:01.080> more<00:05:01.260> 40<00:05:01.560> right<00:05:01.740> now<00:05:01.770> course<00:05:02.310> I

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
not much more 40 right now course I

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.190 
not much more 40 right now course I
don't<00:05:02.550> know<00:05:02.640> how<00:05:02.910> well<00:05:03.120> my<00:05:03.300> antennas<00:05:03.900> tuned

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
don't know how well my antennas tuned

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.360 
don't know how well my antennas tuned
but<00:05:04.730> sitting<00:05:05.730> affected<00:05:06.120> receive<00:05:06.450> that<00:05:06.720> much

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.170 

let's<00:05:10.940> go<00:05:11.180> up<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.800> I'll<00:05:13.010> see<00:05:13.250> now<00:05:13.550> look<00:05:13.880> a

let's go up to and I'll see now look a

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.480 
let's go up to and I'll see now look a
little<00:05:15.050> bit<00:05:15.170> extra<00:05:15.350> current<00:05:15.740> changing<00:05:16.130> bands

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
little bit extra current changing bands

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.060 
little bit extra current changing bands
and<00:05:16.700> boom<00:05:17.000> batteries<00:05:17.420> went<00:05:17.630> out<00:05:17.720> again<00:05:18.820> so

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
and boom batteries went out again so

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:27.850 
and boom batteries went out again so
let's<00:05:22.070> see<00:05:23.800> battery<00:05:24.800> low<00:05:25.120> okay<00:05:26.120> so<00:05:26.180> it<00:05:27.140> will

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
let's see battery low okay so it will

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.310 
let's see battery low okay so it will
let<00:05:28.040> you<00:05:28.130> know<00:05:28.160> matters<00:05:29.060> you<00:05:29.150> love<00:05:29.330> so<00:05:29.630> yeah

now they're gone
so<00:05:31.940> what<00:05:32.270> I'll<00:05:32.390> do<00:05:32.600> here<00:05:32.630> is<00:05:33.020> I<00:05:34.090> don't<00:05:35.090> have<00:05:35.330> the

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
so what I'll do here is I don't have the

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.790 
so what I'll do here is I don't have the
extra<00:05:35.810> batteries<00:05:36.110> with<00:05:36.290> me<00:05:36.410> I'll<00:05:36.500> have<00:05:36.650> to<00:05:36.740> go

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
extra batteries with me I'll have to go

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.920 
extra batteries with me I'll have to go
get<00:05:36.950> them<00:05:37.100> but<00:05:37.250> I'm<00:05:37.340> gonna<00:05:37.460> show<00:05:37.700> you<00:05:37.870> go<00:05:38.870> ahead

crack it open look you open it up you
can<00:06:00.530> see<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:01.160> batteries<00:06:02.830> and<00:06:03.830> again<00:06:04.340> the

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
can see the batteries and again the

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.130 
can see the batteries and again the
hardest<00:06:04.940> ones<00:06:05.150> cuz<00:06:05.390> I<00:06:05.480> didn't<00:06:05.660> want<00:06:05.780> to<00:06:05.840> open

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
hardest ones cuz I didn't want to open

hardest ones cuz I didn't want to open
it<00:06:06.260> a<00:06:06.410> tongue<00:06:06.880> the<00:06:07.880> hardest<00:06:08.300> ones<00:06:08.570> were<00:06:09.130> the

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
it a tongue the hardest ones were the

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.110 
it a tongue the hardest ones were the
ones<00:06:10.400> where<00:06:10.700> the<00:06:11.230> spring<00:06:12.230> was<00:06:12.530> facing<00:06:13.490> me<00:06:13.790> so

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
ones where the spring was facing me so

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.990 
ones where the spring was facing me so
what<00:06:14.780> I'm<00:06:14.870> gonna<00:06:14.990> do<00:06:15.230> is<00:06:15.530> I'm<00:06:16.490> gonna<00:06:16.580> see<00:06:16.880> if<00:06:16.970> I

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna see if I

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.730 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna see if I
can't<00:06:17.240> splice<00:06:17.540> this<00:06:17.750> video<00:06:18.080> together<00:06:18.260> but<00:06:18.620> I'm

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
can't splice this video together but I'm

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.800 
can't splice this video together but I'm
gonna<00:06:18.890> put<00:06:19.100> your<00:06:19.220> own<00:06:19.310> pause<00:06:19.640> here<00:06:20.030> and<00:06:20.690> we'll

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
gonna put your own pause here and we'll

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.060 
gonna put your own pause here and we'll
see<00:06:20.960> from<00:06:21.050> the<00:06:21.170> splice<00:06:21.350> together<00:06:21.530> so<00:06:21.920> I<00:06:21.980> can
