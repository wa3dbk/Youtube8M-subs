right now I can't feel it at all like I

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.330 
right now I can't feel it at all like I
think<00:05:39.510> I<00:05:39.750> over<00:05:40.050> cleaned<00:05:40.349> it<00:05:40.590> because<00:05:41.220> the

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
think I over cleaned it because the

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.990 
think I over cleaned it because the
bottle<00:05:41.580> says<00:05:42.229> three<00:05:43.229> to<00:05:43.380> six<00:05:43.740> times<00:05:44.370> a<00:05:44.550> day<00:05:44.580> and

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
bottle says three to six times a day and

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.570 
bottle says three to six times a day and
it's<00:05:45.120> kind<00:05:45.180> of<00:05:45.330> a<00:05:45.389> lot<00:05:45.539> and<00:05:46.160> I<00:05:47.160> think<00:05:47.370> I<00:05:47.430> did

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
it's kind of a lot and I think I did

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.450 
it's kind of a lot and I think I did
three<00:05:48.060> to<00:05:48.240> four<00:05:48.450> times<00:05:48.660> so<00:05:49.139> maybe<00:05:49.710> two<00:05:50.070> three

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
three to four times so maybe two three

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.000 
three to four times so maybe two three
you<00:05:51.030> want<00:05:51.120> to<00:05:51.240> be<00:05:51.330> careful<00:05:51.539> clean<00:05:52.530> it<00:05:52.710> as<00:05:52.800> much

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
you want to be careful clean it as much

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.960 
you want to be careful clean it as much
three<00:05:54.139> two<00:05:55.139> to<00:05:55.229> three<00:05:55.380> days<00:05:55.620> at<00:05:56.550> least

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
three two to three days at least

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.640 
three two to three days at least
don't<00:05:57.150> overdo<00:05:57.419> it<00:05:57.720> I<00:05:57.840> think<00:05:58.110> that's<00:05:58.229> why<00:05:58.349> it

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
don't overdo it I think that's why it

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.040 
don't overdo it I think that's why it
started<00:05:59.010> hurting<00:05:59.220> a<00:05:59.400> lot<00:05:59.550> cuz<00:06:00.150> it's<00:06:00.660> like<00:06:00.810> it

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
started hurting a lot cuz it's like it

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.420 
started hurting a lot cuz it's like it
needs<00:06:01.229> to<00:06:01.320> heal<00:06:01.590> with<00:06:01.919> the<00:06:02.010> air<00:06:02.190> and<00:06:02.430> stuff<00:06:03.020> um

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
needs to heal with the air and stuff um

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.730 
needs to heal with the air and stuff um
