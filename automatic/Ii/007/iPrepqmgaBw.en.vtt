Rice's goes because I think McLaren will
be<00:03:52.359> very<00:03:52.540> strong<00:03:52.870> as<00:03:53.049> well<00:03:53.230> Mercedes<00:03:53.680> I<00:03:54.069> think

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
be very strong as well Mercedes I think

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.430 
be very strong as well Mercedes I think
we<00:03:54.790> will<00:03:55.120> improve<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:55.540> lot<00:03:55.600> this<00:03:55.840> year<00:03:55.900> as<00:03:56.290> well

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
we will improve a lot this year as well

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.840 
we will improve a lot this year as well
so<00:03:57.329> as<00:03:58.329> the<00:03:58.840> moment<00:03:59.109> yes<00:03:59.230> red<00:03:59.739> bull<00:03:59.920> like<00:04:00.639> the

so as the moment yes red bull like the
first<00:04:01.329> reference<00:04:01.540> but<00:04:02.019> I<00:04:02.530> think<00:04:03.430> this<00:04:03.609> may

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
first reference but I think this may

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.729

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
I think when the car is quick every

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.310 
I think when the car is quick every
everything<00:04:24.460> becomes<00:04:24.820> easier<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.600> stars<00:04:25.930> are

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
everything becomes easier the stars are

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.740 
everything becomes easier the stars are
not<00:04:26.650> any<00:04:27.310> more<00:04:27.430> crucial<00:04:28.030> when<00:04:28.330> you<00:04:28.479> have<00:04:28.630> the

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
not any more crucial when you have the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.200 
not any more crucial when you have the
quickest<00:04:29.080> car<00:04:29.289> the<00:04:30.039> pit<00:04:30.220> stops<00:04:30.490> are<00:04:30.699> different

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
quickest car the pit stops are different

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.760 
quickest car the pit stops are different
because<00:04:31.449> the<00:04:31.690> mechanics<00:04:32.110> are<00:04:32.229> a<00:04:32.289> little<00:04:32.530> bit

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
because the mechanics are a little bit

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.300 
because the mechanics are a little bit
more<00:04:32.889> relaxed<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:34.660> strategy<00:04:35.190> everything<00:04:36.190> is

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
more relaxed the strategy everything is

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.820 
more relaxed the strategy everything is
good<00:04:36.490> if<00:04:36.729> you<00:04:36.880> stop<00:04:37.120> one<00:04:37.300> lap<00:04:38.020> earlier<00:04:38.229> one<00:04:38.650> lap

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
good if you stop one lap earlier one lap

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.879 
good if you stop one lap earlier one lap
later<00:04:39.030> everything<00:04:40.030> is<00:04:40.180> less<00:04:40.960> crucial<00:04:41.320> let's

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
later everything is less crucial let's

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.040 
later everything is less crucial let's
say<00:04:42.100> when<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.520> car<00:04:42.699> is<00:04:42.729> performing<00:04:43.360> well<00:04:43.570> when

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
say when the car is performing well when

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.659 
say when the car is performing well when
you<00:04:44.229> are<00:04:44.350> at<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.560> limit<00:04:44.889> when<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.280> are<00:04:45.430> not

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
you are at the limit when you are not

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.249 
you are at the limit when you are not
quick<00:04:45.880> enough<00:04:45.910> you<00:04:46.389> need<00:04:46.570> to<00:04:46.720> get<00:04:46.840> everything

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
quick enough you need to get everything

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.249 
quick enough you need to get everything
ready<00:04:47.410> so<00:04:48.180> we<00:04:49.180> did<00:04:49.360> some<00:04:49.570> some<00:04:50.050> good

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
ready so we did some some good

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.070 
ready so we did some some good
improvements<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.099> the<00:04:51.220> team<00:04:51.430> is<00:04:51.580> ready<00:04:52.300> after

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
improvements and the team is ready after

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.350 
improvements and the team is ready after
a<00:04:53.110> difficult<00:04:53.320> 2011<00:04:54.220> season<00:04:54.430> now<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.880> team<00:04:55.150> now

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
a difficult 2011 season now the team now

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.800 
a difficult 2011 season now the team now
is<00:04:55.539> more<00:04:55.780> prepared<00:04:56.139> for<00:04:56.430> for<00:04:57.430> everything<00:04:57.910> but

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
is more prepared for for everything but

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.100 
is more prepared for for everything but
we<00:04:59.110> need<00:04:59.410> a<00:04:59.680> big<00:05:00.460> fast<00:05:00.820> car<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.270> for<00:05:01.750> that<00:05:01.900> we

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
we need a big fast car and for that we

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.749 
we need a big fast car and for that we
need<00:05:02.139> aerodynamics<00:05:02.889> we<00:05:03.130> need<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.849> good

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
need aerodynamics we need the good

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.400 
need aerodynamics we need the good
maximize<00:05:06.759> of<00:05:06.910> the<00:05:07.000> Pirelli<00:05:07.389> tires<00:05:07.630> we<00:05:08.259> need

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
maximize of the Pirelli tires we need

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.159 
maximize of the Pirelli tires we need
the<00:05:08.590> big<00:05:09.430> good<00:05:09.610> probability<00:05:10.360> in<00:05:10.660> the<00:05:10.750> car<00:05:10.930> with

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
the big good probability in the car with

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.020 
the big good probability in the car with
non<00:05:11.410> mechanical<00:05:11.590> problems<00:05:12.280> finishing<00:05:12.639> all

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
non mechanical problems finishing all

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.330 
non mechanical problems finishing all
the<00:05:13.060> races<00:05:13.570> so<00:05:13.810> we<00:05:14.380> need<00:05:14.560> all<00:05:14.740> these<00:05:14.949> factors

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
the races so we need all these factors

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.339 
the races so we need all these factors
that<00:05:15.400> is<00:05:15.699> what<00:05:16.090> I<00:05:16.120> asked<00:05:16.389> that<00:05:16.690> him<00:05:16.840> obviously

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
that is what I asked that him obviously

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.939 
that is what I asked that him obviously
not<00:05:17.500> easy<00:05:17.740> but<00:05:17.949> we<00:05:18.220> would<00:05:18.400> work<00:05:18.610> for<00:05:18.849> that<00:05:19.949> you

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
not easy but we would work for that you

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.219 
not easy but we would work for that you
are<00:05:21.099> a<00:05:21.130> driver<00:05:21.610> used<00:05:22.240> to<00:05:22.330> drive<00:05:22.539> a<00:05:22.570> victory<00:05:23.050> not

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
are a driver used to drive a victory not

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.930 
are a driver used to drive a victory not
the<00:05:23.349> podium<00:05:23.710> for<00:05:23.830> victory<00:05:24.159> how<00:05:24.520> did<00:05:24.729> you

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
the podium for victory how did you

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.430 
the podium for victory how did you
personally<00:05:25.240> managed<00:05:25.780> last<00:05:26.050> year<00:05:26.289> the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
personally managed last year the

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.500 
personally managed last year the
situation<00:05:26.979> for<00:05:27.130> you<00:05:27.250> that<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.849> most<00:05:28.300> of<00:05:28.419> the

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
situation for you that the most of the

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.300 
situation for you that the most of the
time<00:05:28.690> there<00:05:28.900> was<00:05:29.050> no<00:05:29.320> chance<00:05:29.590> for<00:05:29.889> victories

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
time there was no chance for victories

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.750 
time there was no chance for victories
it<00:05:31.120> was<00:05:31.270> difficult<00:05:31.479> I<00:05:31.930> think<00:05:32.229> we<00:05:32.949> try<00:05:33.699> to

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
it was difficult I think we try to

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.610 
it was difficult I think we try to
control<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:36.220> situation<00:05:36.430> try<00:05:37.330> to<00:05:37.389> to<00:05:38.349> find

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
control the situation try to to find

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.790 
control the situation try to to find
some<00:05:39.030> new<00:05:40.030> motivations<00:05:40.720> as<00:05:41.110> you<00:05:41.320> said<00:05:41.560> maybe

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
some new motivations as you said maybe

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.770 
some new motivations as you said maybe
the<00:05:42.010> victory<00:05:42.310> was<00:05:42.520> not<00:05:42.729> possible<00:05:42.909> so<00:05:43.330> we<00:05:43.360> try

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
the victory was not possible so we try

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.230 
the victory was not possible so we try
to<00:05:43.810> get<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.139> podium<00:05:44.470> then<00:05:45.280> we<00:05:45.520> try<00:05:45.729> to<00:05:45.789> get<00:05:46.030> one

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
to get the podium then we try to get one

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.969 
to get the podium then we try to get one
victory<00:05:46.360> then<00:05:47.080> we<00:05:47.289> try<00:05:47.470> to<00:05:47.530> get<00:05:47.770> some

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
victory then we try to get some

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.850 
victory then we try to get some
information<00:05:48.130> for<00:05:48.669> 2012<00:05:49.449> there<00:05:50.139> was<00:05:50.289> some<00:05:50.500> kind

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
information for 2012 there was some kind

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.450 
information for 2012 there was some kind
of<00:05:51.419> new<00:05:52.419> challenge<00:05:52.900> every<00:05:53.259> race<00:05:53.500> knowing<00:05:54.430> that

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
of new challenge every race knowing that

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.670 
of new challenge every race knowing that
the<00:05:54.639> victory<00:05:55.120> maybe<00:05:55.360> was<00:05:55.630> out<00:05:55.870> of<00:05:55.930> our<00:05:56.320> hands

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
the victory maybe was out of our hands

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.310 
the victory maybe was out of our hands
so<00:05:57.039> it<00:05:57.820> was<00:05:58.030> it<00:05:58.300> was<00:05:58.449> difficult<00:05:58.630> for<00:05:58.930> all<00:05:59.110> of<00:05:59.139> us

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
so it was it was difficult for all of us

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.070 
so it was it was difficult for all of us
I'm<00:05:59.650> used<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.520> to<00:06:00.970> win<00:06:01.180> as<00:06:01.360> you<00:06:01.449> said<00:06:01.659> but<00:06:01.810> also

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 
it was a new situation that we try to

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.540 
it was a new situation that we try to
munch<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.389> this<00:06:10.720> 2012<00:06:11.440> we<00:06:11.620> want<00:06:11.830> to<00:06:11.979> change

got here there is a comparison view
between<00:06:18.340> Louis<00:06:19.000> and<00:06:19.210> Sebastian<00:06:20.050> and<00:06:20.199> you

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
between Louis and Sebastian and you

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.649 
between Louis and Sebastian and you
start<00:06:21.099> that<00:06:21.400> Sebastian<00:06:21.940> is<00:06:22.060> not<00:06:22.240> on<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.479> same

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
start that Sebastian is not on the same

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.390 
start that Sebastian is not on the same
level<00:06:22.720> as<00:06:23.139> Louis's<00:06:23.680> can<00:06:24.009> you<00:06:24.099> explain<00:06:24.310> that

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
level as Louis's can you explain that

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.999 
level as Louis's can you explain that
I<00:06:25.430> think<00:06:25.699> I<00:06:27.070> I<00:06:28.690> know<00:06:29.690> is<00:06:29.990> maybe<00:06:30.500> better<00:06:30.860> than

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
I think I I know is maybe better than

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:35.170 
I think I I know is maybe better than
the<00:06:31.610> Sebastian<00:06:32.210> being<00:06:33.199> teammates<00:06:33.830> and<00:06:34.340> in

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
the Sebastian being teammates and in

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.710 
the Sebastian being teammates and in
McLaren<00:06:35.720> and<00:06:36.490> Grayson<00:06:37.490> maybe<00:06:37.699> a<00:06:37.910> couple<00:06:38.539> of

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
McLaren and Grayson maybe a couple of

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.710 
McLaren and Grayson maybe a couple of
more<00:06:38.930> years<00:06:39.350> together<00:06:39.530> so<00:06:40.270> in<00:06:41.270> those<00:06:41.419> years

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
more years together so in those years

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.189 
more years together so in those years

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 
and so with winning races with not maybe

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.469 
and so with winning races with not maybe
