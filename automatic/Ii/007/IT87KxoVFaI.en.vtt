00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.950 
parts of the Caribbean pack and rockets
and<00:00:15.450> expunged<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:17.000> back<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.210> hold<00:00:18.449> they're

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
and expunged and back to hold they're

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.759 
and expunged and back to hold they're
pretty<00:00:19.109> simple<00:00:20.930> there's<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.529> one

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
pretty simple there's just like this one

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.400 
pretty simple there's just like this one
or<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:23.910> which<00:00:24.240> has<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> different<00:00:24.930> sponge

do is go to your pocket menu select any

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.080 
do is go to your pocket menu select any
sort<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.440> sponge<00:00:34.770> any<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.790> doesn't

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
sort of sponge any like it doesn't

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.470 
sort of sponge any like it doesn't
really<00:00:36.180> matter<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:37.230> sponge<00:00:37.890> or<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.579> one

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
really matter just sponge or that one

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.270 
really matter just sponge or that one
that<00:00:39.660> says<00:00:41.180> poly<00:00:42.590> steering<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.920> can't

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that says poly steering I can't

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.939 
that says poly steering I can't
polystyrene<00:00:45.210> yeah<00:00:45.719> polystyrene<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:47.989> ah

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.000 

so<00:00:52.949> yeah<00:00:53.219> select<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.699> sponge<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.440> like<00:00:55.440> this

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
so yeah select a sponge I like this

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.439 
so yeah select a sponge I like this
wrong<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.550> guess<00:00:56.930> make<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.079> three<00:00:58.260> layers<00:00:59.449> sort

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
wrong I guess make it three layers sort

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.750 
wrong I guess make it three layers sort
of<00:01:00.539> expand<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> big<00:01:02.039> enough<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.670> your

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
of expand it make it big enough for your

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.270 
of expand it make it big enough for your
sack<00:01:03.030> person<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.840> sackboy<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
sack person to be on sackboy then you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.020 
sack person to be on sackboy then you
crowd<00:01:08.659> you<00:01:09.659> sort<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.320> expand<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.340> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
crowd you sort of expand it like that so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.090 
crowd you sort of expand it like that so
it<00:01:12.090> looks<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.330> whole<00:01:12.930> shape<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.290> balsa<00:01:14.509> body

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
it looks like whole shape of balsa body

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.180 
it looks like whole shape of balsa body
um

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.470 

go<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:20.820> your<00:01:20.970> square<00:01:21.450> shape<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:23.060> make<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> huge

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
go to your square shape and make a huge

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.780 
go to your square shape and make a huge
cut<00:01:24.750> right<00:01:24.930> there<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.680> huge<00:01:26.190> actually<00:01:26.580> just

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
cut right there not huge actually just

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.380 
cut right there not huge actually just
like<00:01:26.940> small<00:01:27.330> slit<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:28.590> go<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.980> your<00:01:29.070> toes

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
like small slit and then go to your toes

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:38.030 
like small slit and then go to your toes
go<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> rockets<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:36.320> put<00:01:37.320> three<00:01:37.560> layers<00:01:37.800> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
go to rockets and put three layers of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.340 
go to rockets and put three layers of
rockets<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:40.260> it

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
rockets in there it's like a see it

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.050 
rockets in there it's like a see it
looks<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.650> they're<00:01:40.830> truly<00:01:41.100> nothing<00:01:41.790> in

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
looks like they're truly nothing in

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.830 
looks like they're truly nothing in
there<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:44.720> you<00:01:45.720> want<00:01:45.870> to<00:01:45.900> make<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.260> sale

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
it on anywhere on the Holts body then

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.270 
it on anywhere on the Holts body then
hook<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:33.989> on<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.470> three<00:02:36.950> rockets<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.160> then

hook it on to the three rockets and then

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.160 
hook it on to the three rockets and then
configure<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.150> rocket<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:39.780> there's<00:02:39.959> only

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
configure the rocket so there's only

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.910 
configure the rocket so there's only
like<00:02:41.300> seven<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.230> go<00:02:43.500> all<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.800> way<00:02:43.830> down

flags<00:04:05.790> rockets<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:07.000> can<00:04:07.180> go<00:04:07.300> backwards<00:04:07.540> and

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
flags rockets you can go backwards and

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.320 
flags rockets you can go backwards and

where<00:04:10.960> there's<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:11.920> switch<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:12.370> controls<00:04:12.820> it

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
where there's a switch that controls it

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.140 
where there's a switch that controls it
and<00:04:13.660> it<00:04:14.590> makes<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:14.950> go<00:04:15.280> either<00:04:15.460> backwards<00:04:16.060> or

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
and it makes it go either backwards or

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.590 
and it makes it go either backwards or
four<00:04:16.360> so<00:04:16.600> let's<00:04:16.840> put<00:04:17.080> it<00:04:17.170> backwards<00:04:21.480> you<00:04:22.480> can

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
four so let's put it backwards you can

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.060 
four so let's put it backwards you can
see<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.810> boat<00:04:22.990> stopped<00:04:23.350> and<00:04:23.560> asked<00:04:23.710> when<00:04:23.950> we

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
see the boat stopped and asked when we

see the boat stopped and asked when we
tour<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.340> other<00:04:24.610> way<00:04:24.790> I<00:04:25.120> have<00:04:25.840> tweaks<00:04:29.130> 10c<00:04:30.900> so

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
tour the other way I have tweaks 10c so

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.860
