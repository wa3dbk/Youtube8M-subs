00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
thing what I think this picture is is

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.340 
thing what I think this picture is is
basically<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.570> showing<00:01:07.020> us<00:01:07.140> some

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
basically like showing us some

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.929 
basically like showing us some
decoration<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.580> within<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
decoration that you can get within the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.840 
decoration that you can get within the
game<00:01:09.119> that's<00:01:09.780> what<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.049> looks<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.530> me

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
game that's what it looks like to me

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.789 
game that's what it looks like to me
dirge<00:01:11.850> various<00:01:12.390> decorations<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.619> does

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
dirge various decorations like it does

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.340 
dirge various decorations like it does
this<00:01:14.610> equality<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.240> quietly<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> quite

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this equality is quietly it's a quite

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.380 
this equality is quietly it's a quite
nicely<00:01:16.560> decorated<00:01:16.860> room<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.790> that's<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.330> I

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
nicely decorated room so that's what I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.510 
nicely decorated room so that's what I
think<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.810> picture<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.259> about<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.430> this

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
think this picture is about so in this

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.100 
think this picture is about so in this
picture<00:01:20.909> as<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.540> there<00:01:21.720> are<00:01:21.750> five

races that we don't know yet yet in this

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
races that we don't know yet yet in this
picture<00:01:33.840> there<00:01:33.990> are<00:01:34.079> 5<00:01:34.320> screenshots<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.040> only

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
one being blacked out now I don't know

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.109 
one being blacked out now I don't know
if<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> bottom<00:01:37.950> left<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> top<00:01:38.880> right

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
if the bottom left one on the top right

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.910 
if the bottom left one on the top right
are<00:01:39.329> different<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:40.110> could<00:01:40.350> potentially<00:01:40.799> be

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
are different they could potentially be

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.310 
are different they could potentially be
different<00:01:41.280> races<00:01:41.520> not<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.630> Spencer<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.140> this

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
different races not on Spencer on this

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.660 
different races not on Spencer on this
but<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.560> thought<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.799> would<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.009> bring<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.460> up

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
but I thought I would just bring this up

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.910 
but I thought I would just bring this up
just<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:45.180> case<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.689> overall<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:46.829> just

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
just in case and overall here we just

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.469 
just in case and overall here we just
sing<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.310> few<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.700> examples<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> leaf

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
sing a few more examples of the leaf

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.280 
sing a few more examples of the leaf

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
to say about this firstly the blockiness

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.040 
to say about this firstly the blockiness
that<00:02:43.530> you'll<00:02:43.650> notice<00:02:44.130> here<00:02:44.670> will<00:02:45.090> actually<00:02:45.750> be

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
that you'll notice here will actually be

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.860 
that you'll notice here will actually be
fixed<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:47.040> is<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:48.030> soon<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.510> maps<00:02:48.750> will

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
fixed that is just it soon the maps will

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.960 
fixed that is just it soon the maps will
be<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.380> planets<00:02:49.709> will<00:02:49.800> be<00:02:49.920> pre-loaded<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.910> you

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
be the planets will be pre-loaded so you

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.220 
be the planets will be pre-loaded so you
won't<00:02:51.180> have<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.480> problem<00:02:51.810> with<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.020> maps

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
won't have the problem with the maps

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.560 
won't have the problem with the maps
generating<00:02:53.010> as<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.310> spawn<00:02:53.670> there<00:02:53.970> now<00:02:54.540> I

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570

used from when you teleport from the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.170 
used from when you teleport from the
ship<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.070> planet<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.580> what<00:03:11.940> I<00:03:11.970> need<00:03:12.150> to

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
ship to the planet and what I need to

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.060 
ship to the planet and what I need to
say<00:03:12.300> here<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.290> color<00:03:13.530> that's<00:03:13.770> used

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
say here is the the color that's used

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.610 
say here is the the color that's used
when<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.459> teleport<00:03:15.000> can<00:03:15.540> be<00:03:15.660> changed<00:03:16.110> in<00:03:16.530> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
when you teleport can be changed in the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.770 
when you teleport can be changed in the
character<00:03:16.980> creation<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.700> apparently<00:03:18.540> this

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
character creation and apparently this

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.870 
character creation and apparently this
also<00:03:19.380> controls<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:19.980> lot<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.220> other<00:03:20.400> things<00:03:20.700> that

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
also controls a lot of other things that

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.520 
also controls a lot of other things that
happens<00:03:21.330> within<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.690> game<00:03:21.959> yet<00:03:22.260> what<00:03:22.440> we

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
happens within the game yet what we

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.740 
happens within the game yet what we
haven't<00:03:22.799> found<00:03:22.920> out<00:03:23.130> about<00:03:23.250> yet<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:24.180> yeah<00:03:24.480> that

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
haven't found out about yet so yeah that

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.020 
haven't found out about yet so yeah that
is<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.900> cool<00:03:25.230> animation<00:03:25.950> which<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.370> open<00:03:26.910> this

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
is a cool animation which you open this

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.940 
is a cool animation which you open this
pretty<00:03:27.269> in<00:03:27.360> slow<00:03:27.540> motion<00:03:27.720> right<00:03:27.959> now<00:03:28.140> but<00:03:28.650> yeah

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
pretty in slow motion right now but yeah

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.710 
pretty in slow motion right now but yeah
I<00:03:28.980> probably<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.580> might<00:03:29.850> make<00:03:30.030> her<00:03:30.209> like<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.480> funny

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720
