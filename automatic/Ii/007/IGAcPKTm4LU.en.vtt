emergencies we've been you know very

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.840 
emergencies we've been you know very
lucky<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.680> some<00:01:34.920> things<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.340> rejected

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
lucky we have some things like rejected

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
many airlines have but we really haven't

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.130 
many airlines have but we really haven't
had<00:01:40.500> anything<00:01:40.740> major<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.450> crew<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
had anything major so the crew get to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.380 
had anything major so the crew get to
practice<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.770> lot<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.220> things<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.759> hope<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
practice a lot of things that I hope and

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.929 
practice a lot of things that I hope and
I<00:01:46.110> know<00:01:46.229> they<00:01:46.710> will<00:01:46.860> never<00:01:47.040> ever<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.759> deal

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
I know they will never ever have to deal

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.889 
I know they will never ever have to deal
with<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.390> real<00:01:48.600> life<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.460> 16-hour<00:01:50.460> flight

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
with in real life a 16-hour flight

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.420 
with in real life a 16-hour flight
40,000<00:01:51.899> feet<00:01:52.049> up<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.380> air<00:01:52.470> changing<00:01:53.130> time

40,000 feet up in the air changing time
zones<00:01:53.460> flying<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.810> tough<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> passenger

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
zones flying can be tough as a passenger

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.609 
zones flying can be tough as a passenger
and<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.310> definitely<00:01:56.939> isn't<00:01:57.149> an<00:01:57.509> easy<00:01:57.630> job<00:01:57.810> but

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and it definitely isn't an easy job but

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.870 
and it definitely isn't an easy job but
