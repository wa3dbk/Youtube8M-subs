00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.870
 Monday 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:31.160
 we will need a roll of puff pastry 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:36.020
 round three large apples two eggs 200 ml 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:40.180
 of fresh liquid cream and 30 grams of 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:48.910
 brown sugar in a container 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:48.910
 I put the brown sugar in the eggs 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.570
 along the cream 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.420
 and I'm going to mix 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:32.380

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.380

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.290

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.490
 I make holes with a fork 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.420
 I put them over the apples that I cut 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.420
 previously very thin 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.989
 and then lost over the compound 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.790

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.260
