00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.940
 welcome everyone today we'll talk about 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.780
 smartwatch 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.950
 smart watch oukitel from 28 after the release 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.770
 smartphone oukitel 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.990
 at 8 also talked about the upcoming release 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.720
 at 9 which is very similar to his 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.480
 predecessor as well as rumors went that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 the manufacturer took up the smartwatch 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.240
 oukitel and 28 at this point is still accurate 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.180
 prices no much now claims that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.850
 and 28 will go on sale next days 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.940
 Although I wonder how much you manufacturer 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.730
 last the next days to us more this year 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.890
 See not one smart watch from 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.680
 Chinese manufacturers but already 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.989
 output can be assumed that a 28 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.510
 is one of many smart watches 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.460
 which will decorate the market maker 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.149
 oukitel seriously thinks that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.800
 and 28 is an alternative to apple watch and for 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.320
 this recorded a short video 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.229
 showing 2 wearable devices aa 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.040
 jacket 28 design made on the basis of 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.200
 apple watch of course there are differences a 28 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.860
 has a large display and no 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.299
 rotating buttons on the menu which 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.970
 several things struck me of course 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.619
 video yes i think you firstly can't 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.560
 deny that oukitel 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.170
 and 28 well defined heartbeat 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.720
 which likewise responds to the hand like 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.049
 and apple watch although not updated immediately 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.820
 2 surprise is that no one named john 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.400
 wrote the script for the video with 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.380
 name don't give up people georgij 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.040
 specifications 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.850
 154 inch 240 by 240 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.420
 mediatek touch display processor 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.140
 mt-25 02 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.510
 and the battery capacity is enough 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.640
 the manufacturer claims for 100 hours in 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.330
 standby time 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.370
 an application with which you can 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.250
 monitor heart rate 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.950
 cuts the number of steps for the teacher 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.520
