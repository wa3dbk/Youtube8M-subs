 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.619
 german andele classic and today in 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.640
 In this video, I would like to record a small 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.890
 guide for novice skimmers will try 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.619
 write not just feints that can 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.769
 use the effect of e and simplicity 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.949
 interesting things interesting things tricks 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.239
 which most of you hope to be 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.239
 interesting to see what 's the first 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.460
 what a beginner scaler should be able to do 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.640
 strike the ball up 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.610
 performed this trick is just alternate 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.170
 by pressing lt and rt on the joystick 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.020
 in fact this is one of the most 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.420
 useless tricks but i think that 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.160
 almost everybody should own it 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.489
 so it might look 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.770
 football match but again this trick 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.039
 virtually useless for normal 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.090
 games 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.710
 it is executed once again I repeat on ltb 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.729
 but you should probably use it 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.780
 just for fun of yourself 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.810
 the next movie i would like to 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.380
 tell it rolls go to the side 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.110
 it is performed more than simply 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.399
 you deflect the right stick perpendicular 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.439
 movement let's see how it is 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.210
 looks on the football field 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.840
 if we move to the right accordingly 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.340
 right stick we deflect up and down well 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.960
 what can such screw really be 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.960
 take a defender by surprise 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.900
 Nina no next find one of the most 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.710
 interesting recipes in this force so 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.690
 called rainbow its execution is not 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.210
 should be a big deal 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.030
 moving straight away from a and 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.060
 swerve right stick back and then 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.070
 twice forward let's do it again when 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.450
 direct movement reject the right stick 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.450
 back and double forward 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.040
 the most important thing is the movement back on 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.400
 go ahead and double forward all this 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.180
 performed right stick 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.630
 accordingly, how is the direction changing? 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.390
 movements in the same way changing 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.140
 stick direction 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.300
 right joystick if we learn 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.880
 feel the moment of tossing and 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.519
 making this trick slower 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.370
 is meant in terms of right clicking 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.390
 stick then our player will perform more 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.200
 interesting film 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.300
 ie pobivanie sword through you Well 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.600
 the following about what I would like to tell 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.810
 this is a punch rabona 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.920
 performed it is also not very difficult 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.880
 most importantly we should have a button 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.860
 lt and canopy immediately want to say in order 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.630
 to hit the goal you need 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:12.329
 disable automatic awnings 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:15.329
 boy settings we can use 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.690
 work as a carport or just gear it 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:22.820
 and in the same way we can use 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.820
 work like a shot on goal 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.340
 anime 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.150
 the last for today is pretty 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.010
 funny trick too but which is also not 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.500
 is of particular difficulty along the way 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.220
 movement holding lp 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.350
 we just do important for over 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.640
 find is more than simple but in some 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.170
 situations he really helps 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.810
 get a good shock position so what 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.850
 Well guys on this all will hope that 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.400
 to some of you this will prove useful with 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.130
 You were a German from the El Clasico team 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.410
 all football and remember better than good 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.070
 king can only be good gear 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.070
 until
