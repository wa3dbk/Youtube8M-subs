00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
working pretty well at the moment and

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.870 
working pretty well at the moment and
I'm<00:06:15.530> pretty<00:06:15.860> impressed<00:06:16.010> with<00:06:16.310> the<00:06:16.490> last<00:06:16.700> game

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
I'm pretty impressed with the last game

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.240 
I'm pretty impressed with the last game
the<00:06:17.180> last<00:06:17.300> game<00:06:17.450> against<00:06:17.960> Newcastle<00:06:18.470> I<00:06:18.650> was

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
the last game against Newcastle I was

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.690 
the last game against Newcastle I was
the<00:06:19.730> work<00:06:19.910> rate<00:06:20.210> was<00:06:20.510> from<00:06:21.080> fantastic<00:06:21.710> so<00:06:22.670> I

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
the work rate was from fantastic so I

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.950 
the work rate was from fantastic so I
think<00:06:22.940> we've<00:06:23.060> got<00:06:23.150> a<00:06:23.180> good<00:06:23.270> chance<00:06:23.420> is<00:06:23.750> a<00:06:23.780> home
