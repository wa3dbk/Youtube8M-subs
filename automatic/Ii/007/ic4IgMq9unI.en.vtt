00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
fatigue played a role eventually it's a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.490 
fatigue played a role eventually it's a
little<00:00:47.789> bit<00:00:47.879> tiring<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.390> hard<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.899> as<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
little bit tiring it's hard to be as a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
little bit tiring it's hard to be as a
cute<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.190> sharp

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420

you know the starts got a little more

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
you know the starts got a little more
difficult<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.420> don't<00:00:54.629> want<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> take<00:00:54.960> too

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
difficult you don't want to take too

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.569 
difficult you don't want to take too
much<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.559> week<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.949> want<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.190> make<00:00:56.340> sure<00:00:56.370> you

much this week you want to make sure you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.389 
much this week you want to make sure you
take<00:00:56.760> them<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:57.000> stuff<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:58.100> was<00:01:00.739> yeah<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.190> take

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
take them out stuff I was yeah you take

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.880 
take them out stuff I was yeah you take
a<00:01:02.430> million<00:01:02.820> runs<00:01:03.149> every<00:01:03.510> day<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.809> though<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
a million runs every day as though and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.039 
a million runs every day as though and
was<00:01:05.070> interesting<00:01:05.489> at<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.180> time<00:01:06.479> between

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
was interesting at the time between

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.730 
was interesting at the time between
rounds<00:01:07.470> was<00:01:07.650> very<00:01:07.920> short<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:09.390> side<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:10.020> as

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
rounds was very short and one side I as

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.370 
rounds was very short and one side I as
I<00:01:10.890> drove<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:11.939> one<00:01:12.299> minute<00:01:12.510> away

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
I drove up I was just one minute away

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.340 
I drove up I was just one minute away
from<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.860> stuff<00:01:14.360> so<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.930> was<00:01:16.020> kind<00:01:16.320> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
from the stuff so it was kind of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:27.480 
from the stuff so it was kind of
exciting

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.220 

I<00:01:28.490> think<00:01:28.760> there<00:01:28.970> is<00:01:29.000> there<00:01:29.690> are<00:01:29.780> tactics

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
I think there is there are tactics

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.280 
I think there is there are tactics
because<00:01:34.120> you<00:01:35.120> don't<00:01:35.270> have<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.690> you<00:01:36.050> don't<00:01:36.140> have

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
because you don't have to you don't have

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.010 
because you don't have to you don't have
to<00:01:36.410> risk<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:36.920> much<00:01:37.270> in<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.360> second<00:01:38.720> round<00:01:38.900> if

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
to risk so much in the second round if

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.410 
to risk so much in the second round if
you<00:01:39.080> have<00:01:39.320> four<00:01:40.010> or<00:01:40.160> five<00:01:40.340> tenths<00:01:40.640> advantage

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
you have four or five tenths advantage

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.870 
you have four or five tenths advantage
you<00:01:42.260> know<00:01:42.410> that<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:42.710> just<00:01:42.890> have<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.280> ski<00:01:43.520> smart

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
you know that you just have to ski smart

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.430 
you know that you just have to ski smart
and<00:01:44.120> once<00:01:44.420> when<00:01:44.660> you<00:01:44.690> hear<00:01:44.990> that<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.440> guy<00:01:45.620> is

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
and once when you hear that the guy is

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.960 
and once when you hear that the guy is
coming<00:01:48.790> nearer<00:01:49.790> then<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:50.810> just<00:01:51.190> let<00:01:52.190> go<00:01:52.220> you

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
coming nearer then you just let go you

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.560 
coming nearer then you just let go you
just<00:01:53.120> be<00:01:53.330> faster<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:55.280> what<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.180> good<00:01:56.330> about

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
just be faster so you what is good about

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.960 
just be faster so you what is good about
this<00:01:57.140> parallel<00:01:58.010> event<00:01:58.250> is<00:01:58.430> that<00:01:58.580> you<00:01:58.760> really

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
this parallel event is that you really

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.219 
this parallel event is that you really
have<00:01:59.120> to<00:02:00.010> turn<00:02:01.010> on<00:02:01.190> my<00:02:01.280> senses<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:02.150> lot<00:02:02.510> because

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
have to turn on my senses a lot because

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.590 
have to turn on my senses a lot because
you<00:02:03.920> don't<00:02:04.070> ski<00:02:04.310> along<00:02:04.580> like<00:02:04.940> you<00:02:04.970> usually<00:02:05.240> do

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
you don't ski along like you usually do

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.469 
you don't ski along like you usually do
you<00:02:06.260> always<00:02:06.440> have<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.740> skier<00:02:07.190> either<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.179> hear

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
you always have a skier either you hear

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.020 
you always have a skier either you hear
him<00:02:08.660> or<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:09.200> see<00:02:09.410> him<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:09.740> I<00:02:09.860> have<00:02:10.040> ten<00:02:10.790> races

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
him or you see him so I have ten races

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.910 
him or you see him so I have ten races
like<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:11.600> but<00:02:11.840> we<00:02:12.170> might<00:02:12.350> have<00:02:12.380> two<00:02:12.709> per

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
like this but we might have two per

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.290 
like this but we might have two per
season<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:15.050> think<00:02:15.560> it's<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:16.730> good<00:02:17.120> for

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
season and I think it's it's good for

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.720 
season and I think it's it's good for
