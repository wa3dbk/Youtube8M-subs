I<00:02:11.200> mean<00:02:11.560> usually<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:12.220> don't<00:02:12.640> think<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:12.910> take<00:02:13.120> a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
I mean usually I don't think you take a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.949 
I mean usually I don't think you take a
lot<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.390> pictures<00:02:13.569> with<00:02:14.190> your<00:02:15.190> watch<00:02:15.810> sounds<00:02:16.810> a

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
lot of pictures with your watch sounds a

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.680 
lot of pictures with your watch sounds a
little<00:02:17.260> bit<00:02:17.349> random<00:02:17.980> even<00:02:18.670> though<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.940> it's<00:02:19.180> a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
little bit random even though it it's a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.089 
little bit random even though it it's a
little<00:02:19.870> bit<00:02:19.989> cold<00:02:20.230> it's<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.560> little<00:02:20.680> bit<00:02:20.800> cool

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
little bit cold it's a little bit cool

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.160 
little bit cold it's a little bit cool
but<00:02:21.400> I'm<00:02:22.180> not<00:02:22.300> sure<00:02:22.330> about<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.720> internal

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
but I'm not sure about the internal

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
specs on this device and definitely one

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.940 
specs on this device and definitely one
of<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.510> problems<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:25.870> think<00:02:26.050> with<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.560> galaxy

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
forward to this to something like this

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.530 
forward to this to something like this
out<00:03:09.519> of<00:03:09.580> knows<00:03:09.910> we're<00:03:10.180> going<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.360> see<00:03:10.450> an

out of knows we're going to see an

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.930 
out of knows we're going to see an
iWatch<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:11.080> year<00:03:11.440> although<00:03:12.190> skeptical

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
iWatch this year although skeptical

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.500 
iWatch this year although skeptical
about<00:03:13.090> its<00:03:13.330> maybe<00:03:14.250> 2015<00:03:15.329> but<00:03:16.329> it<00:03:16.390> will

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
about its maybe 2015 but it will

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.440 
about its maybe 2015 but it will
definitely<00:03:16.720> be<00:03:17.049> epic<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.739> then<00:03:18.370> I<00:03:18.579> didn't

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
definitely be epic and then I didn't

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.900 
definitely be epic and then I didn't
pick<00:03:19.570> up<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.810> galaxy<00:03:20.140> gear<00:03:20.290> because<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:20.910> think

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
pick up the galaxy gear because I think

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.789 
pick up the galaxy gear because I think
so<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.209> also<00:03:22.359> have<00:03:22.570> sony<00:03:23.200> also<00:03:23.290> has<00:03:23.560> one<00:03:23.769> of

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
so you also have sony also has one of

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.690 
so you also have sony also has one of
those<00:03:23.980> things<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.180> can<00:03:25.329> take<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.900> put<00:03:26.079> on<00:03:26.140> and

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
those things you can take it put on and

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.430 
those things you can take it put on and
i'm<00:03:27.700> probably<00:03:28.450> going<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.750> try<00:03:28.959> something<00:03:29.200> more

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
i'm probably going to try something more

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.349 
i'm probably going to try something more
of<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.950> future<00:03:30.100> poly<00:03:30.519> and<00:03:30.820> see<00:03:31.269> if
