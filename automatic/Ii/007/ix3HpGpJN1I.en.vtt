00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.250
 more television I also appreciate 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.899
 much that is with us for you ruiz 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.880
 that is the author of this book that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.469
 called canine miracles that is one thing 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.340
 he says to you that he was very used to 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.780
 to TV but I do not see it anymore so 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.970
 really that the work he does for you 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.710
 with this sanctuary in miracles ways 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.029
 It is an awesome thing I would 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.210
 I highly recommend you read this book 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.099
 because it's first a tour of the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.990
 human evil and then also the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.699
 find that there is a lot of goodness both in 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.160
 animals as well as people 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.230
 here it counts for you for example of the case 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.559
 of flan that is a dog that three times 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.090
 he was killed and he did not refuse to die and it's me 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.620
 I say practically that it's the puppy that 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.410
 he refused to die because in theory he should 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.050
 be dead three times and the first time 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.360
 he was run over and only left 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.329
 paralyzed he did not die is the first time 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.280
 that must have died later what 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.530
 They threw a sewage channel for 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.090
 what then he died and he could manage 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.280
 leaving is the second time he should have 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.230
 however have died did not die were 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.120
 they felt sorry for him they took him to a 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.920
 veterinary clinic to inject what 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.600
 for 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.940
 mysteriously or miraculously he does not 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.980
 he died because because his destiny was 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.230
 in canine miracles and give us all the 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.090
 love that there may be right now 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.130
 a wheelchair and can walk and 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.290
 he can run and he's a very puppy 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.720
 happy and it's an amazing thing like these 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.460
 is weighing is what we can see that 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.740
 have suffered tranquil dogs are seen 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.870
 I do not know if they are all puppies in 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.090
 canine miracles and hopefully so with 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.650
 all dogs are dogs that have 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.240
 suffered a lot but now all 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.400
 they have the same common denominator that is 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.990
 that are happy dogs and empathy and me
