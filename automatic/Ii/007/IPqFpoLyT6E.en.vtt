one of the problems that we had with the
castle<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:17.880> didn't<00:01:18.090> really<00:01:18.270> realize

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
castle that we didn't really realize

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.050 
castle that we didn't really realize
until<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.200> built<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.650> damn<00:01:19.830> thing<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.520> red<00:01:20.880> on

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
until we built the damn thing was red on

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
ambient light is still the same but

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
ambient light is still the same but
because<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> darkness<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.710> color

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
because of the darkness of the color

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.730 
because of the darkness of the color
itself<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.909> very<00:01:30.180> hard<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:31.290> detail

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
itself it's very hard to see detail

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.830 
itself it's very hard to see detail

know<00:02:52.550> makes<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.820> some<00:02:54.030> giant<00:02:54.540> laser

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
know makes you like some giant laser

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.570 
know makes you like some giant laser
death<00:02:55.380> beam<00:02:55.650> but<00:02:55.890> you'll<00:02:56.010> see<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.250> we've<00:02:56.370> got

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
death beam but you'll see that we've got

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.830 
death beam but you'll see that we've got
white<00:02:57.410> cycling<00:02:58.410> through<00:02:58.769> all<00:02:58.980> four<00:02:59.370> towers<00:02:59.840> we

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
white cycling through all four towers we

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.410 
white cycling through all four towers we
did<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.200> or<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.830> was<00:03:01.950> my<00:03:02.070> idea<00:03:02.250> because<00:03:02.790> we

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
did that or that was my idea because we

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.449 
did that or that was my idea because we
needed<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.720> really<00:03:03.750> break<00:03:04.230> things<00:03:04.560> up<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.250> I

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
needed to really break things up and I

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.180 
needed to really break things up and I
also<00:03:05.720> paneled<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.989> hell<00:03:07.230> out<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.530> inside<00:03:08.040> of

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
also paneled the hell out of inside of

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.280 
also paneled the hell out of inside of
here<00:03:08.370> I've<00:03:08.519> got<00:03:09.060> marble<00:03:09.570> panels<00:03:09.840> on<00:03:10.170> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
here I've got marble panels on the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.740 
here I've got marble panels on the
bottom<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:10.890> we've<00:03:11.160> got<00:03:11.459> cobblestone<00:03:11.970> panels

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
bottom and we've got cobblestone panels

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
on the side or maybe that's brick cobble

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.870 
on the side or maybe that's brick cobble
stone<00:03:15.540> brick<00:03:15.720> maybe<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.140> don't<00:03:16.620> know<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:17.670> played

staircases<00:03:29.489> they<00:03:30.180> don't<00:03:30.360> make<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.540> stair

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
staircases they don't make a stair

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.949 
staircases they don't make a stair
plaque<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.190> get<00:03:32.489> some<00:03:32.730> kind<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.180> funky

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
plaque so you get some kind of funky

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.100 
plaque so you get some kind of funky
looking<00:03:34.170> gaps<00:03:34.680> there<00:03:35.180> other<00:03:36.180> problems<00:03:36.690> also

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
looking gaps there other problems also

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.280 
looking gaps there other problems also
the<00:03:37.290> stairs<00:03:37.620> same<00:03:38.250> issue<00:03:38.750> but<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.900> looks

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
the stairs same issue but it looks

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.410 
the stairs same issue but it looks
pretty<00:03:40.380> good<00:03:40.799> so<00:03:41.070> let<00:03:42.000> me<00:03:42.060> know<00:03:42.120> what<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.329> guys

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
pretty good so let me know what you guys

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.030 
pretty good so let me know what you guys
think<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:42.900> guys<00:03:42.989> have<00:03:43.200> any<00:03:43.350> ideas<00:03:43.739> for<00:03:43.769> the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
think you guys have any ideas for the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.470 
think you guys have any ideas for the
interior<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.700> makes<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.090> little<00:03:45.299> bit

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
interior that makes it a little bit

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.199 
interior that makes it a little bit
better<00:03:45.660> looking<00:03:46.260> let<00:03:47.040> me<00:03:47.130> know<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.489> we<00:03:48.090> will

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
better looking let me know and we will

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.000 
better looking let me know and we will
definitely<00:03:48.720> take<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.350> under<00:03:49.560> advisement

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
definitely take that under advisement

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.640 
definitely take that under advisement
and<00:03:50.790> as<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.269> can<00:03:51.390> see<00:03:51.420> it's<00:03:52.140> still<00:03:52.350> kind<00:03:52.590> of

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
and as you can see it's still kind of

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.979 
and as you can see it's still kind of
dark<00:03:52.920> but<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.579> can<00:03:53.730> at<00:03:53.820> least<00:03:53.940> see<00:03:54.299> everything

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
dark but you can at least see everything

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.930 
dark but you can at least see everything
now<00:03:55.560> what<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:55.980> was<00:03:56.160> talking<00:03:56.340> about<00:03:56.549> when<00:03:56.910> it

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
now what I was talking about when it

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.030 
now what I was talking about when it
comes<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.510> darkness<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.530> get<00:03:58.680> down<00:03:58.890> to

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
comes to darkness like I get down to

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.199 
comes to darkness like I get down to
like<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.190> bottom<00:03:59.400> floor<00:03:59.579> and<00:03:59.820> each<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.120> these

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
like the bottom floor and each of these

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.390 
like the bottom floor and each of these
has<00:04:00.320> like<00:04:01.320> five<00:04:01.590> floors<00:04:01.950> it's<00:04:02.190> pretty

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
has like five floors it's pretty

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.740 
has like five floors it's pretty
ridiculous<00:04:02.640> so<00:04:03.239> it's<00:04:03.329> going<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.480> take<00:04:03.600> me<00:04:03.720> a

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
ridiculous so it's going to take me a

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.509 
ridiculous so it's going to take me a
while<00:04:03.900> but<00:04:04.140> this<00:04:04.769> is<00:04:05.010> what<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.160> was<00:04:05.310> talking

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
while but this is what I was talking

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.240 
while but this is what I was talking
about<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.840> light<00:04:07.079> level<00:04:07.290> between<00:04:07.650> there<00:04:08.070> in

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
about the light level between there in

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.130 
about the light level between there in
here<00:04:08.519> is<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.850> same<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.810> know<00:04:09.870> here<00:04:10.019> we<00:04:10.109> are

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
here is the same you know here we are

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.599 
here is the same you know here we are
right<00:04:10.350> next<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.620> torches<00:04:11.010> but<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:11.340> can<00:04:11.459> see

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
right next to torches but you can see

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.060 
right next to torches but you can see
it's<00:04:11.850> very<00:04:12.150> hard<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.540> see<00:04:12.810> detail<00:04:13.260> on<00:04:13.530> the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
it's very hard to see detail on the

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.279 
it's very hard to see detail on the
walls<00:04:14.310> like<00:04:14.730> where<00:04:14.970> they<00:04:15.090> actually<00:04:15.239> start<00:04:15.959> and

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
walls like where they actually start and

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.500 
walls like where they actually start and
the<00:04:16.590> points<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.250> when<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:17.850> put<00:04:18.030> equipment

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
the points and when you put equipment

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.969 
the points and when you put equipment
and<00:04:18.660> things<00:04:18.690> in<00:04:18.989> there<00:04:19.109> it's<00:04:19.320> just<00:04:19.410> really

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
and things in there it's just really

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.580 
and things in there it's just really
difficult<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.940> see<00:04:21.209> which<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:21.959> why<00:04:22.109> we<00:04:22.289> felt

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
difficult to see which is why we felt

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.350 
difficult to see which is why we felt
the<00:04:22.950> pain

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
the pain

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.740 
the pain
were<00:04:23.719> probably<00:04:24.099> the<00:04:25.099> best<00:04:25.460> option<00:04:25.669> now<00:04:26.569> this

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
were probably the best option now this

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.589 
were probably the best option now this
is<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:26.960> wizard<00:04:27.289> tower<00:04:27.680> I<00:04:28.009> believe<00:04:29.349> maybe<00:04:30.349> not

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
is the wizard tower I believe maybe not

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.969 
is the wizard tower I believe maybe not
see<00:04:32.599> right<00:04:32.719> here<00:04:32.870> it's<00:04:33.110> dark<00:04:33.469> and<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.680> even<00:04:33.889> have

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
see right here it's dark and I even have

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.100 
see right here it's dark and I even have
a<00:04:34.039> hard<00:04:34.219> time<00:04:34.340> seeing<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:35.120> stairs<00:04:35.569> and<00:04:35.810> I'm

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
a hard time seeing the stairs and I'm

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.270 
a hard time seeing the stairs and I'm
sure<00:04:36.259> some<00:04:36.409> of<00:04:36.530> your<00:04:36.710> like<00:04:36.830> will<00:04:36.919> turn<00:04:37.129> your

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
sure some of your like will turn your

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.179 
sure some of your like will turn your
brightness<00:04:37.490> up<00:04:37.909> noob<00:04:38.620> yeah<00:04:39.620> it's<00:04:39.800> probably<00:04:40.009> a

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:40.189 
brightness up noob yeah it's probably a

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.820 
brightness up noob yeah it's probably a
good<00:04:40.219> point<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.729> probably<00:04:40.759> should<00:04:41.240> but<00:04:41.629> it<00:04:42.379> just

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
good point I probably should but it just

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.709 
good point I probably should but it just
I<00:04:43.039> don't<00:04:43.099> know<00:04:43.219> it's<00:04:43.490> kind<00:04:44.090> of<00:04:44.270> funky<00:04:44.509> that's

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:44.719 
I don't know it's kind of funky that's

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.200 
I don't know it's kind of funky that's
right<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:46.310> wizard's<00:04:46.610> tower<00:04:46.699> is<00:04:47.180> the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
right the the wizard's tower is the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.149 
right the the wizard's tower is the
secondary<00:04:48.139> tower<00:04:48.409> so<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.680> can<00:04:48.770> see<00:04:48.919> he's

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:49.159 
secondary tower so you can see he's

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:51.670 
secondary tower so you can see he's
changed<00:04:49.610> up<00:04:49.819> we're<00:04:50.780> now<00:04:50.870> using<00:04:51.050> these<00:04:51.319> blue

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
changed up we're now using these blue

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.309 
changed up we're now using these blue
things<00:04:51.710> as<00:04:52.310> opposed<00:04:52.699> to<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.360> normal<00:04:53.509> redstone

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
things as opposed to the normal redstone

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.010 
things as opposed to the normal redstone
lamp<00:04:54.680> so<00:04:55.400> I<00:04:55.430> are<00:04:55.759> I<00:04:56.060> think<00:04:56.539> it's<00:04:56.629> glowstone

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
lamp so I are I think it's glowstone

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.019 
lamp so I are I think it's glowstone
actually<00:04:57.439> I'm<00:04:57.889> not<00:04:58.039> sure<00:04:58.219> with<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:58.580> sword<00:04:58.849> ugh

00:04:59.019 --> 00:04:59.029 
actually I'm not sure with a sword ugh

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:01.929 
actually I'm not sure with a sword ugh
so<00:04:59.599> I'm<00:04:59.840> not<00:04:59.990> quite<00:05:00.169> sure<00:05:00.460> what<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.729> blue

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:01.939 
so I'm not quite sure what the blue

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.420 
so I'm not quite sure what the blue
stuff<00:05:02.240> stands<00:05:03.199> for<00:05:03.529> maybe<00:05:03.860> it's<00:05:04.039> just<00:05:04.159> a

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
stuff stands for maybe it's just a

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.159 
stuff stands for maybe it's just a
different<00:05:04.639> cool<00:05:04.969> look<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.870> nice<00:05:06.139> thing

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
different cool look the nice thing

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.320 
different cool look the nice thing
though<00:05:06.590> is<00:05:06.770> will<00:05:06.949> notice<00:05:07.189> the<00:05:07.340> lights<00:05:07.639> are<00:05:08.060> the

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
though is will notice the lights are the

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.879 
though is will notice the lights are the
windows<00:05:08.659> here<00:05:09.020> because<00:05:09.379> there's<00:05:09.529> windows

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
windows here because there's windows

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.369 
windows here because there's windows
that<00:05:10.129> seems<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.430> open<00:05:10.550> things<00:05:10.849> up<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:12.139> make

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
that seems to open things up and make

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.469 
that seems to open things up and make
things<00:05:12.590> a<00:05:12.710> lot<00:05:13.039> more<00:05:13.099> visible<00:05:13.849> a<00:05:13.969> hell<00:05:14.240> of<00:05:14.270> a

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
things a lot more visible a hell of a

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.589 
things a lot more visible a hell of a
lot<00:05:14.659> more<00:05:14.689> visible<00:05:15.259> so<00:05:15.529> we<00:05:16.099> may<00:05:16.370> add<00:05:16.610> those<00:05:17.029> to

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
lot more visible so we may add those to

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.830 
lot more visible so we may add those to
the<00:05:17.629> other<00:05:17.930> towers<00:05:18.680> that<00:05:19.610> was<00:05:19.789> originally<00:05:20.689> my

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
the other towers that was originally my

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.830 
the other towers that was originally my
idea<00:05:20.870> was<00:05:21.680> to<00:05:21.830> have<00:05:21.860> those<00:05:22.460> and<00:05:23.419> I<00:05:23.509> think<00:05:23.719> we

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
idea was to have those and I think we

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.480 
idea was to have those and I think we
decided<00:05:24.289> not<00:05:24.469> to<00:05:24.680> go<00:05:24.830> with<00:05:24.860> it<00:05:25.009> so<00:05:25.219> I<00:05:25.250> think<00:05:25.460> I

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
decided not to go with it so I think I

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.089 
decided not to go with it so I think I
may<00:05:25.610> talk<00:05:25.789> to<00:05:25.969> Guido<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.330> we<00:05:26.659> may<00:05:26.840> add<00:05:27.169> those

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
may talk to Guido and we may add those

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.890 
may talk to Guido and we may add those
little<00:05:28.400> lights<00:05:28.610> to<00:05:29.000> hear<00:05:29.270> because<00:05:29.389> that

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
little lights to hear because that

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.540 
little lights to hear because that
pretty<00:05:30.110> much<00:05:30.259> lights<00:05:30.500> all<00:05:30.680> of<00:05:30.919> them<00:05:31.009> up<00:05:31.159> I<00:05:31.339> mean

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
pretty much lights all of them up I mean

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.769 
pretty much lights all of them up I mean
it<00:05:31.669> makes<00:05:31.789> it<00:05:31.940> a<00:05:31.969> lot<00:05:32.060> more<00:05:32.120> visible<00:05:32.479> at<00:05:32.629> least

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:32.779 
it makes it a lot more visible at least

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.589 
it makes it a lot more visible at least
during<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:33.050> daylight<00:05:33.580> so<00:05:34.580> that's<00:05:35.389> the

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
during the daylight so that's the

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.379 
during the daylight so that's the
general<00:05:36.169> look<00:05:37.099> at<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:37.550> base<00:05:37.759> and<00:05:38.150> then<00:05:38.240> right

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
general look at the base and then right

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.230 
general look at the base and then right
out<00:05:38.539> here<00:05:38.569> we've<00:05:39.110> got<00:05:39.139> our<00:05:39.379> farms<00:05:40.129> I've<00:05:40.969> got
