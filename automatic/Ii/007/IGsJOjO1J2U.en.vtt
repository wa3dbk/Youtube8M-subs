want to go to the network and tell them
about<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.490> no<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.330> write<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.750> down

paper because this this will allow you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.929 
paper because this this will allow you
to<00:01:21.530> think<00:01:22.530> about<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> idea<00:01:23.250> further<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.880> as

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
to think about the idea further and as

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.609 
to think about the idea further and as
you're<00:01:24.119> writing<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> down<00:01:24.750> you'll<00:01:25.080> notice<00:01:25.290> how

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
you're writing it down you'll notice how

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.070 
you're writing it down you'll notice how
more<00:01:26.220> ideas<00:01:26.640> will<00:01:26.790> pop<00:01:27.000> into<00:01:27.210> your<00:01:27.330> hand<00:01:27.689> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
more ideas will pop into your hand to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.679 
more ideas will pop into your hand to
make<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.350> idea<00:01:28.920> even<00:01:29.159> better<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.150> writing<00:01:30.450> it

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
make that idea even better so writing it

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.230 
make that idea even better so writing it
down<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.049> crucial<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.220> key<00:01:32.549> element<00:01:32.790> in

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
down is crucial it's a key element in

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
down is crucial it's a key element in
making<00:01:33.900> your<00:01:33.990> idea<00:01:34.350> better

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
making your idea better

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.749 
making your idea better
second<00:01:36.420> rewrite<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.340> wrote<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.729> down

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
second rewrite it so you wrote it down

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.219 
second rewrite it so you wrote it down
that<00:01:39.509> wasn't<00:01:39.900> hard

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
that wasn't hard

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.520 
that wasn't hard
now<00:01:40.979> rewriting<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.509> most<00:01:42.840> difficult<00:01:43.200> part

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
now rewriting is the most difficult part

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.210 
now rewriting is the most difficult part
of<00:01:43.860> making<00:01:44.549> your<00:01:44.729> idea<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:46.170> sellable<00:01:46.920> idea

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
of making your idea of a sellable idea

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.160 
of making your idea of a sellable idea
why<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.420> where<00:01:48.630> your<00:01:48.750> research

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
why because this is where your research

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.899 
why because this is where your research
will<00:01:49.380> come<00:01:49.560> into<00:01:49.710> play<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.520> need<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> become

will come into play you need to become

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.300 
will come into play you need to become
an<00:01:51.149> expert<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.259> idea<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.860> need<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.130> know

would be a lot more interested than if

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.949 
would be a lot more interested than if
you<00:02:28.250> just<00:02:28.400> have<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.580> random<00:02:28.819> idea<00:02:29.360> or<00:02:29.569> a<00:02:29.600> random

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
you just have a random idea or a random

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.840 
you just have a random idea or a random
thought<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.860> they<00:02:31.100> would<00:02:31.220> have<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.430> put<00:02:31.610> work

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
thought that they would have to put work

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.060 
thought that they would have to put work
into<00:02:32.120> one<00:02:32.900> thing<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.320> keep<00:02:33.470> in<00:02:33.620> mind<00:02:33.680> about

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
into one thing to keep in mind about

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.360 
into one thing to keep in mind about
rewriting<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.450> less<00:02:35.810> is<00:02:36.080> more<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:37.070> you

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
rewriting is that less is more so you

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.310 
rewriting is that less is more so you
need<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.640> make<00:02:37.850> your<00:02:38.000> idea<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.660> your<00:02:38.780> concept

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
need to make your idea and your concept

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.100 
need to make your idea and your concept
concise<00:02:40.000> yet<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.269> need<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.600> make<00:02:41.900> it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
concise yet you need to make it

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.900 
concise yet you need to make it
informative<00:02:42.709> so<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.250> need<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.580> find<00:02:43.760> a

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
informative so you need to find a

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.940 
informative so you need to find a
balance<00:02:44.390> between<00:02:44.600> what's<00:02:45.410> too<00:02:45.680> much<00:02:45.709> and

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
balance between what's too much and

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.759 
balance between what's too much and
what's<00:02:46.250> not<00:02:46.730> enough<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:48.110> balance<00:02:48.320> means

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
what's not enough so that balance means

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.670 
what's not enough so that balance means
that<00:02:49.070> you're<00:02:49.550> given<00:02:49.970> enough<00:02:50.570> information<00:02:50.810> for

that you're given enough information for

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.759 
that you're given enough information for
them<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.130> able<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.430> get<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.269> idea<00:02:53.630> but<00:02:53.930> not

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
them to be able to get the idea but not

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.550 
them to be able to get the idea but not
too<00:02:55.130> much<00:02:55.280> information<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.540> can<00:02:57.170> lead<00:02:57.380> you

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
too much information that can lead you

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.160 
too much information that can lead you
to<00:02:57.590> confusing<00:02:58.430> them<00:02:58.580> or<00:02:58.760> maybe<00:02:59.050> making<00:03:00.050> your
