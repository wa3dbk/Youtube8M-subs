windows and mac and linux the link will

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.190 
windows and mac and linux the link will
be<00:00:21.919> in<00:00:21.950> the<00:00:22.310> description<00:00:22.550> to<00:00:23.000> download<00:00:23.119> it<00:00:23.480> but

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
be in the description to download it but

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.290 
be in the description to download it but
basically<00:00:24.560> this<00:00:25.369> is<00:00:25.430> probably<00:00:25.790> the<00:00:25.939> easiest

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
basically this is probably the easiest

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.409 
basically this is probably the easiest
way<00:00:26.540> to<00:00:26.989> do<00:00:27.140> it<00:00:27.290> yeah<00:00:28.070> I<00:00:28.279> don't<00:00:28.369> recommend<00:00:28.939> this

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
way to do it yeah I don't recommend this

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.049 
way to do it yeah I don't recommend this
way<00:00:29.829> it's<00:00:30.829> a<00:00:30.919> lot<00:00:31.040> better<00:00:31.309> to<00:00:31.579> go<00:00:31.700> in<00:00:31.849> and

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
way it's a lot better to go in and

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.479 
way it's a lot better to go in and
manually<00:00:32.360> mod<00:00:32.750> it<00:00:32.899> yourself<00:00:33.260> although<00:00:34.070> not<00:00:34.309> as

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
manually mod it yourself although not as

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.810 
manually mod it yourself although not as
one<00:00:34.700> can<00:00:34.880> do<00:00:35.120> that<00:00:35.300> it's<00:00:35.720> not<00:00:35.900> super<00:00:36.380> easy<00:00:36.820> so

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
one can do that it's not super easy so

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.460

bill<00:01:35.630> load<00:01:35.900> here<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:36.950> we<00:01:37.220> can<00:01:37.340> look<00:01:37.490> around<00:01:38.350> and

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
bill load here so we can look around and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.789 
bill load here so we can look around and
find<00:01:39.409> one<00:01:39.979> that<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:40.159> want<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:40.940> that's<00:01:41.119> just<00:01:41.799> for

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
find one that we want so that's just for

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.990 
find one that we want so that's just for
example<00:01:43.250> let's<00:01:43.490> do<00:01:44.299> elemental<00:01:44.990> arrows<00:01:46.000> so

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
example let's do elemental arrows so

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.700 
example let's do elemental arrows so
we're<00:01:47.119> going<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.299> download<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:47.780> one<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.500> it

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
we're going to download this one so it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.670 
we're going to download this one so it
requires<00:01:49.310> modloader<00:01:49.880> so<00:01:50.570> that<00:01:51.140> means<00:01:51.350> you

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
requires modloader so that means you

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.380 
requires modloader so that means you
better<00:01:51.830> just<00:01:52.070> go<00:01:52.250> in<00:01:52.369> here<00:01:52.640> and<00:01:52.760> look<00:01:53.119> for

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
better just go in here and look for

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.730 
better just go in here and look for
modloader<00:01:54.189> which<00:01:55.189> is<00:01:55.310> somewhere<00:01:55.610> in<00:01:55.729> here

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
modloader which is somewhere in here

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.100 
modloader which is somewhere in here
don't<00:01:57.740> really<00:01:58.159> want<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:58.820> look<00:01:59.119> for<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.600> i<00:01:59.810> guess

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
don't really want to look for it i guess

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.070 
don't really want to look for it i guess
i<00:02:00.259> will<00:02:01.060> anyway<00:02:02.060> over<00:02:02.240> here<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:02.900> it's<00:02:02.990> right

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
i will anyway over here so it's right

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.570 
i will anyway over here so it's right
