00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 and what happens through you see we are 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.850
 here in a new video of those 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.740
 inscriptions and this time I bring you a 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.380
 tutorial on the tricks of these we 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.510
 we have to put 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.840
 in the pause and options below the whole 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.850
 will hack the animus but only if 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.470
 we have spent the last mission to the 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.890
 second of the sequence of 12 is to say 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.450
 now we have finished the story and how 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.400
 there you see piracy of the animus we have to 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.740
 unlock it using pivots that 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.079
 appear 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.539
 why are 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.190
 is unlocked online then skin of 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.660
 steel that does not hurt you infinite ammunition 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.940
 it is understood that it is very telling 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.609
 my killer instinct what 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.950
 you can always kill but as if 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:51.350
 as if I made several hits 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.809
 do a like d 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.010
 and murder then you kill him 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.230
 practically a 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.649
 except with the enemies that do not 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.649
 they are left 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.110
 semiautomatic which is that you shoot 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.890
 then giving the one with rabies equal to r1 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.650
 in 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.720
 play 3 automatically reload the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.790
 ninja pistol that does not detect you recruit 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.570
 that you use flames on recruits all 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.420
 the times you want murderers 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.490
 and thunderous murder that jumps in rays 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.030
 and thunder each time you kill has given 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.700
 gall 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.240
 man of the time that you can always 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.619
 Choose by raining snowing and sunny sun and 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.020
 moon always by day always at night 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.340
 changed the seasons between summer and 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.960
 you can choose between always summer 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.649
 always winter we go with steel skin 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.380
 like there you see me uncle is attacking me 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.299
 and look well in the bar white bar 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.830
 on the left is not declining 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.479
 because because I do pee 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.620
 then forms that attack you can not 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.990
 die 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.040
 it's a good trick because it has not been 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.040
 killed flame 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.820
 then it's quite useful because that's how 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.100
 it never kills you 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.360
 let's go with the next infinite mission 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.430
 I will not explain it to you because it is 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.430
 simply that never more than disparate 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.080
 you know, look now 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.790
 he did not counterattack because with a 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.620
 counterattack almost always kill depends 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.160
 of the enemy but as you see 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.690
 I give him only one blow and the uncle and Santiago already 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.950
 a combo of murders I think what 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.160
 you will understand 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.160
 we went with the semiautomatic pistols 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.230
 how they work, I explained it to you before 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.090
 that no matter how much you shoot, you give 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.800
 boil you have another bullet again 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.470
 inside the bedroom 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.040
 then it is quite useful to us since 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.379
 never 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.469
 you always have to be there a good 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.410
 time to recharge and all that and as 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:57.510
 You see let me 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.209
 shoot because I'm not either 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.940
 then I give him to read me and there we have 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.340
 another bullet in the chamber 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.710
 no need to recharge it is quite 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.200
 Useful 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:12.060
 and we went with the next and last 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.940
 and last hack of spirits there are many 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.940
 more but I think it's pretty easy 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.160
 do not understand 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.550
 your explanation then we go with 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.140
 thunderous murder as you see is 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.569
 pretty hard I think it's good for 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.260
 montages and things like that because every time 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.260
 we kill one 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.989
 of salento 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.120
 and it does not stay pretty well or is it a 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.629
 skill a bit silly but looks good 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.629
 for a montage 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.890
 quite useful because 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.780
 like that 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.960
 go back to this video and you'll know how to 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.960
 make 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.970
 these have all been the pirates of 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.500
 animus are unlocked with pivots 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.130
 that appear on the different maps 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.500
 you have to go to the main map 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.840
 a section that has been all 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.960
 I hope you liked it and 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.340
 helped the favorite x or if it has been like that 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.690
 subscribe and especially happy Christmas 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.690
 I hope you have a good time 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.630
 to other kids bye bye
