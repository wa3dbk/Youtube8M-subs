00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.490
 welcome to a new video of is 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.620
 visible on this occasion we are going to talk 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.350
 of the new shoes to go to be 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.630
 found means flatout football that's 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.760
 something like standing outside and leaning more 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.619
 stability is something that they always look for 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.689
 the mountain bikers with a style 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.199
 more aggressive for that let's talk about 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.390
 three points which is comfort connection and 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.220
 protection let's explain a little bit 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.460
 how the shoes are built I had 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.460
 little bit 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.410
 for this type of cyclists the connection 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.390
 it's super important if we want 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.699
 descend as quickly as possible we have 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.370
 to trust in that connection between shoe 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.620
 and pedal that's why we have two styles 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.539
 of shoes one sole with system 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.030
 shock and other equipment with sole 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.500
 totally smooth the two seek the best 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.479
 connection but they are two styles of 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.519
 pedal differently when we talk about 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.229
 totally flat style what 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.820
 We were looking for a component in the sole 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.940
 that will help us make the pedals with 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.409
 pins penetrate the sole for that 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.360
 we had to develop a compound 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.890
 much softer than normal and we had 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.050
 to work with the department of 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.240
 tire development the result is 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.149
 this new system of soles that calls 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.490
 slip not the same happens with the system 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.140
 Shock pedal platform but 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.789
 here is a small difference that if 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.550
 we want to improve the speed of 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.259
 connection interfaces between the pedal and 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.670
 the shock or the cove we had to 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.020
 use a slightly harder compound and 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.360
 a tache design that will help 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.700
 slide the result was a pocket 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.500
 a cavity that is much faster than 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.149
 assemble well we will be able to take off the foot 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.829
 whenever we need it and we are not going to 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.180
 waste time in the transition again 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.180
 to hook them on the pedals 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.040
 if we are going to talk about comfort we have 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.630
 to think about the fit of the shoe this 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.460
 shoe is not a shoe for cross 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.840
 cons and competitive the use that you 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.550
 let's give you need a little more of 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.920
 volume and more space for the foot 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.930
 We are using new materials 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.119
 like a new foam that we call the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.369
 month the advantage of using this foam 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.619
 is that it allows us to perspire is very 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.659
 light and does not absorb as much water as 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.450
 traditional foams additionally 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.250
 we are also using a sole with 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.620
 a protection or a reinforcement that 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.450
 we call the form of a lollipop 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.400
 what we are going to achieve with this design is 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.050
 that the sole will have more rigidity 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.239
 where we need them to transfer 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.090
 Pedaling energy can pedal with 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.580
 strength but at the back ends and 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.080
 forward a little more flexible to be able 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.470
 walk with confidence and have good 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.470
 traction 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.660
 the last part of which we are going to talk about 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.700
 of the new shoes to be pop is the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.709
 protection we know that this kind of 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.989
 aggressive cyclists have to have 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.430
 protection and we have considered this in 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.200
 the front part and in the part 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.760
 lateral of the ankle in the part of 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.110
 forward we have a protection of a 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.150
 much harder plastic 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.010
 so this cyclist can pass devastating 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.780
 with the stones without any problem the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.209
 Another important point is the ankle 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.769
 medial we have a little protection 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.720
 higher the shoe what you are going to avoid 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.220
 the blows against the cranks so obama 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.480
 have much more confidence and will have 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.430
 a much more fun shot 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.590
 additionally in our new 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.180
 slippers we find all the 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.610
 Features of body geometry 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.160
 we have the varus supplement with the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.780
 arch support and metatarsal button as well 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.459
 not only are we going to have very good 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.860
 performance but we're going to be comfortable 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.930
 for a long time I invite you to 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.730
 visit a special store see the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.560
 Sneakers choose the most suitable for 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.450
 you and enjoy a good ride 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.840
