00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.190

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.170
 past of North America and its streets 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.920

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.400
 Hispanic architecture arrival up 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.400
 those latitudes 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.260
 later in the so-called country of the 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.170
 fantasy the adventure can be completed 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.210
 well on board a galleon or crew 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.130

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.000
 way or another watch 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.240
 but in the country of adventure the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.409
 qualities are only approximate to those of 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.420
 reality 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.860
 the animal sculptures are only 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.710
 similar to those of current and 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.479
 authentic photographic safaris always 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.240
