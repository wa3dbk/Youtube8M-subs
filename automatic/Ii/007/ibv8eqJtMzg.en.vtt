00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.200
 a premiere with us we look and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.690
 system cameras and catch the same 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.639
 on with the nikon chatroom or j2 or 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.500
 So how does one pronounce what has 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.639
 changed to the predecessor yes so 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.200
 pretty much nothing what the hardware 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.330
 in terms of software were 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.230
 Creative will be enough after that 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.000
 probably synonymous via firmware update 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.930
 but if it is we have it 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.100
 no tests yet 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.600
 Accordingly , you look at them anyway 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.609
 Let's see what 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.990
 They from the camera keep good evil 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.990
 Anyway, let's have a look 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.180
 the first thing I noticed right away 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.380
 I tried it right here with it 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.090
 to take a picture what really 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.080
 works because it is not a super tuned 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.220
 that was with me probably this 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.530
 optical viewfinder flex or 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.270
 SLR does not work here 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.290
 I think it's a pity there 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.940
 another version where he at least 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.770
 the rise electronic great on it 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.150
 but you can do that as well 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.220
 difference between the slr cameras and 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.150
 system cameras system cameras have none 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.730
 optical viewfinder but now 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.290
 electronic came from now hold what 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.360
 one likes to 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.590
 I do not think it's going so well now 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.970
 I just have to say this 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.800
 optical supermarket there are people the 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.540
 to do photography of course like here 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.100
 rather over the display behind 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.540
 it is not bad is high resolution 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.759
 you can not say anything against it draws 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.020
 also not very reactive colors 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.100
 will play quite well has none 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.520
 color cast as I see it now 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.110
 can 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.820
 accordingly that is actually 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.229
 first problem is but not 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.070
 Generally as you can already see him 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.240
 his i say casual camera now 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.500
 but there are not many people like that now 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.030
 you also want to adjust a lot 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.890
 relatively little possibility manually what to 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.149
 do what I found quite interesting 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.899
 is how the camera also and 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.430
 can turn off 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.810
 namely that goes objectively via the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.220
 if he 's here on this me 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.600
 tell me where to park 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.940
 relatively small money from the camera 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.709
 you press out here on this button 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.330
 and that's why and in the moment it goes 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.830
 camera automatically if you can 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.610
 I think again with photos 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.080
 nice idea 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.910
 then it even had to save up here 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.039
 imposing on bonn so for the people 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.819
 It absolutely can not be funny 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.860
 or the nikon man puts on a 10 1 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.020
 megapixel sensor in the so-called cx 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.250
 formats because that's how the textbox is called 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.259
 the whole now for us and for everyone 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.789
 other the cx format is the sensor 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.860
 much smaller than for example the 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.899
 aps c sensors in the dslr i would 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.729
 say informative quarter of the time 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.230
 bildflÃ¤che only is also smaller to 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.030
 micro four thirds sensors you 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.319
 may know from the Lumix cameras 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.110
 or from other systems it can by 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.860
 olympus disadvantage we have you 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.420
 I think so too 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.319
 Explains what depth of field you are 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.960
 So it just does not get that nice 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.000
 beautiful blur into the picture 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.500
 Of course, not so great advantage 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.150
 The whole chamber can be a little bit 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.190
 be built more compact you see 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.500
 here the objective 10 30 millimeters that 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.720
 is not quite pancake but already 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.100
 almost for me now users still know 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.770
 unfamiliar it goes the other way around but 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.840
 no matter what says big accordingly 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.070
 disadvantage depth of blur and also the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.470
 Of course, pixel density is a ticker 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.330
 therefore probably only 10 1 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.590
 But I think megapixel is a very good one 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.940
 bild has it a bit 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.140
 less light tested because that makes 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.550
 camera also good pictures 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.170
 the dynamic range is actually too 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.220
 quite a great advantage 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.260
 system cameras is 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.430
 you have no mirror that is 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.290
 of course a disadvantage in the sense you 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.730
 have the optical viewfinder on it advantage 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.960
 turn is in series images 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.280
 you have much less mobile ones 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.060
 Parts accordingly are the cameras 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.950
 much faster 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.620
 I'll just do it and also 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.690
 she shoots almost five six 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.320
 up to ten pictures per second so even 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.990
 not bad 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.940
 disadvantage a nikon they's just 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.770
 first of all, she pretty fast for 20 25 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.870
 picture about limited thereafter but the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.070
 memory card you got from the mails 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.020
 support cards do it 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.540
 somehow synonymous problem is 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.250
 more than 256 megabytes per second are coming 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.230
 not out there that means at the ten 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.640
 megapixel models in about all this way 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.360
 Two to three seconds she can still one 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.980
 to take a picture 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.720
 why I do not know if you are 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.220
 for example, the Nikon D3000 200 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.060
 actually looks very fresh 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.190
 been published 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.510
 Really creates up to 45 megabytes per 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.320
 second with the same cards that 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.550
 is called factor 8 to 9 in about what you 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.020
 may have stopped, I do not know is 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.820
 a bit too bad because 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.410
 it possible with the camera if nikon that 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.420
 fire from rescued five to six 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.040
 shoot pictures per second permanently 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.860
 and that would be really cool that's it 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.120
 a real shame 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.890
 what can one conclude to nikon 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.140
 ears say yes it is just that 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.760
 system camera accordingly has too 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.110
 the system camera typical mark and 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.930
 advantages advantage 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.010
 It has no moving components of it 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.600
 and what first disadvantage it has him 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.160
 no optical searcher advantage in turn 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.400
 From it series pictures and general 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.310
 recordings much quieter and quieter 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.020
 fast picture qualitatively it lies just 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.640
 not quite on the level of the dslr 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.830
 camera just at the sensor easy 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.330
 Smaller is still because she is only ten 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.950
 megapixel and can be synonymous with relative 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.540
 little light still make good pictures 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.160
 also the dynamic range it actually 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.720
 really good color reproduction yourself 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.000
 So far I have been able to see because I'm great too 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.510
 the pictures are supported so everything 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.010
 in one 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.200
 actually a very good deal I have to 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.380
 So in total, it costs say in the shop 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.090
 with the 10 30 mm kit lens 500 euro 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.290
 is a pretty nice bunch if you 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.090
 Consider that they actually do too 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.530
 already a small dslr camera gets 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.060
 with the talking kit lens 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.760
 accordingly, I would tell you 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.170
 if you have the maximum picture quality in 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.340
 want to break the price then attacks 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.540
 but rather to dr 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.090
 The advantage here is simple 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.470
 more compact that much easier so 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.000
 so to speak your choice we will be in 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.530
 forward a few more of system 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.760
 For example, look at the children's sam 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.710
 Already planned 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.760
 which also with aps c sensors actually 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.680
 in the 56th 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.920
 in small so be curious there is still 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:17.050
 every amount of water rightly known 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:20.020
 system cameras but also smaller than that 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:25.180
 micro and even smaller than that 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:27.040
 micro has that on me 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:32.380
 accordingly even smaller than 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:34.140
 for example, the microsoft that's fine 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.460
 Not 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.010
 I can only say mft 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:44.860
 nobody understands micro four thirds 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:47.760
 I read so I think I really can not let go 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.760
 puke the same
