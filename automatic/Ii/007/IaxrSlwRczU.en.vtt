00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
a few months ago I made this hammer shot

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.760 
a few months ago I made this hammer shot
it<00:00:02.730> was<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.879> project<00:00:03.330> to<00:00:03.570> kind<00:00:03.810> of<00:00:03.840> showcase<00:00:04.350> the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
it was a project to kind of showcase the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.220 
it was a project to kind of showcase the
blaster<00:00:05.160> parts<00:00:05.490> metal<00:00:06.270> internal<00:00:06.870> kit<00:00:07.080> that

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
blaster parts metal internal kit that

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.480 
blaster parts metal internal kit that
they<00:00:07.259> make<00:00:07.470> for<00:00:07.649> the<00:00:07.710> hammer<00:00:07.859> shot<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.429> I

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
they make for the hammer shot and I

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.919 
they make for the hammer shot and I
thought<00:00:08.700> it<00:00:08.790> turned<00:00:08.880> out<00:00:09.059> really<00:00:09.120> really<00:00:09.599> well

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.709 
it's still one of my favorite paint jobs
because<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.700> thought<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.059> turned<00:00:12.210> out<00:00:12.389> nicely

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
because I thought it turned out nicely

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
match it to the hammer shot and give it

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.910 
match it to the hammer shot and give it
a<00:00:23.699> little<00:00:23.850> bit<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.090> an<00:00:24.180> overhaul<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.680> is

and he had also cut down the back input
a<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.530> think<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> Polycarp<00:00:38.670> plate<00:00:38.910> back<00:00:39.180> here<00:00:39.480> but

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
a I think a Polycarp plate back here but

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.900 
a I think a Polycarp plate back here but
wanted<00:00:40.140> me<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.260> replace<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.250> 3d

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
wanted me to replace it with this 3d

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.930 
wanted me to replace it with this 3d
printed<00:00:42.390> stock<00:00:43.050> adapter<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.160> let's<00:00:44.610> go<00:00:44.820> over

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
printed stock adapter so let's go over

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
printed stock adapter so let's go over
everything<00:00:45.690> I've<00:00:45.809> done<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:46.410> there

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
everything I've done to it because there

is<00:00:46.680> quite<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.950> lot<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.489> I'll<00:00:47.579> show<00:00:47.820> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
is quite a lot and then I'll show it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.790 
is quite a lot and then I'll show it
firing<00:00:48.539> starting<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.289> all<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> stuff<00:00:49.710> on

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the outside he wanted me to color match

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.029 
the outside he wanted me to color match
this<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> hammer<00:00:52.140> shot<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.530> obviously<00:00:53.010> I

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
this to the hammer shot so obviously I

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.310 
this to the hammer shot so obviously I
had<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.250> use<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.579> same<00:00:53.850> paint<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.840> paints<00:00:55.170> are

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
had to use the same paint the paints are

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.529 
had to use the same paint the paints are
a<00:00:55.350> dupli-color<00:00:56.160> vinyl<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.879> fabric<00:00:56.910> black

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
a dupli-color vinyl and fabric black

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.540 
a dupli-color vinyl and fabric black
with<00:00:57.809> light<00:00:58.020> gray<00:00:58.289> as<00:00:58.500> well<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> dupli-color

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
with light gray as well as a dupli-color

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.029 
with light gray as well as a dupli-color
perfect<00:01:00.210> match<00:01:00.420> some<00:01:01.350> kind<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.680> right<00:01:01.859> it's

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
perfect match some kind of right it's

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.789 
perfect match some kind of right it's
like<00:01:02.100> one<00:01:02.520> shade<00:01:03.359> darker<00:01:03.390> than<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> inferno

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
like one shade darker than the inferno

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.820 
like one shade darker than the inferno
red<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:06.000> some<00:01:06.270> red<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.080> Chrysler<00:01:07.619> that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
red but it's some red for Chrysler that

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.200 
red but it's some red for Chrysler that
gets<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.040> little<00:01:08.189> bit<00:01:08.369> darker<00:01:08.670> when<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.909> clear

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
gets a little bit darker when you clear

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.000 
gets a little bit darker when you clear
coat<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.020> did<00:01:10.229> run<00:01:10.350> into<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.619> bit<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
coat it so I did run into a bit of a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.980 
coat it so I did run into a bit of a
problem<00:01:11.310> when<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.430> came<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.850> transferring<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
problem when it came to transferring the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.780 
problem when it came to transferring the
design<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.890> paint<00:01:14.100> job<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> hammer

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
design of the paint job on the hammer

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
design of the paint job on the hammer
shot<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> rapid<00:01:16.049> strike<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.860> hammer

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
shot to the rapid strike on the hammer

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.130 
shot to the rapid strike on the hammer
shot<00:01:17.280> there<00:01:17.460> are<00:01:17.580> three<00:01:17.970> obvious<00:01:18.479> layers<00:01:18.810> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
shot there are three obvious layers and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.520 
shot there are three obvious layers and
the<00:01:19.860> rapid<00:01:20.130> strike<00:01:20.340> only<00:01:20.549> has<00:01:21.000> two<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.290> trying

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the rapid strike only has two so trying

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.660 
the rapid strike only has two so trying
to<00:01:22.590> get<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> design<00:01:23.130> that's<00:01:23.340> based<00:01:23.520> around

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
to get a design that's based around

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.450 
to get a design that's based around
three<00:01:23.939> layers<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.689> two<00:01:24.900> layers<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.920> bit

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
three layers on to two layers is a bit

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.070 
three layers on to two layers is a bit
of<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> problem<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.270> layouts<00:01:27.689> are<00:01:27.900> just

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
of a problem and the layouts are just

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.319 
of a problem and the layouts are just
completely<00:01:28.619> different<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.880> does<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
completely different so it does have a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.780 
completely different so it does have a
bit<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.840> different<00:01:31.200> design<00:01:31.350> feel<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.220> but

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
bit of a different design feel to it but

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.060 
bit of a different design feel to it but
I<00:01:32.820> tried<00:01:33.180> my<00:01:33.420> best<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.869> kind<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> same

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
I tried my best to kind of get the same

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.310 
I tried my best to kind of get the same
amount<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.549> blacks<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.299> grays<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.840> red<00:01:37.020> onto

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
amount of blacks and grays and red onto

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.319 
amount of blacks and grays and red onto
it<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.100> take<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> stock<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
it so if we take the stock up on the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.420 
it so if we take the stock up on the
back<00:01:39.540> he<00:01:39.900> wanted<00:01:40.229> me<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.409> put<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.860> 3d

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
back he wanted me to put on this 3d

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.120 
back he wanted me to put on this 3d
printed<00:01:41.790> stock<00:01:42.270> attachment<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.619> had<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.009> go

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
printed stock attachment and I had to go

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.100 
printed stock attachment and I had to go
in<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:45.030> bit<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.360> putty<00:01:45.659> work<00:01:45.899> on

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
in and do a little bit of putty work on

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.200 
in and do a little bit of putty work on
there<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.490> fill<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.000> gap

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
there you can see it to fill in the gap

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.999 
there you can see it to fill in the gap
because<00:01:48.450> he<00:01:48.509> cut<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.079> little<00:01:49.770> too

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
because he cut it just a little too

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.249 
because he cut it just a little too
forward<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.450> had<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.840> there<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.020> fill

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
forward so I had to go in there and fill

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.469 
forward so I had to go in there and fill
that<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.470> around<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.640> stock<00:01:53.880> attachment<00:01:54.420> I

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
that up around the stock attachment I

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.060 
that up around the stock attachment I
used<00:01:54.750> some<00:01:54.960> Lube<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.890> kind<00:01:56.040> of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
used some Lube and then just kind of

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.280 
used some Lube and then just kind of
shoved<00:01:56.790> epoxy<00:01:57.329> pudding<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.659> there<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.140> then

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
shoved epoxy pudding in there and then

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.499 
shoved epoxy pudding in there and then
ground<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.310> round<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.729> out<00:01:59.880> around<00:02:00.240> there

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
ground it to round it out around there

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.179 
ground it to round it out around there
now<00:02:00.960> because<00:02:01.200> he<00:02:01.320> did<00:02:01.469> cut<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> rapid<00:02:02.040> strike

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
now because he did cut the rapid strike

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.280 
now because he did cut the rapid strike
a<00:02:02.340> little<00:02:02.610> too<00:02:02.880> forward<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.869> stock

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
a little too forward the stock

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.039 
a little too forward the stock
attachment<00:02:04.890> piece<00:02:05.070> was<00:02:05.969> very<00:02:06.270> very<00:02:06.479> loose<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
attachment piece was very very loose and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.020 
attachment piece was very very loose and
wouldn't<00:02:07.380> work<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.009> had<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.369> left<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.970> in

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
wouldn't work if you had just left it in

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.790 
wouldn't work if you had just left it in
there<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> pressure<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> shell

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
there with the pressure of the shell

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.960 
there with the pressure of the shell
holding<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.760> that's<00:02:11.879> why<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.180> added

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
holding it in so that's why I added

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.330 
holding it in so that's why I added
bolts<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.870> each<00:02:14.140> side<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.560> just<00:02:14.860> drilled<00:02:15.220> it

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
bolts to each side I just drilled it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.480 
bolts to each side I just drilled it
right<00:02:15.370> in<00:02:15.730> into<00:02:16.060> both<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.050> shell<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.800> 3d

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
right in into both the shell and the 3d

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.790 
right in into both the shell and the 3d
piece<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.270> has<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.450> little<00:02:19.870> bit<00:02:19.930> more<00:02:19.990> hold

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
piece so it has a little bit more hold

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.530 
piece so it has a little bit more hold
to<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.280> does<00:02:21.430> wobble<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.940> little<00:02:22.000> bit<00:02:22.330> but

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
to it it does wobble a little bit but

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.750 
to it it does wobble a little bit but
it's<00:02:22.720> much<00:02:23.110> much<00:02:23.320> better<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.250> much<00:02:24.490> more

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
it's much much better and much more

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.940 
it's much much better and much more
secure<00:02:25.240> than<00:02:25.450> how<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.900> was<00:02:25.990> originally<00:02:26.770> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
secure than how it was originally and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.500 
secure than how it was originally and
attached<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.790> he<00:02:27.940> wanted<00:02:28.120> me<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:28.240> color

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
attached to it he wanted me to color

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.750 
attached to it he wanted me to color
match<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:29.020> stockade<00:02:29.770> stock<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.490> think<00:02:30.700> I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
match this stockade stock and I think I

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.700 
match this stockade stock and I think I
did<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:30.940> pretty<00:02:31.000> nice<00:02:31.570> job<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.620> think

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
did a pretty nice job of that I think

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.950 
did a pretty nice job of that I think
this<00:02:32.950> has<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.160> best<00:02:34.000> balance<00:02:34.450> of<00:02:34.600> colors

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
this has the best balance of colors

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.900 
this has the best balance of colors
overall<00:02:35.470> in<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.740> whole<00:02:35.920> build<00:02:36.220> but<00:02:36.730> that's

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
overall in the whole build but that's

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.640 
overall in the whole build but that's
just<00:02:37.030> my<00:02:37.240> opinion<00:02:37.300> on<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.260> right<00:02:38.410> here<00:02:38.530> you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
just my opinion on the right here you

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.780 
just my opinion on the right here you
can<00:02:38.770> see<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.010> battery<00:02:39.190> trade<00:02:39.490> that<00:02:39.640> he's

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
can see the battery trade that he's

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.490 
can see the battery trade that he's
using<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.270> hold<00:02:40.420> three<00:02:40.750> I'm<00:02:40.930> ours<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.320> one

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
using to hold three I'm ours and one

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.260 
using to hold three I'm ours and one
dummy<00:02:41.770> battery<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.340> run<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.700> entire<00:02:42.940> rapid

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
dummy battery to run the entire rapid

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.030 
dummy battery to run the entire rapid
strike<00:02:43.450> off<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.260> added<00:02:44.470> two<00:02:44.800> little

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
strike off of and I added two little

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.470 
strike off of and I added two little
lines<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:45.610> because<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.820> kind<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.180> wanted<00:02:46.390> to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
lines to it because I kind of wanted to

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.850 
lines to it because I kind of wanted to
break<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.810> up<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.170> little<00:02:47.200> bit<00:02:47.470> now<00:02:47.620> I

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
break it up a little bit now I

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.199 
break it up a little bit now I
originally<00:02:48.580> thought<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.970> they<00:02:49.060> would<00:02:49.150> be

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
originally thought that they would be

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.910 
originally thought that they would be
going<00:02:49.330> up<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:49.780> down<00:02:49.959> but<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.290> think<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.680> side

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
going up and down but I think the side

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.100 
going up and down but I think the side
to<00:02:51.070> side<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.580> just<00:02:52.270> fine<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.870> kind<00:02:53.050> of

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
to side is just fine and it kind of

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.070 
to side is just fine and it kind of
breaks<00:02:53.440> up<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.650> monotony<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.580> read

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
breaks up the monotony of that read

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.120 
breaks up the monotony of that read
nicely<00:02:56.080> so<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.230> think<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.530> was<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.680> nice<00:02:56.800> touch

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
nicely so I think that was a nice touch

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.160 
nicely so I think that was a nice touch
on<00:02:57.250> my<00:02:57.400> part<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:58.120> on<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.600> left<00:02:58.810> side<00:02:58.990> we<00:02:59.140> have

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
on my part and on the left side we have

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.199 
on my part and on the left side we have
a<00:02:59.320> voltmeter<00:02:59.650> that<00:03:00.040> turns<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:00.490> when<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.820> open

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
a voltmeter that turns on when you open

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.510 
a voltmeter that turns on when you open
up<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.840> jam<00:03:02.110> door<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:02.470> just<00:03:02.650> wired<00:03:03.070> it<00:03:03.250> up<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.490> a

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
up the jam door I just wired it up to a

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.370 
up the jam door I just wired it up to a
little<00:03:03.700> switch<00:03:03.970> in<00:03:04.120> there<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:05.110> connects

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
little switch in there and it connects

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.930 
little switch in there and it connects
directly<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.980> where<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.340> wires<00:03:06.580> come<00:03:06.760> out<00:03:06.850> of

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
directly to where the wires come out of

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.100 
directly to where the wires come out of
the<00:03:07.000> battery<00:03:07.240> case<00:03:07.450> there<00:03:07.630> you're<00:03:07.750> getting<00:03:07.840> a

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
the battery case there you're getting a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.470 
the battery case there you're getting a
nice<00:03:08.350> feed<00:03:08.709> directly<00:03:09.340> from<00:03:09.610> here<00:03:10.030> the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
nice feed directly from here the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.330 
nice feed directly from here the
voltmeter<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:11.110> protected<00:03:11.740> by<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.920> little<00:03:12.310> piece

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
voltmeter is protected by a little piece

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.220 
voltmeter is protected by a little piece
of<00:03:12.610> polycarbonate<00:03:12.820> spaced<00:03:13.720> up<00:03:13.930> from<00:03:14.140> the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
of polycarbonate spaced up from the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.280 
of polycarbonate spaced up from the
shell<00:03:14.470> using<00:03:15.160> some<00:03:15.400> 4:40<00:03:16.090> bolts<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.600> nuts<00:03:16.870> and

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
shell using some 4:40 bolts and nuts and

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.840 
shell using some 4:40 bolts and nuts and
I<00:03:17.350> actually<00:03:17.470> had<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.860> slice<00:03:18.250> down<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.610> little

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
I actually had to slice down a little

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.880 
I actually had to slice down a little
bit<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.209> sides<00:03:19.510> one<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.440> sides<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.830> the

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
bit of the sides one of the sides of the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.770 
bit of the sides one of the sides of the
nuts<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.610> voltmeter<00:03:21.910> could<00:03:22.300> raise<00:03:22.570> up

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
nuts so the voltmeter could raise up

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.540 
nuts so the voltmeter could raise up
just<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.260> little<00:03:23.290> bit<00:03:23.680> off<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.860> shell<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:24.489> it

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
just a little bit off the shell so it

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.880 
just a little bit off the shell so it
wasn't<00:03:24.850> sunken<00:03:25.750> into<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.080> magwell<00:03:26.290> too<00:03:26.680> much

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
wasn't sunken into the magwell too much

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.000 
wasn't sunken into the magwell too much
to<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> hinder<00:03:27.940> any<00:03:28.209> sort<00:03:28.570> of<00:03:28.660> performance<00:03:29.260> but

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
to a hinder any sort of performance but

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.590 
to a hinder any sort of performance but
that's<00:03:30.220> just<00:03:30.370> basically<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:31.030> protect<00:03:31.450> it

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
that's just basically to protect it

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.270 
that's just basically to protect it
because<00:03:31.810> known<00:03:32.200> once<00:03:32.440> they<00:03:32.530> scratched<00:03:33.040> a

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
because known once they scratched a

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.520 
because known once they scratched a
voltmeter<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:34.540> can't<00:03:34.930> really<00:03:35.200> read

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
voltmeter that you can't really read

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.530 
voltmeter that you can't really read
anymore<00:03:35.800> so<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.580> needed<00:03:36.880> a<00:03:36.970> little<00:03:37.390> bit<00:03:37.480> of

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
anymore so it needed a little bit of

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.509 
anymore so it needed a little bit of
protection<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.350> think<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.950> polycarb

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
protection and I think the polycarb

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.060 
protection and I think the polycarb
piece<00:03:39.790> just<00:03:40.209> kind<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.600> looks<00:03:41.110> nice<00:03:41.500> on<00:03:41.709> its<00:03:41.920> own

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
piece just kind of looks nice on its own

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.310 
piece just kind of looks nice on its own
so<00:03:42.580> that's<00:03:43.060> what<00:03:43.209> I<00:03:43.269> did<00:03:43.420> there<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:44.110> last

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
so that's what I did there and the last

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.080 
so that's what I did there and the last
little<00:03:44.500> external<00:03:44.860> piece<00:03:45.010> is<00:03:45.220> this<00:03:45.459> extended

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
little external piece is this extended

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.910 
little external piece is this extended
mag<00:03:46.239> release<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:46.720> painted<00:03:47.230> red<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.590> love

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
mag release that I painted red I love

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.199 
mag release that I painted red I love
these<00:03:48.100> things<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.519> I<00:03:48.549> can<00:03:48.700> talk<00:03:48.820> about<00:03:48.970> them

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
these things and I can talk about them

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.570 
these things and I can talk about them
for<00:03:49.690> days<00:03:50.110> but<00:03:50.709> yeah<00:03:50.830> that's<00:03:51.070> all<00:03:51.370> the

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
for days but yeah that's all the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.539 
for days but yeah that's all the
external<00:03:51.940> stuff<00:03:52.150> not<00:03:52.600> too<00:03:52.959> bad<00:03:53.320> just<00:03:54.010> a<00:03:54.220> bunch

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
external stuff not too bad just a bunch

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.210 
external stuff not too bad just a bunch
of<00:03:54.700> taping<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.390> bunch<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.870> kind<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.380> small

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
of taping and a bunch of kind of small

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.949 
of taping and a bunch of kind of small
touch-ups<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.850> make<00:03:58.000> everything<00:03:58.299> looking

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
touch-ups to make everything looking

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.890 
touch-ups to make everything looking
nice<00:03:59.170> but<00:03:59.769> there<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:01.150> go

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
nice but there you go

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.110 
nice but there you go
now<00:04:02.709> these<00:04:02.860> nice<00:04:03.100> rapid<00:04:03.519> strike<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:03.820> may<00:04:03.970> have

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
now these nice rapid strike and may have

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.690 
now these nice rapid strike and may have
gone<00:04:04.269> a<00:04:04.330> little<00:04:04.510> bit<00:04:05.049> overboard<00:04:05.530> on<00:04:06.040> how<00:04:06.519> much

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
gone a little bit overboard on how much

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.979 
gone a little bit overboard on how much
I<00:04:06.790> overhauled<00:04:07.269> it<00:04:07.360> especially<00:04:07.570> for<00:04:07.840> something

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
I overhauled it especially for something

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.500 
I overhauled it especially for something
that<00:04:08.230> runs<00:04:08.410> on<00:04:08.680> just<00:04:08.709> three<00:04:09.640> high<00:04:09.790> Mars<00:04:10.060> but

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
that runs on just three high Mars but

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.539 
that runs on just three high Mars but
I'd<00:04:10.989> rather<00:04:11.110> overhaul<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:11.739> well<00:04:11.980> then<00:04:12.340> cut

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
I'd rather overhaul it well then cut

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.190 
I'd rather overhaul it well then cut
corners<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:12.970> leave<00:04:13.209> a<00:04:13.239> bunch<00:04:13.450> of<00:04:13.570> stock<00:04:13.870> mess

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
corners and leave a bunch of stock mess

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.259 
corners and leave a bunch of stock mess
in<00:04:14.410> there<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:15.190> on<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.580> inside<00:04:15.850> we<00:04:16.000> have<00:04:16.030> a

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.309 
iMRS I have all three of them in there
so<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.120> get<00:04:30.210> really<00:04:30.479> good<00:04:30.599> single<00:04:31.110> fire

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
so you get really good single fire

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:32.989 
so you get really good single fire

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.869 
battery to the voltmeter itself I've
used<00:04:45.120> an<00:04:45.389> XT<00:04:45.900> 30<00:04:46.319> connector<00:04:46.919> just<00:04:47.669> because

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:47.879 
used an XT 30 connector just because

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.070 
used an XT 30 connector just because
it's<00:04:48.029> small<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.330> it<00:04:48.509> doesn't<00:04:48.749> take<00:04:48.900> up<00:04:49.050> too

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
it's small and it doesn't take up too

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.170 
it's small and it doesn't take up too

tiny little 130 powerhouses that have

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.589 
tiny little 130 powerhouses that have
this<00:04:55.830> excellent<00:04:56.400> line<00:04:56.849> to<00:04:57.060> them<00:04:57.210> they<00:04:57.539> do

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
this excellent line to them they do

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.179 
this excellent line to them they do
really<00:04:57.900> well<00:04:58.080> on<00:04:58.139> 2's<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.770> they<00:04:58.830> do<00:04:58.889> pretty

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
really well on 2's and they do pretty

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.820 
really well on 2's and they do pretty
decently<00:04:59.610> on<00:04:59.759> a<00:04:59.789> 3s<00:05:00.240> but<00:05:00.659> since<00:05:00.870> we're<00:05:01.050> using<00:05:01.080> 3

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
decently on a 3s but since we're using 3

iMRS<00:05:02.279> in<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.669> battery<00:05:02.939> pack<00:05:03.210> I<00:05:03.360> thought

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
iMRS in the battery pack I thought

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.959 
iMRS in the battery pack I thought
banshees<00:05:04.229> would<00:05:04.919> wouldn't<00:05:05.400> hold<00:05:05.580> up<00:05:05.729> too<00:05:05.939> well

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:05.969 
banshees would wouldn't hold up too well

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:07.519 
banshees would wouldn't hold up too well
so<00:05:06.240> that's<00:05:06.389> why<00:05:06.539> I<00:05:06.569> went<00:05:06.689> Thor<00:05:06.870> Anton's<00:05:07.259> I<00:05:07.379> had

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:07.529 
so that's why I went Thor Anton's I had

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:09.320 
so that's why I went Thor Anton's I had
three<00:05:07.800> of<00:05:07.889> them<00:05:07.949> laying<00:05:08.129> around<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:09.029> I<00:05:09.120> wanted

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
three of them laying around and I wanted

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.820 
three of them laying around and I wanted
to<00:05:09.389> use<00:05:09.569> them<00:05:09.750> so<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:09.930> threw<00:05:10.289> them<00:05:10.409> in<00:05:10.529> there<00:05:10.680> and

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
to use them so I threw them in there and

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.399 
to use them so I threw them in there and
they<00:05:10.979> perform<00:05:11.520> really<00:05:12.240> really<00:05:12.719> nicely<00:05:12.930> I<00:05:13.139> just

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
they perform really really nicely I just

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.439 
they perform really really nicely I just
I<00:05:13.529> like<00:05:13.860> them<00:05:14.099> and<00:05:14.460> I<00:05:14.550> wish<00:05:14.759> I<00:05:14.879> could<00:05:14.909> find<00:05:15.210> more

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
I like them and I wish I could find more

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.350 
I like them and I wish I could find more
of<00:05:15.509> them<00:05:15.689> but<00:05:16.189> you<00:05:17.189> can't<00:05:17.669> anymore<00:05:17.879> so<00:05:18.180> that's

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
of them but you can't anymore so that's

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.820 
of them but you can't anymore so that's
a<00:05:18.479> shame<00:05:18.750> so<00:05:19.409> I<00:05:19.439> think<00:05:19.529> I've<00:05:19.680> covered

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
a shame so I think I've covered

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.649 
a shame so I think I've covered
everything<00:05:20.129> if<00:05:20.520> I<00:05:20.669> didn't<00:05:20.969> go<00:05:21.210> back<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.539> put

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
everything if I didn't go back and put

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.089 
everything if I didn't go back and put
like<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:21.839> little<00:05:21.930> annotation<00:05:22.379> or<00:05:22.770> something

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
like a little annotation or something

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.159 
like a little annotation or something
but<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.430> made<00:05:23.610> this<00:05:23.789> rapid<00:05:24.240> strike<00:05:24.539> to<00:05:24.990> be<00:05:25.139> a

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
but I made this rapid strike to be a

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.990 
but I made this rapid strike to be a
powerhouse<00:05:25.889> it<00:05:26.099> has<00:05:26.219> all<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.639> internals

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
powerhouse it has all the internals

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.990 
powerhouse it has all the internals
necessary<00:05:27.479> to<00:05:27.930> take<00:05:28.110> 3<00:05:28.500> IM<00:05:28.770> ARS<00:05:28.949> and<00:05:29.099> then<00:05:29.639> some

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
necessary to take 3 IM ARS and then some

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.450 
necessary to take 3 IM ARS and then some
so<00:05:30.509> this<00:05:30.900> thing<00:05:31.139> is<00:05:31.349> shooting<00:05:31.740> very<00:05:32.189> very

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
so this thing is shooting very very

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.189 
so this thing is shooting very very
nicely<00:05:32.639> slow<00:05:32.969> let's<00:05:33.479> take<00:05:33.870> this<00:05:34.020> thing

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
nicely slow let's take this thing

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.480 
nicely slow let's take this thing
outside<00:05:34.379> put<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:34.889> through<00:05:34.979> the<00:05:35.129> chronograph

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
outside put it through the chronograph

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.490 
outside put it through the chronograph
and<00:05:35.639> I'll<00:05:35.699> show<00:05:35.909> you<00:05:35.969> some<00:05:36.210> darts<00:05:36.870> Spanish

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
and I'll show you some darts Spanish

00:05:37.500 --> 00:06:20.090 
and I'll show you some darts Spanish
with<00:05:37.680> it<00:05:37.800> so<00:05:37.949> let's<00:05:38.099> go<00:05:38.219> do<00:05:38.339> that<00:05:38.460> right<00:05:38.729> now

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.040 

as<00:06:20.820> you<00:06:20.970> guys<00:06:21.090> can<00:06:21.270> see<00:06:21.330> this<00:06:21.630> rapid<00:06:21.900> strike

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
as you guys can see this rapid strike

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.320 
as you guys can see this rapid strike
has<00:06:22.170> some<00:06:22.290> very<00:06:22.650> nice<00:06:22.860> spam<00:06:23.550> fire<00:06:23.850> too<00:06:24.060> but<00:06:24.270> it

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
has some very nice spam fire too but it

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.400 
has some very nice spam fire too but it
also<00:06:24.510> retains<00:06:25.380> a<00:06:25.680> single-shot<00:06:26.840> control<00:06:27.840> using

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
also retains a single-shot control using

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.770 
also retains a single-shot control using
the<00:06:28.440> BSU<00:06:28.920> K<00:06:29.100> wiring<00:06:29.730> setup<00:06:30.060> and<00:06:30.270> the<00:06:30.360> three

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
the BSU K wiring setup and the three

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.480 
the BSU K wiring setup and the three
switches<00:06:31.440> controlling<00:06:31.980> everything<00:06:32.160> you<00:06:32.340> can

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
switches controlling everything you can

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.850 
switches controlling everything you can
still<00:06:32.760> have<00:06:32.970> that<00:06:33.180> nice<00:06:33.750> one<00:06:34.230> shot<00:06:34.590> per

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
still have that nice one shot per

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.710 
still have that nice one shot per
trigger<00:06:35.520> pulse<00:06:35.820> that's<00:06:36.060> for<00:06:36.270> the<00:06:36.330> chronograph

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
trigger pulse that's for the chronograph

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.820 
trigger pulse that's for the chronograph
so<00:06:36.780> I<00:06:36.840> notice<00:06:37.110> that<00:06:37.170> was<00:06:37.290> revving<00:06:37.590> this<00:06:37.710> to

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
so I notice that was revving this to

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.630 
so I notice that was revving this to
about<00:06:38.040> the<00:06:38.270> 85<00:06:39.270> 90<00:06:39.660> %<00:06:40.050> motor<00:06:40.380> wind-up<00:06:40.890> speed<00:06:41.220> so

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
about the 85 90 % motor wind-up speed so

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.280 
about the 85 90 % motor wind-up speed so
that's<00:06:41.760> why<00:06:42.000> I<00:06:42.030> was<00:06:42.150> getting<00:06:42.240> about<00:06:42.450> 115<00:06:43.260> I

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290 
that's why I was getting about 115 I

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.080 
that's why I was getting about 115 I
would<00:06:43.560> think<00:06:43.890> you<00:06:44.280> can<00:06:44.430> get<00:06:44.580> this<00:06:44.670> up<00:06:44.850> to<00:06:44.970> about

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
would think you can get this up to about

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.190 
would think you can get this up to about
100<00:06:45.540> and<00:06:45.710> 1820<00:06:46.710> FPS<00:06:47.100> max<00:06:47.520> but<00:06:48.240> a<00:06:48.270> 115<00:06:49.020> is

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 
100 and 1820 FPS max but a 115 is

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.860 
100 and 1820 FPS max but a 115 is
perfectly<00:06:49.770> fine<00:06:49.980> for<00:06:50.480> basically<00:06:51.480> any

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
perfectly fine for basically any

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.920 
perfectly fine for basically any
situation<00:06:52.770> so<00:06:52.800> that<00:06:53.160> is<00:06:53.340> no<00:06:53.640> problem<00:06:54.300> so<00:06:54.510> there

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
situation so that is no problem so there

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.230 
situation so that is no problem so there
you<00:06:55.020> have<00:06:55.050> it<00:06:55.290> that<00:06:55.470> is<00:06:55.500> the<00:06:55.860> rapid<00:06:56.400> strike<00:06:56.670> SMG

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240
