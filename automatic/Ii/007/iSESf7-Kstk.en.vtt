 welcome to my channel nice that 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.759
 Join her since the month of november 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.679
 is pay and we have december and we 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.120
 I hope the Christmas season and I have 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.310
 a used up as we for you 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.410
 This time I have everything in this box 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.420
 I collected now just run purely 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.760
 pull one thing out after the other 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.949
 and tell you there is a top for me 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.340
 or a flop was the first thing I started 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.090
 on with a contact lens care product 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.800
 oldenburg care for soft 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.360
 contact lenses multi norm 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.280
 I did not think so well now 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.840
 eyes burned with it i have 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.730
 found that with all this 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.170
 contact lenses care products my eyes 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.640
 I think I'm burning on this 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.710
 preservatives in the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.750
 allergic to contact lenses 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.000
 I am then more of a saline solution 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 in black you can not do that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.170
 clean 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.059
 although i do that training 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.160
 and to store but it is extra 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.289
 Packing it just for one 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.989
 short-term storage should take 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.160
 but well and I have two weeks 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.799
 Lens of this is maybe it 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.659
 not so tragic but yes I contract 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.369
 all these contact lenses with not 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.979
 I have finally noticed and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.869
 that's why cooking salt solutions are for me 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:19.590
 Definitely better then here 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:21.630
 completely uninteresting expect 625 places 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.310
 say no the fans were the ones from 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.960
 dms from in berlin quite normal standard 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.020
 I find everything dull then my 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.180
 beloved cleaning wipes from young care 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.590
 that he still has the one old packing 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.880
 I have the in a new packaging 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.520
 bought because it has again 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.890
 buy it and I can tell you that 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.570
 here are still well knows every case 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
 recommends using the new packaging bin 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.090
 I'm not that satisfied anymore 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.560
 have the feeling they do not have only the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.140
 packaging changed but also the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.180
 cloths in itself but I will you 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.890
 then in the next used up video 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.479
 explain still shared with the old towels 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.549
 comes then bought that is namely 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.110
 really good food buys a demand 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.939
 because him 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.340
 my beloved body butter in cocoa from 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.500
 valea has finished the whole 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.399
 table is empty but I still have one 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.080
 backup at home 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.330
 You have written me that you out 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.879
 it was supposed to go to the assortment 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.130
 would like to dm on friday and had 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.330
 So there are those in our wm 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.950
 maybe even find out about it now 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.900
 the leftovers still to be sold and 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.340
 After that I have the hazelnut 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.720
 not seen yet maybe 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.239
 also takes a bit on everyone 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.310
 fall an absolute favorite product of 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.860
 jÃ¶rg sour then I have a shower and 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.420
 Bathing is done by la brea me 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.220
 liked that at the beginning like the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.280
 smell it has aired so after roses 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.780
 yes, also a seemingly wild game 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.459
 but arrows towards the end I had 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.410
 somehow the feeling as if the roses 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.410
 had become angry then but should 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.090
 so towards the end I did that 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.860
 not at the beginning but no 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.760
 I know what happened there 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.660
 the part or the couple of rock I was 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.790
 again not how to do that 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.349
 although all the time lately, everyone speaks 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.000
 subscribers and in the comments 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.290
 determine how to pronounce that because 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.329
 I've told you that's me 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.560
 a subscriber said and I did it 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.810
 forgot again I already have 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.590
 So forget lord god again 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.660
 that is from rock azzura is destined to be 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.489
 I probably it's wrong 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.440
 summerer or the calculus or me 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.569
 use that as a dry shampoo and me 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.310
 can highly recommend it that is 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.109
 incidentally, the thing that I at 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.700
 forgot words in dm i can 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.829
 Watch the video below in the infobox 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.510
 I link as an order as I do 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.609
 use as a dry shampoo me 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.590
 maybe I have questions from neobio 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.410
 a shampoo is empty and that is 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.450
 that now for his shiny hair 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.849
 clan shampoo I have a turn of the series too 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.620
 the volume of shampoo the two bubbly 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.420
 do not take much, it is one 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.530
 my favorite shampoos maybe 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.780
 I find the volume of shampoo and 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.519
 little bit better but is up 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.620
 every case is a very good shampoo 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.190
 without silicone without paraffin and without 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.540
 mineral oils bleed voluntary abstinence 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.269
 on synthetic fragrance and dyes 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.730
 I can definitely recommend you 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.350
 that's what I believe in the lottery invite 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.850
 And you can do it anyway 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.010
 get internet and it does not cost 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.170
 a lot of them usually cost this bubbly 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.850
 from nature always came 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.760
 a bit more, but that's really great 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.010
 cheap and really good then I have 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.110
 a shower gel made of a like pineapple 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.270
 and mint a nursing shower 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.560
 I have it from a subscriber 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.790
 got sent by the coin 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.650
 I did not smell that much now though 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.870
 in any case from the pineapple so if 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.850
 her fruity may be liked and fruity 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.520
 you stand then I can do that on everyone 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.770
 case do not recommend 100 percent after 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.500
 I have the aqua pineapple from alberta 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.470
 Cleansing Gel learn makes seaweed cleanses 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.300
 and refreshes for normal and mixed skin 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.100
 at the beginning when I used that 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.480
 I face all over and adhere 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.940
 and I thought oh my god that 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.620
 is indeed a very bad product as 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.480
 but then used it longer against 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.010
 the impurities gone it has good 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.510
 cleaned one has really fresh 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.670
 it probably feels like it's on the skin 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.500
 cleaned so well that it in the beginning 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.930
 first cut everything out and then 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.820
 towards the end it was good 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.440
 However, I had the feeling that 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.030
 this will wash the skin a bit 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.070
 Print that means if you already 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.300
 I would like to have you dry skin 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.770
 not recommend it but there is yes 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.900
 also that it is normal and how 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.490
 Look at it from the skin 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.110
 I definitely recommend it for 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.480
 dry skin or even for sensitive 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.370
 Maybe you do not skin then I have 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.770
 a deodorant made empty by maria das 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.050
 sensitive theo this is a demon with 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.760
 aloe vera gentle care for sensitive 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.930
 skin and somehow are all my 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.090
 room now just sticky the 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.730
 Efficiency was good, the shelf life was good 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.930
 good and enough was good too i was 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.610
 yes not always if a deo like that 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.650
 intrusive is so must with me 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.450
 which he would be counted 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.730
 and that he has in any case a 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.860
 subtle scent to reckless pen 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.780
 all worth is a gentle one in any case 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.000
 and mild deodorant if you are more sensitive 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.660
 You can have that skin 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.610
 look at 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.540
 I've done a livia walk 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.100
 I also from a subscriber 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.710
 gets sent that's a nice 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.690
 Herzdose I also have another one 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.820
 equal to several with tackled and nivea 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.590
 cream I can recommend you in winter 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.830
 is it the best you can do for your lips 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.570
 really hot and dry can do 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.330
 brittle lips and if you really 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.340
 regular nivea cream then uses 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.160
 Do not you have the problem yes and then 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.169
 Finally, a mascara of 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.780
 Manhattan the super size volume delight 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.460
 mascara is an absolute favorite product 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.229
 I also got one from me 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.000
 Subscribed I have sent you

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.200
 eyelashes and you have me as 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.970
 I used this mascara too 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.800
 often addressed my eyelashes and 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.990
 asked me which mascara I use 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.120

 well i can get you down to the infobox 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.190
 I believe in addition to video link 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.990
 you also asked me in the comments 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.060
 which mascara I use I show 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.280
 I'll show you that bit again 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.720
 but also in this video I am 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.660
 show off my mascara 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.470
 that is not a forced one 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.419
 is we call that so a 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.979
 just a bit down a bit 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.000
 wider then it will be in the middle 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:05.800
 narrow and then it works again 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.720
 apart but up again 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.910
 narrower and then you can do it as well or 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.880
 eyelashes and it really is one 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:15.280
 So great mascara she makes you swing
