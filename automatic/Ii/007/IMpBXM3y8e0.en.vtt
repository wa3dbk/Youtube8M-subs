00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.260
 hello youtube friends here rb 01 and 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:07.120
 Well today I'm going to show you how to create a 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.889
 server bach and the first thing we have to 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.860
 to do is to go to the link that description that 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.019
 is this once there you have to download 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.420
 the version that you want to make the server 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.000
 if you have version 1.5 point 2 of 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.530
 minecraft then this and if when you are 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.220
 seeing this is already a newer version 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.350
 Well the newest knit 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.750
 you see it here 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.470
 you give to download and you have to wait 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.400
 it's worth once you have downloaded what you have 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.620
 what to do is create a folder 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.090
 anybody I'm going to create it within 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.340
 this other folder because the desktop 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.320
 we have it full of shit the folder 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.710
 You can take whatever you want to call it 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.710
 server 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.050
 and what you have to do is drag the 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.719
 file inside 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.460
 then you have to click and 1 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.390
 second later another and you erase everything 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.390
 except kraft bouquet 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.750
 and then right - click them 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.440
 new 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.630
 and here you give a text document 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.530
 there would not be and you will stick the code that one 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.780
 of the codes that I leave the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.580
 description if it does not work well what 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.810
 do with another and so me to me this is the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.770
 I'm doing well 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.200
 What I also want to tell you is that 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.609
 if you want those who do not enter 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.439
 they have the purchased minecraft that they have 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.289
 very graphic of all that you put 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.880
 true the falls I have it put so 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.250
 because he would not let me in before and if I 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.229
 change the configuration just good so 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.119
 this is saved as a point file 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.800
 to the place you give with the name that you want 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.490
 but it has 7 points 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.360
 that is to say 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.790
 I will call a bat is a name that more 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.950
 they usually put 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.299
 and then the wait 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.299
 I leave as is 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.630
 keep the current format and it is once 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.130
 done this what you have to do is 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.770
 erase this because this one will no longer be 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.770
 useless poor initial is this 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.299
 OK yes 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.240
 to download everything and we have to 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.240
 wait for it to finish loading everything 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.790
 good when they have already been loaded 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.790
 you simply put stop and down 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.450
 and if this rare automatically now what 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.020
 what you have to do is open this the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.840
 server that comes out with a little notebook 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.590
 and here customize is all the server to 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.620
 from here if you want to do it without 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.599
 more and what is it that gives you the ip 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.650
 what you have to do then will be to go 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.060
 to another video that I have that I will leave you 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.370
 up with the little screen and the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.239
 description 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.519
 and if I 'm not going to keep teaching this for 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.590
 allow you to go if you have many what 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.970
 you can remove this you do not need to 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.800
 change nothing nothing 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.110
 all this is disregarded only 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.800
 the ip of 0 is what you have to catch 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.800
 of the machine 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.770
 well then you have ipv4 addresses 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.080
 I will put here 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.480
 but if you want to do it without more and then 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.280
 as I told you 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.110
 Well, you still have all this texture 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.280
 pac if you want a texture pack if 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.130
 you want it to only connect in 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.860
 premium users 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.760
 I will set false if you want them to be 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.040
 fight maximum game difficulty of 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.140
 players and all this 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.800
 once all this is done you give him file 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.780
 save 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.780
 Do not close if you give it back to run 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.820
 and with this the people who have your ip 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.820
 of marchi in this case 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.280
 Well, you can enter 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.110
 and I'm going to teach a little 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.110
 but 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.820
 and this would be our server normally 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.850
 he does not leave would not look like that to loot 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.590
 even with a 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.350
 with a pack of textures that mix makes 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.569
 little and good, that's it but those 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.139
 servers like and subscribe jce and good 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.139
 goodbye
