depth and what makes this odd tsunami
series<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.610> appealing<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.530> has<00:00:37.770> a

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
series so appealing is that it has a

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.729 
series so appealing is that it has a
really<00:00:38.760> quite<00:00:39.059> an<00:00:39.180> ingenious<00:00:39.540> hull<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.440> has<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
really quite an ingenious hull and has a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.720 
really quite an ingenious hull and has a
moderate<00:00:41.280> B<00:00:42.180> style<00:00:42.600> hull<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.800> has<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.340> multi

moderate B style hull and it has a multi
chine<00:00:45.090> sides<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.960> what<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.039> means<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.750> when

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
chine sides and what that means is when

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.139 
chine sides and what that means is when
you<00:00:48.780> china<00:00:49.320> side<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.070> put<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> couple<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.850> bends

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
you china side you put a couple of bends

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.689 
you china side you put a couple of bends
in<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.840> creates<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.350> wall<00:00:52.590> or<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> flat<00:00:53.340> spot

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
in it it creates a wall or a flat spot

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.049 
in it it creates a wall or a flat spot
and<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.899> provides<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:56.190> good<00:00:56.219> secondary

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
and that provides really good secondary

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.150 
and that provides really good secondary
stability<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.960> boat<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:58.469> fall<00:00:58.739> over<00:00:58.770> on

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
stability that boat will fall over on

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.360 
stability that boat will fall over on
that<00:00:59.579> wall<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:00.960> helps<00:01:01.559> provide<00:01:02.340> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
that wall and it really helps provide a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
that wall and it really helps provide a
lot<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.850> confidence<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.809> paddler<00:01:04.290> who's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
lot of confidence to that paddler who's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.190 
lot of confidence to that paddler who's
trying<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.920> edge<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.339> boat<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:06.030> carve<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.600> drum<00:01:06.869> or

trying to edge a boat or carve a drum or

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.289 
trying to edge a boat or carve a drum or
or<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> little<00:01:08.070> bit<00:01:08.430> more<00:01:08.670> aggressive<00:01:09.180> with

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
or be a little bit more aggressive with

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.390 
or be a little bit more aggressive with
it<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.930> also<00:01:10.080> does<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> couple<00:01:10.890> other<00:01:11.040> things

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it it also does a couple other things

it it also does a couple other things
those<00:01:11.670> bends<00:01:12.240> make<00:01:12.990> your<00:01:13.200> hull<00:01:13.439> stiffer<00:01:13.939> just

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
those bends make your hull stiffer just

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.880 
those bends make your hull stiffer just
like<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> fold<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.930> sheet<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.290> paper<00:01:16.470> wood

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
like a fold and a sheet of paper wood

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.670 
like a fold and a sheet of paper wood
but<00:01:17.460> because<00:01:18.299> they<00:01:18.570> travel<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.259> virtual

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
but because they travel the virtual

length of the kayak it also makes the
