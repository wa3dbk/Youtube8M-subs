00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
pretty hard level and I'm probably gonna

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.960 
pretty hard level and I'm probably gonna
die

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
die

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.470

but<00:00:25.640> these<00:00:26.640> dragonflies<00:00:27.000> though<00:00:27.330> are

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
but these dragonflies though are

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.599 
but these dragonflies though are
eventually<00:00:27.990> pass<00:00:28.260> because<00:00:28.439> they<00:00:29.279> will<00:00:29.490> be

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
eventually pass because they will be

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.560 
eventually pass because they will be
right<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.939> wrong<00:00:30.090> spot<00:00:30.390> when<00:00:30.510> you're

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
right in the wrong spot when you're

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.470 
right in the wrong spot when you're
trying<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.869> jump<00:00:31.019> up<00:00:31.610> not<00:00:32.610> very<00:00:32.790> fun<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.180> should

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
trying to jump up not very fun I should

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.670 
trying to jump up not very fun I should
have<00:00:33.570> grabbed<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.750> multiplier<00:00:34.230> back<00:00:34.440> there

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
have grabbed that multiplier back there

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.280 
have grabbed that multiplier back there
I<00:00:35.300> thought<00:00:36.300> since<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.570> already<00:00:36.660> had<00:00:36.870> one<00:00:36.899> I

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
I thought since I already had one I

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.630 
I thought since I already had one I
didn't<00:00:37.559> think<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.950> will<00:00:38.100> run<00:00:38.309> out<00:00:38.430> so

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
didn't think this will run out so

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.020 
didn't think this will run out so
quickly<00:00:39.530> okay<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.980> I've<00:00:41.340> got<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> spread

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
quickly okay it's I've got the spread

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.990 
quickly okay it's I've got the spread
fire<00:00:42.239> gun<00:00:42.510> though<00:00:42.920> pretty<00:00:43.920> good<00:00:44.100> not<00:00:44.700> strong

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
fire gun though pretty good not strong

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.279 
fire gun though pretty good not strong
you<00:00:45.120> know<00:00:45.239> dealing<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.840> these<00:00:45.930> stronger

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
you know dealing with these stronger

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.479 
you know dealing with these stronger
enemies<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.800> better<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> bolo

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
enemies so it's better to have the bolo

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.630 
enemies so it's better to have the bolo
gun<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.260> take<00:00:49.260> what<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.590> get<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.430> game

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
gun but take what you can get this game

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.060 
gun but take what you can get this game
doesn't<00:00:50.969> give<00:00:51.059> me<00:00:51.149> much

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.400 

I<00:00:54.100> will<00:00:54.940> say<00:00:55.150> however<00:00:55.180> that<00:00:55.600> this<00:00:55.870> level<00:00:56.260> I

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
I will say however that this level I

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.150 
I will say however that this level I
found<00:00:56.830> an<00:00:57.040> unnaturally<00:00:57.880> large<00:00:58.270> amount<00:00:58.690> of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
found an unnaturally large amount of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.049 
found an unnaturally large amount of
life<00:01:00.360> light<00:01:01.360> power-ups<00:01:01.870> which<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.850> pretty

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
life light power-ups which it's pretty

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:26.330 
life light power-ups which it's pretty
generous<00:01:04.540> considering<00:01:05.230> this<00:01:05.380> level<00:01:05.800> so<00:01:05.950> hard

more when we're hit to our life which is

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.740 
more when we're hit to our life which is
good<00:02:25.530> satelite<00:02:26.530> before<00:02:27.070> we<00:02:27.160> found<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.489> shield
