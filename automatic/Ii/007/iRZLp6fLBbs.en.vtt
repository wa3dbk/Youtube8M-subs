I'm<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> switch<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.730> 3-way<00:00:15.210> switch

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
I'm to a switch and the 3-way switch

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
right here now I'm using the killer RC

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.920 
right here now I'm using the killer RC
superbee<00:00:20.460> RC<00:00:20.939> kill<00:00:21.180> switch<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.720> car

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930

superbee RC kill switch for this car
right<00:00:22.080> now<00:00:22.199> since<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.859> extra<00:00:23.189> two

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
right now since I have the extra two

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.849 
right now since I have the extra two

channels and the third channel which is

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.519 
channels and the third channel which is
the<00:00:25.949> red<00:00:26.130> switch<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.910> kill<00:00:27.150> switch<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the red switch is the kill switch in the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.370 
the red switch is the kill switch in the
four-way<00:00:29.099> or<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> three<00:00:29.580> way<00:00:29.730> switch<00:00:30.380> I'm

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
four-way or the three way switch I'm

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.810 
four-way or the three way switch I'm
pretty<00:00:31.650> much<00:00:31.830> gonna<00:00:32.040> put<00:00:32.250> lights<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
pretty much gonna put lights for the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.850 
pretty much gonna put lights for the
3-way<00:00:33.090> switch<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.570> control<00:00:33.960> kit<00:00:34.170> so

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
3-way switch with the control kit so

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.549 
3-way switch with the control kit so
that'll<00:00:35.340> always<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.730> good<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.140> figured<00:00:37.410> big

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
that'll always be good and I figured big

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.139 
that'll always be good and I figured big
good<00:00:37.739> data<00:00:37.860> start<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.340> car<00:00:38.579> since<00:00:38.879> well

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
good data start the car since well

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.000 
good data start the car since well
everyone's<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.660> mowing<00:00:39.899> outside<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
everyone's out mowing outside and so you

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.170 
everyone's out mowing outside and so you
know<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.219> wouldn't<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.670> much<00:00:41.700> louder

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
know it wouldn't be that much louder

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.150 
know it wouldn't be that much louder
than<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.260> then<00:00:43.379> everybody<00:00:43.739> else<00:00:43.829> so

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
than that and then everybody else so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.990 
than that and then everybody else so
let's<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.460> started

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
let's get started

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.119 
let's get started
just<00:00:45.809> gonna<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> quick<00:00:46.260> test<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.829> make<00:00:46.860> sure

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
just gonna do a quick test so make sure

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.600 
just gonna do a quick test so make sure
the<00:00:47.309> switches<00:00:48.270> turn<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:49.280> make<00:00:50.280> sure<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the switches turn on make sure the

tuning screwdriver and to adjust the
idle<00:01:33.350> which<00:01:33.680> is<00:01:33.800> probably<00:01:34.040> really<00:01:34.250> doing

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
idle which is probably really doing

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.030 
idle which is probably really doing
wacky<00:01:35.510> and<00:01:35.630> probably<00:01:35.930> off<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:36.619> prime<00:01:36.860> it<00:01:36.950> up

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
wacky and probably off and I prime it up

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.330 
wacky and probably off and I prime it up
real<00:01:37.190> quick<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:39.080> gas<00:01:39.290> going<00:01:39.590> blowing<00:01:40.220> and

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
real quick the gas going blowing and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.660 
real quick the gas going blowing and
mixed<00:01:40.610> up<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:41.470> I<00:01:42.470> turned<00:01:42.890> out<00:01:43.040> all<00:01:43.070> up<00:01:43.310> quite<00:01:43.640> a

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
mixed up and I turned out all up quite a

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.359 
mixed up and I turned out all up quite a
bit<00:01:43.940> head<00:01:44.530> up<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.590> little<00:01:45.619> bit<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.040> little<00:01:46.130> bit
