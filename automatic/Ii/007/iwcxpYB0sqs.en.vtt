don't<00:00:09.450> cut<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.809> yet<00:00:10.320> we're<00:00:11.130> going<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.309> take

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
don't cut that yet we're going to take

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.789 
don't cut that yet we're going to take
these<00:00:11.610> two<00:00:11.670> befores<00:00:12.210> put<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.660> each<00:00:12.870> bottom<00:00:13.380> and

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
these two befores put on each bottom and

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.240 
these two befores put on each bottom and
top<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:15.360> each<00:00:15.540> wall<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.770> when<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.100> wall

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
top of each wall and when the wall

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.590 
top of each wall and when the wall
stands<00:00:17.640> up<00:00:17.760> they'll<00:00:17.970> give<00:00:18.180> me<00:00:18.240> something<00:00:18.539> to

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
stands up they'll give me something to

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.810 
stands up they'll give me something to
fasten<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.439> bottom<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:22.820> and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
fasten the bottom of that to and and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.519 
fasten the bottom of that to and and
it'll<00:00:24.180> hopefully<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.750> more<00:00:24.990> stability<00:00:25.199> to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
it'll hopefully have more stability to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.279 
it'll hopefully have more stability to
the<00:00:25.769> rest<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:27.150> we've<00:00:27.869> got<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.109> cut

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
the rest of this so we've got to cut

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.599 
the rest of this so we've got to cut
this<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.619> too<00:00:28.800> but<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> little<00:00:29.429> bit

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
this here too but for a little bit

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.060 
this here too but for a little bit
shorter<00:00:30.230> the<00:00:31.230> wall<00:00:31.380> I'm<00:00:31.560> actually<00:00:31.769> standing

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
shorter the wall I'm actually standing

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.580 
shorter the wall I'm actually standing
on<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.930> back<00:00:34.620> wall<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.460> shed<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.590> that

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
on is the back wall of the shed and that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.369 
on is the back wall of the shed and that
one<00:00:37.770> there<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> side<00:00:38.520> wall<00:00:39.020> both<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.230> them

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
one there is a side wall both of them

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.590 
one there is a side wall both of them
both<00:00:41.219> side<00:00:41.460> walls<00:00:41.700> are<00:00:41.850> same<00:00:42.120> length<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
both side walls are same length and

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.150 
both side walls are same length and
whatnot<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.110> had<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.290> cut<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.770> shorter

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
whatnot we had to cut this one shorter

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.650 
whatnot we had to cut this one shorter
we<00:00:44.670> actually<00:00:46.039> kind<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.250> modified<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.300> center

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
we actually kind of modified the center

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.630 
we actually kind of modified the center
section<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.230> pallets<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.800> made<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> skinnier

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
section of pallets and made it skinnier

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.119 
section of pallets and made it skinnier
to<00:00:50.850> see<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.239> section<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.140> little<00:00:53.010> bit

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
to see the section here a little bit

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.810 
to see the section here a little bit
wider<00:00:53.309> than<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.739> modified<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.250> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
wider than that one we modified it so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.510 
wider than that one we modified it so
it'd<00:00:57.379> take<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> couple<00:00:58.710> inches<00:00:58.949> off<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.280> each

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it'd take a couple inches off of each

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.000 
it'd take a couple inches off of each
end<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> outer<00:01:01.140> portions<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> wall

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
end of the outer portions of the wall

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.260 
end of the outer portions of the wall
but<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.059> did<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> center<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:06.119> we

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
but we just did it in the center so we

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.960 
but we just did it in the center so we
got<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.740> loft<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.280> almost<00:01:08.549> complete

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
got that and the loft is almost complete

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.230 
got that and the loft is almost complete
got<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> add<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.630> more<00:01:09.840> pile<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.240> lofting

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
got to add one more pile to the lofting

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.740 
got to add one more pile to the lofting
and<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.900> they'll<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.260> ready<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.909> we're

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
put two before it down each side of the

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.410 
put two before it down each side of the
wall<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:38.920> we've<00:01:39.100> only<00:01:39.340> got<00:01:39.550> one<00:01:39.580> more<00:01:39.910> left<00:01:40.240> to

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
wall so we've only got one more left to

to go
next<00:01:43.840> project<00:01:44.410> on<00:01:44.680> part<00:01:45.400> six<00:01:45.640> will<00:01:45.790> probably

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
next project on part six will probably

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.560 
next project on part six will probably
be<00:01:47.070> setting<00:01:48.070> up<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.490> walls<00:01:48.730> getting<00:01:49.150> them<00:01:49.330> set

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.550 
up and whatnot getting all that done so
yeah<00:01:55.060> that'll<00:01:55.420> be<00:01:55.510> next<00:01:55.690> overbilling<00:01:56.350> the

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
yeah that'll be next overbilling the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.650 
yeah that'll be next overbilling the
loft<00:01:56.800> or<00:01:57.070> finish<00:01:57.400> putting<00:01:57.730> the<00:01:57.880> loft<00:01:58.090> in<00:01:58.360> or

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
loft or finish putting the loft in or

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.070 
loft or finish putting the loft in or
getting<00:01:59.260> that<00:01:59.470> thing<00:01:59.680> squared<00:02:00.280> away<00:02:01.080> so

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
getting that thing squared away so

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.410 
getting that thing squared away so
