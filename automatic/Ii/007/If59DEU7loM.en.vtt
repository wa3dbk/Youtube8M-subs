 for who has precatórios in the test of three months the dollar 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.089

 what you do in your English course those questions concerning the 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.710
 is a tactical voice transformation active passive evidence 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.759
 in direct discourse for indirect discourse 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:28.749
 the accumulation 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.560
 they that you fill with it there may be something for it 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.670
 none of this cain 'vestibular' 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.050
 what does vestibular tumors of gleisi 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.050
 catch fish interpretation 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.420
 for you to interpret an English text 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.860
 we have some suggestions for some strategies that you can apply 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.520
 do 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.539
 None 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.060
 but I take the readings from pt 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.700
 the initial reading 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.330
 it would be a very superficial reading 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.920
 What we call English, he said. 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.190
 you know that 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.270
 I played for milan water with those kits before sinking 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.170
 This English game is called extinction. 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.500
 so I noticed growth in Aveiro I think I did 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.540
 the feeling of ideas is a superficial reading 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.240
 the joke 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.310
 in which you will acquire knowledge of the subject of p 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.930
 the target audience of the time 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.100
 What is the position of the author? 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.610
 the text is opinionated it is not 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.100
 text is a problem is a 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.740
 terror a charge 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.970
 a joke 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.880
 all this you would do 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.880
 quickly doing one of those that 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.770
 second moment of our strategy for you to do wine tasting 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.060
 be 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.890
 discursive or many freshness you should read the questions 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.859
 steps also that they want 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.710
 I think top issues are offensive or multiple choice 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.330
 you should give a lot of questions to know what the examiner 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.609
 What do you have to do about pec? 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:16.639
 from there you go to the third step 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.639
 in the third stage the club will read the first question 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.259
 ibahia 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.089
 group maybe to look for answers 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:28.989
 this return to the country and this one this more thorough reading of the fish 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.749
 but says that neither 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:35.169
 phone is that machine 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.369
 law 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.819
 and translate to the computer 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.819
 the new photo the fish 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.560
 by law and in detail 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.560
 and that your pulpit being a photo 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.709
 deepest of fish what now if you are looking for answers from the 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.529
 questions 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:02.989
 in that first moment that you did that m 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.969
 ie you read quickly 3 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:10.819
 you probably ran into words that you did not know 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.939
 expressions 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.219
 and they did not make sense to you and even a whole paragraph 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.759
 if you do not understand, right? 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.759
 this is normal it is natural that is not cause for panic 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.789
 Do you take the English test? 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:28.959
 do not expect to know everything 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.819
 What is expected is that you know how to compensate 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.129
 1 what do you know 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.679
 what you do not know 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:38.739
 of adoption 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.179
 I have here as an example 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:44.829
 the first paragraph of the text that fell in the federal university of Rio de Janeiro proves 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.869
 of 2010 the most recent 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:49.679
 daisy first stop 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:53.759
 meneguelli of the column shakespeare present in this sense 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:54.809
 Saudis 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:56.879
 in apricot when cláudio 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.489
 of kaletra painting 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.869
 even going to analyze with the people 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:06.339
 these goals have already sent my nets shelley face many deadlocks deadlock has a 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:07.709
 role the actress 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.639
 this shitty case the action shocked with customers about that first 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.469
 paragraph 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.299
 the examiner proposed a question 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.280
 the chain of texas boots and toninho in a chaotic world value xis samir 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.479
 imagine that you have not know the meaning of the word vacations 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.090
 My god, I got the first question. 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.960
 if you know all the rest 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.770
 and if you had at least general understanding in the first paragraph of the text 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.580
 you get sick able to answer this question 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.650
 just ask some basic questions 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.110
 singing 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.430
 do not guess 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.599
 maitê deducted meaning different 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:54.729
 come on 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.919
 what is different 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.879
 is an adjective or noun 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.449
 the unicaja of the square 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.280
 in the placement in the square and even because of the rs of the third person 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.189
 you realize that comes to mind is a duty 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:12.330
 if it is a government that has a subject 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.930
 the subject is 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.300
 in the year to the team 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.349
 if we remember the first paragraph 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.749
 now we have spoken institution 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:24.419
 of culture 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.409
 and says the first paragraph here when culture feels shy 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.800
 it extinguishes 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.740
 the lost 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.389
 It's as bad as the leg. 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.270
 after it caused by the explosion 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.270
 of a kind of origin 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:46.629
 Another thing that gives a good diet is the vertex borders 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.409
 the preposition does not 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.150
 from the idea of ​​origin 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.389
 when something different 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:53.960
 it went better 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.360
 Vera is close. 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.110
 What you conclude? 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.159
 has already reached the conclusion of part to deduct what it wants 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.129
 so tevez means this seems to sum up 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.129
 stylist 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.770
 then the examiner has to know 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.889
 according to the text what it means 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.889
 proculture disappears from the earth 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.580
 it is very clear that it is written clearly the first one for the fish 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.240
 The text compares the extinction of a 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.469
 with extinction 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:30.469
 a kind of hours 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:34.089
 What I'm trying to say is that you can 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:37.439
 What do you know 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.150
 to reduce what you do not know 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.939
 to the point of hiding 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:43.279
 clearly 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.729
 and accurately 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.139
 is a question proposed by a vestibular examiner 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.559
 sent by today was amazing and it's not just that
