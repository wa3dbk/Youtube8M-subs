00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
has a tremolo system in it for the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.599

that has a fixed bridge let me explain

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.099 
that has a fixed bridge let me explain
the<00:00:20.070> differences<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.910> as<00:00:21.630> far<00:00:21.900> as<00:00:21.990> what

the differences to you as far as what

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.019 
the differences to you as far as what
the<00:00:22.199> guitar<00:00:22.500> will<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:22.769> able<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.519> then

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the guitar will be able to do and then

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.790 
the guitar will be able to do and then
tell<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.800> construction

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
tell you some of the construction

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.109 
tell you some of the construction
techniques<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.580> are<00:00:26.670> going<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.849> differ

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
techniques that are going to differ

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.359 
techniques that are going to differ
between<00:00:27.689> these<00:00:27.840> two<00:00:27.990> guitars<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:29.070> guitar

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
between these two guitars the guitar

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.589 
between these two guitars the guitar
that<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:29.640> holding<00:00:29.760> right<00:00:30.060> now<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.269> what's

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
that I'm holding right now is what's

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.500 
that I'm holding right now is what's
commonly<00:00:31.109> referred<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.470> as<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> tremolo<00:00:32.279> guitar

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
commonly referred to as a tremolo guitar

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.209 
commonly referred to as a tremolo guitar
that<00:00:33.510> means<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> bridge<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:35.040> whole

of this guitar you're gonna see that

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.490 
of this guitar you're gonna see that
when<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.910> build<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.210> tremolo<00:01:00.600> guitar<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:01.230> only

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
when you build a tremolo guitar not only

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.950 
when you build a tremolo guitar not only
do<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.340> route<00:01:02.670> through<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.449> body<00:01:03.660> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
do you have to route through the body to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.289 
do you have to route through the body to
put<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> block<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.760> you'll<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
put the block in but that you'll have to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.380 
put the block in but that you'll have to
route<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.689> some<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> back<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.560> well<00:01:08.299> to<00:01:09.299> be

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
route out some of the back as well to be

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.719 
route out some of the back as well to be
able<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.630> put<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> springs<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.729> control

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
able to put the springs and the control

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.580 
able to put the springs and the control
claw<00:01:12.060> which<00:01:12.450> holds<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> end<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.260> springs

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
claw which holds the end of the springs

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.340 
claw which holds the end of the springs
into<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.460> back<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> guitar<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.630> there's

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
into the back of the guitar so there's

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.320 
into the back of the guitar so there's
going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.770> limit<00:01:17.159> at<00:01:17.280> some<00:01:17.549> point<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.030> how

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
going to be a limit at some point of how

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.109 
going to be a limit at some point of how
thin<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.290> build<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> guitar<00:01:19.950> before<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
thin you can build a guitar before the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.050 
thin you can build a guitar before the
pickup<00:01:21.600> spaces<00:01:22.229> actually<00:01:22.640> emerge<00:01:23.640> through

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
pickup spaces actually emerge through

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.399 
pickup spaces actually emerge through
the<00:01:24.240> back<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> guitar<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> tremolo

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the back of the guitar in the tremolo

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.929 
the back of the guitar in the tremolo
space<00:01:25.860> that's<00:01:26.250> something<00:01:26.580> you'll<00:01:26.700> need<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
space that's something you'll need to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.760 
space that's something you'll need to
keep<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.270> mind<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:27.780> you'd<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.740> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
keep in mind if you'd like to have a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.249 
keep in mind if you'd like to have a
guitar<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.280> sustain<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:29.970> possible<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:31.229> can

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
guitar that sustain as possible you can

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.100 
guitar that sustain as possible you can
actually<00:01:31.560> build<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.430> set<00:01:33.119> bridge<00:01:33.720> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
actually build one with a set bridge a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.749 
actually build one with a set bridge a
hardtail<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.130> its<00:01:35.310> called

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
hardtail as its called

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.670 
hardtail as its called
