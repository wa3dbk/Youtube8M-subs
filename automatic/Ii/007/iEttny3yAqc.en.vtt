00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.219
 we dieticians are very excited about 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.349
 healthy foods and one of those 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.619
 we wish they were consumed more often is 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.570
 definitely the fish many people though 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.970
 they tell me they don't like the taste of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.160
 fish or who do not know how to cook it 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.560
 many have never gone beyond one 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.010
 tuna salad or chopsticks 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.590
 fish 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.750
 if so for you it may be that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.000
 you have never eaten fish 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.000
 really fresh I cooked like it 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.840
 I must instead assure you that it is worthwhile 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.030
 try out 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.219
 not just because fish is good but 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.890
 also because it is quick and simple to 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.020
 prepare with regards to flavor 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.660
 there are varieties that know a little more than 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.610
 fish of others but there are fish from 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.820
 more delicate taste than they deserve 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.610
 be tried halibut cod and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.579
 tilapia for example are some of the fish 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.190
 with a more delicate taste also matters 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.220
 consistency some people do not eat 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.020
 fish just for the consistency there is ad 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.210
 example those who do not like soft meat 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.970
 like that of sole despite 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.310
 have a very delicate taste in these 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.560
 cases a more compact and dry fish 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.650
 like the lampuga may turn out more 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 strangely appreciated when the fish is 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.930
 really fresh knows less about fish when 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.930
 choose fresh fish meat must 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.509
 appear firm and shiny and fish like 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.329
 the fish shop must also have an odor 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.360
 slightly salty of sea not the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.310
 typical piercing fish smell 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.470
 ask the seller what the fish are 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.600
 fresher and tell them yours 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.759
 preferences can recommend the varieties 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.430
 best and often give you also 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.399
 advice on how to prepare them for weight 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.159
 fresh should be cooked within 24 hours 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.680
 so buy it the same day in 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.930
 which you intend to prepare also dates 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.210
 look at the frozen food counter the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.670
 freshly caught fish is subjected to 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.590
 a rapid abatement process e 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.560
 therefore it maintains taste and properties 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.479
 nutritional 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.970
 but there without the consistency appears 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.069
 too affected it will surprise you 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.800
 to know that it is not necessary to thaw 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.170
 the fish before cooking the fillets of 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.450
 frozen fish can be cooked at 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.730
 grilled or pan-fried oven 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.440
 nothing easier to take out the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.030
 fish from the package pass it 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.910
 briefly under cold water for 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.200
 remove ice crystals 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.930
 dry it and it is ready to be 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.880
 cooked one of the simplest methods for 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.019
 cooking fish is the burn in 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.330
 cooking pan 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.760
 spray cooking oil in the kitchen 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.350
 pan and heat it up 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.930
 medium-high flame 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.810
 pour a little olive oil salt and pepper 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.299
 on the fish and scalded it in the hot pan 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.489
 so far, turn it over on one side 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.830
 cover the pan and continue the 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.250
 cooking generally for about ten 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.950
 minutes 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.569
 no need to add liquids 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.299
 before covering the pan 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.400
 but if you want you can do it a little juice 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.030
 of lemon or white wine can do 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.610
 wonders 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.860
 add a little spicy sauce and 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.620
 you will get a great filling for yours 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.870
 fish tacos fish fillets 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.000
 can also be baked or 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.100
 on the grill in any way 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.019
 check that the fish is ready 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.780
 cooked putting a fork in the 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:26.109
 thicker part the meat must be 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.850
 compact opaque and brittle also dates 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.420
 look at the products department in 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.940
 box 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.079
 you can try making medallions of 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.359
 salmon 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.639
 add to the crumbled bread of the bread 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.489
 dried a beaten egg of the onion 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:41.380
 informed cubes of cooked medallions 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.870
 grilled and placed in a sandwich with 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.799
 tomato lettuce can make them change their mind 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.799
 on the fish
