deceptive were displayed inside the fMRI

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.940 
deceptive were displayed inside the fMRI
and<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.600> cognitive<00:01:15.140> process<00:01:15.590> during<00:01:15.800> the

later<00:01:18.260> analyzed<00:01:18.799> we<00:01:19.700> saw<00:01:19.940> that<00:01:20.180> there<00:01:20.360> were

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
later analyzed we saw that there were

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.890 
later analyzed we saw that there were
really<00:01:20.690> two<00:01:20.990> stages<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:22.130> processing<00:01:22.900> involved

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
really two stages of processing involved

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.380 
really two stages of processing involved
when<00:01:24.500> people<00:01:24.830> are<00:01:24.920> seeing<00:01:25.190> these<00:01:25.430> these

potentially<00:01:27.020> deceptive<00:01:27.530> ads<00:01:27.710> in<00:01:28.010> the<00:01:28.549> first
