00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
hyper scan gives it a run for its money

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.030 
hyper scan gives it a run for its money
it's<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.450> hyper<00:00:30.750> scan<00:00:31.320> which<00:00:31.620> looks<00:00:31.920> like

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
it's the hyper scan which looks like

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920 
it's the hyper scan which looks like
something<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.580> Batman<00:00:33.270> would<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.660> thrown

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
something that Batman would have thrown

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.690 
something that Batman would have thrown
out<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.410> Batcave<00:00:34.920> because<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.550> was

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
out of the Batcave because it was

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.080 
out of the Batcave because it was
obsolete<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:38.730> when<00:00:38.970> it<00:00:39.000> was

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
obsolete and it is it was when it was

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.410 
obsolete and it is it was when it was

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.060 
massive software library of 5 games I
really<00:00:51.540> think<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.900> was<00:00:52.110> designed<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.920> be

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
really think this was designed to be

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.860 
really think this was designed to be
something<00:00:53.489> else<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> at<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.269> last<00:00:54.480> minute

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
something else and at the last minute

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.530 
something else and at the last minute
turned<00:00:55.230> into<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.500> video<00:00:55.710> game<00:00:55.860> console<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.820> mean

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
turned into a video game console I mean

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.810 
turned into a video game console I mean
look<00:00:57.690> at<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.019> it's<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.409> what<00:00:59.339> the<00:00:59.460> hell<00:00:59.640> is

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
look at it it's like a what the hell is

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.880 
look at it it's like a what the hell is
this<00:01:00.089> it<00:01:00.720> sucks<00:01:01.110> at<00:01:01.290> everything

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
this it sucks at everything

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.680 
this it sucks at everything
it<00:01:02.460> doesn't<00:01:02.850> even<00:01:03.030> sit<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> table

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it doesn't even sit on the table

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.170 
it doesn't even sit on the table
properly<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.500> figured<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.100> out<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.430> 1977

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
properly they figured that out in 1977

normally<00:01:12.300> I<00:01:12.330> don't<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.720> say<00:01:12.990> outright<00:01:13.440> that
