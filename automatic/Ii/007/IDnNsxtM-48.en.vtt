00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:14.362
 I'm happy 

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:15.913
 - You were the youngest at the table. 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 Were you surprised to get here at such a young age? 

00:00:29.754 --> 00:00:31.754
 No, practically every year someone new participates 

00:00:33.312 --> 00:00:35.312
 Last year we even had one at the table 

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:38.737
 I do not think being new is a bad thing 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.719
 I do not think it's bad, I think it's really good 

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:49.085
 - How did you feel about being at the final table? 

00:00:49.814 --> 00:00:51.814
 Sitting at the final table? 

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:57.833
 I thought I'd be more nervous. 

00:00:57.833 --> 00:00:59.413
 The first time I sat down 

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:01.914
 I was trembling a little 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.060
 but as soon as I started playing 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.954
 and I was doing well 

00:01:05.954 --> 00:01:07.133
 I started to relax 

00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:09.854
 and it was just me playing Poker the same way I do in my house 

00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:11.855
 "What does money mean to you?" 

00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:15.013
 Money is not the most important 

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:18.321
 I've been in games of the same value so 

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:19.895
 it's not that much money if I compare 

00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:24.334
 but, I do not know, I was calm about money 

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.252
 and I'm cool now 

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:28.435
 "What's next for you?" 

00:01:28.873 --> 00:01:30.873
 I do not know! 

00:01:33.073 --> 00:01:35.073
 Now it's time to party, I think 

00:01:35.414 --> 00:01:37.414
 and then we will see 

00:01:37.414 --> 00:01:38.733
 I'll probably take a break 

00:01:38.893 --> 00:01:40.893
 next month I will not do anything, just enjoy 

00:01:43.553 --> 00:01:45.553
 and then I'll think better what to do 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.060
 Two guys got a big stack very early 

00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:52.733
 and that made you short stack take a step back 

00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:54.194
 and changed all the dynamics of the game 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.566
 What did you think of this? 

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:00.519
 Yes, the two big ones 

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.193
 This was too bad for me. 

00:02:02.193 --> 00:02:03.495
 I was medium stack 

00:02:04.813 --> 00:02:06.813
 so I could not play as comfortably as I wanted 

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:10.028
 They put a lot of pressure on 

00:02:10.028 --> 00:02:11.233
 especially the Van Hoof 

00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:14.516
 he put a lot of pressure and played really well 

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:17.634
 I did not find any chance to do the same with him 

00:02:20.158 --> 00:02:22.158
 I was playing normally, I did not find an opportunity 

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:26.957
 And yes, the bick stack was high 

00:02:28.394 --> 00:02:30.394
 and the medium stack folded because 

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:34.533
 it was very bad for us 

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:36.455
 have to pay such high values 

00:02:49.193 --> 00:02:51.193
 Then they told me it was a bad bet because they played like this. 

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:54.433
 I played with great players. 

00:02:54.793 --> 00:02:56.793
 I think they are the best in the world. 

00:02:57.433 --> 00:02:59.433
 and they told me it was a very close pot 

00:03:19.973 --> 00:03:21.973
 but I decided to go through this line 

00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:24.653
 and it's not something I regret or something that would do differently 

00:03:24.653 --> 00:03:26.054
 I think it was a good move 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.059
 and the people who said it was a bad move, I think they're wrong 

00:03:34.993 --> 00:03:36.993
 Affects me, affects everyone 

00:03:36.993 --> 00:03:38.904
 but at the same time creates a dynamic 

00:03:39.214 --> 00:03:41.214
 because everyone knows what others are doing 

00:03:48.553 --> 00:03:50.553
 It's good to know what others are doing. 

00:03:50.553 --> 00:03:52.396
 if they are playing aggressively 

00:03:52.396 --> 00:03:53.613
 Who is bluffing? 

00:03:54.113 --> 00:03:56.113
 and is an interesting dynamic 

00:03:58.074 --> 00:04:00.074
 -You did not show up in the November Nines interview. 

00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:01.733
 I apologize for this! 

00:04:07.614 --> 00:04:09.614
 I guess so 

00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:12.491
 I know I do not have any kind of pressure 

00:04:13.613 --> 00:04:15.613
 I can relax and feel good 

00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:17.693
 I'm happy with the way I played 

00:04:18.774 --> 00:04:20.774
 And tonight we're going to have fun, for sure.
