here so I can demonstrate this king arms
tube<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.719> really<00:00:58.020> good<00:00:58.230> because<00:00:58.469> not<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
tube is really good because not like the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.900 
tube is really good because not like the
other<00:00:59.789> buffer<00:01:00.329> tubes<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.609> you<00:01:02.609> know<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
other buffer tubes this one you know the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.850 
other buffer tubes this one you know the
screw<00:01:03.210> comes<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.870> little<00:01:03.989> closer<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
screw comes in a little closer to the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.190 
screw comes in a little closer to the
tube<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.339> there's<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:05.790> hollow<00:01:06.119> inside<00:01:06.420> you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
tube so there's more hollow inside you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.130 
tube so there's more hollow inside you
can<00:01:07.380> put<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> battery<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.549> stage<00:01:09.140> this

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
can put the battery in it so stage this

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.530 
can put the battery in it so stage this
more<00:01:10.380> pretty<00:01:10.650> much<00:01:10.830> fit<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:12.360> just

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
more pretty much fit in there but just

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.590 
more pretty much fit in there but just
