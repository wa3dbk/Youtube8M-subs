you're throwing you want to make sure
that<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.809> actual<00:01:01.199> blade<00:01:01.770> edge<00:01:02.100> sharp<00:01:02.609> edge<00:01:02.760> is

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
that the actual blade edge sharp edge is

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.960 
that the actual blade edge sharp edge is
facing<00:01:03.449> towards<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.049> whenever<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.559> throw<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
edge of the blade has a greater chance

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.630 
edge of the blade has a greater chance
of<00:01:13.530> hitting<00:01:13.740> whatever<00:01:14.159> you're<00:01:14.280> throwing<00:01:14.430> it

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
at so um try to try throwing it that way

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
at so um try to try throwing it that way
at<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.080> tree<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.560> then<00:01:19.650> try<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> other<00:01:20.430> way<00:01:20.580> see

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
at a tree and then try the other way see

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.789 
at a tree and then try the other way see
which<00:01:20.970> one<00:01:21.150> works<00:01:21.330> better<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.530> guarantee

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799

which one works better and I guarantee
it's<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.240> just

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it's going to be the one that I just

traditional gangsters tab and then
you're<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> flip<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.320> around<00:01:31.560> your

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
you're going to flip it around your

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.870 
you're going to flip it around your
finger<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.400> you're<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.090> throw<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.360> so

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
finger and you're going to throw it so

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.999 
finger and you're going to throw it so
to<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.180> trick<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:37.439> start<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:37.829> like

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
to do this trick you just start out like

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.940 
to do this trick you just start out like
that<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:40.049> you're<00:01:40.259> holding<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.680> like

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that so if you're holding it like

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.920 
that so if you're holding it like
regular<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.890> right<00:01:44.159> here<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.930> to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
regular and you go right here and to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.749 
regular and you go right here and to
flip<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.200> around<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.530> finger<00:01:46.799> or<00:01:47.610> you're

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
flip it around your finger or you're

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.050 
flip it around your finger or you're
going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.939> do<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.680> you're<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.939> take<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
going to do is you're going to take the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.429 
going to do is you're going to take the
left<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.720> order<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.170> palm<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.409> your

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
left like that in order the palm of your

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.429 
left like that in order the palm of your
hand<00:01:52.560> basically<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.520> then<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.170> same

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
hand basically and then in that same

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.499 
hand basically and then in that same
motion<00:01:55.680> you're<00:01:56.520> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> flip<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.299> knife

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
motion you're going to flip the knife

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.010 
motion you're going to flip the knife
around<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.920> finger<00:01:59.310> your<00:02:00.000> pointer<00:02:00.240> finger

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
around that finger your pointer finger

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.990 
around that finger your pointer finger
so<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:01.799> going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.009> flip<00:02:02.250> around<00:02:02.280> except

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
so it's going to flip around except

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.580 
so it's going to flip around except
you're<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.299> catch<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.659> at<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.869> blade<00:02:04.320> at

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
you're going to catch it at the blade at

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.709 
you're going to catch it at the blade at
the<00:02:04.680> end<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:04.979> plate<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.450> going<00:02:06.450> from<00:02:06.600> right

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
the end of the plate so going from right

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.420 
the end of the plate so going from right
here<00:02:07.640> good<00:02:08.929> pull<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.020> around<00:02:10.110> twist<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
here good pull it around twist it and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.520 
here good pull it around twist it and
you<00:02:12.360> won't<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> worry<00:02:13.170> about

you won't have to worry about
any<00:02:13.620> other<00:02:13.770> fingers<00:02:14.069> because<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> momentum

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
any other fingers because the momentum

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.100 
any other fingers because the momentum
should<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.209> carry<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.540> around<00:02:15.600> your<00:02:15.840> finger

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
of about three-quarters down the handle

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.180 
of about three-quarters down the handle
maybe<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:22.950> should<00:02:23.610> get<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.760> good<00:02:24.470> twist<00:02:25.470> or

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
flip so it's going is going to flip
