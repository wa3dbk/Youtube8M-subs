00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.950
 hey people I will shut your wall I 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.950
 street show 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.720
 the most important requirement for the 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.490
 post is the pope in which you should 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.050
 First of all, I already have it 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.830
 a tutorial made if it's not already 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.180
 I've trained the first time 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.680
 her already well on it you who is 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.180
 also good for the slow motion 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.500
 but not necessarily one 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.150
 assumption you can also only in 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.559
 learn bristle and then join the team 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.360
 the tricks are about the same weight 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.860
 I would say the technique when rolling 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.530
 am almost the same as the palm 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.600
 There is only one big spin for parking 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.309
 difference that is that you are the right one 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.260
 if I do not have the left now 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.379
 right hand no longer next to the left 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.180
 have but over the left take if 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.870
 you want to go right then exactly 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.399
 the other way 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.590
 then you take the left hand over the 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.570
 Right turns your word over the 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.129
 lower hand that supports you in the process 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.270
 wall with the upper hand it gives you 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.780
 a little one just as well as the 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.780
 palm spin 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.740
 when usb you run slightly diagonally on the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.409
 wall and jump with a gap 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.119
 in front of the wall that you roughly with 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.180
 the outstretched poor 's wall 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.570
 The downturn would be affected by this 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.570
 both legs 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.210
 important is that the distance to 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.920
 wall is not too big 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.360
 so that you also really nice pressure on 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.070
 you can bring the wall with your hands 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.210
 and you can turn around your hands 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.470
 It is also important that they are on it 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.479
 pay attention to viticulture 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.679
 body side and not too close to the wall 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.119
 do not let her get caught 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.119
 Do not dress with your knees against the wall 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.680
 Of course there is also a wars movie 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.990
 again before exercise he can do 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.300
 before a garage wall tries that 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.790
 it for the first as already said the fans 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.860
 You should be able to find good then as 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.450
 second step you try the pope 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.190
 in ever higher walls 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.420
 to make it to the wall here 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.420
 which is about at breast height 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.410
 the third exercise is that you are 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.670
 first of all ne wall is not looking for it 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.180
 straight is a bit oblique 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.930
 so you have more space for the legs 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.640
 then you do not have that much fear 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.900
 with the wars against the wall too small 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.100
 or to hang with your feet 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.940
 train it there and then you can 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.940
 you answered it on one 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.659
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.700
 if you give me thumbs up 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.840
 thinks off your question in the comments 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.400
 I can write on that 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.200
 answer if you are not subscribed yet 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.060
 could like to do it then you see 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.200
 all my latest videos have fun 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.560
 while exercising first and until 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.560
 next time
