00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
rigors of this this season and I think

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.040 
rigors of this this season and I think
it's<00:00:38.180> in<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.290> last<00:00:39.500> two<00:00:39.650> games<00:00:39.860> of<00:00:40.070> that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
it's in the last two games of that

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.170 
it's in the last two games of that
that's<00:00:42.050> really<00:00:42.320> paid<00:00:42.590> off<00:00:42.620> me<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.520> sharp<00:00:43.820> open

that's really paid off me the sharp open
as<00:00:44.300> Collinsworth<00:00:44.840> won't<00:00:45.050> take<00:00:45.200> that<00:00:45.230> three

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
as Collinsworth won't take that three

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
good and then not only were they there

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.289 
good and then not only were they there
but<00:01:48.500> they<00:01:48.619> were<00:01:48.680> into<00:01:49.189> it<00:01:49.220> really<00:01:49.880> well<00:01:50.150> the

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
but they were into it really well the

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.630 
but they were into it really well the
students<00:01:50.689> were<00:01:50.780> terrific<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.470> my<00:01:52.220> guys<00:01:52.400> could

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
students were terrific and my guys could

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.390 
students were terrific and my guys could
feel<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.000> energy<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.869> lot<00:01:54.200> of<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.799> comes

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
feel the energy and a lot of that comes

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.399 
feel the energy and a lot of that comes
from<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.790> energy<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.810> building<00:01:56.930> from<00:01:57.320> the

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
from the energy in the building from the

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.829 
from the energy in the building from the
environment
