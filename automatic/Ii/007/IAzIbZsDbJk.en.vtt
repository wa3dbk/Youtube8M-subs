00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.780 

okay<00:00:04.799> now<00:00:04.950> that<00:00:05.009> we<00:00:05.250> know<00:00:05.370> how<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.520> open

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
okay now that we know how to open

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.099 
okay now that we know how to open
patterns<00:00:06.390> we're<00:00:06.540> going<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.750> talk<00:00:07.080> about

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
patterns we're going to talk about

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.140 
patterns we're going to talk about
editing<00:00:07.710> patterns<00:00:08.250> there's<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.940> couple

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
editing patterns there's a couple

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.930 
editing patterns there's a couple
different<00:00:09.269> ways<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.809> can<00:00:09.900> edit<00:00:10.080> patterns

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
different ways you can edit patterns

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.759 
different ways you can edit patterns
there's<00:00:11.940> easy<00:00:12.269> editing<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.410> then<00:00:13.559> there's

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
there's easy editing and then there's

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.340 
there's easy editing and then there's
more<00:00:14.009> advanced<00:00:14.429> editing<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.990> first<00:00:16.199> thing

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
more advanced editing so the first thing

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.480 
more advanced editing so the first thing
we're<00:00:16.470> going<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.619> do<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.949> click<00:00:17.250> on<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
we're going to do is click on the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.910 
we're going to do is click on the
pattern<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.970> we<00:00:18.090> want<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.630> edit<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.260> then

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
pattern that we want to edit and then

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.279 
pattern that we want to edit and then
for<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> easy<00:00:20.910> editing<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.750> use<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
for the easy editing we can use the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.490 
for the easy editing we can use the
resize<00:00:22.740> editor<00:00:23.160> tool<00:00:23.340> which<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.789> here<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.500> as

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
resize editor tool which is here and as

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.589 
resize editor tool which is here and as
you<00:00:25.650> notice<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.400> pattern<00:00:26.939> automatically

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
you notice the pattern automatically

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.870 
you notice the pattern automatically
zooms<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.380> object<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:29.760> that

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
zooms to the object you can do that

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.910 
zooms to the object you can do that
manually<00:00:30.300> also<00:00:30.750> with<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> zoom<00:00:31.320> object<00:00:31.769> tool

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
manually also with the zoom object tool

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.810 
manually also with the zoom object tool
here<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.410> errors<00:00:34.739> basically<00:00:35.160> show<00:00:35.760> you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
here so the errors basically show you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.000 
here so the errors basically show you
where<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.360> modify<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> pattern<00:00:37.770> either

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
where you can modify the pattern either

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.610 
where you can modify the pattern either
on<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.760> left<00:00:39.680> right<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:40.950> bottom<00:00:41.760> edge<00:00:42.379> in<00:00:43.379> most

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
on the left right or bottom edge in most

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.410 
on the left right or bottom edge in most
cases<00:00:43.829> people<00:00:44.070> want<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.760> just<00:00:44.940> modify<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
cases people want to just modify the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.600 
cases people want to just modify the
bottom<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.140> shorter<00:00:46.559> or<00:00:46.590> longer<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.340> we'll

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
bottom to be shorter or longer so we'll

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.209 
bottom to be shorter or longer so we'll
just<00:00:47.760> click<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> arrow<00:00:48.360> down<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:50.070> can

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
just click on the arrow down and you can

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.220 
just click on the arrow down and you can
see<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> purple<00:00:50.910> line<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> original<00:00:52.050> and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
see the purple line is the original and

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.670 
see the purple line is the original and
the<00:00:53.070> new<00:00:53.309> line<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.059> below<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.649> we

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the new line is just below that so if we

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.799 
the new line is just below that so if we
wanted<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> bring<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> inside<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.449> line

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
wanted to bring it inside that line

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.010 
wanted to bring it inside that line
we'll<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.170> press<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:59.309> arrow<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.899> you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
we'll just press the up arrow and you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.389 
we'll just press the up arrow and you
can<00:01:01.140> see<00:01:01.320> how<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> pattern<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.070> continues

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
can see how the pattern that continues

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.100 
can see how the pattern that continues
to<00:01:02.820> shrink<00:01:03.180> inward<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.619> setting<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
to shrink inward the setting for the

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.850 
to shrink inward the setting for the
Nestea<00:01:07.110> movement<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.770> under<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.189> Tools<00:01:08.549> menu

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
Nestea movement is under the Tools menu

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.890 
Nestea movement is under the Tools menu
under<00:01:10.860> options<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.299> want<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.659> click

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
under options and then you want to click

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.520 
under options and then you want to click
on<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> tools<00:01:13.619> tab<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.840> modify<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.170> easy

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
on the tools tab and modify the easy

editor<00:01:17.159> noise<00:01:17.490> distance<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.320> like<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.439> set<00:01:19.650> mine

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
editor noise distance I like to set mine

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.370 
editor noise distance I like to set mine
to<00:01:19.860> eighth<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.490> an<00:01:20.580> inch<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.200> every<00:01:22.200> click

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
to eighth of an inch so that every click

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.670 
to eighth of an inch so that every click
is<00:01:22.409> one<00:01:22.770> eighth<00:01:23.210> but<00:01:24.210> change<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.140> your<00:01:25.320> setting

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
is one eighth but change to your setting

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.030 
is one eighth but change to your setting
as<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.890> prefer<00:01:26.600> now<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.960> second<00:01:28.439> way<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> edit

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
as you prefer now the second way to edit

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.600 
as you prefer now the second way to edit
a<00:01:29.100> pattern<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.750> use<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.590> regular<00:01:32.009> editing

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
a pattern is to use the regular editing

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.520 
a pattern is to use the regular editing
mode<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> first<00:01:34.259> thing<00:01:34.439> I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
mode which is here so the first thing I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.200 
mode which is here so the first thing I
did<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:34.829> take<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.250> out<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.490> easy<00:01:35.640> editor<00:01:36.060> with

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
did was take it out of easy editor with

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.929 
did was take it out of easy editor with
the<00:01:36.240> layout<00:01:36.540> tool<00:01:36.930> arrow<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.799> then<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.790> get

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the layout tool arrow and then to get

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.420 
the layout tool arrow and then to get
into<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.479> advanced<00:01:39.960> editor<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.470> vector<00:01:41.009> edit

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
into the advanced editor is vector edit

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.889 
into the advanced editor is vector edit
node<00:01:41.670> tool<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.210> I'll<00:01:42.360> click<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.750> yellow

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
node tool so I'll click the yellow

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.590 
node tool so I'll click the yellow
pencil<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.820> see<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> multiple

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
pencil and you can see the multiple

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.830 
pencil and you can see the multiple
nodes<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.470> screen<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
nodes on the screen so if we want to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.240 
nodes on the screen so if we want to
take<00:01:49.049> out<00:01:49.259> nodes<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.799> take<00:01:50.100> out

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
take out nodes we can take out

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.149 
take out nodes we can take out
individual<00:01:50.909> nodes<00:01:51.180> by<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.720> zooming<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
individual nodes by just zooming in and

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.219 
individual nodes by just zooming in and
double<00:01:53.700> clicking<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.540> just<00:01:54.720> double<00:01:54.960> click<00:01:55.140> on

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
double clicking so just double click on

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.639 
double clicking so just double click on
the<00:01:55.320> node<00:01:55.530> until<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.340> delete<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:58.530> you

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
the node until it delete and then you

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.730
