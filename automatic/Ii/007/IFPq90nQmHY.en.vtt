how do you think come about well we've

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.870 
how do you think come about well we've
been<00:00:37.410> putting<00:00:37.710> people<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> top<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
been putting people to the top of the

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.530 
been putting people to the top of the
mountain<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.420> 50<00:00:39.720> years<00:00:40.700> clean<00:00:41.700> efficient

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
mountain for 50 years clean efficient

mountain for 50 years clean efficient
all<00:00:43.200> about<00:00:43.650> fast<00:00:44.070> yeah

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
all about fast yeah

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.910 
all about fast yeah
pulling<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.720> heavy<00:00:45.870> load<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.380> to<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
pulling that and heavy load up to the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.970 
pulling that and heavy load up to the
top<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.330> down<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.720> other<00:00:48.750> side<00:00:49.080> gets

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
top it's going down the other side gets

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.960 
top it's going down the other side gets
your<00:00:50.070> hackles<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.760> about<00:00:51.000> 20<00:00:51.330> years<00:00:51.480> ago<00:00:51.600> I

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
your hackles up so about 20 years ago I

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.570 
your hackles up so about 20 years ago I
got<00:00:53.970> curious<00:00:54.240> about<00:00:54.660> these<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:56.190> brakes<00:00:56.430> that

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
got curious about these the brakes that

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.520 
got curious about these the brakes that
were<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:56.880> market<00:00:57.110> because<00:00:58.110> I<00:00:58.320> was<00:00:58.440> getting

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
were on the market because I was getting

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.290 
were on the market because I was getting
performance<00:00:59.130> complaints<00:00:59.610> and<00:00:59.700> I<00:00:59.760> found<00:01:00.060> out

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
performance complaints and I found out

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.060 
performance complaints and I found out
that<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.810> brakes<00:01:01.050> were<00:01:01.230> restrictive<00:01:01.890> when

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that the brakes were restrictive when

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.860 
that the brakes were restrictive when
they<00:01:02.190> were<00:01:02.250> open<00:01:02.700> the<00:01:03.390> exhaust<00:01:03.690> brake

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
they were open the exhaust brake

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.740 
they were open the exhaust brake
mechanical<00:01:04.439> yes<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.549> designed<00:01:05.820> some<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
mechanical yes so I designed some that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.719 
mechanical yes so I designed some that
actually<00:01:07.170> helped<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.920> when<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.130> were<00:01:08.219> open

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
actually helped you when you were open

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.819 
actually helped you when you were open
whoa<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.859> braked<00:01:11.899> we<00:01:12.899> pretty<00:01:13.289> much<00:01:13.380> took<00:01:13.679> the

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
whoa and braked we pretty much took the

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.700 
whoa and braked we pretty much took the
market<00:01:14.189> back<00:01:14.429> in<00:01:14.460> o2<00:01:14.869> we<00:01:15.869> started<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.289> get<00:01:16.469> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
market back in o2 we started to get a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.940 
market back in o2 we started to get a
lot<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.369> electronics<00:01:18.149> and<00:01:18.770> variable<00:01:19.770> geometry

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
lot of electronics and variable geometry

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.279 
lot of electronics and variable geometry
turbochargers<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.119> thought<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:22.259> know

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
turbochargers and I thought you know

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.649 
turbochargers and I thought you know
what<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.829> think<00:01:23.609> I<00:01:23.789> think<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.270> control<00:01:24.539> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
what I think I think I can control that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.169 
what I think I think I can control that
turbocharger<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.350> geometry<00:01:25.890> making<00:01:26.609> that<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
turbocharger of geometry making that the

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.020 
turbocharger of geometry making that the
brake<00:01:27.420> do<00:01:28.289> down<00:01:28.590> hills<00:01:28.890> cruise<00:01:29.490> control<00:01:29.880> with

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
brake do down hills cruise control with

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.209 
brake do down hills cruise control with
this<00:01:30.149> thing<00:01:30.329> that's<00:01:30.840> great<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.530> was<00:01:31.679> original

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
this thing that's great it was original

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:33.770 
this thing that's great it was original
enough<00:01:32.460> for<00:01:32.609> me<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.789> get<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.969> US<00:01:33.240> patent<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.719> it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
enough for me to get a US patent on it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.419 
enough for me to get a US patent on it
well<00:01:34.439> that's<00:01:34.530> great<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.069> we<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
well that's great so now we have the

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.730 
well that's great so now we have the
bank<00:01:35.609> speed<00:01:35.909> break<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.109> pretty<00:01:37.319> easy<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
bank speed break this is pretty easy to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.669 
bank speed break this is pretty easy to

know what you can manage with this well

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.809 
know what you can manage with this well
when<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.950> thought<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.400> through<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:14.760> thought

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
when I thought this through I thought

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.270 
when I thought this through I thought
okay<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.329> can<00:02:16.599> manage<00:02:17.079> the<00:02:17.409> position<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.159> the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
okay I can manage the position of the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.360 
okay I can manage the position of the
restriction<00:02:18.999> which<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.950> variable

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
restriction which is a the variable

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.250 
restriction which is a the variable
geometry<00:02:21.579> and<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.090> turbocharger<00:02:22.719> okay<00:02:23.049> that

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
geometry and the turbocharger okay that

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.660 
geometry and the turbocharger okay that
makes<00:02:23.439> the<00:02:23.560> back<00:02:23.709> pressure<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.219> makes<00:02:24.489> the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
makes the back pressure that makes the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.509 
makes the back pressure that makes the
back<00:02:24.819> pressure<00:02:25.120> right<00:02:25.420> if<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.439> vary<00:02:26.499> it<00:02:27.129> I<00:02:27.340> could

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
back pressure right if I vary it I could

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.420 
back pressure right if I vary it I could
control<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.969> speed<00:02:28.269> down<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.689> hill<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.469> to

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
control the speed down the hill and to

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.849 
control the speed down the hill and to
really<00:02:30.760> amp<00:02:30.999> that<00:02:31.269> up<00:02:31.329> and<00:02:31.810> give<00:02:32.200> us<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.439> lot<00:02:32.709> of

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
really amp that up and give us a lot of

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.740 
really amp that up and give us a lot of
braking<00:02:33.219> effort<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.670> want<00:02:33.939> to<00:02:34.030> back<00:02:34.299> shift<00:02:34.599> the

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
the transmission I want to change the

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.119 
the transmission I want to change the
angle<00:02:51.129> so<00:02:52.000> I'm<00:02:52.180> running<00:02:52.389> this<00:02:52.719> math<00:02:53.129> that's

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
angle so I'm running this math that's

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.250 
angle so I'm running this math that's
looking<00:02:54.549> at<00:02:55.000> how<00:02:55.030> fast<00:02:55.629> your<00:02:55.840> speed<00:02:56.109> is

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
looking at how fast your speed is

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.409 
looking at how fast your speed is
changing<00:02:56.680> it's<00:02:57.189> adjusting<00:02:57.790> all<00:02:58.000> three<00:02:58.329> of

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:58.419 
changing it's adjusting all three of

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.839 
changing it's adjusting all three of
these<00:02:58.510> things<00:02:58.840> simultaneously<00:02:59.849> that's

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
these things simultaneously that's

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.610 
these things simultaneously that's
incorrect<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.889> be<00:03:03.040> doing<00:03:03.790> all<00:03:03.909> this<00:03:04.150> stuff

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
incorrect and to be doing all this stuff

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.229 
incorrect and to be doing all this stuff
in<00:03:05.620> no<00:03:05.799> way<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.069> could<00:03:06.370> manually<00:03:06.669> lock<00:03:07.030> and

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
in no way you could manually lock and

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.970 
in no way you could manually lock and
unlock<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.659> torque<00:03:07.900> converter<00:03:07.989> absolutely

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.599 
you want to know all about it hit spin
speed<00:03:22.659> brake<00:03:22.900> mm-hmm<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.949> it'll<00:03:24.280> give<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.519> a

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
speed brake mm-hmm and it'll give you a

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.119 
speed brake mm-hmm and it'll give you a
braking<00:03:25.000> percentage<00:03:25.599> trans<00:03:26.500> stamp<00:03:26.799> which<00:03:26.979> is

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
braking percentage trans stamp which is

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.909 
braking percentage trans stamp which is
nice<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.459> know<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.790> gear<00:03:28.030> you're<00:03:28.150> in<00:03:28.599> it<00:03:28.919> you

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
nice to know the gear you're in it you

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.069 
nice to know the gear you're in it you
could<00:03:30.040> select<00:03:30.250> TCC<00:03:30.939> lock<00:03:31.209> or<00:03:31.449> whatever<00:03:31.900> you

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
could select TCC lock or whatever you

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.229 
could select TCC lock or whatever you
want<00:03:32.349> that's<00:03:32.680> great<00:03:32.979> that's<00:03:33.579> absolutely<00:03:34.120> I

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
want that's great that's absolutely I

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.089 
want that's great that's absolutely I
know<00:03:34.449> you<00:03:34.569> can<00:03:34.780> control<00:03:35.139> a<00:03:35.169> lot<00:03:35.409> of<00:03:35.439> things<00:03:35.739> you

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
know you can control a lot of things you

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.589 
know you can control a lot of things you
know<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.370> parameters<00:03:36.879> these<00:03:36.970> engines<00:03:37.359> and<00:03:37.509> so

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
know the parameters these engines and so

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:38.969 
know the parameters these engines and so
on<00:03:37.750> you've<00:03:37.870> done<00:03:38.019> so<00:03:38.169> much<00:03:38.290> testing<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:38.829> work

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:38.979 
on you've done so much testing and work

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.159 
on you've done so much testing and work
on<00:03:39.189> them<00:03:39.340> yeah<00:03:39.790> well<00:03:40.120> one<00:03:40.329> thing<00:03:40.509> you<00:03:40.540> don't

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
on them yeah well one thing you don't

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.080 
on them yeah well one thing you don't
want<00:03:41.349> to<00:03:41.439> do<00:03:41.530> is<00:03:41.680> over<00:03:41.919> rev<00:03:42.129> the<00:03:42.250> engine<00:03:42.280> by

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
want to do is over rev the engine by

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.729 
want to do is over rev the engine by
back<00:03:43.299> shifting<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:43.930> we're<00:03:44.079> running<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.500> math

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
back shifting so we're running the math

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.830 
back shifting so we're running the math
so<00:03:45.579> we<00:03:45.729> know<00:03:45.879> we're<00:03:46.120> not<00:03:46.269> going<00:03:46.599> to<00:03:46.659> damage

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
so we know we're not going to damage

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.659 
so we know we're not going to damage
anything<00:03:47.259> yeah<00:03:47.829> as<00:03:47.919> you<00:03:48.009> go<00:03:48.129> down<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.459> hill

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
anything yeah as you go down the hill

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:49.860 
anything yeah as you go down the hill
tell<00:03:48.819> me<00:03:48.939> about<00:03:49.000> real-world<00:03:49.419> tests<00:03:49.659> to<00:03:49.750> know

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
tell me about real-world tests to know

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.939 
tell me about real-world tests to know
you<00:03:49.930> know<00:03:50.079> you've<00:03:50.199> got<00:03:50.319> all<00:03:50.349> this<00:03:50.560> nice<00:03:50.739> stuff

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
you know you've got all this nice stuff

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.469 
you know you've got all this nice stuff
in<00:03:51.099> the<00:03:51.189> research<00:03:51.489> but<00:03:51.519> when<00:03:52.329> you've<00:03:52.449> got

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:52.479 
in the research but when you've got

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.119 
in the research but when you've got
these<00:03:52.750> trucks<00:03:52.989> loaded<00:03:53.139> what<00:03:53.829> are<00:03:53.919> you<00:03:54.009> really

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
these trucks loaded what are you really

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.219 
these trucks loaded what are you really
do<00:03:54.340> in<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.489> real<00:03:54.699> world<00:03:54.909> well<00:03:55.120> that's<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:56.019> love

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
do in the real world well that's I love

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.050 
do in the real world well that's I love
real<00:03:56.500> will<00:03:56.680> real<00:03:57.189> world<00:03:57.489> that's<00:03:57.729> where<00:03:57.939> you

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
real will real world that's where you

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.319 
real will real world that's where you
drive<00:03:58.359> we<00:03:58.959> did<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.139> downhill<00:03:59.439> tests<00:04:00.219> a<00:04:00.400> 6%<00:04:01.389> grade

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
drive we did a downhill tests a 6% grade

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.679 
drive we did a downhill tests a 6% grade
18,000<00:04:04.329> 500<00:04:04.780> pounds<00:04:05.199> tow<00:04:06.099> haul<00:04:06.400> started<00:04:07.120> at<00:04:07.209> 55

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:07.689 
18,000 500 pounds tow haul started at 55

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.020 
18,000 500 pounds tow haul started at 55
miles<00:04:07.959> an<00:04:08.079> hour<00:04:08.199> with<00:04:08.379> the<00:04:08.469> stock<00:04:08.680> truck<00:04:09.030> when

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
miles an hour with the stock truck when

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.580 
miles an hour with the stock truck when
we<00:04:10.150> got<00:04:10.299> to<00:04:10.419> about<00:04:10.509> 78<00:04:10.900> miles<00:04:11.169> an<00:04:11.349> hour<00:04:11.439> the

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
we got to about 78 miles an hour the

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.229 
we got to about 78 miles an hour the
guys<00:04:11.739> lost<00:04:11.979> their<00:04:12.250> nerve<00:04:12.400> yeah

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
guys lost their nerve yeah

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.680 
guys lost their nerve yeah
so<00:04:13.449> that's<00:04:13.599> accelerating<00:04:15.269> we<00:04:16.269> put<00:04:16.509> on<00:04:16.659> a

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
so that's accelerating we put on a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.560 
so that's accelerating we put on a
competitive<00:04:17.789> mechanical<00:04:18.789> brakes<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.359> they

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
competitive mechanical brakes and they

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.050 
competitive mechanical brakes and they
slowed<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.259> but<00:04:20.919> still<00:04:21.250> you<00:04:21.609> you're

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
slowed you but still you you're

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.029 
slowed you but still you you're
accelerating<00:04:22.719> gradually<00:04:23.199> he<00:04:23.349> went<00:04:23.500> from<00:04:23.650> 55

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
accelerating gradually he went from 55

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.439 
accelerating gradually he went from 55
to<00:04:24.070> 63<00:04:24.760> miles<00:04:24.940> an<00:04:25.180> hour

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
to 63 miles an hour

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:29.430 
to 63 miles an hour
okay<00:04:26.320> in<00:04:26.500> one<00:04:26.710> mile<00:04:27.300> with<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.570> speed<00:04:28.870> brakes

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
okay in one mile with the speed brakes

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.270 
okay in one mile with the speed brakes
fifty-five<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:31.890> little<00:04:32.890> over<00:04:33.070> three

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
fifty-five and little over three

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.670 
fifty-five and little over three
quarters<00:04:33.430> of<00:04:33.640> a<00:04:33.730> mile<00:04:33.970> weed<00:04:34.840> back<00:04:35.080> shifted<00:04:35.530> you

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
quarters of a mile weed back shifted you

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.910 
quarters of a mile weed back shifted you
all<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.980> way<00:04:36.100> down<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.580> second<00:04:36.970> gear<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:38.350> you
