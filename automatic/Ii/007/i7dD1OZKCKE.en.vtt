00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:11.720 
people on boats are probably staring at

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.960 
people on boats are probably staring at
me<00:00:11.840> because<00:00:12.020> i<00:00:12.350> have<00:00:13.100> a<00:00:13.130> guitar<00:00:13.310> and<00:00:13.730> a<00:00:13.820> guitar

me because i have a guitar and a guitar
case<00:00:14.150> and<00:00:14.300> devoting<00:00:14.720> a<00:00:14.780> camera<00:00:15.110> on<00:00:15.290> the<00:00:15.860> front

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
case and devoting a camera on the front

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.710 
case and devoting a camera on the front
I'm<00:00:16.309> really<00:00:16.640> trusting<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:17.210> gorillapod<00:00:17.630> at

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
I'm really trusting the gorillapod at

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.270 
I'm really trusting the gorillapod at
the<00:00:17.780> moment<00:00:18.050> it's<00:00:18.590> good<00:00:18.740> not<00:00:18.890> going<00:00:19.039> to<00:00:19.100> end<00:00:19.220> up

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.280 
the moment it's good not going to end up

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.880 
the moment it's good not going to end up
in<00:00:19.370> the<00:00:19.460> water<00:00:19.750> so<00:00:20.750> yeah<00:00:21.289> I<00:00:21.470> thought<00:00:21.680> I'd<00:00:21.770> do

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
in the water so yeah I thought I'd do

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.080 
in the water so yeah I thought I'd do
another<00:00:22.100> little<00:00:22.430> installment<00:00:22.820> of<00:00:22.850> how<00:00:23.030> you

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
another little installment of how you

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.939 
another little installment of how you
can<00:00:23.450> start<00:00:23.869> to<00:00:23.990> compose<00:00:24.530> your<00:00:24.680> own<00:00:24.710> pieces

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
can start to compose your own pieces

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.010 
can start to compose your own pieces
this<00:00:25.550> one<00:00:25.730> actually<00:00:25.850> has<00:00:26.030> a<00:00:26.180> slightly<00:00:26.720> dual

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
this one actually has a slightly dual

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.160 
this one actually has a slightly dual
purpose<00:00:27.470> when<00:00:28.430> I<00:00:28.460> was<00:00:28.640> first<00:00:28.820> learning<00:00:29.000> I<00:00:29.750> was

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
purpose when I was first learning I was

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.599 
purpose when I was first learning I was
actually<00:00:30.320> having<00:00:30.500> lessons<00:00:30.740> with<00:00:31.010> Eric<00:00:31.340> Roche

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609 
actually having lessons with Eric Roche

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.420 
actually having lessons with Eric Roche
and<00:00:31.970> he<00:00:32.770> met<00:00:33.770> his<00:00:33.890> learning<00:00:34.160> how<00:00:34.220> to<00:00:34.280> do<00:00:34.340> the

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
and he met his learning how to do the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.979 
and he met his learning how to do the
curse<00:00:34.640> of<00:00:34.670> stuff<00:00:34.970> not<00:00:35.120> first<00:00:35.510> learning<00:00:35.720> time

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
curse of stuff not first learning time

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.650 
curse of stuff not first learning time
he<00:00:36.770> suggested<00:00:37.310> that<00:00:37.340> when<00:00:37.970> you<00:00:38.090> come<00:00:38.270> to<00:00:38.390> do<00:00:38.510> an

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
he suggested that when you come to do an

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.630 
he suggested that when you come to do an
arrangement<00:00:39.110> of<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.380> piece<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.160> baselines

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
arrangement of a piece the baselines

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.910 
arrangement of a piece the baselines
probably<00:00:41.300> about<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.720> best<00:00:41.750> place<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.649> start

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
probably about the best place to start

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.540 
probably about the best place to start
so<00:00:43.450> for<00:00:44.450> example<00:00:44.540> we<00:00:44.899> were<00:00:45.079> working<00:00:45.260> on<00:00:45.680> his

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
so for example we were working on his

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.760 
so for example we were working on his
arrangement<00:00:47.059> of<00:00:47.239> semester<00:00:47.989> teen<00:00:48.170> spirit<00:00:48.559> and

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
arrangement of semester teen spirit and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.729 
arrangement of semester teen spirit and
also<00:00:49.460> his<00:00:49.760> arrangement<00:00:50.300> of<00:00:50.480> she<00:00:51.410> drives<00:00:51.649> me

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
also his arrangement of she drives me

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.430 
also his arrangement of she drives me
crazy<00:00:51.890> now<00:00:52.850> in<00:00:52.969> those<00:00:53.059> arrangements<00:00:53.719> they<00:00:54.290> got

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
crazy now in those arrangements they got

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.290 
crazy now in those arrangements they got
a<00:00:54.469> really<00:00:54.829> really<00:00:54.950> strong<00:00:55.160> bassline<00:00:55.610> indeed

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
a really really strong bassline indeed

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.000 
a really really strong bassline indeed
teen<00:00:56.510> spirit<00:00:56.840> starts<00:00:57.170> off<00:00:57.260> basically<00:00:57.770> just

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
teen spirit starts off basically just

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.840 
teen spirit starts off basically just
with<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:58.579> baseline<00:00:59.149> and<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.390> harmonics<00:00:59.809> so

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
with the baseline and the harmonics so

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.950 
with the baseline and the harmonics so
what<00:01:01.850> I'm<00:01:01.940> going<00:01:02.030> to<00:01:02.090> suggest<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:02.690> if

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
what I'm going to suggest to you if

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.329 
what I'm going to suggest to you if
you're<00:01:03.140> composing<00:01:03.530> at<00:01:03.770> these<00:01:03.920> is<00:01:04.159> that

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
you're composing at these is that

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.890 
you're composing at these is that
perhaps<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:04.670> look<00:01:04.909> at<00:01:05.119> making<00:01:05.570> a<00:01:05.659> really

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
perhaps you look at making a really

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.510 
perhaps you look at making a really
solid<00:01:06.170> baseline<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:06.979> then<00:01:07.130> putting<00:01:07.400> the

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
solid baseline and then putting the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.600 
solid baseline and then putting the
mundelein<00:01:07.940> in<00:01:08.270> over<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:08.780> top<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:08.990> it<00:01:09.610> an

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
mundelein in over the top of it an

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.960 
mundelein in over the top of it an
example<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.210> this<00:01:11.270> in<00:01:11.659> a<00:01:12.409> modern<00:01:13.100> piece<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:13.940> I

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
example of this in a modern piece that I

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.820 
example of this in a modern piece that I
can<00:01:14.150> think<00:01:14.180> of<00:01:14.450> just<00:01:14.479> off<00:01:15.200> top<00:01:15.440> of<00:01:15.470> head<00:01:15.560> would

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
can think of just off top of head would

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.920 
can think of just off top of head would
be<00:01:15.979> baseline<00:01:16.520> for<00:01:16.670> kids<00:01:16.909> by<00:01:17.119> MGMT<00:01:17.540> which<00:01:17.689> just

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
be baseline for kids by MGMT which just

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:29.980 
be baseline for kids by MGMT which just
really<00:01:18.229> solid

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.590 

and<00:01:30.979> then<00:01:31.640> everything<00:01:31.850> else<00:01:32.000> comes<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.420> at<00:01:32.509> the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
and then everything else comes in at the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.270 
and then everything else comes in at the
top<00:01:32.750> of<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:32.990> now<00:01:33.560> personally<00:01:33.799> when<00:01:34.040> I<00:01:34.130> play

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
top of that now personally when I play

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.620 
top of that now personally when I play
that<00:01:34.430> I<00:01:34.460> do<00:01:34.549> a<00:01:34.670> little<00:01:34.820> variation<00:01:35.479> and

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
that I do a little variation and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.260 
that I do a little variation and
actually<00:01:36.380> make<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.770> baseline<00:01:37.220> drop<00:01:37.939> down

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
actually make the baseline drop down

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.389 
actually make the baseline drop down
rather<00:01:38.600> than<00:01:38.840> doing<00:01:39.049> this<00:01:39.950> movement<00:01:40.220> just

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
rather than doing this movement just

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.540 
rather than doing this movement just
here

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:02:01.950 

so<00:01:46.180> in<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.510> regiment<00:01:46.720> I<00:01:46.900> do<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:47.110> play<00:01:47.560> like<00:01:47.740> this

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.330 

who

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.410 

the<00:02:10.340> first<00:02:10.610> place<00:02:10.790> that<00:02:10.820> I<00:02:10.970> started<00:02:11.270> when<00:02:11.390> I

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
the first place that I started when I

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.930 
the first place that I started when I
was<00:02:11.450> looking<00:02:11.750> at<00:02:11.780> how<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:12.400> put<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.520> onto<00:02:13.640> just

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
was looking at how to put that onto just

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.870 
was looking at how to put that onto just
a<00:02:14.000> single<00:02:14.210> guitar<00:02:14.540> was<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.950> baseline<00:02:16.280> getting

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
a single guitar was the baseline getting

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.460 
a single guitar was the baseline getting
based<00:02:17.060> on<00:02:17.240> going<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.630> then<00:02:17.900> working<00:02:18.230> out<00:02:18.350> with

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
based on going and then working out with

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.660 
based on going and then working out with
the<00:02:18.500> monthly<00:02:18.860> walls<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.250> melody<00:02:19.370> just

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
the monthly walls and the melody just

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:29.760 
the monthly walls and the melody just
sticks<00:02:19.910> really<00:02:20.120> closely<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.810> scale<00:02:24.050> just

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.570 

etc<00:02:30.770> still<00:02:30.950> ran<00:02:31.070> around<00:02:31.160> I'm<00:02:31.370> gonna<00:02:31.430> do

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
etc still ran around I'm gonna do

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.550 
etc still ran around I'm gonna do
another<00:02:31.790> lesson<00:02:32.030> on<00:02:32.360> present<00:02:33.170> melody<00:02:33.380> lines

another lesson on present melody lines
but<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.800> give<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.070> rough<00:02:34.220> idea<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.520> what's

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
but I give you a rough idea of what's

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.990 
but I give you a rough idea of what's
going<00:02:34.820> on<00:02:35.060> just<00:02:35.150> there<00:02:35.330> in<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:37.010> guitar<00:02:37.400> piece<00:02:37.610> a

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
going on just there in a guitar piece a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.340 
going on just there in a guitar piece a
good<00:02:38.990> example<00:02:39.410> would<00:02:39.470> be<00:02:39.910> roundabout<00:02:40.930> by<00:02:41.930> Eric

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
good example would be roundabout by Eric

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.680 
good example would be roundabout by Eric
rush<00:02:42.530> which<00:02:42.830> starts<00:02:43.220> off<00:02:43.400> basically<00:02:43.880> just

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
rush which starts off basically just

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:52.570 
rush which starts off basically just
with<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.959> riff<00:02:45.740> on<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:46.250> base<00:02:46.400> drinks<00:02:51.580> awesome

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
with a riff on the base drinks awesome

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.370 
with a riff on the base drinks awesome
different<00:02:52.880> tune<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.050> just<00:02:54.200> loops

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
different tune and that just loops

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.810 
different tune and that just loops
around<00:02:54.500> obviously<00:02:54.980> he<00:02:55.100> doubles<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.520> up<00:02:55.580> then

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
around obviously he doubles it up then

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.240 
around obviously he doubles it up then
and<00:02:56.060> plays<00:02:56.300> on<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.690> D<00:02:56.870> string<00:02:56.900> just<00:02:57.830> here<00:02:58.070> as

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
and plays on the D string just here as

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.800 
and plays on the D string just here as
well<00:02:58.370> as<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.580> top<00:02:58.730> string<00:02:58.970> which<00:02:59.150> is<00:02:59.180> down

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
well as the top string which is down

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.670 
well as the top string which is down
tuned<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.560> d

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.080 

and<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:06.129> loops<00:03:06.310> around<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.790> then<00:03:06.909> you<00:03:07.000> get

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
and that loops around and then you get

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.330 
and that loops around and then you get
the<00:03:07.180> bass<00:03:07.299> drum<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.540> f'ing<00:03:07.780> coming<00:03:08.019> in<00:03:11.340> and

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
the bass drum and f'ing coming in and

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.300 
the bass drum and f'ing coming in and
that<00:03:12.670> just<00:03:12.849> goes<00:03:12.969> round<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.299> round<00:03:13.329> around<00:03:13.569> so

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
that just goes round and round around so

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.410 
that just goes round and round around so
quite<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.340> good<00:03:15.519> place<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.819> start<00:03:16.030> with<00:03:16.180> all<00:03:16.269> of

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
quite a good place to start with all of

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.339 
quite a good place to start with all of
this<00:03:16.540> will<00:03:16.959> be<00:03:17.079> just<00:03:17.319> finding<00:03:18.269> some<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.599> don't

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
this will be just finding some I don't

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.379 
this will be just finding some I don't
know<00:03:20.409> comfortable<00:03:21.010> area<00:03:21.219> to<00:03:21.459> work<00:03:21.609> in<00:03:21.879> I<00:03:22.030> find

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
know comfortable area to work in I find

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:23.759 
know comfortable area to work in I find
that<00:03:22.420> if<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.629> drop<00:03:22.810> down<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.109> a<00:03:23.139> d<00:03:23.349> it<00:03:23.650> makes

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
that if I drop down to a d it makes

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.229 
that if I drop down to a d it makes
basslines<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.459> lot<00:03:24.579> easier<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.909> do<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.180> you

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
basslines a lot easier to do and you

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.420 
basslines a lot easier to do and you
also<00:03:25.359> get<00:03:25.510> that<00:03:25.659> nice<00:03:25.810> rich<00:03:26.409> low<00:03:26.829> loner<00:03:27.069> and

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
also get that nice rich low loner and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.209 
also get that nice rich low loner and
the<00:03:27.579> tops<00:03:27.790> there<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.560> just<00:03:29.560> looking<00:03:29.980> through

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:30.219 
the tops there and just looking through

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.740 
the tops there and just looking through
sort<00:03:30.400> of<00:03:30.459> like<00:03:30.579> old<00:03:30.849> funk<00:03:31.120> songs<00:03:31.359> Michael

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
sort of like old funk songs Michael

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.349 
sort of like old funk songs Michael
Jackson<00:03:32.139> songs<00:03:32.639> disco<00:03:33.639> all<00:03:33.879> that<00:03:34.180> kind<00:03:34.329> of

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
Jackson songs disco all that kind of

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.030 
Jackson songs disco all that kind of
stuff<00:03:34.420> stuff<00:03:35.049> that<00:03:35.139> had<00:03:35.260> a<00:03:35.290> really<00:03:35.469> solid<00:03:35.769> base

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
stuff stuff that had a really solid base

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.710 
stuff stuff that had a really solid base
line<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:36.639> they<00:03:37.000> can<00:03:37.180> really<00:03:37.359> hear<00:03:37.569> the

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
line to it and they can really hear the

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.569 
line to it and they can really hear the
bassline<00:03:37.900> obviously<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:38.919> Quincy<00:03:39.370> Jones

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
bassline obviously so Quincy Jones

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.159 
bassline obviously so Quincy Jones
period<00:03:39.909> Michael<00:03:40.180> Jackson<00:03:40.450> is<00:03:40.510> perfect<00:03:40.959> that's

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
period Michael Jackson is perfect that's

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.780 
period Michael Jackson is perfect that's
because<00:03:41.439> it<00:03:41.560> all<00:03:41.799> revolves<00:03:42.370> around<00:03:42.579> that

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
because it all revolves around that

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.330 
because it all revolves around that
baseline<00:03:43.239> that<00:03:43.409> Quincy<00:03:44.409> Jones<00:03:44.620> had<00:03:44.889> probably

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
baseline that Quincy Jones had probably

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.759 
baseline that Quincy Jones had probably
more<00:03:45.549> than<00:03:45.609> a<00:03:45.669> small<00:03:45.939> part<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.359> writing<00:03:47.079> also

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
more than a small part in writing also

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.080 
more than a small part in writing also
looking<00:03:47.980> at<00:03:48.010> some<00:03:48.250> sort<00:03:48.489> of<00:03:48.519> Stevie<00:03:48.849> Wonder

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
looking at some sort of Stevie Wonder

00:03:49.090 --> 00:04:05.850 
looking at some sort of Stevie Wonder
stuff<00:03:49.299> like<00:03:49.480> master<00:03:49.930> blaster

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.660 

etc<00:04:06.860> just<00:04:07.010> goes<00:04:07.130> round<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:07.430> round<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:07.580> round

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
etc just goes round and round and round

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.280 
etc just goes round and round and round
and<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.270> can<00:04:08.390> see<00:04:08.510> that<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.720> can<00:04:08.810> gradually

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
and you can see that you can gradually

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.309 
and you can see that you can gradually
build<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:09.800> now<00:04:10.340> when<00:04:11.269> you're<00:04:11.450> when<00:04:12.230> you're

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
build that now when you're when you're

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.270 
build that now when you're when you're
looking<00:04:12.560> at<00:04:12.650> putting<00:04:12.800> everything<00:04:13.190> we've

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
looking at putting everything we've

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.259 
looking at putting everything we've
talked<00:04:13.519> about<00:04:13.550> together<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:14.030> you're<00:04:14.180> working

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
talked about together so you're working

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.300 
talked about together so you're working
in<00:04:14.569> maybe<00:04:14.750> an<00:04:14.900> altar<00:04:15.260> tuning<00:04:15.650> you're<00:04:16.160> working

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
in maybe an altar tuning you're working

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.099 
in maybe an altar tuning you're working
maybe<00:04:16.790> in<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:16.940> strange<00:04:17.180> time<00:04:17.450> signature<00:04:17.930> and

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
maybe in a strange time signature and

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.810 
maybe in a strange time signature and
you're<00:04:18.799> thinking<00:04:18.950> about<00:04:19.190> sort<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:19.400> layering

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
you're thinking about sort of layering

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.250 
you're thinking about sort of layering
it<00:04:20.120> so<00:04:20.329> you're<00:04:20.480> building<00:04:20.780> at<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:20.930> baseline

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
it so you're building at the baseline

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.990 
it so you're building at the baseline
and<00:04:21.739> then<00:04:21.950> you're<00:04:22.070> adding<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.310> melody<00:04:22.639> line<00:04:22.820> and

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
and then you're adding a melody line and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.400 
and then you're adding a melody line and
then<00:04:23.090> maybe<00:04:23.240> you're<00:04:23.330> adding<00:04:23.510> in<00:04:23.630> chords<00:04:24.169> and

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
then maybe you're adding in chords and

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.510 
then maybe you're adding in chords and
then<00:04:24.860> you've<00:04:24.980> got<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.130> think<00:04:25.190> about<00:04:25.310> different

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
then you've got to think about different

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.310 
then you've got to think about different
sections<00:04:25.940> things<00:04:26.210> it's<00:04:26.810> important<00:04:27.260> to

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
sections things it's important to

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.370 
sections things it's important to
remember<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.669> you<00:04:28.669> don't<00:04:28.910> need<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.720> do<00:04:30.200> all

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
remember that you don't need to do all

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.500 
remember that you don't need to do all
of<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.860> crazy<00:04:31.250> techniques<00:04:31.790> at<00:04:32.030> once<00:04:32.270> and

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
of the crazy techniques at once and

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.500 
of the crazy techniques at once and
often<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.020> can<00:04:33.169> imply<00:04:33.620> a<00:04:33.979> lot<00:04:34.700> of<00:04:34.820> what<00:04:35.000> you

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
often you can imply a lot of what you

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.659 
often you can imply a lot of what you
end<00:04:35.630> up<00:04:35.750> doing<00:04:36.010> throughout<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.160> song<00:04:37.280> so<00:04:37.490> for

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
end up doing throughout the song so for

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.490 
end up doing throughout the song so for
example<00:04:37.760> if<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:38.540> do<00:04:38.690> something<00:04:38.840> at<00:04:39.080> one<00:04:39.260> point

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
example if you do something at one point

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.200 
example if you do something at one point
and<00:04:39.830> then<00:04:40.400> you<00:04:40.490> keep<00:04:40.639> everything<00:04:40.880> else<00:04:41.060> going

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
and then you keep everything else going

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.760 
and then you keep everything else going
basically<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.810> saying<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.169> audience<00:04:42.470> kind

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
basically the saying the audience kind

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.469 
basically the saying the audience kind
of<00:04:42.919> have<00:04:43.100> this<00:04:43.250> persistence<00:04:43.880> of<00:04:44.000> hearing<00:04:44.300> and

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
of have this persistence of hearing and

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.060 
of have this persistence of hearing and
they<00:04:44.600> will<00:04:44.750> almost<00:04:44.930> hear<00:04:45.350> that<00:04:45.560> over<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:45.950> top

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
they will almost hear that over the top

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.409 
they will almost hear that over the top
of<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.220> rest<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.520> song<00:04:46.700> and<00:04:46.910> that's<00:04:47.270> one

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
of the rest of the song and that's one

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.379 
of the rest of the song and that's one
of<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.540> things<00:04:47.660> that<00:04:47.810> allows<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.320> to<00:04:48.350> arrange

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
of the things that allows you to arrange

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.180 
of the things that allows you to arrange
songs<00:04:50.389> which<00:04:50.600> are<00:04:50.780> designed<00:04:51.050> for<00:04:51.320> vocals<00:04:51.800> and

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
songs which are designed for vocals and

on<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.160> acoustic<00:04:55.280> guitar<00:04:55.669> because<00:04:55.820> you<00:04:55.910> don't

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
on the acoustic guitar because you don't

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.330 
on the acoustic guitar because you don't
have<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.300> do<00:04:56.419> them<00:04:56.540> all<00:04:56.720> together<00:04:57.289> to<00:04:58.130> get<00:04:58.220> the
