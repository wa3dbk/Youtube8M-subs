information<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.239> here<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.599> itself<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.260> mean

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
information and here it is itself I mean

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.259 
information and here it is itself I mean
it's<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.860> same<00:02:32.220> size<00:02:32.489> as<00:02:33.560> what<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.650> expect

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
it's the same size as what you expect

it's the same size as what you expect
and<00:02:38.120> there's<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.300> now<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.290> cable<00:02:40.890> looks<00:02:41.010> a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
and there's this now this cable looks a

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.300 
and there's this now this cable looks a
little<00:02:41.280> bit<00:02:41.489> different<00:02:41.880> than<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.239> older<00:02:42.840> one

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
little bit different than the older one

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.300 
little bit different than the older one
which<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:45.530> do<00:02:46.530> have<00:02:46.830> here<00:02:48.140> but<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.500> can't<00:02:49.920> really

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
which I do have here but I can't really

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.610 
which I do have here but I can't really
show<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.940> well<00:02:51.209> because<00:02:51.450> there's<00:02:52.440> no

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
show you that well because there's no

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.240 
show you that well because there's no
point<00:02:53.160> but<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.330> looks<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.780> little<00:02:55.049> bit

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
point but this looks a little bit

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.460 
point but this looks a little bit
sleeker<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.459> all<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.420> I'm<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:58.349> going

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
sleeker and all that so I'm just going

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.289 
sleeker and all that so I'm just going
to<00:02:58.530> move<00:02:58.680> these<00:02:58.890> boxes<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.610> can<00:02:59.849> I<00:02:59.940> pull<00:03:00.150> off

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
to move these boxes so can I pull off

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:07.520 
to move these boxes so can I pull off
here<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.810> second<00:03:03.200> open<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:04.290> up<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:06.530> again

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
here for a second open this up and again

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.490 
here for a second open this up and again
it<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.980> same<00:03:08.160> length<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.670> old<00:03:09.360> one<00:03:09.599> it

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
it is the same length as the old one it

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.620 
it is the same length as the old one it
feels<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.890> little<00:03:10.950> bit<00:03:11.130> better<00:03:11.250> more<00:03:11.670> thicker

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
feels a little bit better more thicker

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.770 
feels a little bit better more thicker
