00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
do it up for hogs same thing will work

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.889 
do it up for hogs same thing will work
for<00:01:06.100> catfish<00:01:06.490> another<00:01:07.210> thing<00:01:07.450> that<00:01:07.570> they<00:01:07.689> use

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
for catfish another thing that they use

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.749 
for catfish another thing that they use
that<00:01:08.170> nobody<00:01:08.560> publicizes<00:01:09.450> cottonseed<00:01:10.450> blocks

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
that nobody publicizes cottonseed blocks

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.280 
that nobody publicizes cottonseed blocks
take<00:01:12.759> that<00:01:12.909> cottonseed<00:01:13.299> block<00:01:13.720> throw<00:01:14.049> it<00:01:14.200> in

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
take that cottonseed block throw it in

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.679 
take that cottonseed block throw it in
there<00:01:14.530> same<00:01:15.520> thing<00:01:15.549> it's<00:01:16.090> just<00:01:16.180> all<00:01:16.420> little

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
there same thing it's just all little

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.749 
there same thing it's just all little
seeds<00:01:16.930> from<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.229> cotton<00:01:17.619> so<00:01:18.340> number<00:01:18.729> of

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
seeds from the cotton so number of

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.609 
seeds from the cotton so number of
different<00:01:19.090> things<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.360> can<00:01:19.420> use<00:01:19.780> so<00:01:20.350> if<00:01:20.469> you

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
different things you can use so if you

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.690 
different things you can use so if you
mix<00:01:20.920> yeast<00:01:21.759> corn<00:01:22.689> and<00:01:22.990> sugar<00:01:23.500> you<00:01:24.250> start<00:01:24.579> to

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
mix yeast corn and sugar you start to

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.969 
mix yeast corn and sugar you start to
make<00:01:24.850> whiskey<00:01:25.290> white<00:01:26.290> lightning

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
make whiskey white lightning

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.279 
make whiskey white lightning
whatever<00:01:27.820> that's<00:01:28.659> essentially<00:01:29.110> what<00:01:29.229> we're

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
whatever that's essentially what we're

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.080 
whatever that's essentially what we're
doing<00:01:29.560> here<00:01:29.710> but<00:01:29.740> with<00:01:29.979> Milo<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:30.729> we're<00:01:30.969> going

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
doing here but with Milo and we're going

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.120 
doing here but with Milo and we're going
to<00:01:31.119> make<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:31.390> really<00:01:31.630> stinky<00:01:32.289> we're<00:01:32.770> just<00:01:32.979> not

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
to make it really stinky we're just not

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.800 
to make it really stinky we're just not
going<00:01:33.399> into<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.789> further<00:01:34.030> process<00:01:34.600> we're

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
going into the further process we're

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.209 
going into the further process we're
just<00:01:34.960> using<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.289> first<00:01:35.530> fermenting<00:01:36.100> process

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
just using the first fermenting process

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.670 
just using the first fermenting process
so<00:01:37.030> what<00:01:37.180> we'll<00:01:37.299> be<00:01:37.390> doing<00:01:37.539> is<00:01:37.899> catching<00:01:38.259> drunk

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
so what we'll be doing is catching drunk

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.480 
so what we'll be doing is catching drunk
catfish<00:01:39.219> essentially<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.799> rip<00:01:41.799> open<00:01:41.950> all<00:01:42.250> three

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
catfish essentially I rip open all three

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.270 
catfish essentially I rip open all three
packets<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.960> just<00:01:44.320> dump<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:44.680> all<00:01:44.799> in<00:01:45.009> there<00:01:45.039> as

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
packets and just dump it all in there as

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.190 
packets and just dump it all in there as
you<00:01:45.310> can<00:01:45.490> see<00:01:45.640> there's<00:01:46.090> still<00:01:46.149> ol<00:01:46.509> Milo<00:01:46.869> in

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
you can see there's still ol Milo in

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.789 
you can see there's still ol Milo in
there<00:01:47.380> too

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
there too

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.800 
there too
next<00:01:48.490> comes<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.789> sugar<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.759> whole<00:01:51.939> bag<00:01:52.240> and

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
next comes the sugar the whole bag and

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.240 
next comes the sugar the whole bag and
that<00:01:53.140> gives<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.530> yeast<00:01:53.770> on<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.219> work<00:01:54.369> on<00:01:56.250> who

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
that gives the yeast on the work on who

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.679 
that gives the yeast on the work on who
doesn't<00:01:57.640> use<00:01:57.759> chicken<00:01:58.090> livers<00:01:58.539> for

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
doesn't use chicken livers for

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.099 
doesn't use chicken livers for
catfishing<00:01:59.380> me<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.820> don't<00:02:01.719> mess<00:02:01.899> with<00:02:01.990> that

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
catfishing me I don't mess with that

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.169 
catfishing me I don't mess with that
crap<00:02:02.469> no<00:02:02.679> more<00:02:02.710> but<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.159> will<00:02:03.369> use<00:02:03.609> it<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.820> stink

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
crap no more but I will use it to stink

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.209 
crap no more but I will use it to stink
my<00:02:04.329> betta<00:02:04.600> now<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.289> don't<00:02:05.530> necessarily<00:02:05.679> have

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
my betta now you don't necessarily have

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.950 
my betta now you don't necessarily have
to<00:02:06.250> use<00:02:06.520> those<00:02:06.729> ingredients<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.600> get<00:02:07.780> this

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
to use those ingredients to get this

I think $9.99 over a Walmart a couple
years<00:02:53.689> ago<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.169> this<00:02:55.159> will<00:02:55.340> put<00:02:55.609> hundreds<00:02:56.569> upon

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
years ago so this will put hundreds upon
