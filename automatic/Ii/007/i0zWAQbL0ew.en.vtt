00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
to to run the clock program here's a

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.600 
to to run the clock program here's a
last<00:00:47.910> answer<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.750> kind<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.350> two<00:00:50.190> LED

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
last answer it's a kind of just two LED

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.060 
last answer it's a kind of just two LED
Brittany's<00:00:51.090> according<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:52.070> your

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
Brittany's according to your your

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.060 
Brittany's according to your your
environment<00:00:53.789> led<00:00:53.969> here's<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.070> temperature

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
environment led here's a temperature

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.959 
environment led here's a temperature
sensor<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:58.039> sec<00:00:59.039> egg<00:00:59.370> freaking<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.940> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
sensor it can I sec egg freaking is a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.240 
sensor it can I sec egg freaking is a
temperature<00:01:00.949> measurement<00:01:03.229> if<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.439> trigger

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
temperature measurement if you trigger

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
temperature measurement if you trigger
the<00:01:05.450> temperature<00:01:06.450> motors<00:01:06.810> can<00:01:07.049> display<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the temperature motors can display the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.800 
the temperature motors can display the
temperature<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:09.020> backup<00:01:10.020> battery<00:01:11.299> can<00:01:12.299> mix<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
temperature a backup battery can mix the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.340 
temperature a backup battery can mix the
LED<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.610> connect<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.790> MCU<00:01:15.479> memory<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.170> last

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
LED and connect the MCU memory and last

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.300 
LED and connect the MCU memory and last
longer<00:01:16.770> time<00:01:17.189> with<00:01:17.549> other<00:01:17.700> power<00:01:18.979> power<00:01:19.979> pins

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
longer time with other power power pins

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.999 
longer time with other power power pins
it's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.180> nine<00:01:21.780> volt<00:01:21.810> each<00:01:22.229> power<00:01:23.189> supply<00:01:23.610> so

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
it's a nine volt each power supply so

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.690 
it's a nine volt each power supply so
well<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:26.210> it's<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.330> very<00:01:27.570> clean<00:01:28.350> design<00:01:28.740> from

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
well now it's a very clean design from

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.120 
well now it's a very clean design from
the<00:01:29.759> front<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:30.960> also<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.409> BD<00:01:31.740> letters

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the front it so it's also a BD letters

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.330 
the front it so it's also a BD letters
and<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.119> fully<00:01:33.659> control<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.409> mean<00:01:34.979> its

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
and it's a fully control I mean its

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.140 
and it's a fully control I mean its
descent<00:01:35.759> bearers<00:01:37.189> we<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.640> support

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
descent bearers we can we can support

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:52.860 
descent bearers we can we can support
customers<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.770> need<00:01:42.560> no<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> program

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.780 

because<00:01:53.870> it's<00:01:54.230> very<00:01:54.620> nice<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:54.770> patty<00:01:55.310> for<00:01:55.610> this

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
because it's very nice a patty for this

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.240 
because it's very nice a patty for this
