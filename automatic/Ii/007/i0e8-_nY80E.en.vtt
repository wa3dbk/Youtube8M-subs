00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.519
 hi how are you all techno together 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.790
 good is a very quick video for 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:14.610
 tell them not to update 613 the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.189
 ibex is 6.3 that has just come out is very 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.199
 important not to update obviously 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.159
 those people who have facts and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.529
 great and want to continue to have it since 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:27.449
 updating it to this new version go 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.369
 to lose the jailbreak and it's not going to 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.079
 work will not be able to do it back 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.810
 to do it so it's very important that 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.220
 do not update those people who want 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.920
 follow because about the one that I do not have 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.649
 retains the same if they want to update not 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.989
 nothing happens since it solves some 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.899
 mistakes some questions more and more than 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.690
 all of me's mistakes nothing else does not bring 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.449
 No news this update and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.839
 It is also very important since it came out 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.460
 this new version save your shs h is 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.620
 very important that you do it and it's very 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.710
 important that they do so within the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.470
 first 24 hours after it has left 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.290
 this firmware because as you already know 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.760
 only within 24 hours of 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.090
 do 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.090
 to save the ssh of the previous 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.050
 firmware that have obviously installed 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.120
 if I want to save the shhh from my v I know 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.000
 that I am in 612 I have to 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.700
 do now because within 24 hours 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.250
 today we are on March 16 within 24 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.270
 hours and will not be able to save the 6 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.310
 12 9 to save I have 21 in 24 hours 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.890
 to do it so it's very important 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.540
 let them hurry up and save those of shs h 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.850
 for anything by any 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.210
 problem that is or are updated without 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.759
 want or whatever happens to them to be able 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.320
 go to a good end earlier very 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.800
 important so in fact this from 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.470
 put you cancel so very important 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.810
 that for those who want to know how 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.750
 address them shhh click here in the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.030
 apple and will go to the video where he explained 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.610
 how to save them is hyper easy it is very very 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.890
 easy but but you have to do it is very 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.229
 important that you do it is simply 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.360
 for a security issue nothing more 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.530
 so good very important not 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.630
 update 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.840
 under any view choose 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.459
 keep happening break and for which what 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.060
 ask because in fact they ask me 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.180
 all the time but if one does not save the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.069
 s htc h there's no way to starve 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.090
 there is no way to do it if they do not 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.130
 know the dhhh and update to 613 and 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.590
 then it turns out that I discover that no 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.170
 have that break and I want to go back to 612 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.170
 it's not a way to do it if you do not save 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.520
 shh being in the previous fillmore not 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.170
 There is a way that the 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.400
 Hunger is always going to throw a mistake 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.590
 itunes so obviously that's why it's very 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.590
 important to save them so good 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.750
 they are warned and you know that good 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.069
 can comment on any problem 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.900
 any doubt you have in the 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.300
 comments on this video and follow me 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.440
