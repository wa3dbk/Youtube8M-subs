00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
of that is separated into a dot that

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.170 
of that is separated into a dot that
lasts<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.649> two<00:00:52.800> seconds<00:00:53.250> after<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> original

lasts for two seconds after the original
dart<00:00:54.570> hits<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.559> use<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.829> splinters<00:00:56.550> ruin

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
dart hits if you use the splinters ruin

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.849 
dart hits if you use the splinters ruin
it<00:00:56.910> reduces<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> damage<00:00:57.719> dart<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> damage

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it reduces the damage dart or the damage

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.830 
it reduces the damage dart or the damage
dart<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> dart<00:00:59.340> damage<00:00:59.730> down<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.420> sixty

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
dart the dart damage down to sixty

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.170 
dart the dart damage down to sixty
percent<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.410> 100<00:01:02.039> buddy<00:01:02.190> cast<00:01:02.520> three<00:01:02.910> darts

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
percent from 100 buddy cast three darts

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.179 
percent from 100 buddy cast three darts
instead<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> ends<00:01:04.799> up<00:01:04.860> doing<00:01:04.979> one

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
instead of one so it ends up doing one

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.620 
instead of one so it ends up doing one
hundred<00:01:05.400> eighty<00:01:05.549> percent<00:01:05.790> damage<00:01:06.119> instead<00:01:06.479> of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
hundred eighty percent damage instead of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.359 
hundred eighty percent damage instead of
140<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.409> get<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> little<00:01:07.740> forty<00:01:08.070> percent

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
140 so you get a little forty percent

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.580 
140 so you get a little forty percent
buff<00:01:08.729> there<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.720> use<00:01:09.960> his<00:01:10.140> secondary

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590
