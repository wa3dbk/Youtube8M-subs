 as a business 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.580
 The first step then would be to create 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.619
 your channel and some basic tips that 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.750

 how you may be different when generating 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.510

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.210
 things like identity is something that is 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.550

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.300

 neither of youtube wants to change the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.420
 henrique does not even have some tricks 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.600
 that people know that for 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.460
 redirection 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.840
 but you can not get the content to take 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.210
 to another place with the same data 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.070
 updates or even change the world that 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.570

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.979
 it 's not easy to create it has to be a name 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.630
 easy to repatriate legal then your 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.939

 make money on this but like you 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.130
 need to monetize your channel or give 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.560
 one touch for youtube that he can 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.509
 sell media using their vilson and to 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.310

 have a monetization the account list has 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.700
 that everything is right between a 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.060
 problem will have a line that will have 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.130
 if it is actually a click on the tab and took 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.660
 father and remember that he will release 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.310
 monetization in that first moment he 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.920
 until I can see or have content 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.150
 talk with 3 x videos to monetize 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.560
 are going to use ok 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.090
 done, you'll start to see some 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.890
 ads on video that you have not now 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.530
 Forget about a new video bid 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.030
 time and monetizes that video and will not 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.040
 thinking this is an easy task 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.330
 make money from your videos only 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.159
 for you to have a notion 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.629
 after you should be neither good nor the 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.670
 yours on your videos 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.200
 your channel enters a list of 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.239
 other thousands of millions 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.830
 is more for the world and is part of a 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.170
 auction or what it costs for a 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.420
 brand spoke owner announce at the door of 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.599
 funds and on your channel offer demand 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.800
 seeks relevance or even time or 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.080
 several other things that you have to 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.480
 stay connected but in a very general way well 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.550
 generic quotation marks every thousand views 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.590
 you earn a dollar which is the cost per 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.430
 million dollars that a dollar is actually a 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.220
 average 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.440
 but it is the cpm it will vary according to 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.580
 the time of relevance so christmas made 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.739
 a video panetone 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.209
 maybe the channel search is larger 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.730
 This goes to 1 90 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.500
 so had 20 thousand views did not take another 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.970
 if you have a food channel at the time 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.220
 of the case, announcing a cost 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.880
 different but does not start to cry because 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.470
 It gives to be just a little money on your channel 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.420
 So, what if you got 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.940
 many videos on your channel or better 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.920
 you have many many many and many rivers 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.380
 You can earn money with your channel. 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.720
 just recapturing duca if the guy has a thousand 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.959
 views against gain a dollar and little 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.220
 between 100 thousand views 100 dollars in 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.470
 few touches or make it difficult 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.139
 then michel teló plays in the 15th stadium 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.810
 billion is cs 1 billion will come to say 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:49.510
 I'll say garbage there is too neat to cut nor 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.519
 cpi I do not know how much is too much, but few are 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.920
 a lot more money if you generate a 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.989
 cool content has a legal channel but is 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.850
 A little more targeted Speaks for less 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.470
 people does not mean you can not 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.239
 make money because I think it 's this 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.250
 that matters just this segmentation 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.630
 You talk about something specific and there. 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.069
 you have a specific audience 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.200
 regardless of the size of the quantity 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.420
 for example playing the blog that people 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.100
 Italy knows great sugar was to have 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.049
 An ingenious idea , he doubts. 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.630
 answer the conversation with the crew about 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.030
 specific automotive problems 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.919
 then suddenly the battery mark goes 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.539
 seeing the potential of the 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.729
 benguela province favor or 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.800
 sponsor the channel macaé merchant 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.570
 my brand appears I think with 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.160
 sure was canceled advertising worth 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.660
 much more worth it to invest this 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.090
 capital than to enter the auction 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.039
 gang style michel cpm wacky 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.530
 lorca who will speak to a public mix 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:41.919
 very comprehensive people including the 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.630
 worldwide were impacted right around the 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.400
 difference the more impacted in this 1 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.289
 million people or there on that channel 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.180
 of the spot and in an exclusive report 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.190
 that was free from the sheet through the internet 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.840
 politely it was one of the respondents 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.370
 press kitchen 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.169
 I heard about the simple girl because 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.139
 the deal had never heard of the 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.949
 girl and she does a blog makeup like this 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.960
 she earns 10 bucks only combines hellman already 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.520
 it is obvious that it suddenly cpf 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.220
 increased but not the issue so she 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.320
 live this pattinson lives do not know why 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.729
 so I doubt she'll take a chance or 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.320
 at least it received a proposal 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.190

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.949
 Granny baton or did not find 100 kg

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.080
 that sure money that is that of the rivers 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.550

 can even make a video explaining 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.330
 exactly but broadly are you 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.060

 absurdly high for us to win 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.139
 only with them but we can be 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.960
