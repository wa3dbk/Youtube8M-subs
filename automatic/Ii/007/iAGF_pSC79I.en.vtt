00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
bit I now have a tree in it and this is

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.610 
bit I now have a tree in it and this is
the<00:01:21.729> modified<00:01:22.330> tree<00:01:22.720> from<00:01:23.020> us

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
the modified tree from us

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.520 
the modified tree from us
leggo<00:01:24.010> say<00:01:24.340> I<00:01:24.490> forget<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.000> name<00:01:25.210> but<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:26.170> just

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
leggo say I forget the name but I just

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.350 
leggo say I forget the name but I just
kind<00:01:26.830> of<00:01:26.920> changed<00:01:27.369> it<00:01:27.550> up<00:01:27.700> so<00:01:27.970> it<00:01:28.030> could<00:01:28.180> fit

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
kind of changed it up so it could fit

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.980 
kind of changed it up so it could fit
the<00:01:28.540> castle<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:31.030> used<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.390> be<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.570> statue

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
the castle there used to be a statue

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.010 
the castle there used to be a statue
there<00:01:32.229> but<00:01:32.680> then<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:32.979> just<00:01:33.130> decided<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.840> it

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
there but then I just decided that it

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.280 
there but then I just decided that it
would<00:01:35.110> be<00:01:35.229> cooler<00:01:35.770> with<00:01:36.160> a<00:01:36.190> tree<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.960> I<00:01:37.990> also

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
would be cooler with a tree then I also

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.880 
would be cooler with a tree then I also
added<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:39.040> pig<00:01:39.369> and<00:01:39.550> chicken<00:01:40.000> pen<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.590> there's<00:01:41.800> a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
added a pig and chicken pen so there's a

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.670 
added a pig and chicken pen so there's a
pig<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:42.909> chicken<00:01:43.150> in<00:01:43.360> there<00:01:43.509> with<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.140> tree

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
pig and a chicken in there with a tree

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.399 
pig and a chicken in there with a tree
that's<00:01:44.979> dropping<00:01:45.520> little<00:01:46.420> fruits<00:01:46.750> everywhere

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
that's dropping little fruits everywhere

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.340 
that's dropping little fruits everywhere
then<00:01:48.190> there's<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.520> fence<00:01:48.910> and<00:01:49.479> then<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.110> mud

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
then there's a fence and then the mud

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.510 
then there's a fence and then the mud
where<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:50.860> pig<00:01:51.070> is

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
where the pig is

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.160 
where the pig is
it's<00:01:52.060> like<00:01:52.270> spilling<00:01:52.690> out<00:01:52.990> I<00:01:54.479> also<00:01:55.479> built<00:01:55.899> this

pathway<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:28.080> then

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
pathway and then

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.339 
pathway and then
this<00:03:29.769> arch<00:03:31.079> where<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.409> portcullis<00:03:33.189> is<00:03:34.349> so

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
this arch where the portcullis is so

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.229 
this arch where the portcullis is so
that<00:03:35.620> adds<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:36.370> cool<00:03:36.970> amount<00:03:37.329> of<00:03:37.450> detail<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:40.209> I

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
that adds a cool amount of detail so I

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.160 
that adds a cool amount of detail so I
think<00:03:40.360> that's<00:03:40.720> it

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
think that's it
