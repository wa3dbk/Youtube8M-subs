00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.320
 through twitter they say many 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.660
 fans that is the curse of lion 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.490
 that while it does not rise blue cross no 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.610
 win 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.610
 the last championship that is never true 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:27.750
 it's more father to have to win a match 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.609
 two goals so it was almost perfect to train 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.410
 in society while I chose from some 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.719
 things like it happened with blue cross with 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.200
 expulsions with errors and what cougars put 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.300
 your share today and grab her say good 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.800
 because course what to do cougars and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.149
 it's just me, not what it should have 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.710
 put the goals in order 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.870
 marco antonio rodríguez the sic and drácula 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.180
 the central and can not be the organs 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.590
 goal of a 2 in a corner kick and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.600
 look where the centrals are could 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.269
 burn play profiles painted look 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.590
 lousy painted is delivered turns over 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.590
 and what a great goal in the definition 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.190
 cervantes was obviously to top it off but 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.510
 who stayed to defend grabbed the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.190
 ball and brought him 65 meters arms 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:14.010
 he looked like the boy of primary autopato 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:16.710
 who does not know how to play has to see a lot 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.420
 with the defenses and the algae then 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.880
 by the criminal dictated the expulsion by him 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.740
 for this type of shooting and not the war 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.560
 nobody did 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.330
 a disaster I think that table is wrong in 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.460
 the approach makes changes is injured 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.460
 certain selected people expel 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:46.740
 except two so I said it we saw the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.009
 party the writing with the cat and with 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.210
 the father and he told them maybe the gonzo 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.910
 with the income they give more calm but not 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.770
 the gaps that there was very good the first 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.509
 time put what had five 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.830
 clarifies he was the best goalkeeper in the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.830
 league with crosses 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.030
 what good this boy of what little 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.110
 salvageable blue color that was a 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.209
 sorry for what the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.599
 season today was his worst match not 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.280
 of these six months of the full year of 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.510
 the greetings the teams have a bad 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.090
 late it costs you bad luck to cross 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:35.209
 chacón was a tornado caricature that 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:38.209
 and this weighed this we can afford to 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.209
 direct red 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:53.640
 but that is there has this trunk 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.230
 Cervantes is a trunk in addition 2 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.930
 with characters that similar aranjuez 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.930
 flight but it's also clear high more 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:16.590
 we're going to save the goal again 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.780
 well located crown and not emerged chunk 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.030
 from the quarry of crosses is the man who 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.340
 says I define change and enter 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.340
 goals that had patience penalty point 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:41.630
 the bottom line two meters had been 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:43.700
 closed the cacho contemplate because the 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.370
 parents asked the ball in fact if not 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.819
 I wanted to charge quite abundantly and now 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.249
 do not go no no no reactions 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.099
 it gave me high hopes of being able to leave 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:56.389
 from here with the victory but I knew I 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.980
 I have what I knew that this team 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.020
 is for great things at least 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.700
 to surrender 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.740
 within all of that they played very well at 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.200
 ball had goal options like 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.330
 says also with the quota he kept the 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.950
 patience was not expected and in the end I had 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.570
 the reward that was the goal I do not believe 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.240
 that the team had claw I had delivery 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.010
 this had decision he had football and had 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.170
 goals that was what he needed me to be 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.840
 he had to score the second goal 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.640
 but the fat all the first goal 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.800
 he also influenced a lot from there 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.280
 we started to dominate we started not 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.770
 let them play and all all all 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.770
 companions are the ones we play inside 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.969
 the court and one 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:41.389
 fortunately I had to put this pizza 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:43.429
 I think that throughout the match 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.499
 games better than us but good 

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:47.470
 sprinkled with everything that happened to us 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:50.590
 expulsion 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.960
 I do not know if it's a hand but there are many 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.660
 of those that are not marked is very 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.730
 short the play as for as for 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.800
 think of stillness premeditatedly 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.150
 throw your hand but good is already 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.680
 I think we deservedly stayed 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.200
 outside because we also left many 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.050
 things to do may not be emboldened 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.600
 We wanted to do things for that reason 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.100
 comes the backlash play many 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.720
 Sometimes one speaks inside the court and 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.600
 in the same perspective that suddenly 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.060
 on TV if it is that there is no no 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.730
 there is no complaint I think that by dint of being 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.260
 sincere I believe that the greater the greater 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.050
 error that is committed is from our side 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.120
 Y 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.740
 and we stop doing many things I do not 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.569
 would like in no way to meditate the 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.840
 triumph of pumas I think a great rival 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:39.110
 it beat us I think it's almost the biggest 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.389
 part of the party maybe I have influenced 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.370
 a little bit because of the expulsion that 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:46.039
 determined much of the encounter but 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.080
 without any fear of being wrong I think that 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.080
 we played a bad game and he beat us
