00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
improvements with this model first of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.130 
improvements with this model first of
all<00:00:29.489> you<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.180> see<00:00:30.360> a<00:00:30.390> front<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:30.989> have

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
all you have to see a front here we have

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.890 
all you have to see a front here we have
the<00:00:31.320> paddle<00:00:32.009> style<00:00:32.669> blades<00:00:32.970> right<00:00:33.150> here<00:00:33.360> which

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
the paddle style blades right here which

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.510 
the paddle style blades right here which
is<00:00:34.050> different<00:00:34.380> than<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.620> first<00:00:34.800> version<00:00:34.950> 1<00:00:35.370> &amp;

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
is different than the first version 1 &amp;

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.110 
is different than the first version 1 &amp;
2<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.590> distance<00:00:37.590> between<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.399> back<00:00:38.760> plate<00:00:39.030> of

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
2 the distance between the back plate of

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.729 
2 the distance between the back plate of
the<00:00:39.239> spinner<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.630> the<00:00:39.960> cowling<00:00:40.350> has<00:00:40.500> been

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the spinner and the cowling has been

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.860 
the spinner and the cowling has been
reduced<00:00:41.250> by<00:00:41.430> 4<00:00:41.700> millimeters<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.300> now<00:00:42.480> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
reduced by 4 millimeters so now it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.380 
reduced by 4 millimeters so now it
actually<00:00:43.410> sits<00:00:43.590> kind<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.280> flush<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
actually sits kind of flush which is you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.990 
actually sits kind of flush which is you
know<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.840> adds<00:00:46.080> more<00:00:46.320> scale<00:00:46.770> looks<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
know it adds more scale looks to it the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.460 
know it adds more scale looks to it the
exhaust<00:00:48.510> right<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.870> has<00:00:49.020> been<00:00:49.200> redesigned

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
exhaust right here has been redesigned

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.990 
exhaust right here has been redesigned
it<00:00:49.800> actually<00:00:50.040> looks<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> lot<00:00:50.400> better

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
it actually looks a lot better

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.550 
it actually looks a lot better
so<00:00:51.540> moving<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.080> we<00:00:52.170> talk<00:00:52.290> about<00:00:52.410> the

so moving on so we talk about the

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.070 
so moving on so we talk about the
fuselage<00:00:53.010> now<00:00:53.940> there's<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:54.420> antenna

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
fuselage now there's actually antenna

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.960 
fuselage now there's actually antenna
back<00:00:55.290> here<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:56.010> give<00:00:56.130> it<00:00:56.220> more<00:00:56.340> detail<00:00:56.520> and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
with a 4 amp BC built in so what that

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.789 
with a 4 amp BC built in so what that
4nbc<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.479> ESC<00:01:21.780> doesn't<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:22.409> work<00:01:22.590> too

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
4nbc the ESC doesn't have to work too

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.770 
4nbc the ESC doesn't have to work too
hard<00:01:22.829> to<00:01:23.520> power<00:01:23.729> two<00:01:23.880> servos<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.539> extra

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
hard to power two servos and the extra

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.330 
hard to power two servos and the extra
retrack<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.319> the<00:01:25.409> rear<00:01:25.590> what<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> lights<00:01:26.130> over

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
retrack in the rear what the lights over

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.450 
retrack in the rear what the lights over
here<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.390> motor<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.869> now<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.079> bigger<00:01:28.590> 25

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
here to the motor is now a bigger 25

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.340 
here to the motor is now a bigger 25
size<00:01:29.700> or<00:01:29.969> I<00:01:30.240> always<00:01:30.840> say<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> little

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
size or I always say it's a little

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.649 
size or I always say it's a little
bigger<00:01:31.590> than<00:01:31.649> 25<00:01:32.100> sides<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.609> 500<00:01:33.210> kV<00:01:33.539> so

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
bigger than 25 sides with a 500 kV so

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.749 
bigger than 25 sides with a 500 kV so
the<00:01:33.780> KB's<00:01:34.109> a<00:01:34.139> little<00:01:34.319> bit<00:01:34.409> lower<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.399> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the KB's a little bit lower but the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.300 
the KB's a little bit lower but the
props<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.389> more<00:01:36.869> area<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.289> there<00:01:37.649> so<00:01:38.130> that's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
props have more area to there so that's

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.770 
props have more area to there so that's
why<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> cave<00:01:38.819> is<00:01:38.969> lower<00:01:39.179> which<00:01:39.479> should<00:01:39.659> give

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
why the cave is lower which should give

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.059 
why the cave is lower which should give
you<00:01:39.960> about<00:01:40.109> maybe<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.649> little<00:01:40.859> bit<00:01:40.950> more

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
you about maybe a little bit more

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:42.679 
you about maybe a little bit more
performance<00:01:41.249> with<00:01:41.819> these<00:01:41.969> parallel

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
performance with these parallel

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.169 
performance with these parallel
propellers<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.289> here<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.249> now<00:01:44.639> is<00:01:44.789> moving<00:01:45.090> on

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
propellers on here so now is moving on

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.029 
propellers on here so now is moving on
to<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.389> bottom<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.109> airplane<00:01:46.590> Bobby<00:01:46.859> will

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
to the bottom of the airplane Bobby will

hooked up yes and see here we have

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:51.889 
hooked up yes and see here we have
here's<00:01:50.249> the<00:01:50.369> retracts<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.969> tires<00:01:51.299> now<00:01:51.659> have

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
here's the retracts the tires now have

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.300 
here's the retracts the tires now have
you<00:01:51.990> thread<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.319> patterning<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.920> here<00:01:53.159> it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
you thread the patterning on here it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.010 
you thread the patterning on here it
seems<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:53.999> made<00:01:54.179> out<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.479> very<00:01:54.810> durable

seems to be made out of a very durable
maybe<00:01:55.469> hard<00:01:55.829> foam<00:01:56.069> or<00:01:56.219> plastic<00:01:56.609> but<00:01:56.789> it<00:01:56.909> looks

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
maybe hard foam or plastic but it looks

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.849 
maybe hard foam or plastic but it looks
very<00:01:57.270> nice<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.719> see<00:01:57.959> here<00:01:58.139> the<00:01:58.649> 30

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
very nice you can see here the 30

a<00:02:05.459> little<00:02:05.579> bit<00:02:05.729> kind<00:02:06.359> of<00:02:06.420> above<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.229> main<00:02:07.409> wing

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619

a little bit kind of above the main wing
right<00:02:07.770> here<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.100> which<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.369> good<00:02:08.640> because<00:02:09.119> for

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
right here so which is good because for

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
grass there's a less chance of tipping

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.010 
grass there's a less chance of tipping
over<00:02:14.250> now<00:02:14.580> just<00:02:14.880> because<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.660> landing<00:02:15.900> gears

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
over now just because the landing gears

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.510 
over now just because the landing gears
are<00:02:16.140> Ford<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.950> let's<00:02:17.099> just<00:02:17.220> give<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.400> guys<00:02:17.490> a

are Ford so let's just give you guys a
demonstration<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.240> how<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.420> retracts<00:02:18.900> work

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
demonstration of how the retracts work

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.690 
demonstration of how the retracts work
he<00:02:19.290> has<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> seat<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.860> was<00:02:19.950> closing<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.550> was

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
he has a seat that was closing and I was

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.970 
he has a seat that was closing and I was
open<00:02:21.000> up

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
open up

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.199 
open up
and<00:02:22.370> now<00:02:22.489> we'll<00:02:22.610> show<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.760> guys<00:02:22.879> the

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
and now we'll show you guys the

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.470 
and now we'll show you guys the
tailwheel<00:02:23.599> back<00:02:23.840> here<00:02:24.110> let's<00:02:25.040> close<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.520> and

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
tailwheel back here let's close it and

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.110 
tailwheel back here let's close it and
let's<00:02:26.989> opening<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:27.530> up<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:28.489> absentee<00:02:28.879> looks

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
let's opening it up the absentee looks

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.360 
let's opening it up the absentee looks
very<00:02:29.330> nice<00:02:29.569> is<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> very<00:02:30.110> simple<00:02:30.590> design<00:02:30.709> pretty

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
very nice is a very simple design pretty

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.520 
very nice is a very simple design pretty
much<00:02:31.610> when<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.940> tail<00:02:32.150> grill<00:02:32.330> closes<00:02:32.750> it<00:02:33.200> pulls

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
much when the tail grill closes it pulls

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.020 
much when the tail grill closes it pulls
down<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:33.739> little<00:02:33.980> mechanism<00:02:34.099> inside<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.879> it

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
down this little mechanism inside and it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.970 
down this little mechanism inside and it
closes<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.510> hatch<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:35.900> there's<00:02:36.110> no<00:02:36.620> servos

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
closes the hatch so there's no servos

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.710 
closes the hatch so there's no servos
for<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.220> hatch<00:02:37.400> which<00:02:37.670> which<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.510> actually

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
for the hatch which which is actually

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.809 
for the hatch which which is actually
pretty<00:02:38.870> cool<00:02:39.080> so<00:02:39.830> moving<00:02:40.160> on<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.519> wing

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
pretty cool so moving on to the wing

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.580 
pretty cool so moving on to the wing
tips<00:02:41.060> over<00:02:41.300> here<00:02:41.450> we<00:02:41.599> have<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.810> guiding<00:02:42.380> lights

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
tips over here we have a guiding lights

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.259 
tips over here we have a guiding lights
or<00:02:43.069> not<00:02:43.340> guiding<00:02:43.670> lights<00:02:43.849> those<00:02:44.000> little

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
or not guiding lights those little

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.699 
or not guiding lights those little
lights<00:02:44.569> on<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.780> side<00:02:44.930> we<00:02:45.019> have<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.170> red<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.650> a

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
lights on the side we have a red and a

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.080 
lights on the side we have a red and a
green<00:02:45.739> on<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.069> other<00:02:46.190> side<00:02:46.459> which<00:02:46.580> is<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.819> very

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
green on the other side which is a very

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.300 
green on the other side which is a very
neat<00:02:47.300> so<00:02:48.140> I<00:02:48.170> think<00:02:48.440> that's<00:02:48.709> pretty<00:02:48.890> much<00:02:49.010> it

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
neat so I think that's pretty much it

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.820 
neat so I think that's pretty much it
evolved<00:02:49.610> improvements<00:02:50.090> on<00:02:50.209> here<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:50.599> let's

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
evolved improvements on here so let's

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.140 
evolved improvements on here so let's
plug<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:51.980> batteries<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.819> show<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:53.000> guys

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
plug in the batteries and show you guys

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.880 
plug in the batteries and show you guys
how<00:02:53.390> all<00:02:53.629> three<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.900> these<00:02:53.989> planes<00:02:54.290> fly<00:02:54.500> so

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
how all three of these planes fly so

00:02:54.890 --> 00:05:49.570 
how all three of these planes fly so
let's<00:02:55.040> take<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.250> on<00:02:55.310> up

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.410 

alright<00:05:50.580> guys<00:05:50.670> you<00:05:50.880> just<00:05:51.030> saw<00:05:51.090> the<00:05:51.150> flight

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
alright guys you just saw the flight

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.120 
alright guys you just saw the flight
footage<00:05:51.750> with<00:05:51.930> these<00:05:52.050> three<00:05:52.290> planes<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:52.740> they

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
footage with these three planes and they

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.880 
footage with these three planes and they
fly<00:05:53.310> very<00:05:53.370> good<00:05:53.790> a<00:05:54.050> one<00:05:55.050> improvement<00:05:55.590> that<00:05:55.860> I

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
fly very good a one improvement that I

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.350 
fly very good a one improvement that I
noticed<00:05:56.250> during<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.520> flight<00:05:56.760> was<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:57.030> power

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
noticed during the flight was the power

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.510 
noticed during the flight was the power
difference<00:05:58.110> on<00:05:58.230> here<00:05:58.440> we<00:05:58.860> flew<00:05:59.100> it<00:05:59.190> with<00:05:59.310> both

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
difference on here we flew it with both

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.340 
difference on here we flew it with both
the<00:05:59.730> stock<00:05:59.970> back<00:06:00.270> although<00:06:00.840> these<00:06:00.990> planes<00:06:01.230> on

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
the stock back although these planes on

the stock back although these planes on
the<00:06:01.410> stock<00:06:01.620> battery<00:06:01.830> which<00:06:02.130> is<00:06:02.220> a<00:06:02.310> 2620<00:06:03.240> C<00:06:03.390> pack

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
the stock battery which is a 2620 C pack

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.570 
the stock battery which is a 2620 C pack

one<00:06:43.950> right<00:06:44.190> now<00:06:45.440> the<00:06:46.440> yellow<00:06:46.590> one

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 
one right now the yellow one

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.770 
one right now the yellow one
unfortunately<00:06:47.820> went<00:06:48.030> down<00:06:48.210> during<00:06:48.510> our

unfortunately went down during our
scramble<00:06:49.320> maneuver<00:06:49.770> I<00:06:49.920> guess<00:06:50.160> the<00:06:51.060> pilot<00:06:51.420> you

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480

scramble maneuver I guess the pilot you
can<00:06:51.600> see<00:06:51.720> a<00:06:51.750> front<00:06:51.990> sitting<00:06:52.290> on<00:06:52.380> the<00:06:52.560> yellow

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
part over there I guess he got

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.740 
part over there I guess he got
