00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.759
 therefore brought in pieces 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.860
 Alone goalkeeper Oleg Orlov laugh a lot too Matthias version to 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.529
 Download under par 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.320
 henceforth days ago the day before yesterday against Stuttgart the creation of Haydn 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.019
 she thought it was great that I pour in as well as 4 50 euros 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.619
 four-hour program is still healthy 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.010
 and that is one 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.560
 insane 80 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.500
 and then at Christmas announces a record as a gift 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.660
 of course, fit 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.730
 that has the AXA moment make 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.390
 to take the duty 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.620
 and as the matthaus passion 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.740
 what should I do? 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.460
 my mother caught me there 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.340
 deliver the city 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.860
 and this plate Starcevic 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.730
 before bigger ones flowed 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.730
 and I said I can tell me where I come from 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.050
 of course I would not have thought that Heidi the cross-eyed 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.570
 he shoots that I'm just a scratch we do not want to 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.530
 once 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.249
 as her instrument Marbach are made and the packaging of 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.670
 there the association stands the statement that the procedure is not 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.290
 Find 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.340
 to panic 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.030
 simultaneously with the group One with the cello 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.900
 and sung this choir 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.830
 the Helios does not have 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.090
 just blindly trust by for that time 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.630
 Do something that does not have a lot of drugs at all in the one too 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.630
 There will be no deaths here and the noise will be 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.659
 in this context 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.670
 Comcast out 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.740
 the value-free 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.690
 "That's crazy 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.690
 I mean I can spit with a scratch 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.000
 something to complicate 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.970
 and that's true that means if we can not go to the record 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.600
 his lays 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.750
 to have frequency in action to just that 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:13.219
 Zombies a superposition of different frequencies 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:14.619
 why is this? 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.069
 henceforth almost lost opponents 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.449
 Shock at the SC just now 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.859
 the overlay of who and how they are now going to get us done 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.719
 the orchestra 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.400
 to make computers again after frequencies 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.079
 fixed both for instruments 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.099
 Waldemar learned we had an oboe win 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.430
 like a violin sounds like a champion like a piano 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:40.949
 but we can get it too 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:44.339
 Every time I play it is official 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:50.349
 makes the head is a piano a piano recognizes nanoporous Bobo Poland 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.919
 and a string instrument 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.279
 the current year 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:57.930
 which some plaintiffs of bowing in these areas get death instantly and 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:01.430
 the number of x-dax is 11 for you 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.079
 Westwood has not guessed that 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.999
 Kroos taken 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:06.629
 like the administration
