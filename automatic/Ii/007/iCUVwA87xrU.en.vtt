thought<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.360> our<00:01:57.450> proposal<00:01:57.869> we<00:01:58.880> made<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.240> step

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
thought in our proposal we made a step

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.690 
thought in our proposal we made a step
in<00:02:01.729> considerable<00:02:02.729> concessions<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.570> them<00:02:03.689> and

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
in considerable concessions to them and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.319 
in considerable concessions to them and
frankly<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.060> was<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> little

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
frankly you know it was a little

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.639 
frankly you know it was a little
disappointing<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.020> see<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> response

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
disappointing to see the response

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.479 
disappointing to see the response
yesterday<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489

all of you they have on it why was it

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.289 
all of you they have on it why was it

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
disappointing did you feel like there

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.100 
disappointing did you feel like there
was<00:02:14.390> no<00:02:14.420> well<00:02:14.810> we<00:02:14.930> just<00:02:15.080> took<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:16.599> thought<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.659> or

was no well we just took I thought I or

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.170 
was no well we just took I thought I or
we<00:02:18.290> think<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.680> step<00:02:19.310> in<00:02:19.459> that<00:02:19.489> direction<00:02:19.610> and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
we think a step in that direction and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.649 
we think a step in that direction and
you<00:02:20.720> know<00:02:21.220> seven<00:02:22.220> years<00:02:22.489> ago<00:02:22.730> we<00:02:22.879> did<00:02:23.060> the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
dollars a year since and basically they

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.170 
dollars a year since and basically they
just<00:02:32.030> want<00:02:32.360> more<00:02:32.510> money<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:33.860> know<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:36.069> think

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120

we continue to have issue and you know
there's<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.799> systematical<00:03:22.519> problem<00:03:22.849> when<00:03:23.090> we

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
there's a systematical problem when we

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.259 
there's a systematical problem when we
keep<00:03:23.389> running<00:03:23.540> into<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:23.989> and<00:03:24.230> then<00:03:25.120> what<00:03:26.120> we

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
keep running into this and then what we

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.629 
keep running into this and then what we
proposed<00:03:26.720> is<00:03:27.459> working<00:03:28.459> towards<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:31.370> know<00:03:31.459> not

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.500 
proposed is working towards you know not
being<00:03:31.819> in<00:03:31.940> that<00:03:32.030> situation<00:03:32.090> again<00:03:32.660> and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
being in that situation again and

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.089 
being in that situation again and
hopefully<00:03:35.510> i<00:03:35.690> will<00:03:36.049> continue<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.769> talk<00:03:36.950> about

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
hopefully i will continue to talk about

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.190 
hopefully i will continue to talk about
it<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:37.569> they'll<00:03:38.569> be<00:03:38.690> other<00:03:38.780> things<00:03:38.930> talked

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
it and they'll be other things talked

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.150 
it and they'll be other things talked
about<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.669> will<00:03:41.560> will<00:03:42.560> be<00:03:42.650> able<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.859> come<00:03:43.010> to

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
about and will will be able to come to

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.280 
about and will will be able to come to
something<00:03:43.370> it's<00:03:44.269> been<00:03:44.419> coming<00:03:44.599> down<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.900> NHL

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
something it's been coming down the NHL

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.789 
something it's been coming down the NHL
to<00:03:45.470> come<00:03:45.650> more<00:03:45.799> in<00:03:45.919> your<00:03:46.040> direction<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:47.810> just

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
to come more in your direction I just

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.220 
to come more in your direction I just
think<00:03:49.419> they<00:03:50.419> took<00:03:50.630> such<00:03:50.840> an<00:03:50.989> aggressive

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
think they took such an aggressive

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.229 
think they took such an aggressive
stance<00:03:51.680> with<00:03:52.010> their<00:03:52.190> first<00:03:54.069> proposal<00:03:55.239> you

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
stance with their first proposal you

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.720 
stance with their first proposal you
know<00:03:56.359> and<00:03:57.069> we<00:03:58.069> could<00:03:58.220> have<00:03:58.310> taken<00:03:58.489> an

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
know and we could have taken an

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.490 
know and we could have taken an
aggressive<00:03:59.209> stance<00:03:59.419> the<00:03:59.660> other<00:03:59.840> way<00:04:00.049> and<00:04:00.290> and

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
aggressive stance the other way and and

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.000 
aggressive stance the other way and and
we<00:04:00.859> didn't<00:04:01.190> you<00:04:01.310> know<00:04:01.430> we<00:04:01.609> we<00:04:02.030> want<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.299> fix<00:04:03.010> the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
we didn't you know we we want to fix the

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.420 
we didn't you know we we want to fix the
systemic<00:04:04.609> issues<00:04:04.760> they<00:04:05.060> have<00:04:05.090> with<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:07.310> know

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
systemic issues they have with you know

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.800 
systemic issues they have with you know
the<00:04:07.549> way<00:04:07.669> things<00:04:07.730> are<00:04:08.090> run<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:10.720> think<00:04:11.720> for

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
the way things are run and I think for

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.330 
the way things are run and I think for
being<00:04:12.019> more<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.349> fair<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:12.739> doing<00:04:12.949> that<00:04:13.069> and

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
being more and fair and doing that and

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.349 
being more and fair and doing that and
you<00:04:13.970> know<00:04:14.090> I<00:04:14.120> I<00:04:15.820> really<00:04:16.820> don't<00:04:16.940> know<00:04:17.060> what

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
you know I I really don't know what

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.819 
you know I I really don't know what

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
that on some aspects you're in two

different<00:04:29.750> worlds<00:04:29.960> does<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:30.560> player<00:04:30.740> feel

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
this way too well I think they took such

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.490 
this way too well I think they took such
an<00:04:36.770> aggressive<00:04:37.040> approach<00:04:39.730> and<00:04:41.140> in<00:04:42.140> our<00:04:42.320> eyes

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
an aggressive approach and in our eyes

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.700 
an aggressive approach and in our eyes
we<00:04:43.990> took<00:04:44.990> an<00:04:45.140> approach<00:04:45.350> of<00:04:47.380> taking<00:04:48.380> some

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
we took an approach of taking some

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.370 
we took an approach of taking some
concessions<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.370> trying<00:04:49.580> to<00:04:49.670> fix<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.970> problem

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
concessions and trying to fix a problem

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930
