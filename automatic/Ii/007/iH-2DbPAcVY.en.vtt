00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.090
 very good kids that such videos of 

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:07.009
 new to the channel to a new video here 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.749
 you have a game in the game mode to 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.980
 butt I like a lot to play this mode 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.990
 of the game the truth that I would like 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.719
 get me one that does not something like that because if you 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.309
 the bags have to be the support no longer 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.160
 How good is the game mode to you? 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.450
 run and it's very cool so then 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.950
 I really like playing this game mode 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.830
 it seems that the games are ending very 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.120
 soon and good enough when you get out 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.560
 a streak so fast but when you 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.450
 begins to kill like that many times 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.850
 you also get mad the case is that 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.230
 I had here the fad and good a weapon that 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.720
 I was testing and I really liked it 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.690
 enough and I put on the assault harrows 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.430
 the sat with trinity what is called the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.020
 trinity rocket and another one already so I do not 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.820
 agreement but that dedicated 13 that you're going 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.680
 cutting we're going a shit of gusts that 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.930
 I have said many times that the streak 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.640
 is jumping from this game not like I do not 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.960
 they encourage you to take you away from texas 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.140
 as for example we did in white 2 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.820
 with the swarming dogs he was going to say 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.980
 the black see but I do not agree as 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.930
 they call whites sorry the case is that 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.430
 today I come to talk about a topic that I 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.770
 I had no conscience 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.030
 the other day a friend and said this to by 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.590
 Greg you can make a video because 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.920
 returning you report your pile of times 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.770
 on 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.220
 of the call of duty and this is about a 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.979
 so I'll come to give you a 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.509
 let's say a promotion that do not go anything 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.920
 with promoting this but good 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.740
 It seems interesting to upload it to the channel 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.170
 since good to many people can you 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.390
 benefit turns out that it has now taken 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.009
 a few cans of monster knows what 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.810
 is the monster the energy drink not 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.299
 type redbull type such it is the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.680
 monster we know this, now a 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.570
 You can find lots of cans in 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.399
 the Chinese in which you buy the drinks 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.649
 or whatever in the area where I bought you 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.690
 that soda if that if you buy it 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.600
 you can find some monsters that 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.729
 they have tattooed the this one the name of 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.619
 typical cold and it turns out that in the capita 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.080
 in the tula ring you start and behind 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.030
 has a code with that code you're going 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.229
 you're going to put in a page that I'm going 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.090
 to leave in the description is more now 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.220
 I'm going to do an example and you'll see what 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.810
 that they gave me to swap their links 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.069
 your account call of duty to me 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.280
 I imagine that you will all have an account of 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:07.610
 call of duty elite then they give you a 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.560
 prize can be a double x during 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.540
 a quarter to half a hour and then 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.000
 apart you can also give two 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.820
 emblems that here 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.740
 the image looked to see are these here 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.010
 is the first one, well, it's pretty 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.439
 cool and the second are also the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.329
 the image is that you put on your 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.519
 player card so here you see 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.879
 you are going to watch a video where I exchanged the 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.799
 game in which you redeemed the game where 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.239
 redeemed the code better said is a 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.430
 page that travels you in the description and 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.959
 here you see puts a draw and such it appears 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.239
 get these awards it seems to me that 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.970
 You also enter the prize draw 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.390
 older like xbox one and such and then I 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.519
 it seemed interesting I do not know to show you 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.950
 this because maybe someone is interested 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.629
 here sign in with my account and now 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.239
 you will see later how I am going to 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:57.120
 put the code I think it has about 13 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.549
 digits about yes I think they are 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.079
 13 digits be careful and look well 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.940
 the characters because it may be that you 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.720
 confuse something so here as you see 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.849
 I had copied the code, we pasted it 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.519
 there we are to send email and see what 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.409
 give me give me x doubles for 15 minutes 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.930
 put there so well here you have the 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.909
 example of how you exchange that yes no 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.370
 if you are very fond of getting them 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.230
 the emblems italy have liked you then 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.060
 you can buy a can master test 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.799
 luck or maybe friends that you have to 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.680
 they do not square with your type is that you can 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.810
 say about you or leave me the badge 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.129
 I can exchange it in the agent of the 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.440
 starting as I already tell you is pretty 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.599
 it was pretty much the same as it was 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.410
 well says the gameplay and I liked it 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.020
 because russia and quite 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.120
 I like the game mode to be 100 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.040
 low instead of 75 but still to me 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.380
 it makes me a bit short I would like 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.670
 that they introduced domain in tope are 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.430
 the truth would be the dick leave me the 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.480
 comments what do you think about that but 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.140
 would be to tell you infinity ward 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.370
 enter your domain to the truth 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.800
 It would be very cool because to me this way 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.380
 of game convinces me enough so that 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.540
 you know it 's 100 casualties with the fach ya 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.160
 I say it 's pretty good and the proof of 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.010
 the few of the few weapons that I 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.930
 was to be tried in this game kills 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.790
 fast I do not know what does not move much in 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.080
 This case was carried without a silencer 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.630
 good thing is that when I go to try a gun 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.970
 new as everything goes by points I do not have 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.010
 to worry about having a level 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.570
 enough so nothing kids 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.520
 heading here is already going to end up getting to 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.840
 its a pleasure to tell you this and 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.030
 you know that my channel I always like 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.190
 have them informed of everything about 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.630
 call of duty I also hope that it has 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.380
 liked the video see you in the 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.380
 next goodbye
