rest<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.829> us<00:02:21.920> can't<00:02:22.159> match<00:02:23.709> yes<00:02:24.709> but<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.010> do

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
rest of us can't match yes but I do

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.710 
rest of us can't match yes but I do
believe<00:02:25.400> Obama<00:02:25.909> will<00:02:26.120> win<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.480> I'll<00:02:26.569> be

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
believe Obama will win and I'll be

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.089 
believe Obama will win and I'll be
surprised<00:02:27.110> if<00:02:27.260> he<00:02:27.349> doesn't<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.739> think<00:02:27.769> he's<00:02:28.069> a

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
surprised if he doesn't I think he's a

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.860 
surprised if he doesn't I think he's a
good<00:02:28.340> candidate<00:02:28.849> he's<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> smart<00:02:29.450> man<00:02:29.629> he's

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
good candidate he's a smart man he's

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.839 
good candidate he's a smart man he's
shown<00:02:30.140> growth<00:02:30.470> as<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.739> candidate<00:02:33.609> because<00:02:34.609> you

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
shown growth as a candidate because you

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.890 
shown growth as a candidate because you
were<00:02:34.970> governor<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.390> Arkansas<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:38.150> think<00:02:38.750> who's

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
were governor of Arkansas I think who's

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.780 
were governor of Arkansas I think who's
qualified<00:02:39.140> well<00:02:39.709> Sarah<00:02:40.099> Palin<00:02:40.430> because<00:02:40.519> she

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
qualified well Sarah Palin because she

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.979 
qualified well Sarah Palin because she
was<00:02:40.909> the<00:02:41.030> governor<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.599> you<00:02:41.720> were<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
was the governor and you were the

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.869 
was the governor and you were the
governor<00:02:42.140> when<00:02:42.439> I<00:02:42.470> was<00:02:42.709> elected<00:02:43.099> though<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.280> I

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
governor when I was elected though I I

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.869 
governor when I was elected though I I
was<00:02:44.359> I<00:02:44.569> was<00:02:44.840> just<00:02:44.870> Barack<00:02:45.859> Obama's<00:02:46.340> age<00:02:46.519> we're

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
was I was just Barack Obama's age we're

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.119 
was I was just Barack Obama's age we're
almost<00:02:47.030> exactly<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.659> same<00:02:47.720> age<00:02:48.049> were<00:02:48.620> then<00:02:48.920> I

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
almost exactly the same age were then I

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.210 
almost exactly the same age were then I
can<00:02:49.430> still<00:02:49.609> remember<00:02:49.730> them<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.950> but<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:51.980> was

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
can still remember them and but I was

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.740 
can still remember them and but I was
the<00:02:52.310> longest-serving<00:02:52.700> governor<00:02:53.000> in<00:02:53.329> America

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
the longest-serving governor in America

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.629 
the longest-serving governor in America
so<00:02:54.409> President<00:02:54.980> Bush<00:02:55.129> said<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.370> wasn't

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
so President Bush said I wasn't

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.610 
so President Bush said I wasn't
qualified<00:02:55.909> and<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.629> wasn't<00:02:56.870> as<00:02:57.049> qualified<00:02:57.500> as

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
qualified and I wasn't as qualified as

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.009 
qualified and I wasn't as qualified as
he<00:02:57.739> was<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.069> international<00:02:58.639> issues<00:02:58.909> but<00:02:59.659> I<00:02:59.689> was

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
he was on international issues but I was

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.020 
he was on international issues but I was
more<00:03:00.200> qualified<00:03:00.709> on<00:03:00.889> the<00:03:01.010> economic<00:03:01.700> issues

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
more qualified on the economic issues

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.399 
more qualified on the economic issues
and<00:03:02.180> those<00:03:02.329> are<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.599> things<00:03:02.720> that<00:03:02.870> dominated

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
and those are the things that dominated

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.539 
and those are the things that dominated
the<00:03:03.470> 92<00:03:03.829> election<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.540> think<00:03:05.540> that<00:03:06.109> I<00:03:06.980> got<00:03:07.519> a

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
the 92 election I think that I got a

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.940 
the 92 election I think that I got a
little<00:03:07.909> kind<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.989> bum<00:03:09.170> rap<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.590> thought<00:03:09.799> well

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
little kind of a bum rap I thought well

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.339 
little kind of a bum rap I thought well
I<00:03:09.980> said<00:03:10.510> system<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.569> thought<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.840> was<00:03:11.989> indirectly

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
I said system I thought I was indirectly

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.050 
I said system I thought I was indirectly
criticizing<00:03:13.069> senator<00:03:13.400> Obama<00:03:13.639> and<00:03:13.730> I<00:03:13.849> said

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
criticizing senator Obama and I said

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.819 
criticizing senator Obama and I said
having<00:03:14.540> been<00:03:14.689> there<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.349> could<00:03:15.530> argue<00:03:15.709> that

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
having been there you could argue that

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.439 
having been there you could argue that
nobody's<00:03:16.340> ever<00:03:16.430> fully<00:03:16.760> qualified<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.269> be

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:17.449 
nobody's ever fully qualified to be

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:18.759 
nobody's ever fully qualified to be
President<00:03:17.900> -<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.079> take<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:18.410> because<00:03:18.530> it's

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
President - you take it because it's

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.830 
President - you take it because it's
such<00:03:18.949> a<00:03:18.980> unique<00:03:19.669> job<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.419> you<00:03:20.480> have<00:03:20.599> to<00:03:20.720> learn

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
such a unique job and you have to learn

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.789 
such a unique job and you have to learn
things<00:03:21.109> as<00:03:21.290> you<00:03:21.410> go<00:03:21.560> but<00:03:23.230> there's<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.260> point<00:03:24.590> of

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
things as you go but there's a point of

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.619 
things as you go but there's a point of
there<00:03:25.010> is<00:03:25.190> but<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:25.459> think<00:03:25.819> I<00:03:26.000> think<00:03:26.030> he's<00:03:26.449> ready

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
there is but I think I think he's ready

there is but I think I think he's ready
to<00:03:26.750> be<00:03:26.930> President<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.680> think<00:03:27.980> McCain's

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
to be President and I think McCain's

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.770 
to be President and I think McCain's
ready<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:28.699> be<00:03:28.819> President<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.299> think<00:03:29.359> you<00:03:29.599> gotta
