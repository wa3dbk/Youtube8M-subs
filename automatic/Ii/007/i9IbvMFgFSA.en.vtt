just to stick their like count up take
it<00:00:53.730> depends<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:54.760> little<00:00:54.910> break

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
it depends a little break

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.770 
it depends a little break
however<00:00:57.010> previously<00:00:57.820> in<00:00:57.880> my<00:00:57.910> video<00:00:59.190> these

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.920 
I just melted the chocolate Derrick to
use<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.450> brush<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:28.590> much<00:01:28.800> easier<00:01:28.830> for<00:01:29.160> me<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
use a brush be much easier for me and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.440 
use a brush be much easier for me and
try<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.960> make<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.320> kind<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.040> thick<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.270> will

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
try to make it kind of thick so it will

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:43.670 
try to make it kind of thick so it will
be<00:01:33.600> much<00:01:33.780> easier<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.260> take<00:01:34.440> it<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.800> now<00:01:42.680> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
be much easier to take it out now to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.040 
be much easier to take it out now to
take<00:01:44.010> them<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.460> first<00:01:44.940> thing<00:01:45.210> I'm<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.900> going

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
that's it

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.380 
that's it
it's<00:03:28.380> much<00:03:28.680> better<00:03:28.890> using<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.819> punishment

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
it's much better using the punishment

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.260 
it's much better using the punishment
