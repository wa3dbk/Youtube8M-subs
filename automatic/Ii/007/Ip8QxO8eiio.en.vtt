00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.249
 then the boys I'm male and I'll say 

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:17.690
 welcome to the first and episode of the 

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:19.400
 my news section from the tube code and in 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.039
 this first episode I would like to talk about 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.350
 a very, very recent topic that 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.000
 were you 20 will also know for 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.010
 case or the issue makes vigilance but 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.940
 I do not want to mention in particular is 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.339
 vj but mostly of the situation one is 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.710
 came to create 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:41.359
 in short, I state that I follow 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.989
 he has been vigilant since he was in the shard 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:48.469
 gaming success and that still continues 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:52.719
 I like it like youtube and therefore not 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.249
 I'm against fa vj let me know 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.589
 I'm not against anyone else on YouTube 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:01:00.109
 it was absolutely because I see anyway 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.670
 a little bit of everyone's video 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.380
 youtuber I'm not a person he wants 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.439
 create there who or what like that 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.360
 so let's talk about the situation 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.369
 that has been created 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.009
 that is this fury of people 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:23.240
 against three videos or in any case the channel in 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.539
 generate general channels in fact a little bit 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.980
 there was a long time ago 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:33.590
 it was kiko 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:35.930
 who made a video up against fa vj 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.110
 that is, you who was not vigilant against it 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.500
 against va vj was in short a kind of 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.830
 exaggerated criticism and this led 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.060
 to create a great debate of its own 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:54.170
 a furious argument between family fans e 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.380
 those who instead go against me now 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.930
 I mean I state that I don't 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.110
 like that kind of video because 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.710
 there are people like that who decide 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.970
 to create a reputation on youtube 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.770
 doing criticism even enough 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.330
 offensive in terms of against 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.780
 other youtubers who have more 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.820
 success ie apart from the fact that it 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.160
 i find a stupid thing 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.500
 I'm not saying anything against fo kiko 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.860
 other youtube of the kind the tastes are 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.240
 taste that is my personal opinion 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.190
 I find it a bit stupid in 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.560
 how much i like all that 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.350
 receive with those videos from those who 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.900
 follow your thought receive 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.600
 I do not like as many from those who instead a 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.730
 which those who like instead maybe 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.350
 those youtuber who criticized that 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.090
 however they don't share your way 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.190
 to do I am not a person who 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.440
 puts I don't like videos mostly 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.590
 comment expressing my opinion 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.640
 without insulting anyone but I noticed 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.590
 however there are a total of mi 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.209
 like equivalent to the total of not me 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.080
 i like that i don't think it takes you 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.080
 very far away 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.900
 therefore to make success we say between 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:19.340
 with quotes such as video 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.670
 he found apart from one thing only those who own 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.710
 has a lot of self-esteem he can do e 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.240
 that is still enough 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.160
 brave as you are ready to 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.910
 receive criticism of criticism of crises e 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:38.050
 even rather serious offenses I say that 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:41.300
 why why criticize and insult 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.300
 of youtubers who only do what they do 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.880
 he likes to take the example 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.630
 in fact the wi fi video was in effect because 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.400
 enjoys doing those videos by doing 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.930
 those videos so it's fun too 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.480
 lots of other people 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.350
 I read the comments he receives in 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.540
 his videos 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.570
 there are so many more people 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.730
 kids but still lots of people 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.320
 commenting on his videos saying he was 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.600
 a little down your videos have me 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.760
 raised my spirits I enjoy a 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.930
 bag following t 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.780
 thank you so keep me bring me the 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.770
 smile in the most tense moments and these 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.320
 things like that 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.030
 in short, it does no harm to anyone 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.550
 I bother you if you continue to 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.990
 publish these videos this i would like 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.600
 know in short 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.000
 so I would like to know why you go 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.040
 I did against these youtuber 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.170
 the example of fa vj because what in 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.730
 this period is more in the midst of 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.740
 to the fight between the fans but anyway 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.930
 any other youtubers video file 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.610
 just for fun maybe oh well there 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.200
 also earns some money but that 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.780
 it does eventually make them do it for 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.669
 have fun and entertain others 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.830
 there are a lot of people there 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.780
 they enjoy it so why should it 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.570
 go against him 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.370
 what else do you not look at them if you have seen 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.960
 you didn't like a couple of videos 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.090
 maybe write constructive criticism 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.900
 for example sorry I don't like this 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.090
 particular maybe you would do better at 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.870
 change this thing is just a 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.450
 council 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.810
 I don't like your son-in-law anyway 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.650
 these things so without saying you suck 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.930
 picked up from youtube 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.220
 if the face of the Italian community 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.760
 these things so that does not make sense 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.470
 therefore I am of this opinion 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.120
 constructive criticism otherwise I do not follow 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.280
 just the channel if you don't like them 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.510
 those videos I'm going to see the videos of 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.820
 channels I like 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:42.470
 everything here so now I would like to know a 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.420
