00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 a 737 how much do you want it 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.370
 be careful that we saw you a little 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.370
 entertained in those classes let's see 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.969
 boys now my dreams if you 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.830
 turned into reality I'm about to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.830
 pilot a 737 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:30.390
 rare radio the most sophisticated of the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.829
 mission no no no I do not mean in 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.360
 radio stations because I like it 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.360
 handle this thing with music 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960
 is 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.960
 the capital since the procedure is 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.970
 fulfilled this automatic motorcycle that make 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.410
 the pilots during that time of all 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.260
 those asked that we go to the cabin 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.420
 main good us when we have already 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.690
 done everything is the senate by plane and 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.300
 we are level to cruise the pilots 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.640
 what we do is safety first 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.310
 of flight we must be aware of 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.770
 any minimum change within what 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.840
 means the navigation or the device 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.240
 same plane in the part of the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.420
 systems navigation and 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.190
 communications how many hours in a 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.670
 simulator like this should happen a 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.159
 aspiring to become a pilot 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.009
 good is divided into two parts this is a 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.800
 fixed simulator should have roughly 25 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.470
 hours in the simulator 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.480
 and then 25 hours in a full simulator 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.750
 motion with which you were flying to your 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.360
 moment but much bigger yes and in 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.970
 total is 50 hours after that you're going to 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.570
 regular an airplane let's prepare 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.310
 for the landing we are at 13,000 at 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.310
 landing the hardest 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:04.170
 degrees although I already have my hands 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:11.620
 all symptoms are interned the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:13.690
 passengers are full power up 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.080
 now they take away some power or that there 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.080
 a little bit 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.380
 or 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.909
 attention gentlemen passengers lines arcs 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.909
 he has decided not to charge him the ticket
