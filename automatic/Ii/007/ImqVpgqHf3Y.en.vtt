city that's how I perceived it in the
past<00:01:13.660> you<00:01:14.170> know<00:01:14.290> as<00:01:14.440> a<00:01:14.470> kind<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:14.890> like

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
materializing with all its kind of

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.810 
materializing with all its kind of
buildings<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.710> advertising<00:01:21.460> but<00:01:21.670> then

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
buildings and advertising but then

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.360 
buildings and advertising but then
specifically<00:01:22.330> also<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:23.710> way<00:01:23.860> people<00:01:24.040> look

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
specifically also the way people look

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.310 
specifically also the way people look
very<00:01:24.700> very<00:01:24.790> different<00:01:25.060> from<00:01:25.750> one<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.170> each

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
very very different from one to each

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.530 
very very different from one to each
other<00:01:26.560> it's<00:01:27.070> not<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.310> city<00:01:27.580> that<00:01:27.760> has<00:01:27.910> one<00:01:28.150> style

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
other it's not a city that has one style

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.820 
other it's not a city that has one style
question<00:01:29.140> is<00:01:29.229> happening<00:01:29.590> in<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.770> streets

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
question is happening in the streets

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.650 
question is happening in the streets
here<00:01:30.340> also<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.930> I<00:01:32.820> think<00:01:33.820> that<00:01:33.970> was<00:01:34.120> more<00:01:34.330> kind

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
here also so I think that was more kind

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.990 
here also so I think that was more kind
of<00:01:34.900> mindset<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.040> an<00:01:36.160> attitude<00:01:36.580> that<00:01:36.610> I<00:01:36.940> took

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
of mindset and an attitude that I took

00:01:37.000 --> 00:02:01.750 
of mindset and an attitude that I took
as<00:01:37.300> an<00:01:37.420> inspiration

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.820
