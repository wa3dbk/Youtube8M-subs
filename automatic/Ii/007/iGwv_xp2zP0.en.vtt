00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.910
 Talk here about tibi before the city 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.410
 lost is and before starting the video I 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.810
 I think I have to talk to you. 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.210
 Once again I'm late with the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.399
 videos is so one more time I ask 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.130
 Sorry, because I know who 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.450
 accompanies a channel usually 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.000
 watch the videos with a certain 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.820
 frequency and my frequency 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.210
 usually a weekly frequency 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.790
 What happens is that I'm in a 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.989
 I'm moving to a transition period 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.960
 city 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.820
 so I had to go to another city 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.879
 find a house I'm going to have to take 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.059
 Several things there are still changing. 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.949
 of employment is also a seminar period 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.350
 in college several presentations of 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.299
 work is so entered in period that I 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.279
 I have to do the tests. 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.999
 so let's say the time for me 

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:16.950
 It's a little scarce but whenever 

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:18.749
 I could, I'll bring something. 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.569
 new for you here because I also 

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:23.399
 accompanied the channels is not channels of you 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:25.529
 more accompanies other channels 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.009
 I like watching with a certain 

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:31.649
 frequency and are you waiting for such a day? 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.959
 to see that there and the person does not 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.529
 a bit frustrating because the annoying but 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:40.919
 I also know that sometimes the situation of 

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:43.079
 each one is a different situation and we are going 

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:45.179
 It matters to the video that we go. 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.219
 formerly south of Cali there is a 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.409
 island that was the weight of civilization 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.079
 human with the help of the gods that 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.479
 city grew and prospered points out that 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.489
 no other civilization has come the same 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.429
 level this city was called the 

00:01:56.489 --> 00:02:00.689
 formerly a rich and powerful city where 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.179
 no enemy was strong enough 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.729
 to oppose them as time to 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:08.129
 civilization and had previously believed that 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.679
 were the masters of the world have come to 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.180
 forget the gods that another time 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.819
 helped these gods by seeing this 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.819
 the action turned away from 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.549
 sda 2 of necessity and finally the city 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.260
 was condemned by the forces of evil 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.180
 when I heard this team story before 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.359
 I was a bit puzzled and decided 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.480
 search to see if there really was 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:33.700
 some island to the south of meat and which was 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.689
 my surprise really exists there 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.450
 two daughters 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:40.420
 one is the 10 island of the left here that the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.000
 aaa as love kings and also has this 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.689
 small island that lies within the gulf 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.120
 of Kings 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:48.489
 researching a little more and I find out 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.730
 that the island that is located south of 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.930
 meat is called an ice off solitude at 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.549
 island of solitude and formerly it was 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.040
 game masters game chance 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.370
 Who matters were people who were 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.219
 appointed by sic soft to help 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.989
 control the game but nowadays they 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.930
 no longer exist only the 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.659
 customer support that are people who are 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.769
 employees of cip soft and supervises the 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.840
 game the same way 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.690
 obviously there was no famous speech 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.780
 system is a system of skulls and 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.209
 punishment for who was pk for those who kill 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.849
 other players was made directly 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.949
 by gms or creators of the game 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.769
 this photo here we can see guido 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:35.379
 who carried a sin on the island and 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.900
 killed the same in this photo here we 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:41.680
 can see a gm that had as the city 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.079
 natal the residence of others solitude 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.079
 not only this gm with many others 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.519
 they had there like this little island that 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.709
 it is south of meat 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.769
 in this latest photo we can see 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:57.430
 there are several emmys that control the game 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:00.729
 which helps staff and the part of the 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.549
 player support is directly on the 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:05.889
 island and if you can see here that it was already 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.290
 changed dramatically since that photo to 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.780
 people can see the farewell of the twins 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.790
 people who contributed to the game and 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.549
 were normal players who were 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.070
 nominated by cip luck is this here is the 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.900
 meeting room and on the day they did 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.330
 A small party to say goodbye to 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.950
 everyone for being the island of the gods 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.270
 We can also see here that she 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.250
 has a prison 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.650
 and inside the prison there are some 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.990
 people who are sleeping there and the 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.539
 character the way it was there gold 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.210
 in all the beds and can see who they were 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.699
 people and finally in this last photo the 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.250
 people can see here the last floor of the 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.860
 island of the gods owns a teleport 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.819
 I do not know what it's for I do not know where 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.310
 go 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:50.139
 I never ran away, and no one ever. 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.970
 talked a lot about this one 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.449
 Good guys, we got to the end of 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.669
 one more video we can see there that the art 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.139
 ever had before has a relationship much has 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.330
 a very similar story with the 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.360
 history of AtlÃ¢ntida which was also a 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.130
 city that was submerged but at last I hope 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.409
