00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
here again with another video unboxing

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.920 
here again with another video unboxing
for<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:05.040> guys<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.549> today's<00:00:06.150> video<00:00:06.750> unboxing

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
for you guys and today's video unboxing

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.310 
for you guys and today's video unboxing
is<00:00:07.529> just<00:00:07.950> going<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.189> be<00:00:08.370> on<00:00:08.610> an<00:00:08.910> SSD<00:00:09.570> so<00:00:10.080> it's

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
is just going to be on an SSD so it's

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.320 
is just going to be on an SSD so it's
going<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.469> be<00:00:10.559> pretty<00:00:10.769> quick<00:00:11.040> but<00:00:11.460> well<00:00:12.269> I

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
going to be pretty quick but well I

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.299 
going to be pretty quick but well I
guess<00:00:12.509> maybe<00:00:12.809> not<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.080> quick<00:00:13.679> because<00:00:13.889> um

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
guess maybe not that quick because um

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.369 
guess maybe not that quick because um
this<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.759> kind<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.179> different<00:00:15.480> sse<00:00:16.170> than

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
this is kind of a different sse than

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.470 
this is kind of a different sse than
what<00:00:16.529> you'd<00:00:16.710> see<00:00:16.949> normally<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:17.609> normally<00:00:18.330> it's

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
what you'd see normally so normally it's

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.849 
what you'd see normally so normally it's
going<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.660> come<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.020> like<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> two<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.680> half

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
going to come in like a two and a half

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.519 
going to come in like a two and a half
inch<00:00:20.220> or<00:00:21.029> i<00:00:21.060> guess<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:21.449> well<00:00:22.140> they<00:00:22.289> do<00:00:22.350> have

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
inch or i guess like well they do have

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.240 
inch or i guess like well they do have
those<00:00:22.890> like<00:00:23.160> 1.8<00:00:23.699> inch<00:00:24.000> SSDs<00:00:24.869> i<00:00:25.140> guess<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.650> a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
those like 1.8 inch SSDs i guess to a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.450 
those like 1.8 inch SSDs i guess to a
little<00:00:26.760> box<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.890> that's<00:00:28.890> usually<00:00:29.130> going<00:00:29.369> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
little box and that's usually going to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.370 
little box and that's usually going to
be<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:29.699> SSD<00:00:30.000> goes<00:00:30.420> into<00:00:30.720> your<00:00:30.750> desktop<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
be your SSD goes into your desktop it

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.830 
be your SSD goes into your desktop it
goes<00:00:31.529> into<00:00:31.710> your<00:00:31.890> laptop<00:00:32.160> or<00:00:32.809> anything<00:00:33.809> like

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
goes into your laptop or anything like

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.080 
goes into your laptop or anything like
that<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:35.130> know<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.250> runs<00:00:35.520> off<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.730> SATA

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
that and you know it runs off the SATA

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.900 
that and you know it runs off the SATA
interface<00:00:36.739> usually<00:00:37.739> SATA<00:00:37.950> 3<00:00:38.250> 6<00:00:38.520> gigabit

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
interface usually SATA 3 6 gigabit

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.910 
interface usually SATA 3 6 gigabit
nowadays<00:00:39.239> but<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:40.020> had<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.410> old

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
nowadays but you know they had the old

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.830 
nowadays but you know they had the old
satyr<00:00:41.309> ones<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:41.850> pretty<00:00:42.329> much<00:00:42.390> they<00:00:42.719> all

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
satyr ones but pretty much they all

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.200 
satyr ones but pretty much they all
looked<00:00:43.079> sort<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:45.090> we

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
looked sort of a like so what we

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.510 
looked sort of a like so what we
actually<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.780> here<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.350> quite<00:00:47.039> different

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
actually have here is quite different

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.990 
actually have here is quite different
it's<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.969> ocz<00:00:48.629> revodrive<00:00:48.930> 3<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.190> it's

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
it's the ocz revodrive 3 and it's

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.750 
it's the ocz revodrive 3 and it's
actually<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.390> bootable<00:00:52.100> pci<00:00:53.100> express

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
actually a bootable pci express

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.869 
actually a bootable pci express
solid-state<00:00:54.629> drive<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:56.039> runs<00:00:56.190> off<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.430> pci

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
solid-state drive so it runs off the pci

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.049 
solid-state drive so it runs off the pci
express<00:00:58.100> interface<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.489> actually<00:00:59.699> runs

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
express interface and it actually runs

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.050 
express interface and it actually runs
off<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.239> pci<00:01:00.809> express<00:01:01.500> gen<00:01:01.859> 2<00:01:02.570> for<00:01:03.570> X<00:01:04.040> slot<00:01:05.060> so

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
off the pci express gen 2 for X slot so

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.600 
off the pci express gen 2 for X slot so
you<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.900> need<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.290> pci<00:01:07.740> express<00:01:08.070> slot

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
you are going to need a pci express slot

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.280 
you are going to need a pci express slot
in<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.180> Jesus<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.900> isn't<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.229> to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
in or in Jesus so this isn't going to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.800 
in or in Jesus so this isn't going to
work<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.619> your<00:01:10.740> laptop<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.659> it's<00:01:12.659> only

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
work with your laptop and it's only

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.480 
work with your laptop and it's only
going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> work<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> desktop<00:01:14.189> that

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
going to work with like a desktop that

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.300 
going to work with like a desktop that
actually<00:01:15.030> has<00:01:15.180> pci<00:01:15.600> express<00:01:16.009> slots<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.189> them

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
actually has pci express slots on them

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.730 
actually has pci express slots on them
which<00:01:17.549> pretty<00:01:18.180> much<00:01:18.270> every<00:01:18.840> desktops<00:01:19.500> has

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
which pretty much every desktops has

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.070 
which pretty much every desktops has
unless<00:01:20.340> you've<00:01:20.520> got<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.990> graphics<00:01:21.990> card

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
unless you've got like a graphics card

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.899 
unless you've got like a graphics card
or<00:01:22.350> something<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> sound<00:01:23.070> card<00:01:23.340> install<00:01:23.490> on

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
or something or a sound card install on

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.810 
or something or a sound card install on
top<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.890> basically<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.220> thing<00:01:26.490> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
top of it so basically this thing is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
top of it so basically this thing is
going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.509> one<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> your<00:01:28.680> fastest<00:01:29.479> SSDs<00:01:30.710> out

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
going to be one of your fastest SSDs out

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.219 
going to be one of your fastest SSDs out
on<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> market<00:01:32.640> today<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.409> um<00:01:34.640> this<00:01:35.640> thing<00:01:36.229> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
on the market today and um this thing is

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.380 
on the market today and um this thing is
supposed<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.950> blow<00:01:38.189> away<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.759> everything

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
supposed to blow away like everything

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.880 
supposed to blow away like everything
else<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.920> that's<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.850> uses<00:01:42.890> dual

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
else and that's because it uses dual

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.400 
else and that's because it uses dual

use<00:02:04.690> trim<00:02:05.080> on<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.850> know<00:02:07.170> even<00:02:08.170> though<00:02:08.290> you're

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
use trim on you know even though you're

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.540 
use trim on you know even though you're
using<00:02:08.649> like<00:02:08.890> two<00:02:09.300> controllers<00:02:10.530> aggregated

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
using like two controllers aggregated

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.170 
using like two controllers aggregated
speed<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:14.110> also<00:02:14.260> got<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:15.190> ocz<00:02:15.700> super

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
speed and you also got this ocz super

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.870 
speed and you also got this ocz super
scale<00:02:16.690> storage<00:02:17.410> accelerator<00:02:18.130> that<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.790> know

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
scale storage accelerator that you know

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.090 
scale storage accelerator that you know
also<00:02:19.090> helps<00:02:19.510> doing<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.020> load<00:02:20.500> balancing<00:02:21.010> and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
also helps doing the load balancing and

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.210 
also helps doing the load balancing and
everything<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.920> basically<00:02:23.920> yeah

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
everything like that but basically yeah

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.360 
everything like that but basically yeah
you've<00:02:24.430> got<00:02:24.460> to<00:02:24.940> SF<00:02:25.420> 2281<00:02:26.370> sandforce

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
you've got to SF 2281 sandforce

asynchronous NAND flash and of course

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.990 
asynchronous NAND flash and of course
you've<00:02:40.450> also<00:02:40.630> got<00:02:40.930> eight<00:02:41.350> gigs<00:02:41.740> dedicated<00:02:42.700> to

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
you've also got eight gigs dedicated to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.340 
you've also got eight gigs dedicated to
the<00:02:44.040> over-provisioning<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:47.200> know<00:02:47.290> you

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
the over-provisioning so you know you

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.130 
the over-provisioning so you know you
only<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.830> 120<00:02:48.370> gigs<00:02:48.820> left<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.480> but

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
only have 120 gigs left of that but

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.729 
only have 120 gigs left of that but
otherwise<00:02:51.720> supposed<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.810> be<00:02:52.930> very<00:02:52.959> fast<00:02:53.440> so

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
otherwise supposed to be very fast so

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.229 
otherwise supposed to be very fast so
I'm<00:02:54.130> going<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.280> show<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.459> a<00:02:54.550> quick<00:02:54.700> benchmark

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
I'm going to show you a quick benchmark

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.770 
I'm going to show you a quick benchmark
I<00:02:55.360> ran<00:02:55.570> off<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.590> doe<00:02:56.680> disc<00:02:57.340> bench<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:57.940> as<00:02:58.660> you

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
I ran off of a doe disc bench and as you

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.810 
I ran off of a doe disc bench and as you
can<00:02:58.930> see<00:02:58.959> I'm<00:02:59.260> using<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.650> cued<00:02:59.950> up<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.280> 4<00:03:00.550> and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
can see I'm using a cued up of 4 and

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.820 
can see I'm using a cued up of 4 and
basically<00:03:01.209> these<00:03:01.930> drives<00:03:02.320> right<00:03:02.470> here<00:03:02.680> they

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
basically these drives right here they

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.750 
basically these drives right here they
are<00:03:02.980> workstation<00:03:03.580> class<00:03:03.850> drives<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:05.760> because

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
are workstation class drives and because

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.940 
are workstation class drives and because
this<00:03:07.000> thing<00:03:07.270> actually<00:03:07.570> uses<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.650> know<00:03:08.770> the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
this thing actually uses you know the

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.710 
this thing actually uses you know the
aggregated<00:03:09.489> load<00:03:09.790> balancing<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.390> all<00:03:10.510> that

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
aggregated load balancing and all that

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.050 
aggregated load balancing and all that
as<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.590> can<00:03:11.739> see<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.130> numbers<00:03:12.580> are<00:03:12.790> just

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
as you can see the numbers are just

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.320 
as you can see the numbers are just
going<00:03:13.330> in<00:03:13.480> pretty<00:03:14.020> insane<00:03:14.410> pretty<00:03:14.830> fast<00:03:15.330> by

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
going in pretty insane pretty fast by

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.210 
going in pretty insane pretty fast by
the<00:03:16.420> time<00:03:16.720> we<00:03:16.900> reach<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.410> bottom<00:03:17.620> of<00:03:18.040> the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
the time we reach the bottom of the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.280 
the time we reach the bottom of the
charts<00:03:18.610> i<00:03:18.760> mean<00:03:18.940> we're<00:03:19.150> hitting<00:03:19.480> about<00:03:19.570> one

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
charts i mean we're hitting about one

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.970 
charts i mean we're hitting about one
gigabyte<00:03:21.010> per<00:03:21.370> second<00:03:22.209> reeds<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.840> like<00:03:23.230> eight

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
gigabyte per second reeds and like eight

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.390 
gigabyte per second reeds and like eight
nine<00:03:24.430> hundred<00:03:25.440> megabyte<00:03:26.440> per<00:03:26.769> second<00:03:27.160> rights

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
nine hundred megabyte per second rights

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.630 
nine hundred megabyte per second rights
yes<00:03:28.090> that's<00:03:28.300> gigabyte<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:28.870> yes<00:03:29.320> that's

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
yes that's gigabyte and yes that's

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.240 
yes that's gigabyte and yes that's
megabytes<00:03:30.640> so<00:03:30.880> very<00:03:31.540> very<00:03:31.660> fast<00:03:32.019> drive<00:03:32.350> full
