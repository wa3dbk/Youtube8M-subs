 a beautiful day i show you today they are the IAAF of 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.880
 center console 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.679
 namely a Super Nintendo variant 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.149
 the game that on many different systems on each PC and 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.050
 Parts of the Swiss lie came 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.050
 where the Super Nintendo variant is clearly the most beautiful 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.710
 so crashed selected 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.260
 Name entered 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.180
 where it says 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.310
 only in the degree of difficulty I do not choose too much 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.030
 he saw was 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.470
 if so new arrived with land 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.140
 It has to be a nice spot for our dewy nuclear power plant 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.280
 must not miss any good city 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.940
 because of first power lines and build and folder industrial areas for work 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.440
 Bochmann years 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.440
 7 without moss 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.780
 first block of flats who are not bad 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.930
 against the right in the full go money he has 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.870
 to get a little bit to the menus 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.840
 and while I put these two diagrams here their building so 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.350
 Need for industrial and residential areas and here keep up 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.280
 Heap buttons 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.390
 why they do not have to be explained anymore 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.590
 can play memory and stuffiness set statistics on 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.660
 it could be like that 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.660
 and on the left the builders 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.000
 Tip such a public transport network that should not be missing happy 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.170
 the students are able to drive like that 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.670
 and Sonos on the way 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.810
 for those who are they still do not know SIM City is form this are 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.360
 sharper the Briton 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.360
 the team player grew up 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.869
 The answer is that the Briton comes in person so you tell 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.480
 were in high demand 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.969
 Sometimes he even gives a house to God 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.559
 finally I have to sleep on the street and have it off in the street 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.559
 Residential areas then grow particularly difficult 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.769
 so little time jump our city has become the big city 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:29.329
 and Szmal population as demanding as before now a football stadium 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.830
 but you do not have coal 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.830
 Beirut on to pump pumps and hate 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.479

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:41.040

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.989
 crime 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.599
 Syla agenda 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.139
 but if that is not all 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.840
 there are still dreams but out 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.810

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.249
