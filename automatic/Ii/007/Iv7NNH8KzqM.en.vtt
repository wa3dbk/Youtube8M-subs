with<00:00:07.470> ceramics<00:00:08.010> it's<00:00:08.220> less<00:00:08.460> of<00:00:08.490> an<00:00:08.730> expression

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
with ceramics it's less of an expression

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.419 
with ceramics it's less of an expression
of<00:00:09.360> like<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.630> personal<00:00:10.080> idea<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.740> more<00:00:11.070> just

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.879 
of like this personal idea and more just
like<00:00:11.929> this<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.080> what<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.230> think<00:00:13.410> will<00:00:13.500> feel<00:00:13.710> good

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
like this is what I think will feel good

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.189 
like this is what I think will feel good
in<00:00:14.040> my<00:00:14.160> hand<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:15.420> it's<00:00:15.929> just<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.170> different

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
in my hand and so it's just a different

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.019 
in my hand and so it's just a different
mindset<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.250> new<00:00:17.670> way<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.880> thinking

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
mindset and it's a new way of thinking

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.210 
mindset and it's a new way of thinking
about<00:00:18.420> making<00:00:19.020> things<00:00:19.170> from<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.529> which<00:00:19.710> does

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
about making things from you which does

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.150 
about making things from you which does
feel<00:00:20.460> freeing<00:00:21.080> this<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.260> porcelain<00:00:22.590> which<00:00:23.010> is

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
feel freeing this is porcelain which is

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.759 
feel freeing this is porcelain which is
really<00:00:23.789> soft<00:00:24.150> kind<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.170> nicest<00:00:25.410> to

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
really soft kind of like the nicest to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.580 
really soft kind of like the nicest to
throw<00:00:26.269> so<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.840> called<00:00:27.990> centering

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590

the clay when I first threw it down it

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.240 
the clay when I first threw it down it
was<00:00:31.080> like<00:00:31.109> wobbling<00:00:31.590> all<00:00:31.710> over<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> place

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
was like wobbling all over the place

apply pressure like both in and down at
the<00:00:38.010> same<00:00:38.100> time<00:00:38.550> my<00:00:38.910> background<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the same time my background is as a

and developed the prints myself which is
totally<00:00:43.590> dying<00:00:43.829> out<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:44.820> ceramics<00:00:45.329> it's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
totally dying out but with ceramics it's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.479 
totally dying out but with ceramics it's
like<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.170> way<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.320> do<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> same<00:00:47.309> way<00:00:47.430> you

like the way I do it is the same way you
would<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.820> done<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.059> 50<00:00:48.180> years<00:00:48.480> ago<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
would have done it 50 years ago it's the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.630 
would have done it 50 years ago it's the
same<00:00:49.230> way<00:00:49.350> people<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.309> 50

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
same way people are going to do it in 50

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.549 
same way people are going to do it in 50
years<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.940> can't<00:00:51.239> cut<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:51.989> too<00:00:52.260> many<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
years you can't cut out too many of

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.740 
years you can't cut out too many of
these<00:00:52.710> steps<00:00:53.100> I've<00:00:54.059> been<00:00:54.270> doing<00:00:54.449> production

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
these steps I've been doing production

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.869 
these steps I've been doing production
ceramics<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.530> about<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> year<00:00:56.010> before<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.550> it

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
ceramics for about a year before that it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.360 
ceramics for about a year before that it
was<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> hobby<00:00:57.420> my<00:00:58.260> skills<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.800> really<00:00:58.829> grown

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
was a hobby my skills have really grown

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.790 
was a hobby my skills have really grown
because<00:00:59.670> I<00:01:00.090> took<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.780> lot<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.020> classes<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> kid

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
because I took a lot of classes as a kid

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.130 
because I took a lot of classes as a kid
with<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.699> same<00:01:02.879> teacher<00:01:03.149> my<00:01:03.600> whole<00:01:03.629> childhood

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
with the same teacher my whole childhood

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.469 
with the same teacher my whole childhood
and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.040> took<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.580> class<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.270> college

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
and then I took one class in college

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.149 
and then I took one class in college
when<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.930> studied<00:01:07.229> abroad<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.890> was<00:01:08.010> it

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
when I studied abroad and that was it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 
when I studied abroad and that was it
for<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:08.610> formal<00:01:09.119> training<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:10.200> then<00:01:10.350> I

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
for all my formal training and then I

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.859 
for all my formal training and then I
just<00:01:10.650> kind<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.920> start<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.390> gradually<00:01:12.390> thin<00:01:12.720> out

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
just kind of start to gradually thin out

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.200 
just kind of start to gradually thin out
the<00:01:13.049> sides<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.770> walls<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.670> really<00:01:14.970> can't

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210

in<00:02:22.620> there<00:02:22.739> that's<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.070> an<00:02:23.400> experiment

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
in there that's like an experiment

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.030 
in there that's like an experiment
because<00:02:24.810> otherwise<00:02:25.080> every<00:02:25.500> time<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.830> open

know exactly how they're going to come
out<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.500> just<00:02:31.680> becomes<00:02:31.950> rote<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.610> doesn't

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
out it just becomes rote and it doesn't

out it just becomes rote and it doesn't
