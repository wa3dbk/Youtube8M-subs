00:00:00.573 --> 00:00:06.298
 An interesting problem for a hunter hunting or hunter candidate, or 

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:14.852
 candidates for possession of any weapons, or if you have a sentence specifically related to alcohol 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.705
 if there are any chances to regain a gun permit. 

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:27.693
 Hi, my name is Darek Kraśnicki, I am a doctor authorized to carry out tests for weapons and for protection licenses. 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.482
 From Wroclaw. 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.217
 And I will start with the query of my viewer. 

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:39.548
 "Hello, I have read and watched you expressly, because I have a problem with a gun permit. 

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:49.927
 I had permission for hunting weapons, I lost it because I had a sentence in 2010 and after the verdict I try 

00:00:49.927 --> 00:00:54.552
 for permission again. 

00:00:54.552 --> 00:01:02.006
 I started all procedures connected with this, I passed positively medical examinations, I underwent psychological examinations 

00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:09.954
 but the police appealed against these positive judgments and sent me for research to my psychologist from Częstochowa 

00:01:11.142 --> 00:01:15.225
 to the appeal psychologist, and then to the institute in Sosnowiec. 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.039
 And here my problem begins because the psychologist's examination came out negatively, so according to the procedures there is no point 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:33.457
 to go to Sosnowiec for medical examinations, because it will not do anything despite a positive result. 

00:01:34.236 --> 00:01:40.160
 The main question - after what period of time I can try again to pass this research and whether it is possible to appeal from 

00:01:40.677 --> 00:01:41.730
 this negative opinion. 

00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:43.520
 Please reply". 

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:52.300
 Well, from my experience, unfortunately - I had several such cases that the patient - or candidate for the hunter, 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.750
 or a hunter who, let me say he lost his permission, concealed a court sentence from me, often it was connected 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.910
 with alcohol driving or some domestic violence. 

00:02:05.485 --> 00:02:08.620
 Also, so to speak after this non-carbonated stimulant. 

00:02:09.622 --> 00:02:19.420
 And often they were sentences from a few years ago, I remember a case of a hunter that he had a negative judgment from 4 years ago, 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.240
 of course, I got positive for me, but the police appealed and put in a good word. 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:35.790
 As a rule, the police inform the appeal body of the reason for this judgment or some other offenses as they write, 

00:02:35.794 --> 00:02:40.570
 the appeal is so cleverly written that it is clear what's going on. 

00:02:41.276 --> 00:02:47.760
 Well, at least for my patients, all the appeals, which I received positively 

00:02:48.162 --> 00:02:52.560
 all appeal decisions ended with negative results for them. 

00:02:53.303 --> 00:02:58.180
 As it is in other parts of Poland ... how is it with you? 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.470
 I suppose it is very similar, because I sincerely doubt whether anybody - a doctor or a psychologist will sign a decision 

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:16.506
 as he has written knowledge about alcohol problems or some other problems that caused the judgment, the candidate 

00:03:16.506 --> 00:03:17.820
 for a gun permit. 

00:03:18.644 --> 00:03:24.480
 Nevertheless, despite the court's verdict, you have succeeded in undergoing arms appeal investigations 

00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:34.280
 of course, I am talking here about the cancellation from the Police, it is necessary to comment on this video, it may be useful to someone with a similar problem. 

00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:40.430
 I think so privately that it is a waste of time and money, but maybe it is different. 

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:48.898
 A waste of time, because it costs several hundred zlotys, as you heard there, you must go to the Institute of Occupational Medicine - to Sosnowiec, 

00:03:48.898 --> 00:03:54.560
 to Łódź, if you are out-of-town, maybe there will be you in one day. 

00:03:55.274 --> 00:03:58.480
 Well, but it's one day of a resume lost. 

00:03:59.437 --> 00:04:03.610
