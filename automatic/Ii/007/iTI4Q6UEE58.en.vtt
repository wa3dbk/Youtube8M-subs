00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.449
 this note is called confusing the 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:04.449
 people 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.200
 well we are now with joseph 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.809
 Luis 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.670
 Jose Luis, how are you how are you? 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.670
 Commodore Rivadavia is what you care 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:28.770
 and we are making the debut depends that 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.770
 I stayed in carburando 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.930
 This time was good new is deleted 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.760
 we go again patricia that as such 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.370
 it is well the truth that happy with the 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.400
 I think that trying to improve 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.020
 as a pretty but happy addition 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.600
 because we could do a search in 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.180
 this race with the rental of the engine to 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.130
 fontana at least 10 thousand pesitos 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.470
 perhaps we are not silver receives I was 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.300
 talking to your brother like José Luis and 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.520
 he tells me that like where they treat him very 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:09.030
 well as with patricia with patricia is 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.030
 talking 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.080
 there is 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.650
 back 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.650
 that 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.450
 Duck as you are treated by Comodoro Rivadavia 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.450
 like ducks and me 50 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.200
 is the sponsor 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.200
 is under our command 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.310
 jose luis how he treats you with wood was 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.479
 Quite complicated 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.329
 but that does not work well because they are 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.940
 all chevrolet back 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.330
 chevrolet good what 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:52.860
 is half a step ahead of the guru 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.530
 martínez and good I think we 're going to go 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.540
 improving the chevy is like to be able 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.170
 locate it later 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.800
 a result throw me clues to see how 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.220
 you see it look at me clues as we see the 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.060
 final result everything is worth 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.920
 first you win and second tornatore 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.140
 and the third and give 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.140
 I think they are classifying
