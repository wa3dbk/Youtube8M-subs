when<00:00:00.930> we're<00:00:01.079> looking<00:00:01.410> at<00:00:01.500> controlling<00:00:01.949> the

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
when we're looking at controlling the

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.519 
when we're looking at controlling the
cost<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.639> cattle<00:00:03.030> genetics<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.020> often

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
cost of cattle genetics is often

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.320 
cost of cattle genetics is often
overlooked<00:00:04.950> as<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> way<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.310> do<00:00:05.520> that<00:00:05.670> here<00:00:06.240> to

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
overlooked as a way to do that here to

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.330 
overlooked as a way to do that here to
talk<00:00:06.509> more<00:00:06.690> about<00:00:06.750> it's<00:00:07.109> Dave<00:00:07.350> Loman<00:00:07.770> Dave<00:00:08.189> how

thanks for coming in oh thanks for
having<00:00:11.219> us<00:00:11.460> we<00:00:11.580> love<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.759> North<00:00:12.000> range<00:00:12.259> let's

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
having us we love the North range let's

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.110 
having us we love the North range let's
talk<00:00:13.530> about<00:00:13.679> genetics<00:00:14.190> waterproof<00:00:14.940> sirs

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
talk about genetics waterproof sirs

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.430 
talk about genetics waterproof sirs
looking<00:00:15.480> for<00:00:15.660> what<00:00:15.809> are<00:00:15.900> they<00:00:15.960> getting<00:00:16.170> that

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
looking for what are they getting that

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.019 
looking for what are they getting that
they<00:00:16.590> really<00:00:16.890> maybe<00:00:17.369> shouldn't<00:00:17.699> be<00:00:17.820> worried

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
they really maybe shouldn't be worried

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.599 
they really maybe shouldn't be worried
so<00:00:18.150> much<00:00:18.240> about<00:00:18.590> well<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:20.310> know<00:00:20.400> when<00:00:20.580> we

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
so much about well you know when we

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.000 
so much about well you know when we
talked<00:00:21.000> about<00:00:21.119> our<00:00:21.240> enterprise<00:00:21.689> budgets<00:00:22.320> a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
talked about our enterprise budgets a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.700 
talked about our enterprise budgets a
big<00:00:23.519> chunk<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.150> enterprise<00:00:24.570> budget<00:00:24.990> 53%

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
big chunk of that enterprise budget 53%

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.970 
big chunk of that enterprise budget 53%
is<00:00:25.830> feed<00:00:26.400> costs<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:28.019> you're<00:00:28.380> right<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
is feed costs and so you're right and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.849 
is feed costs and so you're right and
that<00:00:29.039> genetics<00:00:29.779> plays<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> big<00:00:31.109> role<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.740> how

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
that genetics plays a big role and how

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.110 
that genetics plays a big role and how
big<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.660> portion<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> budget<00:00:34.350> is

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
big that that portion of the budget is

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.030 
big that that portion of the budget is
what<00:00:36.120> we've<00:00:36.329> noticed<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.829> genetic

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
what we've noticed is that the genetic

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.600 
what we've noticed is that the genetic
trend<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.270> let's<00:00:39.600> say<00:00:39.750> milk<00:00:40.110> production<00:00:40.610> in

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
trend for let's say milk production in

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.970 
trend for let's say milk production in
the<00:00:41.910> angus<00:00:42.329> well<00:00:42.660> particularly<00:00:43.290> angus<00:00:43.739> braid

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the angus well particularly angus braid

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.910 
the angus well particularly angus braid
which<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.910> most<00:00:45.230> popular<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.440> numerous

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
which is is the most popular or numerous

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.040 
which is is the most popular or numerous
cattle<00:00:47.700> breed<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> state<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> Oklahoma<00:00:48.570> in

cattle breed in the state of Oklahoma in
the<00:00:49.140> country<00:00:49.469> right<00:00:49.620> now<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.430> genetic<00:00:50.610> trend

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the country right now the genetic trend

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.100 
the country right now the genetic trend
for<00:00:51.480> milk<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.949> increasing<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.449> we

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
for milk and is is increasing and we

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.110 
for milk and is is increasing and we
think<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.620> maybe<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.219> some<00:00:56.250> cases<00:00:56.550> we've

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
think that maybe in some cases we've

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.709 
think that maybe in some cases we've
really<00:00:57.480> overshot<00:00:58.520> what<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.789> forage<00:01:00.300> can't

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
really overshot what the forage can't

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.490 
really overshot what the forage can't
support<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.530> terms<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.949> milk<00:01:02.190> production<00:01:03.500> it's

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
support in terms of milk production it's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
support in terms of milk production it's
not<00:01:04.739> only<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.250> Angus<00:01:05.670> breed<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.240> just

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
not only the Angus breed you just

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.179 
not only the Angus breed you just
mention<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.229> we've<00:01:07.799> got<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> real

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
mention that because we've got a real

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.130 
mention that because we've got a real
clear<00:01:08.460> genetic<00:01:09.060> trend<00:01:09.540> there<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:09.930> other

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
clear genetic trend there but other

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140 
clear genetic trend there but other
breeds<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.830> well<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.850> what<00:01:11.970> we're<00:01:12.060> talking

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
breeds as well so what we're talking

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.820 
breeds as well so what we're talking
about<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.750> they're<00:01:13.500> getting<00:01:13.740> more

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
about here it's they're getting more

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.010 
about here it's they're getting more
potential<00:01:14.250> than<00:01:14.340> maybe<00:01:14.520> at<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.330> cost<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.840> feed

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
potential than maybe at the cost to feed

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.330 
potential than maybe at the cost to feed
that<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.530> potential<00:01:16.770> list<00:01:17.040> maybe<00:01:17.159> not

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that to that potential list maybe not

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.520 
that to that potential list maybe not
worth<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.610> yeah<00:01:17.790> or<00:01:18.270> that's<00:01:18.780> right<00:01:18.990> more<00:01:19.200> milk

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
worth it yeah or that's right more milk

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.380 
worth it yeah or that's right more milk
is<00:01:19.740> associated<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.430> higher<00:01:20.759> maintenance

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
is associated with higher maintenance

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.140 
is associated with higher maintenance
costs<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.619> think<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.100> maintenance<00:01:23.610> costs

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
costs you can think of maintenance costs

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.530 
costs you can think of maintenance costs
as<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.810> overhead<00:01:25.259> costs<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> run<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:25.979> factory

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
as the overhead costs to run the factory

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.010 
as the overhead costs to run the factory
okay<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.229> have<00:01:28.439> more<00:01:28.770> milk<00:01:29.460> production

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
okay so if you have more milk production

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.120 
okay so if you have more milk production
assuming<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> nutrients<00:01:31.890> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
assuming you have the nutrients to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.950 
assuming you have the nutrients to
support<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.150> milk<00:01:33.390> production<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.930> should

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
support that milk production you should

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.649 
support that milk production you should
get<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:34.530> milk<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.460> what<00:01:36.000> I'm<00:01:36.119> saying<00:01:36.450> is

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
get more milk but what I'm saying is

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.840 
get more milk but what I'm saying is
that<00:01:36.900> if<00:01:37.049> once<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.590> get<00:01:37.799> beyond<00:01:38.130> an<00:01:38.310> optimal

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
that if once you get beyond an optimal

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.910 
that if once you get beyond an optimal
point<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.750> forage<00:01:40.110> won't<00:01:40.409> support<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
point the forage won't support the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.789 
point the forage won't support the
additional<00:01:41.400> milk<00:01:41.640> production<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.570> yet<00:01:42.799> 365

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
additional milk production but yet 365

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.620 
additional milk production but yet 365
days<00:01:44.220> out<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> year<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.180> higher

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
days out of the year you have higher

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.590 
days out of the year you have higher
maintenance<00:01:46.439> cost<00:01:47.070> which<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.759> cost<00:01:48.299> that's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
maintenance cost which is cost that's

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.870

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660

and<00:02:05.810> no<00:02:06.170> bigger<00:02:06.470> calves<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.610> I<00:02:07.640> think

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
and no bigger calves and that I think

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.820

that's<00:02:08.210> the<00:02:08.479> primary<00:02:08.720> concern<00:02:09.440> that<00:02:09.680> we're

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
that's the primary concern that we're

that's the primary concern that we're

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
talking about so what we've just been

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.520

cautioning<00:02:14.060> producers<00:02:14.660> about<00:02:14.960> is<00:02:15.110> just<00:02:15.320> don't

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
cautioning producers about is just don't

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.550 
cautioning producers about is just don't

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.630 
and cow costs are kind of optimally
balanced<00:02:25.850> we<00:02:26.630> can<00:02:26.810> minimize<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.620> cost<00:02:28.100> of

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
balanced we can minimize that cost of

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.690 
balanced we can minimize that cost of

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
ways as we can and we're not just

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.660 
ways as we can and we're not just
talking<00:02:36.950> about<00:02:36.980> milk<00:02:37.280> production<00:02:37.520> here

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
talking about milk production here

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.890 
talking about milk production here
that's<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:37.880> good<00:02:37.910> example<00:02:38.090> but<00:02:38.570> there<00:02:38.690> are

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
that's a good example but there are

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.000 
that's a good example but there are
other<00:02:39.020> genetic<00:02:39.170> traits<00:02:39.560> we're<00:02:39.770> concerned

other genetic traits we're concerned

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.610 
other genetic traits we're concerned
about<00:02:40.220> as<00:02:40.310> well<00:02:40.490> there<00:02:41.180> sure<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.660> another<00:02:42.380> one

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
about as well there sure is another one

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.949 
about as well there sure is another one
is<00:02:43.160> just<00:02:43.220> cow<00:02:43.790> size<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:45.770> know<00:02:46.480> we<00:02:47.480> have<00:02:47.660> in

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
is just cow size and you know we have in

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.810 
is just cow size and you know we have in
our<00:02:48.110> cow<00:02:48.350> herd<00:02:48.620> here<00:02:48.950> at<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.130> North<00:02:49.310> range<00:02:49.610> we

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
our cow herd here at the North range we

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.630 
our cow herd here at the North range we
have<00:02:50.030> just<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:51.050> handful<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.500> 900<00:02:52.160> pound<00:02:52.370> cows

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
have just a handful of 900 pound cows

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.520 
have just a handful of 900 pound cows
and<00:02:52.940> we<00:02:53.030> have<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.209> handful<00:02:53.600> of<00:02:53.660> sixteen<00:02:54.200> hundred

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
and we have a handful of sixteen hundred

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.949 
and we have a handful of sixteen hundred
pound<00:02:54.740> calves<00:02:55.040> well<00:02:55.280> maybe<00:02:55.760> 1,500<00:02:56.540> pound<00:02:56.750> cows

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
pound calves well maybe 1,500 pound cows

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.570 
pound calves well maybe 1,500 pound cows
and<00:02:57.320> everything<00:02:57.830> in<00:02:57.980> between

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
and everything in between

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.540 
and everything in between
they'd<00:02:58.940> average<00:02:59.330> about<00:02:59.600> 1150<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.380> 1200<00:03:01.010> pounds

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
they'd average about 1150 to 1200 pounds

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.740 
they'd average about 1150 to 1200 pounds
and<00:03:01.760> that's<00:03:01.880> probably<00:03:02.330> pretty<00:03:02.480> common

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
and that's probably pretty common

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.740 
and that's probably pretty common
commercial<00:03:03.440> cow<00:03:03.590> herd<00:03:04.000> but<00:03:05.000> we've<00:03:05.390> just<00:03:05.420> run

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
commercial cow herd but we've just run

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.070 
commercial cow herd but we've just run
an<00:03:06.020> interesting<00:03:06.910> analysis<00:03:07.910> on<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.450> records

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
an interesting analysis on the records

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.810 
an interesting analysis on the records
in<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.350> past<00:03:09.620> six<00:03:09.860> years<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.190> North<00:03:10.520> Range

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
in the past six years the North Range

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.330 
in the past six years the North Range
cows<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.300> what<00:03:11.480> we<00:03:11.600> discovered<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.920> for

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
cows and what we discovered is that for

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.820 
cows and what we discovered is that for
each<00:03:13.519> additional<00:03:14.330> hundred<00:03:14.810> pounds<00:03:15.380> of<00:03:15.470> mature

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
each additional hundred pounds of mature

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.210 
each additional hundred pounds of mature
cow<00:03:16.130> weight<00:03:16.600> we<00:03:17.600> get<00:03:17.780> about<00:03:18.050> an<00:03:18.260> additional<00:03:18.620> 10

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
cow weight we get about an additional 10

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.540 
cow weight we get about an additional 10
pounds<00:03:19.880> of<00:03:19.910> calf<00:03:20.360> weaning<00:03:20.870> weight<00:03:21.489> okay<00:03:22.489> so

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
pounds of calf weaning weight okay so

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.270 
pounds of calf weaning weight okay so
then<00:03:23.060> if<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.300> think<00:03:23.570> about<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.170> cost<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:25.010> keep

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
then if you think about the cost to keep

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.400 
then if you think about the cost to keep
that<00:03:25.550> extra<00:03:25.880> hundred<00:03:26.420> pounds<00:03:26.900> of<00:03:26.959> cow<00:03:27.200> weight

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
that extra hundred pounds of cow weight

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.320 
that extra hundred pounds of cow weight
around<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.830> year<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:28.670> know<00:03:28.760> it's<00:03:28.880> probably<00:03:29.269> in

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
around a year you know it's probably in

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.590 
around a year you know it's probably in
the<00:03:29.420> 15<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.959> 20<00:03:30.320> dollars<00:03:30.530> per<00:03:30.800> cow<00:03:31.330> added<00:03:32.330> cost

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
the 15 to 20 dollars per cow added cost

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.920 
the 15 to 20 dollars per cow added cost
okay<00:03:33.170> but<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.650> 10<00:03:33.860> pounds<00:03:34.280> of<00:03:34.340> calf<00:03:34.610> is<00:03:35.150> only

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
okay but the 10 pounds of calf is only

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.990 
okay but the 10 pounds of calf is only
worth<00:03:36.140> eight<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.769> ten<00:03:36.980> dollars<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:37.790> you're<00:03:37.910> not

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
worth eight to ten dollars so you're not

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.040 
worth eight to ten dollars so you're not
getting<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.300> full<00:03:38.420> return<00:03:38.720> on<00:03:38.840> your<00:03:38.870> money

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
getting a full return on your money

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.800 
getting a full return on your money
there<00:03:39.320> absolutely<00:03:39.830> yeah<00:03:40.340> yeah<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:40.820> think<00:03:41.269> you

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
there absolutely yeah yeah I think you

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.410 
there absolutely yeah yeah I think you
know<00:03:41.900> for<00:03:42.080> us<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.709> more<00:03:43.220> optimal<00:03:43.700> cow<00:03:43.910> sizes

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
know for us the more optimal cow sizes

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.000 
know for us the more optimal cow sizes
that<00:03:44.540> eleven<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.110> twelve<00:03:45.320> hundred<00:03:45.500> pound<00:03:45.800> cow

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
that eleven to twelve hundred pound cow

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.670 
that eleven to twelve hundred pound cow
we<00:03:46.250> probably<00:03:46.550> don't<00:03:46.850> need<00:03:47.150> the<00:03:47.360> 1459<00:03:48.350> pound

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
we probably don't need the 1459 pound

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.500 
we probably don't need the 1459 pound
cows<00:03:48.920> here<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:49.700> I<00:03:49.730> guess<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.269> kind<00:03:50.450> of

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
cows here so I guess the the kind of

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.880 
cows here so I guess the the kind of
take-home<00:03:50.720> message<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.260> producers<00:03:51.620> is<00:03:51.709> even

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
take-home message to producers is even

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.530 
take-home message to producers is even
though<00:03:51.950> it's<00:03:52.100> easy<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.489> say<00:03:52.820> well<00:03:53.060> bigger<00:03:53.420> is

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
though it's easy to say well bigger is

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.420 
though it's easy to say well bigger is
better<00:03:53.720> more<00:03:54.500> is<00:03:54.650> better<00:03:54.800> it's<00:03:55.400> not

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
better more is better it's not

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.560 
better more is better it's not
necessarily<00:03:55.910> we're<00:03:56.000> looking<00:03:56.180> for<00:03:56.300> a<00:03:56.330> midpoint

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
necessarily we're looking for a midpoint

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.509 
necessarily we're looking for a midpoint
that's<00:03:57.019> that's<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.650> best<00:03:57.739> return<00:03:58.070> that's

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
that's that's the best return that's

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.670 
that's that's the best return that's
right<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.269> finding<00:03:59.870> that<00:04:00.019> balance<00:04:00.080> I

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
right and and finding that balance I

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.550 
right and and finding that balance I
agree<00:04:00.950> is<00:04:01.130> certainly<00:04:01.820> a<00:04:01.940> challenge<00:04:02.560> but

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
agree is certainly a challenge but

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.810 
agree is certainly a challenge but
producers<00:04:04.070> just<00:04:04.190> kind<00:04:04.400> of<00:04:04.459> have<00:04:04.579> to<00:04:04.700> pay

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
producers just kind of have to pay

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.180 
producers just kind of have to pay
attention<00:04:04.940> over<00:04:05.660> time<00:04:05.930> if<00:04:06.260> they<00:04:06.680> notice<00:04:07.040> that

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
attention over time if they notice that

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.520 
attention over time if they notice that
