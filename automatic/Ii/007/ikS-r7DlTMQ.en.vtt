00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
think it's a little expensive or

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.089 
think it's a little expensive or
whatever<00:05:40.270> then<00:05:40.960> definitely<00:05:41.409> consider

rite-aid they're only like 3 99 so

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.760 
rite-aid they're only like 3 99 so
definitely<00:05:46.240> cheaper<00:05:46.419> than<00:05:46.629> an<00:05:46.779> SE<00:05:47.080> polish<00:05:47.440> and

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
definitely cheaper than an SE polish and

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.499 
definitely cheaper than an SE polish and
this<00:05:48.339> is<00:05:48.460> such<00:05:48.639> a<00:05:48.669> pretty<00:05:48.940> color<00:05:49.029> the

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
this is such a pretty color the

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.059 
this is such a pretty color the
formulation<00:05:50.050> is<00:05:50.199> just<00:05:50.379> a<00:05:50.469> little<00:05:50.589> thick<00:05:50.889> it's

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
formulation is just a little thick it's

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.339 
formulation is just a little thick it's
not<00:05:51.250> terrible<00:05:51.729> but<00:05:51.789> it<00:05:52.060> is<00:05:52.210> thick<00:05:52.569> and<00:05:52.810> it

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
not terrible but it is thick and it

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:54.839 
not terrible but it is thick and it
takes<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.650> little<00:05:53.770> while<00:05:53.949> to<00:05:54.190> dry<00:05:54.339> so<00:05:54.669> that's

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
takes a little while to dry so that's

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:55.920 
takes a little while to dry so that's
all<00:05:55.029> that<00:05:55.089> I<00:05:55.270> have<00:05:55.419> to<00:05:55.509> share<00:05:55.689> with<00:05:55.779> you<00:05:55.900> guys
