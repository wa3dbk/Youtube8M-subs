 Hello dear friends with you vulture and

 We continue to buy raw materials on ebay 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.210
 this time from hong parcel to me 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.309
 I got the message interesting for you here 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.929
 then after 10 seconds we will start 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.619
 I want to say thank you for coming 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.619
 put like permission better and go 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.560
 We continue the topic of reviews I also do not know 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.290
 what's in this package for this now 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.220
 I have legs open I will show you 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.080
 This package is from Hong Kong 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.170
 it can be anything here i am 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.480
 ordered more than one parcel and so on 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.000
 looks I can not prove that here 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.960
 an adapter for the camera 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.320
 rod with such a monopod called 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.650
 so let's see it was not expensive 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.790
 he is 100 rubles written here thanks for 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.890
 your order 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.090
 Put me an estimate by the way it has always 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.800
 I do to all users and for whom 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.869
 I order then we all have to deliver 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.160
 assessment because it depends 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.140
 their fate 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.180
 look at such a monopod but squatting 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.920
 buying for 100 rubles looks like there is 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.410
 to come nothing just for gup rohi 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.180
 if the most basic thing is to have 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:44.090
 because for example we insert here 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.160
 This protective container is so suitable for 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.830
 we don't fit because I didn't get in 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.860
 connector so nacho 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.289
 yes everything is fine everything is fine 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.200
 so well, and you can see here 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.240
 right now, dill fits all his pro 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.979
 which then can come up begins 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.500
 the very first and here the match places 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:10.180
 where will monopod be accumulated here 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:12.920
 He moves apart I think that the price is in a hundred 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.500
 one hundred and one hundred and fifty rubles generally the most 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.880
 perfect for such a thing here and chipboard 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.610
 weeks of waiting 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.170
 start grip well, by the way 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.410
 it looks like it's not 150 rubles 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.420
 much more expensive here a small strap 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.400
 you can hang on the hand, you can plus more 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.830
 big camera with fix for example here 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.360
 which blog rented yes that's even 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.450
 such an option can be made 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.750
 fasten a big camera here and shoot 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.550
 also with her around the world is convenient if you 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.920
 keep your vlog and so let's 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.110
 let's see how this whole thing 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.850
 coming forward well for the stupid and will generally 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.600
 perfect 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.670
 we are moving here a meter and a half then 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.780
 there is this topic attached 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.880
 and now it's gone so far 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.250
 it will all hold on of course 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:05.490
 interesting but he moves so confidently 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.950
 like that on a plus of course everything is here 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.980
 changes its angle with that 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.680
 small crunch too cool so here 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.150
 You can still watch this topic here. 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.330
 and it is to turn off yes and still I thought about 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.970
 turn off she turns me think that 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.430
 can be turned 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.410
 Well, respectively, the court we fasten 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.290
 like a calendar like this 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.050
 the barbell using this thing can 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.180
 record awesome vidos on america 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.150
 either on a motorbike 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.970
 holes just even got in a dream and although not 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.460
 I think that this material is metal 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.160
 survive water and then nothing 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.090
 here is not such a monopod 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.270
 150 rubles 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.400
