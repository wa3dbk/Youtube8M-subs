00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 ah ah ah you asked for a daily blog 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.750
 everybody agreed now they screwed up 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.120
 What am I really going to do? 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.380
 I posted a video a little while ago. 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.160
 asking why I received a proposal 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.070
 publish the book by a publisher and I 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.439
 I like the conversation I have 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.880
 with them and why not make a blog 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.400
 telling you 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.840
 The creative process of this book I know 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.449
 I'm going to pass away 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.160
 I know I'm going to have a crisis I know I 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.500
 I'm going to make drama but I'm going to share with 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.219
 You know that it's 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.239
 completely normal you saw yourself in a 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.360
 barrel in the dark as it is talking to you 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.579
 if they see you do not see it it 's super normal to 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.230
 People do not see light at the end of the tunnel. 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.480
 I said, let's increase from Tokyo 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.219
 using right then I will share with you 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.100
 all these lines 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.840
 every process of creation of the book 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.090
 I said at the beginning of 30 days more 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.360
 Let's see, I do not know if this is going to be the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.140
 enough're for those who do not know the book 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.020
 It's begun but I need to finish. 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.540
 This thing, so I wanted to show it to you. 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.250
 you my bat cave that the place 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.549
 where everything is going to happen that is my 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.979
 office here has a lusa a wall 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.610
 of slate that the taxis already cleaned her more 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.740
 or less will not fit my hand 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.049
 my first first thing 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.530
 the first debate I came back with 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.689
 You guys about the discipline are very difficult. 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.030
 very difficult face you have discipline 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.430
 I'll try, I swear to God I 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.979
 I'm going because otherwise this book will not go away. 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.630
 if I put on the ballad it's gym 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.100
 any girlfriend to any family 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.689
 something else in the foreground in this 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.030
 this book is not going to work out what 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.420
 affirm I 'm guilty I did not buy 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.820
 just because I forgot that woman is 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.200
 well I'm recording a Czech stage 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.479
 I need to write every day for the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.710
 least one page one chapter 11 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.600
 paragraph of this book to look for me 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.390
 with you, I think the only rule I 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.990
 I will have in this creative process to write 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.700
 every day i 'm thinking about friday 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.140
 This is going to be Saturday and Sunday. 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.130
 Why are we going to have to give a 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.400
 relaxed but the idea is to write 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.210
 a little less every day the pomegranate to the end 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.520

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.580
 usually paranÃ© the dog barked plane 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.470
 There is a shout in the window, but here it is. 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.580
 all improvised 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.750

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.830

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.900
 hope so 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.360
