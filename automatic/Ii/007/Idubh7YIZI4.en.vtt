six US Dollars and you can clearly see

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.490 
six US Dollars and you can clearly see
that<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:56.850> basically<00:01:57.420> protects<00:01:58.110> your<00:01:58.259> phone

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
that it basically protects your phone

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.690 
that it basically protects your phone
from<00:01:58.890> scratch<00:02:00.320> especially<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.829> top<00:02:02.159> part<00:02:02.490> of

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
from scratch especially the top part of

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.720 
from scratch especially the top part of
your<00:02:02.820> device

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.790 

however<00:02:06.730> the<00:02:07.330> bottom<00:02:07.750> part<00:02:08.050> does<00:02:08.290> not<00:02:08.320> have

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
however the bottom part does not have

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.500 
however the bottom part does not have
any<00:02:09.040> cover<00:02:09.400> of<00:02:09.700> protections<00:02:10.570> so<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:13.060> would<00:02:13.300> be

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
any cover of protections so you would be

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.620 
any cover of protections so you would be
expecting<00:02:14.640> scratches<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:15.850> case<00:02:16.120> if<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.390> drop

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630

firing because I dropped my phone couple

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.130 
firing because I dropped my phone couple
