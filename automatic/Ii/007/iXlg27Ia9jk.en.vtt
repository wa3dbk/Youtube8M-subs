which I did try to record with on my old

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.200 
which I did try to record with on my old
laptop<00:00:10.070> and<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.160> didn't<00:00:11.429> really<00:00:11.580> work<00:00:12.200> so<00:00:14.210> I'm

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
laptop and it didn't really work so I'm

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.060 
laptop and it didn't really work so I'm
trying<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.750> with<00:00:15.870> my<00:00:16.049> new<00:00:16.199> laptop<00:00:16.410> which<00:00:16.859> is

trying it with my new laptop which is

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.070 
trying it with my new laptop which is
faster<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.670> better<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.510> seems<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.930> work

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
faster and better and it seems we work

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.620 
faster and better and it seems we work
in<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.380> hell<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.619> lot<00:00:19.740> better<00:00:20.240> because<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.449> was

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
in a hell of a lot better because it was

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.769 
in a hell of a lot better because it was
skipping<00:00:22.170> jumping<00:00:22.710> all<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.070> stuff<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.779> it's

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
skipping jumping all that stuff and it's

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.230 
skipping jumping all that stuff and it's
supposed<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.140> HD<00:00:25.560> camera<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.880> quite<00:00:27.000> dark

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
supposed to be HD camera it's quite dark

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.839 
supposed to be HD camera it's quite dark
outside<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.439> probably<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.789> be

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
outside so it's probably not going to be

I<00:03:35.810> really<00:03:36.530> like<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.860> side<00:03:37.070> of<00:03:37.100> it<00:03:37.280> was<00:03:37.430> at<00:03:37.549> the

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
I really like the side of it was at the

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.340 
I really like the side of it was at the
front<00:03:38.090> of<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.269> as<00:03:38.390> well<00:03:38.739> it's<00:03:39.739> like<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:41.350> it's

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
front of it as well it's like that it's

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.610 
front of it as well it's like that it's
like<00:03:42.560> a<00:03:42.590> weird

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.979 

like<00:03:46.250> metal<00:03:46.670> step<00:03:47.000> design<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.720> it's<00:03:47.840> got

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
like metal step design that it's got

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.789 
like metal step design that it's got
going<00:03:48.230> on<00:03:48.319> on<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:51.290> yeah<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.780> hopefully<00:03:54.170> it's

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
going on on it so yeah so hopefully it's

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.440 
going on on it so yeah so hopefully it's
got<00:03:55.280> something<00:03:55.489> called<00:03:55.730> true<00:03:56.120> color

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
got something called true color

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.470 
got something called true color
something<00:03:56.780> or<00:03:57.049> other<00:03:57.140> on<00:03:57.349> it<00:03:58.360> what's<00:03:59.360> it

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
something or other on it what's it

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.630 
something or other on it what's it
called<00:03:59.659> true<00:03:59.959> color<00:04:00.230> clear<00:04:00.590> frame<00:04:00.950> technology

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
called true color clear frame technology

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.740 
called true color clear frame technology
so<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.989> should<00:04:03.650> be<00:04:03.680> showing<00:04:04.400> colors<00:04:05.299> as<00:04:05.480> they

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
so it should be showing colors as they

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.610 
so it should be showing colors as they
are<00:04:05.900> because<00:04:06.110> usually<00:04:06.560> when<00:04:06.829> I<00:04:06.920> do<00:04:06.980> my<00:04:07.159> videos

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
are because usually when I do my videos

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.210 
are because usually when I do my videos
all<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.680> colors<00:04:10.190> are<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.310> little<00:04:10.400> bit<00:04:10.790> off<00:04:12.220> I'm
