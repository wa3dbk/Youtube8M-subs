00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:03:00.040 

I<00:02:56.560> do<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:57.710> one-handed<00:02:58.220> here<00:02:58.640> but<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:59.870> can

I do this one-handed here but you can

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.040 
I do this one-handed here but you can
see<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.410> in<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.770> Blue<00:03:00.950> Hills<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.840> is<00:03:03.020> a

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
see that in the Blue Hills it is a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.900 
see that in the Blue Hills it is a
series<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.560> many<00:03:03.860> hills<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:04.430> you're<00:03:04.550> doing<00:03:04.700> a

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
series of many hills so you're doing a

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.620 
series of many hills so you're doing a
lot<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.620> up<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.800> down<00:03:07.010> up<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.430> down<00:03:07.510> which<00:03:08.510> is

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
lot of up and down up and down which is

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.290 
lot of up and down up and down which is
nice<00:03:08.840> because<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:10.580> highest<00:03:10.850> elevation

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
nice because the the highest elevation

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.800 
nice because the the highest elevation
here<00:03:11.480> is<00:03:11.630> very<00:03:11.840> little<00:03:12.080> I<00:03:12.260> think<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.600> peak

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
here is very little I think the the peak

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.680 
here is very little I think the the peak

hundred and thirty five feet above sea
level<00:03:19.340> which<00:03:19.940> we're<00:03:20.180> at<00:03:20.270> sea<00:03:20.480> level<00:03:20.600> here<00:03:20.930> so

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
level which we're at sea level here so

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.010 
level which we're at sea level here so
that<00:03:21.830> is<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:23.150> elevation<00:03:23.570> that<00:03:23.600> you're<00:03:23.780> going

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
that is the elevation that you're going

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.120 
that is the elevation that you're going
up<00:03:24.140> basically<00:03:26.320> so<00:03:27.320> it's<00:03:27.500> kind<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.770> nice<00:03:27.920> that

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
up basically so it's kind of nice that

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.210 
up basically so it's kind of nice that
you<00:03:28.250> have<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.460> lot<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:29.500> Rolling<00:03:30.500> Hills<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.950> lot<00:03:31.100> of

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
you have a lot of Rolling Hills a lot of

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.850 
you have a lot of Rolling Hills a lot of
up<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:31.550> down<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:32.330> get<00:03:32.510> there<00:03:32.780> so<00:03:33.560> right<00:03:33.680> now

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
up and down to get there so right now

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.230 
up and down to get there so right now
I'm<00:03:33.980> just<00:03:34.160> coming<00:03:34.400> down<00:03:34.520> off<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.910> one<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.180> the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
I'm just coming down off of one of the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.770 
I'm just coming down off of one of the
many<00:03:35.420> hills<00:03:35.660> on<00:03:36.590> this<00:03:36.860> loop<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:38.300> we'll

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
many hills on this loop and we'll

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.610 
many hills on this loop and we'll
continue<00:03:38.960> along<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.910> hope<00:03:41.150> y'all<00:03:41.440> grab<00:03:42.440> some

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
continue along and hope y'all grab some

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.120 
continue along and hope y'all grab some
more<00:03:42.740> footage<00:03:43.040> as<00:03:43.160> we<00:03:43.310> get<00:03:43.460> up<00:03:43.550> to<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.790> big<00:03:43.940> one

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
more footage as we get up to the big one

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.080 
more footage as we get up to the big one
alright<00:03:46.130> here<00:03:46.400> we<00:03:46.430> are<00:03:46.550> at<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.850> big

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
alright here we are at a big

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.480 
alright here we are at a big
intersection<00:03:47.770> you<00:03:48.770> can<00:03:48.950> see<00:03:49.130> that<00:03:49.250> there's

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
intersection you can see that there's

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.820 
intersection you can see that there's
several<00:03:50.209> different<00:03:50.390> trails<00:03:50.990> within<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.680> Blue

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
several different trails within the Blue

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.080 
several different trails within the Blue
Hills<00:03:52.010> reservation<00:03:52.270> and<00:03:54.220> they've<00:03:55.220> done<00:03:56.060> a

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
Hills reservation and they've done a

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.660 
Hills reservation and they've done a
good<00:03:56.270> job<00:03:56.330> not<00:03:57.320> only<00:03:57.590> providing<00:03:58.070> a<00:03:58.130> map<00:03:58.310> here

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
good job not only providing a map here

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.360 
good job not only providing a map here
but<00:03:58.700> also<00:03:59.560> providing<00:04:00.560> some<00:04:00.740> signs<00:04:01.040> here<00:04:01.310> in

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
but also providing some signs here in

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
but also providing some signs here in
trail<00:04:01.580> markers<00:04:01.910> so<00:04:02.030> you<00:04:02.120> can<00:04:02.270> see<00:04:03.130> what

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
trail markers so you can see what

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.670 
trail markers so you can see what
destinations<00:04:05.390> are<00:04:05.660> in<00:04:05.750> which<00:04:05.870> direction<00:04:06.080> and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
destinations are in which direction and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.410 
destinations are in which direction and
it<00:04:06.890> also<00:04:07.040> has<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.370> distance<00:04:07.880> for<00:04:08.030> each<00:04:08.060> of<00:04:08.270> those

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
it also has a distance for each of those

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.570 
it also has a distance for each of those
so<00:04:09.170> looking<00:04:09.440> at<00:04:09.560> our<00:04:09.650> map<00:04:09.830> is<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.190> same<00:04:10.400> map

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
so looking at our map is the same map

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.710 
so looking at our map is the same map
that<00:04:10.730> we<00:04:10.790> looked<00:04:10.970> at<00:04:11.090> at<00:04:11.270> the<00:04:11.360> start<00:04:11.600> of<00:04:11.630> the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
that we looked at at the start of the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.440 
that we looked at at the start of the
video<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:12.650> can<00:04:12.800> see<00:04:13.010> here<00:04:13.340> try<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.180> keep<00:04:14.270> this

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
video you can see here try and keep this

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.930 
video you can see here try and keep this
the<00:04:14.810> camera<00:04:15.110> study<00:04:15.320> for<00:04:15.560> you<00:04:15.680> we<00:04:16.250> started<00:04:16.670> at

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
the camera study for you we started at

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.180 
the camera study for you we started at
the<00:04:17.950> red<00:04:18.950> star<00:04:19.280> we've<00:04:20.270> gone<00:04:20.510> up<00:04:20.570> here<00:04:21.080> and<00:04:21.290> now

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
the red star we've gone up here and now

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.190 
the red star we've gone up here and now
we're<00:04:22.340> at<00:04:22.400> this<00:04:22.550> intersection<00:04:23.200> our

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
we're at this intersection our

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.590 
we're at this intersection our
turnaround<00:04:25.070> point<00:04:25.340> at<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.580> loop<00:04:25.790> is<00:04:26.000> Elliott

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
turnaround point at the loop is Elliott

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.800 
turnaround point at the loop is Elliott
our<00:04:26.780> soar<00:04:27.169> halfway<00:04:27.980> right<00:04:28.160> now<00:04:28.370> and<00:04:28.810> we'll

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
our soar halfway right now and we'll

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.280 
our soar halfway right now and we'll
continue<00:04:29.990> on<00:04:30.230> and<00:04:30.560> choose<00:04:31.010> more<00:04:31.280> video

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
continue on and choose more video

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.390 
continue on and choose more video
there's<00:04:33.290> another<00:04:33.500> steeper<00:04:33.950> section<00:04:34.280> of<00:04:34.340> the

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
there's another steeper section of the

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.500 
there's another steeper section of the
trail<00:04:34.640> I<00:04:34.669> don't<00:04:34.940> know<00:04:35.030> if<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.180> can<00:04:35.300> really

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
trail I don't know if you can really

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.650 
trail I don't know if you can really
tell<00:04:35.750> on<00:04:35.900> camera<00:04:35.930> but<00:04:36.580> these<00:04:37.580> trees<00:04:37.910> here<00:04:38.330> you

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
tell on camera but these trees here you

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.540 
tell on camera but these trees here you
can<00:04:38.810> see<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.080> tops<00:04:39.320> of<00:04:39.560> them<00:04:39.710> and<00:04:40.390> then<00:04:42.550> these

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
can see the tops of them and then these

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.720 
can see the tops of them and then these
ones<00:04:43.820> here<00:04:44.510> that<00:04:44.770> they<00:04:45.770> top<00:04:46.010> out<00:04:46.190> around<00:04:46.250> this

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
ones here that they top out around this

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.180 
ones here that they top out around this
area<00:04:46.970> so<00:04:47.180> you<00:04:47.450> can<00:04:47.600> see<00:04:47.750> that<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.770> declines

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
area so you can see that the declines

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.690 
area so you can see that the declines
it's<00:04:49.940> pretty<00:04:50.150> good<00:04:50.390> very<00:04:51.020> rocky<00:04:51.290> trail<00:04:51.740> but<00:04:52.520> a

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
it's pretty good very rocky trail but a

00:04:52.700 --> 00:05:03.059 
it's pretty good very rocky trail but a
lot<00:04:52.880> of<00:04:52.970> fun

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.909 

there's<00:05:04.069> Elliott<00:05:04.460> tower<00:05:04.699> at<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.330> top<00:05:05.509> of

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
there's Elliott tower at the top of

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:13.179 
there's Elliott tower at the top of
great<00:05:06.919> Blue<00:05:07.099> Hill<00:05:09.250> let's<00:05:10.250> go<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.490> top<00:05:12.189> in

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:13.189 
great Blue Hill let's go to the top in

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:17.350 
great Blue Hill let's go to the top in
the<00:05:13.280> distance<00:05:13.639> there's<00:05:13.849> Boston<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:17.240> then

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
the distance there's Boston and then

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:26.679 
the distance there's Boston and then
over<00:05:17.629> that<00:05:17.780> way<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.139> ocean<00:05:25.270> and<00:05:26.270> over<00:05:26.509> there

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:26.689 
over that way the ocean and over there

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:29.469 
over that way the ocean and over there
near<00:05:26.930> that<00:05:27.080> pond<00:05:28.030> it's<00:05:29.030> about<00:05:29.270> where<00:05:29.449> we

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
near that pond it's about where we

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:30.520 
near that pond it's about where we
parked

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
parked

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.800 
parked
I<00:05:31.930> believe<00:05:33.159> that<00:05:34.159> orient<00:05:35.150> myself<00:05:35.240> again<00:05:35.690> on

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
I believe that orient myself again on

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.320 
I believe that orient myself again on
the<00:05:35.870> map<00:05:36.080> I<00:05:36.289> think<00:05:36.680> that's<00:05:36.830> right<00:05:37.009> and<00:05:40.330> that's

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
the map I think that's right and that's

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:53.140 
the map I think that's right and that's
a<00:05:45.729> really<00:05:46.729> nice<00:05:47.060> area<00:05:50.560> pretty<00:05:51.560> cool<00:05:51.969> it's<00:05:52.969> only

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
a really nice area pretty cool it's only

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.809 
a really nice area pretty cool it's only
that<00:05:53.719> distance<00:05:54.080> away<00:05:54.229> from<00:05:54.319> Boston<00:05:54.860> nice

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
that distance away from Boston nice

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:18.460
