what<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.829> mean<00:01:28.950> now<00:01:29.610> does<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.329> Vance<00:01:30.689> warfare

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
what I mean now does it Vance warfare

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.770 
what I mean now does it Vance warfare
haven't<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.920> similar<00:01:32.220> yes<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.360> believe<00:01:33.720> so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
haven't really similar yes I believe so

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.480 
haven't really similar yes I believe so
because<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.590> look<00:01:34.710> at<00:01:34.860> them<00:01:34.979> side<00:01:35.250> by<00:01:35.280> side

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
because if you look at them side by side

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.280 
because if you look at them side by side
which<00:01:35.939> you'll<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.180> constantly<00:01:36.900> giving<00:01:37.200> these

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
which you'll see constantly giving these

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.310 
which you'll see constantly giving these
two<00:01:37.560> videos<00:01:37.850> you'll<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.290> know

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
two videos you'll see that you know

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.580 
two videos you'll see that you know
advanced<00:01:40.950> warfare<00:01:41.040> has<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.790> Avenger<00:01:42.590> metal

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
advanced warfare has the Avenger metal

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.649 
advanced warfare has the Avenger metal
in<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> first<00:01:44.159> blood<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> comeback

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
in the first blood and the comeback

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.840 
in the first blood and the comeback
metal<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.530> does<00:01:46.680> black<00:01:46.920> ops<00:01:47.130> 2<00:01:47.310> accept

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
metal and so does black ops 2 accept

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.569 
metal and so does black ops 2 accept
advanced<00:01:48.270> warfare<00:01:48.710> metals<00:01:49.710> are<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.399> this

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
advanced warfare metals are in this

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.480 
advanced warfare metals are in this
circular<00:01:51.390> shape<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.560> black<00:01:53.250> ops

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
circular shape and we can see black ops

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.310 
circular shape and we can see black ops
tues<00:01:53.880> metals<00:01:54.540> are<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.020> more<00:01:55.640> rectangular

similarity<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.770> see<00:02:02.520> between<00:02:02.939> these<00:02:03.270> now<00:02:03.509> let

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
similarity I see between these now let

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.120 
similarity I see between these now let
us<00:02:03.869> move<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:04.740> what<00:02:04.770> other

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
us move on and see what other

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.669 
us move on and see what other
similarities<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.990> fund<00:02:07.819> so<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.090> next

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
similarities I can fund so the next

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.390 
similarities I can fund so the next
similarity<00:02:10.679> I

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
similarity I

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.690 
similarity I
see<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:13.049> lot<00:02:13.409> of<00:02:13.560> these<00:02:13.739> scopes<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.430> stuff

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
see is a lot of these scopes and stuff

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.339 
see is a lot of these scopes and stuff
like<00:02:14.879> that<00:02:14.939> within<00:02:15.390> advanced<00:02:15.750> warfare<00:02:16.170> at

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
like that within advanced warfare at

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.860 
like that within advanced warfare at
black<00:02:16.560> ops<00:02:16.799> 2<00:02:16.980> they're<00:02:17.189> very<00:02:17.400> similar<00:02:17.700> such<00:02:18.599> as

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
black ops 2 they're very similar such as

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.080 
black ops 2 they're very similar such as
the<00:02:19.200> millimeter<00:02:19.709> scanner<00:02:20.099> now<00:02:20.519> we<00:02:20.579> had<00:02:20.849> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the millimeter scanner now we had the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.199 
the millimeter scanner now we had the
FMS<00:02:21.689> cited<00:02:22.200> AK<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.680> millimeter<00:02:23.400> scanner<00:02:23.819> site

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
FMS cited AK the millimeter scanner site

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.539 
FMS cited AK the millimeter scanner site
and<00:02:24.480> black<00:02:24.689> ops<00:02:24.930> 2<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.980> we're<00:02:26.159> seeing<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.519> lot

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
and black ops 2 and we're seeing a lot

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.699 
and black ops 2 and we're seeing a lot
of<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.390> advanced<00:02:27.810> warefare<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.560> know

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
of that in advanced warefare you know

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.369 
of that in advanced warefare you know
seeing<00:02:28.980> through<00:02:29.250> walls<00:02:29.780> using<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:31.049> threat

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
seeing through walls using a threat

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.229 
seeing through walls using a threat
detection<00:02:31.859> like<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.489> threat<00:02:32.760> detection

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
detection like the threat detection

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.020 
detection like the threat detection
grenade<00:02:33.659> to<00:02:33.959> detect<00:02:34.409> where<00:02:34.709> players<00:02:35.459> are<00:02:35.879> an

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.099 
advanced warfare or the sensor grenade
which<00:02:38.879> actually<00:02:39.090> kind<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.480> sucked<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.900> black

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
which actually kind of sucked in black

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.759 
which actually kind of sucked in black
ops<00:02:40.319> 2<00:02:40.609> by<00:02:41.609> and<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.450> know<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.959> we<00:02:43.440> got<00:02:43.620> all

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
ops 2 by and you know that we got all

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.170 
ops 2 by and you know that we got all
this<00:02:43.920> technology<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.700> could<00:02:44.819> see<00:02:45.030> through

this technology that could see through

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.410 
this technology that could see through
walls<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> scopes<00:02:46.260> are<00:02:46.530> very<00:02:46.920> similar

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
walls and the scopes are very similar

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.210 
walls and the scopes are very similar
towards<00:02:48.420> each<00:02:48.659> other<00:02:49.049> in<00:02:49.500> terms<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.099> the

futuristic technology you know like we

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.080 
futuristic technology you know like we
have<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> torrent<00:02:52.859> finder<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.250> black<00:02:53.430> ops<00:02:53.459> 2<00:02:53.879> a

have a threat detection grenade and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.710 
have a threat detection grenade and
black<00:02:58.319> ops<00:02:58.530> 2<00:02:58.769> it's<00:02:59.310> all<00:02:59.519> very<00:02:59.549> similar<00:03:00.389> in

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
black ops 2 it's all very similar in

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.710 
black ops 2 it's all very similar in
gameplay<00:03:01.370> style<00:03:02.370> what<00:03:02.909> do<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.030> think<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.480> that

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
gameplay style what do you think of that

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.990 
gameplay style what do you think of that
now<00:03:04.109> let's<00:03:04.349> let's<00:03:04.889> go<00:03:05.040> ahead<00:03:05.189> and<00:03:05.310> move<00:03:05.549> on<00:03:05.760> to

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
now let's let's go ahead and move on to

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.670 
now let's let's go ahead and move on to
some<00:03:06.239> differences<00:03:06.900> because<00:03:07.109> I<00:03:07.200> can<00:03:07.409> go<00:03:07.590> on

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
some differences because I can go on

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.679 
some differences because I can go on
forever<00:03:07.889> with<00:03:08.280> similarities<00:03:08.790> let's<00:03:09.510> go<00:03:09.659> ahead

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
forever with similarities let's go ahead

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.190 
forever with similarities let's go ahead
and<00:03:09.930> move<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.680> differences<00:03:11.959> so<00:03:12.959> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
and move on to the differences so the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.509 
and move on to the differences so the
first<00:03:13.409> difference<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:14.069> want<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.340> talk<00:03:14.489> about

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
scorestreak that like a terror which I

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.369 
scorestreak that like a terror which I
know<00:03:42.269> supposed<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.810> be<00:03:42.870> on<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.109> pipeline

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
know supposed to be on the pipeline

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.800 
know supposed to be on the pipeline
during<00:03:43.889> may<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.150> black<00:03:45.150> ops<00:03:45.329> 2<00:03:45.510> really

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
during may and black ops 2 really

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.990 
during may and black ops 2 really
doesn't<00:03:46.319> have<00:03:46.530> actually<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.459> doesn't<00:03:47.699> have

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
doesn't have actually it doesn't have

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.360 
doesn't have actually it doesn't have
like<00:03:48.209> any<00:03:48.359> dynamic<00:03:48.780> map<00:03:49.260> features<00:03:49.799> as<00:03:49.949> far<00:03:50.190> as

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
like any dynamic map features as far as

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.180 
like any dynamic map features as far as
I'm<00:03:50.519> concerned<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:51.329> that's<00:03:52.229> one<00:03:52.680> difference

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
I'm concerned and that's one difference

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.369 
I'm concerned and that's one difference
so<00:03:53.729> let's<00:03:54.239> go<00:03:54.389> ahead<00:03:54.419> and<00:03:54.629> take<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.989> look<00:03:55.169> at

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
so let's go ahead and take a look at

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.509 
so let's go ahead and take a look at
another<00:03:55.500> difference<00:03:56.989> so<00:03:57.989> here<00:03:58.379> is<00:03:58.620> my<00:03:59.099> final

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
another difference so here is my final

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.099 
another difference so here is my final
difference<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:00.419> I<00:04:00.510> know<00:04:00.569> this<00:04:00.900> will

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
difference and I know this will

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.319 
difference and I know this will
definitely<00:04:01.319> be<00:04:01.590> able<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:01.979> be<00:04:02.099> agreed<00:04:02.549> advanced

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
definitely be able to be agreed advanced

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.500 
definitely be able to be agreed advanced
warfare<00:04:03.479> has<00:04:04.379> a<00:04:04.739> lot<00:04:04.979> deeper<00:04:05.510> customization
