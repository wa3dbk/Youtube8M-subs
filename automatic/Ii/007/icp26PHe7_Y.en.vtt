there's the miter or chop saw it's
called<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.329> miter<00:00:45.600> saw<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.500> set

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
called a miter saw because you can set

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.440 
called a miter saw because you can set
the<00:00:46.829> angle<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> blade<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.059> enters<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the angle of the blade as it enters the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.270 
the angle of the blade as it enters the
wood<00:00:48.629> now<00:00:49.110> if<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> compound<00:00:49.980> miter

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
wood now if you have a compound miter

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.860 
wood now if you have a compound miter
saw<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.730> means<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.390> set<00:00:51.629> two

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
saw that means that you can set two

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.020 
saw that means that you can set two
angles<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> blade<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> saw<00:00:53.850> that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
angles on the blade this is the saw that

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.490 
angles on the blade this is the saw that
you<00:00:54.149> would<00:00:54.270> probably<00:00:54.660> use<00:00:54.840> if<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.260> were<00:00:55.379> going

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you would probably use if you were going

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.200 
you would probably use if you were going
to<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.710> crown<00:00:55.980> molding<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.489> your<00:00:56.670> house<00:00:56.850> or

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
any kind of trim work it's also great

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.130 
any kind of trim work it's also great
for<00:00:59.340> chopping<00:00:59.550> two<00:00:59.879> by<00:01:00.059> fours<00:01:00.329> or<00:01:00.570> making<00:01:00.930> any

for chopping two by fours or making any
straight<00:01:01.680> cuts<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.190> use<00:01:02.489> my<00:01:02.670> miter<00:01:02.850> saw

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
straight cuts I use my miter saw

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.090 
straight cuts I use my miter saw
constantly<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.170> you'll<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> lot<00:01:05.070> of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
constantly and you'll see it in a lot of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.280 
constantly and you'll see it in a lot of
my<00:01:05.280> videos<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.210> great<00:01:06.420> saw<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.869> next

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
my videos it's a great saw to have next

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.440 
my videos it's a great saw to have next
up<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> table<00:01:08.100> saw<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.340> table<00:01:08.729> saw<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.150> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
up is the table saw the table saw is a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.700 
up is the table saw the table saw is a
little<00:01:09.750> bit<00:01:09.840> different<00:01:10.140> than<00:01:10.260> these<00:01:10.380> others

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
little bit different than these others

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.320 
little bit different than these others
because<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> only<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.670> with<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> fixed

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
because it's the only one with a fixed

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.149 
because it's the only one with a fixed
blade<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.020> blade<00:01:13.260> stays<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.770> its<00:01:13.890> place

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
blade the blade stays in its place

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.070 
blade the blade stays in its place
and<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.580> move<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.000> wood<00:01:15.150> across<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.869> blade

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and you move the wood across the blade

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.080 
and you move the wood across the blade
this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.830> great<00:01:17.159> because<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.580> move<00:01:17.790> any

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
this is great because you can move any

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.060 
this is great because you can move any
amount<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.540> wood<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.740> four<00:01:19.950> by
