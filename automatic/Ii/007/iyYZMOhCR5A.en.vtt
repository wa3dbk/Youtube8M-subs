00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
tons of radiator support here too so I'm

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.580 
tons of radiator support here too so I'm
imagining<00:01:36.270> folks<00:01:36.780> might<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.049> looking<00:01:37.409> into

imagining folks might be looking into

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.499 
imagining folks might be looking into
this<00:01:37.710> for<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.189> really<00:01:38.700> high-end<00:01:38.880> water-cooled

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
this for a really high-end water-cooled

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.719 
this for a really high-end water-cooled
system<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.259> could<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> 360<00:01:41.189> radiator<00:01:41.520> here

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
system you could do a 360 radiator here

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.399 
system you could do a 360 radiator here
on<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> side<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.570> put<00:01:42.689> another<00:01:42.960> 360

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
on the side you can put another 360

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.710 
on the side you can put another 360
radiator<00:01:43.979> here<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.670> front<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.570> got

hundred and twenty there at the back as

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.850 
hundred and twenty there at the back as
well<00:01:51.270> as<00:01:51.390> some<00:01:51.570> grommets<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.590> writing

some water cooling tubes and another
great<00:01:55.860> thing<00:01:55.950> about<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.640> there's

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
great thing about this is that there's

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.580 
great thing about this is that there's
just<00:01:57.119> tons<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.659> tons<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.990> space<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.409> here<00:01:58.530> so

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
just tons and tons of space in here so

if<00:01:58.799> you're<00:01:58.920> looking<00:01:59.219> into<00:01:59.369> doing<00:02:00.240> maybe<00:02:00.630> a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
if you're looking into doing maybe a

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.569 
if you're looking into doing maybe a
dual<00:02:01.020> loop<00:02:01.380> water<00:02:01.770> cooling<00:02:02.189> system<00:02:02.219> or

something like that you could easily fit
in<00:02:04.560> your<00:02:05.250> reservoirs<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.479> sort<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.719> thing

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
in your reservoirs of that sort of thing

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.859 
in your reservoirs of that sort of thing
along<00:02:07.110> here<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.849> excellent<00:02:08.849> design<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.780> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
along here so excellent design of the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.250 
along here so excellent design of the
case<00:02:10.050> overall<00:02:10.410> and

I'm<00:02:11.650> really<00:02:11.920> looking<00:02:12.310> forward<00:02:12.519> to<00:02:12.640> what<00:02:12.879> some

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
I'm really looking forward to what some

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.850 
I'm really looking forward to what some
folks<00:02:13.330> might<00:02:13.569> be<00:02:13.629> actually<00:02:14.230> assembling<00:02:14.739> in

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
folks might be actually assembling in

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.770 
folks might be actually assembling in
this<00:02:14.980> thing<00:02:15.220> comes<00:02:15.700> with<00:02:15.879> seven<00:02:16.239> case<00:02:16.480> fans

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
this thing comes with seven case fans

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.600 
this thing comes with seven case fans
right<00:02:16.989> out<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.230> box<00:02:17.409> it<00:02:17.860> basically<00:02:18.370> set

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
right out of the box it basically set

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.309 
right out of the box it basically set
two<00:02:18.760> intakes<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.360> both<00:02:19.540> sides<00:02:19.810> as<00:02:19.989> well<00:02:20.110> as<00:02:20.170> an

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
two intakes on both sides as well as an

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.809 
two intakes on both sides as well as an
exhaust<00:02:20.620> there<00:02:20.829> on<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.010> back<00:02:21.189> and<00:02:21.430> then

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
exhaust there on the back and then

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.250 
exhaust there on the back and then
there's<00:02:21.970> some<00:02:22.120> extra<00:02:22.450> space<00:02:22.480> at<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.019> back<00:02:23.230> of

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
there's some extra space at the back of

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.869 
there's some extra space at the back of
the<00:02:23.470> chassis<00:02:23.890> where<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.189> could<00:02:24.340> set<00:02:24.549> up<00:02:24.610> a

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
the chassis where you could set up a

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.149 
the chassis where you could set up a
power<00:02:25.360> strip<00:02:25.689> and<00:02:25.930> route<00:02:26.470> your<00:02:26.650> cables<00:02:26.980> there

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
power strip and route your cables there

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.069 
power strip and route your cables there
so<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.549> can<00:02:27.700> more<00:02:28.090> easily<00:02:28.150> open<00:02:28.930> and

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
so that you can more easily open and

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.330 
so that you can more easily open and
close<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.680> then<00:02:29.769> of<00:02:29.890> course<00:02:29.920> if<00:02:30.220> you're

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
close this and then of course if you're

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.890 
close this and then of course if you're
worried<00:02:30.549> about<00:02:30.579> security<00:02:30.879> you<00:02:31.329> have<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
worried about security you have the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.289 
worried about security you have the
barrel<00:02:32.140> lock<00:02:32.319> there<00:02:32.590> as<00:02:32.829> well<00:02:33.099> so<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.150> the

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
barrel lock there as well so that is the

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.110 
barrel lock there as well so that is the
DK<00:02:34.690> 0<00:02:34.930> 1<00:02:35.140> X<00:02:35.290> I'm<00:02:35.500> going<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.709> roll<00:02:35.890> this<00:02:35.920> way<00:02:36.400> so

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
DK 0 1 X I'm going to roll this way so

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
monitor stands on either of those so

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.950 
monitor stands on either of those so
that's<00:04:28.400> pretty<00:04:28.669> cool<00:04:28.909> now<00:04:29.120> this<00:04:29.659> one<00:04:29.840> of

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
that's pretty cool now this one of

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.709 
that's pretty cool now this one of
course<00:04:29.990> will<00:04:30.319> also<00:04:30.560> open<00:04:31.009> just<00:04:31.550> like<00:04:31.729> so<00:04:32.060> but

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:32.719 
course will also open just like so but

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:35.019 
course will also open just like so but
you'll<00:04:32.840> notice<00:04:32.990> thanks<00:04:33.800> to<00:04:33.919> its<00:04:34.069> size<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:34.669> can

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:35.029 
you'll notice thanks to its size you can

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:36.879 
you'll notice thanks to its size you can
actually<00:04:35.180> fit<00:04:35.569> two<00:04:35.870> systems<00:04:36.349> in<00:04:36.529> here<00:04:36.740> not

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
actually fit two systems in here not

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.920 
actually fit two systems in here not
just<00:04:36.919> one<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:37.819> you<00:04:37.909> can<00:04:37.999> have<00:04:38.060> a<00:04:38.210> full<00:04:38.419> size<00:04:38.689> say

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
just one so you can have a full size say

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.330 
just one so you can have a full size say
your<00:04:39.110> workhorse<00:04:39.289> system<00:04:39.860> over<00:04:40.069> here<00:04:40.099> your

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
your workhorse system over here your

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.100 
your workhorse system over here your
gaming<00:04:40.669> system<00:04:41.029> and<00:04:41.120> they've<00:04:41.599> actually<00:04:41.810> got<00:04:42.080> a

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
gaming system and they've actually got a

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.420 
gaming system and they've actually got a
pretty<00:04:42.289> cool<00:04:42.560> setup<00:04:42.800> right<00:04:43.009> in<00:04:43.129> there<00:04:43.279> with<00:04:43.400> a

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
pretty cool setup right in there with a

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.550 
pretty cool setup right in there with a
Maximus<00:04:43.879> seven<00:04:44.150> range<00:04:44.360> you're<00:04:44.539> going<00:04:44.779> on<00:04:44.870> tons

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
Maximus seven range you're going on tons

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.110 
Maximus seven range you're going on tons
and<00:04:45.770> tons<00:04:45.800> of<00:04:46.039> harddrive<00:04:46.460> support<00:04:46.819> in<00:04:46.879> here<00:04:47.029> as

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
and tons of harddrive support in here as

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.519 
and tons of harddrive support in here as
well<00:04:47.270> so<00:04:47.449> they've<00:04:47.569> actually<00:04:47.659> split<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.259> specs

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:48.529 
well so they've actually split the specs

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:51.369 
well so they've actually split the specs
up<00:04:48.740> but<00:04:48.889> you<00:04:48.979> can<00:04:49.129> do<00:04:49.279> 9<00:04:49.909> 3.5<00:04:50.779> inch<00:04:50.960> drives<00:04:51.169> on

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:51.379 
up but you can do 9 3.5 inch drives on

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.040 
up but you can do 9 3.5 inch drives on
that<00:04:51.529> one<00:04:51.710> you<00:04:52.099> can<00:04:52.279> do<00:04:52.479> seven<00:04:53.479> I<00:04:53.599> believe<00:04:53.629> on

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
that one you can do seven I believe on

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.209 
that one you can do seven I believe on
this<00:04:54.169> side<00:04:54.379> let<00:04:54.499> me<00:04:54.560> double<00:04:54.800> check<00:04:54.830> that<00:04:55.129> I'm

all of these drive bays also have 2.5
inch<00:05:01.939> drive<00:05:02.180> mounts<00:05:02.569> and<00:05:02.750> then<00:05:03.560> you've<00:05:03.680> got<00:05:03.860> a

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
inch drive mounts and then you've got a

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.399 
inch drive mounts and then you've got a
mini<00:05:04.189> ITX<00:05:04.400> mount<00:05:05.150> over<00:05:05.419> here<00:05:05.629> as<00:05:05.719> well<00:05:05.900> if<00:05:06.349> I

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.409 
mini ITX mount over here as well if I

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.290 
mini ITX mount over here as well if I
don't<00:05:06.469> push<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.860> drawer<00:05:07.069> in<00:05:07.250> so<00:05:07.729> you<00:05:07.849> could<00:05:08.150> do

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
don't push the drawer in so you could do

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.269 
don't push the drawer in so you could do
say<00:05:08.629> maybe<00:05:08.810> a<00:05:08.930> smaller<00:05:09.229> HTP<00:05:09.770> system<00:05:10.159> or

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:10.279 
say maybe a smaller HTP system or

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:12.610 
say maybe a smaller HTP system or
something<00:05:10.580> like<00:05:10.669> that<00:05:10.729> maybe<00:05:11.060> a<00:05:11.210> server<00:05:11.620> over

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
something like that maybe a server over

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.689 
something like that maybe a server over
here<00:05:12.650> running<00:05:13.069> in<00:05:13.159> tandem<00:05:13.520> with<00:05:13.580> your

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
here running in tandem with your

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.019 
here running in tandem with your
full-size<00:05:14.360> gaming<00:05:14.900> desktop<00:05:15.349> again<00:05:16.029> I'm

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:17.029 
full-size gaming desktop again I'm

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:18.399 
full-size gaming desktop again I'm
imagining<00:05:17.330> all<00:05:17.719> of<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.900> water<00:05:18.080> cooling

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
imagining all of the water cooling

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:20.559 
imagining all of the water cooling
possibilities<00:05:19.039> here<00:05:19.250> so<00:05:19.460> let<00:05:20.240> me<00:05:20.270> double

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:20.569 
possibilities here so let me double

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.420 
possibilities here so let me double
check<00:05:20.599> the<00:05:20.900> radiator<00:05:21.259> support<00:05:21.439> yes<00:05:21.860> so<00:05:22.339> we've

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
check the radiator support yes so we've

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.610 
check the radiator support yes so we've
got<00:05:22.599> 360<00:05:23.599> over<00:05:23.689> here<00:05:23.930> although<00:05:24.080> it<00:05:24.229> is<00:05:24.319> blocked

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
got 360 over here although it is blocked

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.469 
got 360 over here although it is blocked
by<00:05:24.860> those<00:05:25.099> hard<00:05:25.580> drives<00:05:25.819> but<00:05:25.999> you<00:05:26.120> can<00:05:26.270> remove

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
by those hard drives but you can remove

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.990 
by those hard drives but you can remove
those<00:05:26.749> if<00:05:26.990> you<00:05:27.080> want<00:05:27.259> to<00:05:27.319> do<00:05:27.409> something<00:05:27.800> more

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
those if you want to do something more

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.269 
those if you want to do something more
advantageous<00:05:29.000> to<00:05:29.419> your<00:05:29.659> water<00:05:29.810> cooling<00:05:30.139> needs
