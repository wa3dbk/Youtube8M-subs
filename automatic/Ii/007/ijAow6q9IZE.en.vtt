wrench so first I'll demonstrate how we
put<00:00:47.150> the<00:00:47.240> kids<00:00:47.420> together<00:00:47.540> and<00:00:48.470> then<00:00:48.680> how<00:00:49.340> we

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
put the kids together and then how we

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.300 
put the kids together and then how we
put<00:00:49.670> it<00:00:49.760> onto<00:00:49.880> the<00:00:50.030> dock<00:00:51.040> first<00:00:52.040> thing<00:00:52.190> I'm

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
put it onto the dock first thing I'm

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.670 
put it onto the dock first thing I'm
going<00:00:52.400> to<00:00:52.460> do<00:00:52.580> is<00:00:52.730> take<00:00:52.940> my<00:00:53.090> axle<00:00:53.900> slide<00:00:54.560> it

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
going to do is take my axle slide it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.620 
going to do is take my axle slide it
through<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.890> first<00:00:55.070> wheels<00:00:55.400> I've<00:00:56.330> already

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
through the first wheels I've already

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.090 
through the first wheels I've already
put<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.810> retaining<00:00:57.200> ring<00:00:57.320> on<00:00:57.560> to<00:00:57.740> save<00:00:57.950> some

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
put the retaining ring on to save some

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:08.719 
put the retaining ring on to save some

and that's the wheel assembly now we're
gonna<00:01:50.000> put<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.240> on<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.600> dock

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.420 

next<00:02:23.379> we're<00:02:23.499> going<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.650> tighten<00:02:23.859> down<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.219> set

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
next we're going to tighten down the set

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:42.780 
next we're going to tighten down the set
bolts<00:02:24.730> on<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:24.939> axle<00:02:25.269> adapter

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.930

there you have it we're all set up
so<00:02:46.940> as<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.120> can<00:02:47.239> see<00:02:47.299> from<00:02:47.599> the<00:02:47.690> tiny<00:02:47.900> take

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
so as you can see from the tiny take

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.589 
so as you can see from the tiny take
this<00:02:48.290> out<00:02:48.470> of<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.650> box<00:02:49.090> five<00:02:50.090> minutes<00:02:50.390> later

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
this out of the box five minutes later

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.559 
this out of the box five minutes later
you<00:02:50.900> have<00:02:51.650> yourself<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.099> Roland<00:02:52.489> die<00:02:52.640> let<00:02:53.510> me

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
you have yourself a Roland die let me

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:06.330 
you have yourself a Roland die let me
show<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:53.780> how<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:54.049> rolls<00:02:54.230> it

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.360 

just<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.480> simple<00:03:08.140> turn<00:03:08.800> your<00:03:08.890> cover<00:03:09.129> some

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
just that simple turn your cover some

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.030 
just that simple turn your cover some
heavy<00:03:09.550> docks<00:03:09.819> into<00:03:10.120> one<00:03:10.300> person<00:03:10.510> job<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.920> can

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
heavy docks into one person job you can

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.570 
heavy docks into one person job you can
usually<00:03:12.190> use<00:03:12.519> one<00:03:13.000> kit<00:03:13.330> for<00:03:14.260> anywhere<00:03:14.890> from<00:03:14.950> 10

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
usually use one kit for anywhere from 10

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.699 
usually use one kit for anywhere from 10
to<00:03:15.610> 20<00:03:15.879> feet<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.269> docks<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:16.810> if<00:03:17.349> they<00:03:17.440> had<00:03:17.530> to

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
to 20 feet of docks so if they had to

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:18.869 
to 20 feet of docks so if they had to
eight-point<00:03:18.099> sections<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:18.610> could<00:03:18.730> both

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
eight-point sections you could both

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.839 
eight-point sections you could both
those<00:03:19.090> together<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:19.840> make<00:03:20.739> one<00:03:20.920> 60-foot<00:03:21.640> roll

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
those together and make one 60-foot roll

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.360 
those together and make one 60-foot roll
in<00:03:22.060> section<00:03:22.480> really<00:03:22.599> save<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:22.930> lot<00:03:23.140> of<00:03:23.170> time<00:03:23.440> and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
in section really save a lot of time and

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.420 
in section really save a lot of time and
it<00:03:25.239> may<00:03:25.450> make<00:03:25.690> your<00:03:25.950> lakefront<00:03:26.950> experience
