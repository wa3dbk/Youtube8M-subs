00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.600
 good afternoon i want to tell you how 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.800
 do not wash your hair with soda 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.719
 use shampoo means I when 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.880
 acquainted with this method seemed to me 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.529
 it's something unreal and thought that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.890
 first time I won't go out 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.640
 but decided to try and it was very 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.250
 pleasantly surprised since the hair is more 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.609
 soft and pleasant silky and most importantly 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.830
 clean appoint now several 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.850
 I don't use months at all 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.360
 shampoo and my head only soda means 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.340
 what we need for this but of course 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.899
 soda 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.840
 Means how many we take vaults if 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.050
 hair is long thick then more 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.860
 if short then you can take less soda 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.030
 but here I have 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:58.469
 medium length hair just below the shoulders i 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:04.860
 take so assembly soda who we dilute 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:07.860
 water well of course it is desirable that water 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.409
 was warm it was nice to wash my hair 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.670
 and somewhere in a glass of water or a cup of water and 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.930
 how we dilute 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.680
 we mix well with us 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.900
 solution 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.900
 when the line is settling it is pretty 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:31.700
 clear solution 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:35.640
 then we wet your hair over a basin 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.509
 we start to pour in this solution and watch 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.360
 on rubbing hair and so five times you can 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.740
 even more rubbing in 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.840
 we massage the hair and we get 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.640
 soap solution 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.640
 here's the color as a soap solution 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:59.810
 is with foam when 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.850
 soda mixes with head and hair fat 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.380
 it turns out such soapy water we see 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.560
 the difference here and after that 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.440
 after thorough washing the courts we already 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.810
 rinse with soda 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.650
 very well it is washed off and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:25.720
 can polygon then rinse hair in 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:29.830
 broth of some kind or vinegar too 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.590
 she softens the hair I like more 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.120
 herbs than vinegar mean what herbs 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:42.670
 chamomile herbs can be used 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.170
 nettle 1000 forester well and basically you 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.120
 can find a lot of information in 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.700
 what herbs are better to use on the internet 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.900
 Here I really liked nettle hair 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.580
 were so soft and sweet and I even 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.530
 I could not believe that this could be without 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:02.530
 shampoo and what attracted to this method 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.690
 so that the hair is less fat and you 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.730
 have to wash my hair not so often then 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:12.910
 there is a mode to wash my hair and well, of course 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:17.549
 efficiency of the method that is, the soda is worth 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:20.680
 cheap and no hair required 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:24.880
 expensive shampoos or some other 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.049
 air conditioners so try if you 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.239
 suddenly something didnâ€™t work 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.780
 try experimenting with 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:38.850
 the amount of soda and I believe that you have everything 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:43.269
 it will turn out and you will be satisfied with everything 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.810
 beautiful hair to you and bless you 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.810
