00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
on the side of your house the next thing

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.609 
on the side of your house the next thing
is<00:00:23.849> turn<00:00:24.419> this<00:00:24.630> valve<00:00:24.930> here<00:00:25.169> the<00:00:25.349> one<00:00:25.470> that

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
is turn this valve here the one that

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.100 
is turn this valve here the one that
goes<00:00:25.770> straight<00:00:25.919> down<00:00:26.130> turn<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.110> completely

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
goes straight down turn that completely

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.549 
goes straight down turn that completely
off

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:28.559 
off

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.170 
off
that's<00:00:28.890> your<00:00:29.099> supply<00:00:29.430> line<00:00:29.700> so<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:29.939> want<00:00:30.090> to

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
that's your supply line so we want to

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.630 
that's your supply line so we want to
take<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.020> water<00:00:31.200> from<00:00:31.380> coming<00:00:31.649> to<00:00:32.399> your

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
take the water from coming to your

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.970 
take the water from coming to your
irrigation<00:00:33.239> system<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.719> turn<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.110> off<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
irrigation system and turn that off the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.100 
irrigation system and turn that off the
next<00:00:35.280> thing<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.629> side<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
next thing is is here on the side of the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.410 
next thing is is here on the side of the
valve<00:00:37.379> here<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.239> petcocks

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
valve here is petcocks

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.270 
valve here is petcocks
and<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.170> want<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.679> turn<00:00:40.859> each<00:00:41.100> one

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
and what we want to do is turn each one

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.319 
and what we want to do is turn each one
of<00:00:41.399> these<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.030> standard

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
of these with just a standard

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
of these with just a standard
screwdriver<00:00:42.649> turn<00:00:43.649> these<00:00:43.859> to<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.039> 45<00:00:44.609> degree

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
screwdriver turn these to a 45 degree

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.790 
screwdriver turn these to a 45 degree
angle<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.780> what<00:00:45.929> that's<00:00:46.109> going<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.409> do<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.679> we

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
angle and what that's going to do is we

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.979 
angle and what that's going to do is we
release<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.190> pressure<00:00:47.489> from<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.909> system<00:00:47.989> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
release the pressure from the system and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.840 
release the pressure from the system and
actually<00:00:49.320> drain<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:49.739> housing<00:00:50.159> inside<00:00:50.519> here

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
actually drain the housing inside here

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.910 
actually drain the housing inside here
this<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> most<00:00:51.749> vulnerable<00:00:51.989> part<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
this is the most vulnerable part the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.189 
this is the most vulnerable part the
brass<00:00:53.159> right<00:00:53.579> here<00:00:53.909> is<00:00:54.059> vulnerable<00:00:54.989> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
brass right here is vulnerable to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.290 
brass right here is vulnerable to
freezing<00:00:55.679> water<00:00:56.219> inside<00:00:56.609> of<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.909> freeze<00:00:57.149> that

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
freezing water inside of it freeze that

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.229 
freezing water inside of it freeze that
expands<00:00:57.719> cracks<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.409> then<00:00:58.499> you<00:00:58.620> got<00:00:58.769> problems

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
expands cracks and then you got problems

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.579 
expands cracks and then you got problems

this inside the garage may be mounted
outside<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:16.290> home<00:01:16.469> and<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:17.100> we're<00:01:17.310> trying

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
outside your home and what we're trying

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
outside your home and what we're trying
to<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.149> is<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:19.110> into<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> inside<00:01:19.740> and

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
to do here is get into the inside and

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.389 
to do here is get into the inside and
manually<00:01:21.540> go<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> each<00:01:22.259> zone<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.979> relieve<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
manually go to each zone and relieve the

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.279 
manually go to each zone and relieve the
pressure<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.969> what<00:01:24.539> we're<00:01:24.659> trying<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.899> do<00:01:25.049> is

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
pressure and what we're trying to do is

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:26.990 
pressure and what we're trying to do is
there<00:01:25.469> may<00:01:25.619> still<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.890> some<00:01:26.039> water<00:01:26.460> inside<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
there may still be some water inside the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.969 
there may still be some water inside the
pipes<00:01:27.240> we're<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.049> worried<00:01:28.320> about<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.710> is

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
pipes we're not so worried about that is

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.109 
pipes we're not so worried about that is
we<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.340> don't<00:01:29.490> want<00:01:29.670> them<00:01:29.789> under<00:01:29.880> pressure

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
we just don't want them under pressure

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.569 
we just don't want them under pressure
again<00:01:30.899> water<00:01:31.500> inside<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.039> pipes<00:01:32.310> under

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
again water inside the pipes under

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.700 
again water inside the pipes under
pressure<00:01:32.939> those<00:01:33.210> pipes<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:33.659> full<00:01:33.869> expands

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
pressure those pipes are full expands

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.920 
pressure those pipes are full expands
we've<00:01:34.979> got<00:01:35.100> broken<00:01:35.460> pipes<00:01:35.700> again<00:01:36.180> bad<00:01:36.450> thing

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
we've got broken pipes again bad thing

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.569 
we've got broken pipes again bad thing
so<00:01:37.380> we'll<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.710> go<00:01:37.859> manually<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.460> each

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
so we'll just go manually to each

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.380 
so we'll just go manually to each
station<00:01:39.619> run<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.710> through<00:01:40.920> each<00:01:41.130> station<00:01:41.700> this

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
station run it through each station this

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.730 
station run it through each station this
