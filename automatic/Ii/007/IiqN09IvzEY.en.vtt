00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
what happens 300 yard marker coming up

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.600 
what happens 300 yard marker coming up
and<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.140> think<00:03:39.200> that<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:39.709> very<00:03:39.860> very<00:03:40.280> good

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
and I think that is a very very good

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:52.710 
and I think that is a very very good
decision<00:03:41.180> things<00:03:41.630> are<00:03:41.840> getting<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:42.140> lip

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.390 

but<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.410> not<00:03:53.560> much<00:03:53.710> better<00:03:53.980> than<00:03:54.220> that

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
but the not much better than that

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.040 
but the not much better than that
because<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.850> lane<00:03:55.030> one<00:03:55.270> in<00:03:55.450> lane<00:03:55.630> two<00:03:55.900> were

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
because the lane one in lane two were

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.410 
because the lane one in lane two were
quite<00:03:56.290> busy<00:03:59.490> returning<00:04:00.490> the<00:04:00.670> left<00:04:01.000> of<00:04:01.300> the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
quite busy returning the left of the

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:19.340 
quite busy returning the left of the
random<00:04:01.750> either<00:04:01.930> had
