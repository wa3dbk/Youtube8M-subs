 motherboard again i repeat 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.760
 was chosen on this through these because 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.020
 what 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.640
 Why will not disperse, and so with 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.640

 video card this video card will be 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.410
 enough here budget which we have 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:20.060
