00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.700 
the water and then to the plants I will
use<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> measurement<00:00:39.690> related<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> light

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
use a measurement related to light

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.619 
use a measurement related to light

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
correct light i will use watts per

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.880 
correct light i will use watts per

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
fluorescent bulbs are more efficient and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.770 
fluorescent bulbs are more efficient and
they<00:01:37.259> require<00:01:37.619> less<00:01:37.979> watts<00:01:38.340> per<00:01:38.640> gallon<00:01:39.119> one

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
they require less watts per gallon one

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520 
of the reasons they do this is compact
fluorescents<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.360> better<00:01:42.630> light<00:01:42.899> hoods<00:01:43.290> and
