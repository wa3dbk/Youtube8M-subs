after that it just like after we unplug

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.899 
after that it just like after we unplug
it<00:02:04.049> everything<00:02:05.049> would<00:02:05.229> be<00:02:05.380> easy<00:02:05.590> I<00:02:06.100> just<00:02:06.700> like

remove it like this way so this

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.140 
remove it like this way so this
SATA<00:02:12.450> hard<00:02:12.750> drive<00:02:13.079> Sam<00:02:14.069> thinks<00:02:14.519> that<00:02:14.700> it's<00:02:15.060> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
SATA hard drive Sam thinks that it's a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.069 
SATA hard drive Sam thinks that it's a
faulty<00:02:15.480> drive<00:02:15.659> actually<00:02:16.219> so<00:02:17.219> now<00:02:17.489> we<00:02:17.549> just

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
faulty drive actually so now we just

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.929 
faulty drive actually so now we just
remove<00:02:19.079> the<00:02:19.260> card<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:20.400> will<00:02:20.489> your<00:02:20.670> card
