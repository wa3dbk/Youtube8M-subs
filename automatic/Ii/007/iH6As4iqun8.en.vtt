body fat so now I'm going to increase

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.689 
body fat so now I'm going to increase
the<00:00:29.079> number<00:00:29.109> of<00:00:29.470> reps<00:00:29.710> increase<00:00:30.249> the<00:00:30.400> number

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
the number of reps increase the number

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.330 
the number of reps increase the number
of<00:00:30.730> sets<00:00:31.089> and<00:00:31.509> burn<00:00:32.079> that<00:00:32.320> fat<00:00:32.650> with<00:00:32.890> light<00:00:33.130> and

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
of sets and burn that fat with light and

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.900 
of sets and burn that fat with light and
wait<00:00:33.550> some<00:00:33.760> higher<00:00:34.030> reps<00:00:34.770> well<00:00:35.770> they<00:00:36.730> keep

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
wait some higher reps well they keep

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.360 
wait some higher reps well they keep
doing<00:00:37.210> that<00:00:37.420> nothing<00:00:38.170> two<00:00:38.650> three<00:00:38.950> months<00:00:39.100> we

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
doing that nothing two three months we

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.250 
doing that nothing two three months we
see<00:00:39.550> them<00:00:39.670> in<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.790> gym<00:00:40.030> again<00:00:40.120> they<00:00:41.080> look

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
see them in the gym again they look

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.960 
see them in the gym again they look
smaller<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:43.660> they<00:00:43.930> are<00:00:43.990> not<00:00:44.110> leaner<00:00:44.380> and<00:00:44.970> they

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
smaller but they are not leaner and they

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.430 
smaller but they are not leaner and they
look<00:00:46.120> smaller<00:00:46.420> because<00:00:46.660> they<00:00:46.960> lost<00:00:47.200> muscle

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
look smaller because they lost muscle

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.600 
look smaller because they lost muscle
tissue<00:00:47.830> but<00:00:48.190> it<00:00:48.490> didn't<00:00:48.700> lose<00:00:48.820> any<00:00:49.180> body<00:00:49.510> fat

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
tissue but it didn't lose any body fat

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.280 
tissue but it didn't lose any body fat
so<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:51.730> question<00:00:52.180> now<00:00:52.360> is<00:00:53.460> why<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.660> happens

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
so the question now is why this happens

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.750 
so the question now is why this happens
why<00:00:56.770> this<00:00:57.180> high<00:00:58.180> rep<00:00:58.900> training<00:00:59.430> high<00:01:00.430> number

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
why this high rep training high number

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.950 
why this high rep training high number
of<00:01:00.880> sets<00:01:01.710> simply<00:01:02.710> doesn't<00:01:03.130> burn<00:01:03.310> fat<00:01:03.640> as<00:01:03.960> most

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
of sets simply doesn't burn fat as most

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.060 
of sets simply doesn't burn fat as most
most<00:01:05.560> people<00:01:06.070> believe<00:01:06.700> it<00:01:06.999> will<00:01:07.920> well<00:01:08.920> the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
most people believe it will well the

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.940 
most people believe it will well the
answer<00:01:09.429> is<00:01:10.119> again<00:01:10.509> in<00:01:10.869> metabolism<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.950> when

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
answer is again in metabolism so when

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.910 
answer is again in metabolism so when
you<00:01:15.189> start<00:01:15.609> using<00:01:15.899> high<00:01:16.899> reps<00:01:17.229> that<00:01:17.649> means

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
you start using high reps that means

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.929 
you start using high reps that means
that<00:01:18.009> you're<00:01:18.130> gonna<00:01:18.219> start<00:01:18.460> using<00:01:18.609> lighter

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
that you're gonna start using lighter

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.099 
that you're gonna start using lighter
weights<00:01:19.090> but<00:01:19.929> you<00:01:20.049> don't<00:01:20.229> be<00:01:20.649> taken<00:01:21.069> away<00:01:21.189> by

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
weights but you don't be taken away by

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.510 
weights but you don't be taken away by
pumping<00:01:23.109> with<00:01:23.259> higher<00:01:23.619> reps<00:01:23.979> and<00:01:24.249> the<00:01:24.369> weight

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
pumping with higher reps and the weight

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.039 
pumping with higher reps and the weight
will<00:01:24.729> start<00:01:24.969> dropping<00:01:25.119> down<00:01:25.569> and<00:01:25.899> you're

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
will start dropping down and you're

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.020 
will start dropping down and you're
gonna<00:01:26.200> enjoy<00:01:26.350> your<00:01:26.530> workout<00:01:26.950> thinking<00:01:27.880> that

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
gonna enjoy your workout thinking that

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.849 
gonna enjoy your workout thinking that
you're<00:01:28.149> burning<00:01:28.420> fat<00:01:28.450> but<00:01:29.409> actually<00:01:29.770> you're

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
you're burning fat but actually you're

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.840 
you're burning fat but actually you're
not<00:01:30.039> burning<00:01:30.219> fat<00:01:31.079> exercise<00:01:32.079> per<00:01:32.499> se<00:01:32.770> is<00:01:33.039> not

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
not burning fat exercise per se is not

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.559 
not burning fat exercise per se is not
very<00:01:34.240> effective<00:01:34.899> in<00:01:35.139> calorie<00:01:35.740> burning<00:01:35.979> so<00:01:36.569> for

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
very effective in calorie burning so for

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.029 
very effective in calorie burning so for
example<00:01:38.189> 40<00:01:39.189> minutes<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:40.770> jogging<00:01:41.770> or

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
example 40 minutes of of jogging or

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.629 
example 40 minutes of of jogging or
running<00:01:42.069> will<00:01:42.880> burn<00:01:43.149> around<00:01:43.509> 300<00:01:44.200> calories

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:44.639 
running will burn around 300 calories

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:47.129 
running will burn around 300 calories
weight<00:01:45.639> training<00:01:45.909> will<00:01:46.090> probably<00:01:46.389> burn<00:01:46.689> half

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:47.139 
weight training will probably burn half

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.949 
weight training will probably burn half
the<00:01:47.499> month<00:01:47.799> so<00:01:48.130> talking<00:01:48.520> about<00:01:48.549> 150<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.509> 200

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
the month so talking about 150 to 200

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.069 
the month so talking about 150 to 200
calories<00:01:50.079> per<00:01:50.499> Y<00:01:51.219> training<00:01:51.609> session<00:01:51.969> I<00:01:52.119> mean

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
calories per Y training session I mean

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.260 
calories per Y training session I mean
this<00:01:53.409> is<00:01:53.679> simply<00:01:54.039> not<00:01:54.219> enough<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:54.729> burn<00:01:54.999> body

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
this is simply not enough to burn body

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.870 
this is simply not enough to burn body
fat<00:01:55.450> because<00:01:55.840> just<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.709> remind<00:01:57.069> you<00:01:57.189> to<00:01:57.670> burn

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
fat because just to remind you to burn

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.580 
fat because just to remind you to burn
one<00:01:58.179> pound<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.569> body<00:01:58.749> fat<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.079> will<00:01:59.289> need<00:01:59.469> to

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
one pound of body fat you will need to

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.690 
one pound of body fat you will need to
burn<00:01:59.770> 3,500<00:02:00.509> calories<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.950> this<00:02:03.159> is<00:02:03.310> for<00:02:03.520> me

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
burn 3,500 calories so this is for me

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.639 
burn 3,500 calories so this is for me
completely<00:02:04.179> false<00:02:04.479> economy<00:02:04.810> this<00:02:05.200> is<00:02:05.469> not

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
completely false economy this is not

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.679 
completely false economy this is not
gonna<00:02:05.799> work<00:02:05.920> I<00:02:06.310> mean<00:02:06.490> if<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:06.909> if<00:02:07.389> you<00:02:07.569> only

gonna work I mean if you if you only

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.990 
gonna work I mean if you if you only
burn<00:02:07.899> 150<00:02:08.530> 200<00:02:08.890> calories<00:02:09.220> per<00:02:09.429> your<00:02:09.640> training

burn 150 200 calories per your training

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.190 
burn 150 200 calories per your training
session<00:02:10.439> then<00:02:11.439> that

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
session then that

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.760 
session then that
is<00:02:12.319> not<00:02:12.470> going<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:12.680> happen<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.849> now<00:02:13.970> how<00:02:14.330> is

really lose body fat the answer lays
down<00:02:21.080> in<00:02:22.300> metabolism<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:26.480> most<00:02:28.120> important

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
down in metabolism the most important

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.000 
down in metabolism the most important
thing<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.540> understand<00:02:29.989> is<00:02:30.230> if<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.590> want<00:02:30.830> to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
thing to understand is if you want to

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.130 
thing to understand is if you want to
burn<00:02:31.280> body<00:02:31.580> fat<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.300> will<00:02:32.510> need<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.900> increase

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
burn body fat you will need to increase

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.680 
burn body fat you will need to increase
your<00:02:33.260> metabolism

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
your metabolism

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.380 
your metabolism
you<00:02:35.690> will<00:02:35.870> need<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.260> burn<00:02:36.970> more<00:02:37.970> calories

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
you will need to burn more calories

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.350 
you will need to burn more calories
during<00:02:39.349> your<00:02:39.709> resting<00:02:40.099> hours<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:40.910> when<00:02:41.269> you

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
during your resting hours so when you

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.990 
during your resting hours so when you
when<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:41.780> look<00:02:41.900> at<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.140> day<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:42.860> 24<00:02:43.819> hours

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
when you look at the day of 24 hours

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.960 
when you look at the day of 24 hours
right<00:02:45.010> 24<00:02:46.010> hours<00:02:46.370> you're<00:02:46.549> burning<00:02:46.819> energy

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
right 24 hours you're burning energy

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.729 
right 24 hours you're burning energy
you're<00:02:47.720> burning<00:02:48.019> calories<00:02:48.049> you're<00:02:48.709> burning

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
you're burning calories you're burning

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.150 
you're burning calories you're burning
predominantly<00:02:49.730> fat<00:02:50.030> in<00:02:50.209> wresting<00:02:50.599> hours<00:02:51.160> so

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
predominantly fat in wresting hours so

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.430 
predominantly fat in wresting hours so
now<00:02:52.310> if<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.549> want<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.819> burn<00:02:53.000> more<00:02:53.239> fat<00:02:53.510> you

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
now if you want to burn more fat you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.140 
now if you want to burn more fat you
will<00:02:54.590> need<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.829> burn<00:02:54.980> more<00:02:55.280> calories<00:02:55.700> in<00:02:56.120> your

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
will need to burn more calories in your

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.330 
will need to burn more calories in your
resting<00:02:56.660> hours<00:02:57.049> so<00:02:57.560> how<00:02:57.799> are<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:57.980> gonna<00:02:58.130> do

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
resting hours so how are you gonna do

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.509 
resting hours so how are you gonna do
this<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.959> best<00:03:00.230> way<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.560> do<00:03:00.920> it<00:03:01.040> actually<00:03:01.430> the

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
this the best way to do it actually the

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.600 
this the best way to do it actually the
only<00:03:01.700> way<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:01.940> do<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.329> is<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.959> increase<00:03:03.650> the

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
only way to do it is to increase the

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.050 
only way to do it is to increase the
tissue<00:03:04.970> that<00:03:05.450> actually<00:03:06.079> burns<00:03:07.040> most<00:03:07.730> of<00:03:07.940> the

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
tissue that actually burns most of the

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.300 
tissue that actually burns most of the
calories<00:03:08.329> during<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:09.019> day<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.560> tissue<00:03:09.920> is

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
calories during the day that tissue is

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.839 
calories during the day that tissue is
muscle<00:03:11.269> tissue<00:03:11.829> so<00:03:12.829> by<00:03:13.130> increasing<00:03:13.400> muscle

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
muscle tissue so by increasing muscle

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.500 
muscle tissue so by increasing muscle
tissue<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.540> will<00:03:14.569> increase<00:03:15.049> your<00:03:15.260> overall

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
tissue you will increase your overall

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.569 
tissue you will increase your overall
metabolism<00:03:17.889> by<00:03:18.889> increasing<00:03:19.340> overall

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
metabolism by increasing overall

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.170 
metabolism by increasing overall
metabolism<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.420> will<00:03:20.569> be<00:03:20.690> melting<00:03:21.200> your<00:03:21.380> fat

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
metabolism you will be melting your fat

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.300 
metabolism you will be melting your fat
now<00:03:23.180> if<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:24.049> go<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.470> gym<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.950> increase

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
now if you go to the gym and increase

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.370 
now if you go to the gym and increase
number<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.700> reps<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.209> lower<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.660> weights<00:03:26.870> he

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
number of reps and lower the weights he

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.830 
number of reps and lower the weights he
will<00:03:27.500> simply<00:03:27.769> lower<00:03:28.160> intensity<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.030> that

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
will simply lower intensity and that

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.289 
will simply lower intensity and that
whom<00:03:30.230> in<00:03:30.380> less<00:03:30.620> muscle<00:03:31.069> tissue<00:03:31.250> you<00:03:31.760> start

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
whom in less muscle tissue you start

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.349 
whom in less muscle tissue you start
losing<00:03:33.200> your<00:03:33.410> muscle<00:03:33.829> and<00:03:34.340> then<00:03:35.000> he<00:03:35.180> will

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
losing your muscle and then he will

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.470 
losing your muscle and then he will
start<00:03:35.769> slowing<00:03:36.769> down<00:03:36.950> your<00:03:37.370> metabolism<00:03:37.489> so

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
start slowing down your metabolism so

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.809 
start slowing down your metabolism so
whatever<00:03:38.810> weight<00:03:39.079> you<00:03:39.260> lose<00:03:39.470> is<00:03:40.310> going<00:03:40.609> to<00:03:40.670> go

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
whatever weight you lose is going to go

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.800 
whatever weight you lose is going to go
from<00:03:41.709> your<00:03:42.709> muscle<00:03:43.130> tissue<00:03:43.280> not<00:03:44.060> from<00:03:44.510> your

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
from your muscle tissue not from your

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.059 
from your muscle tissue not from your
fat<00:03:45.380> deposits<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.290> message<00:03:48.709> is<00:03:48.739> simple

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
fat deposits so the message is simple

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.430 
fat deposits so the message is simple
you<00:03:49.639> have<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:50.030> start<00:03:50.329> training<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:51.139> build

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
you have to start training to build

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.830 
you have to start training to build
muscles<00:03:51.889> by<00:03:52.700> building<00:03:53.209> muscles<00:03:53.600> you<00:03:53.720> will

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
muscles by building muscles you will

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.900 
muscles by building muscles you will
increase<00:03:54.170> your<00:03:54.319> overall<00:03:54.980> muscle<00:03:55.160> tissue<00:03:55.579> I'm

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
increase your overall muscle tissue I'm

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.879 
increase your overall muscle tissue I'm
there<00:03:56.180> for<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:56.690> will<00:03:57.410> increase<00:03:57.650> your

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
there for you will increase your

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.910 
there for you will increase your
metabolism<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.760> in<00:03:59.000> the<00:03:59.150> resting<00:03:59.630> hours<00:03:59.959> you

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
metabolism and in the resting hours you

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.879 
metabolism and in the resting hours you
will<00:04:01.099> be<00:04:01.250> burning<00:04:01.489> more<00:04:01.670> calories<00:04:02.389> in<00:04:03.200> the

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
will be burning more calories in the

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.160 
will be burning more calories in the
resting<00:04:04.280> hours<00:04:04.639> you<00:04:04.819> will<00:04:05.120> burn<00:04:05.420> calories

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
resting hours you will burn calories

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.620 
resting hours you will burn calories
from<00:04:06.530> body<00:04:06.799> fat<00:04:07.010> so<00:04:07.880> if<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.150> increase<00:04:08.359> your

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
from body fat so if you increase your

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.500 
from body fat so if you increase your
metabolism<00:04:08.750> for<00:04:09.349> example<00:04:09.859> for<00:04:10.459> 500<00:04:11.120> calories

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
metabolism for example for 500 calories

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.809 
metabolism for example for 500 calories
today<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:12.260> will<00:04:12.380> be<00:04:12.500> burning<00:04:12.739> on<00:04:13.040> one<00:04:13.519> pound

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
today you will be burning on one pound

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:20.699 
today you will be burning on one pound
of<00:04:13.940> body<00:04:14.120> fat<00:04:14.419> in<00:04:15.010> one<00:04:16.010> week<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:17.840> increase

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.920 

consumption<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.950> extra<00:04:22.430> 500<00:04:23.090> calories<00:04:23.450> will

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
consumption of extra 500 calories will

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.870 
consumption of extra 500 calories will
require<00:04:24.520> extra

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
require extra

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.930 
require extra
pounds<00:04:26.450> of<00:04:26.570> new<00:04:26.930> muscle<00:04:27.500> tissue<00:04:27.740> so<00:04:28.160> now<00:04:28.880> you

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
pounds of new muscle tissue so now you

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.880 
pounds of new muscle tissue so now you
better<00:04:29.210> start<00:04:29.330> building<00:04:30.020> those<00:04:30.140> 10<00:04:30.440> pounds<00:04:30.830> of

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
better start building those 10 pounds of

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.700 
better start building those 10 pounds of
muscle<00:04:31.070> tissue<00:04:31.600> because<00:04:32.600> once<00:04:33.230> you<00:04:33.440> here

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
muscle tissue because once you here

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.680 
muscle tissue because once you here
extra<00:04:34.010> 10<00:04:34.340> pounds<00:04:34.670> of<00:04:34.730> muscle<00:04:34.880> tissue<00:04:35.240> you

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
extra 10 pounds of muscle tissue you

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.140 
extra 10 pounds of muscle tissue you
will<00:04:35.840> be<00:04:35.960> melting<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.680> pound<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.340> body<00:04:37.550> fat<00:04:37.850> per

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
will be melting a pound of body fat per
