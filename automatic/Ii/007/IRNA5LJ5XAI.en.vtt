00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
go or telling you how long to train it's

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.920 
go or telling you how long to train it's
more<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:25.920> about<00:03:26.250> your<00:03:26.879> heart<00:03:27.239> rate<00:03:27.480> now

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
more so about your heart rate now

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.660 
more so about your heart rate now
remember<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:28.799> don't<00:03:28.890> want<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.159> go<00:03:29.250> over<00:03:29.549> that

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
remember we don't want to go over that

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.490 
remember we don't want to go over that
140<00:03:30.330> beats<00:03:30.510> per<00:03:30.659> minute<00:03:31.049> so<00:03:31.140> that's<00:03:31.290> going<00:03:31.440> to

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
140 beats per minute so that's going to

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.770 
140 beats per minute so that's going to
be<00:03:31.590> our<00:03:31.620> top<00:03:32.010> range<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.700> our<00:03:33.120> lower<00:03:33.330> range<00:03:33.629> is

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
be our top range and our lower range is

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.150 
be our top range and our lower range is
going<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.959> be<00:03:34.080> about<00:03:34.170> 120<00:03:35.599> so<00:03:36.680> for<00:03:37.680> people<00:03:38.010> that

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
going to be about 120 so for people that

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.580 
going to be about 120 so for people that
are<00:03:38.280> beginners<00:03:38.760> or<00:03:39.120> most<00:03:39.870> people<00:03:40.319> pregnant

that's<00:03:43.590> comfortable<00:03:44.129> now<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.120> increase<00:03:45.659> the

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
that's comfortable now to increase the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.539 
that's comfortable now to increase the
heart<00:03:46.079> rate<00:03:46.110> up<00:03:46.409> to<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.650> higher<00:03:46.920> range<00:03:47.310> at

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549

heart rate up to that higher range at
140<00:03:48.239> beats<00:03:48.390> per<00:03:48.540> minute<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.349> can<00:03:49.560> up<00:03:49.950> the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
140 beats per minute you can up the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.270 
140 beats per minute you can up the
incline<00:03:50.760> heart<00:03:51.660> rate<00:03:51.840> hits<00:03:52.140> 140<00:03:52.980> we're<00:03:53.160> going

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
incline heart rate hits 140 we're going

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.369 
incline heart rate hits 140 we're going
to<00:03:53.340> walk<00:03:53.579> it<00:03:53.730> down<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.180> 120<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:54.959> then<00:03:55.140> vice

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
to walk it down to 120 and then vice

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.619 
to walk it down to 120 and then vice
versa<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.980> we're<00:03:56.099> going<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.250> do<00:03:56.459> that<00:03:56.700> for<00:03:57.239> 20

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629
