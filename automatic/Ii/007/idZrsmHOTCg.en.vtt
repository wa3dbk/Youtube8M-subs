this<00:00:01.589> is<00:00:01.740> Dabu<00:00:02.159> 7<00:00:02.580> an<00:00:03.080> update<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.830> massive

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
this is Dabu 7 an update to the massive

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.600 
this is Dabu 7 an update to the massive
explosions<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.270> have<00:00:06.450> rocked<00:00:06.750> China<00:00:07.610> now

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
explosions that have rocked China now

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.799 
explosions that have rocked China now
initially<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.570> put<00:00:10.110> out<00:00:10.260> footage<00:00:10.740> showing<00:00:11.809> this

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
initially I put out footage showing this

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.939 
initially I put out footage showing this
explosion<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.620> took<00:00:13.799> place<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.849> area

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
explosion that took place in this area

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.279 
explosion that took place in this area
but<00:00:16.949> there's<00:00:17.190> been<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.670> lot<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.420> explosions

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
but there's been a lot of explosions

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.890 
but there's been a lot of explosions
afterward<00:00:20.100> nothing<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> scale<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.630> what

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
afterward nothing on the scale of what

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.650 
afterward nothing on the scale of what
we've<00:00:22.109> seen<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.830> very<00:00:23.070> first<00:00:23.340> time<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
we've seen the very first time but the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.439 
we've seen the very first time but the
very<00:00:24.900> first<00:00:25.230> explosion<00:00:25.920> was<00:00:26.400> different<00:00:26.910> from

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
very first explosion was different from

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.209 
very first explosion was different from
all<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.900> rest<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.580> magnitude<00:00:29.580> power

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
all the rest in magnitude power

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.049 
all the rest in magnitude power
everything<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:34.590> question<00:00:35.190> right<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:35.550> is

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
everything the question right now is

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.060 
everything the question right now is
what<00:00:36.600> caused<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.100> first<00:00:38.780> explosion<00:00:40.070> because

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
what caused the first explosion because

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.900 
what caused the first explosion because
obviously<00:00:41.520> if<00:00:42.559> there's<00:00:43.559> an<00:00:43.710> explosion<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
obviously if there's an explosion in a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.810 
obviously if there's an explosion in a
chemical<00:00:45.329> plant<00:00:45.450> other<00:00:46.039> things<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.370> blow<00:00:47.610> up

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
chemical plant other things can blow up

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.910 
chemical plant other things can blow up
and<00:00:48.030> we've<00:00:48.149> seen<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> past<00:00:49.410> 24

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
and we've seen that here in the past 24

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.299 
and we've seen that here in the past 24
hours

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
hours

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.950 
hours
they're<00:00:50.910> saying<00:00:51.210> there's<00:00:51.329> been<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.510> total<00:00:51.899> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
they're saying there's been a total of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.139 
they're saying there's been a total of
at<00:00:52.649> least<00:00:52.920> seven<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.520> eight<00:00:53.670> different

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
at least seven to eight different

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.569 
at least seven to eight different
explosions<00:00:54.750> as<00:00:54.930> many<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> hundred<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
explosions as many as a hundred and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.330 
explosions as many as a hundred and
eight<00:00:56.789> firefighters<00:00:57.199> feared<00:00:58.199> dead<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
eight firefighters feared dead and you

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.310 
eight firefighters feared dead and you
can<00:00:59.489> see<00:00:59.730> it's<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.120> been<00:01:00.300> decimated<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:01.170> mean

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
can see it's just been decimated I mean

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.609 
can see it's just been decimated I mean
look<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.120> rows<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.449> cars<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:04.019> far<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.470> your

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
look at this rows of cars as far as your

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.460 
look at this rows of cars as far as your
eye<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.769> see<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:07.860> has<00:01:08.400> some<00:01:08.729> asking<00:01:12.470> was

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
eye can see and it has some asking was

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.880 
eye can see and it has some asking was
this<00:01:13.680> some<00:01:13.950> sort<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.250> test<00:01:15.140> was<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.170> initial

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
this some sort of test was the initial

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.570 
this some sort of test was the initial
blast<00:01:18.259> something<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.799> nature<00:01:19.860> because

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
blast something of this nature because

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.780 
blast something of this nature because
if<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.360> look<00:01:21.630> at<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:22.020> was<00:01:22.170> left<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.890> I've

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
if you look at what was left and I've

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.539 
if you look at what was left and I've
seen<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> lot<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> different<00:01:25.280> chemical<00:01:26.280> plant

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
seen a lot of different chemical plant

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.840 
seen a lot of different chemical plant
explosions<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.270> tell<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:28.579> there's<00:01:29.579> been

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
explosions I tell you what there's been

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.280 
explosions I tell you what there's been
several<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> past<00:01:30.930> couple<00:01:31.140> years

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
several here in the past couple years

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.670 
several here in the past couple years
and<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.430> can't<00:01:32.759> recall<00:01:32.939> any<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:34.079> left<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.439> lake

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
and I can't recall any that left a lake

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.240 
and I can't recall any that left a lake
or<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.009> pond<00:01:35.939> behind<00:01:36.630> afterwards<00:01:37.409> but<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.070> can

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
or a pond behind afterwards but I can

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.710 
or a pond behind afterwards but I can
tell<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.759> does<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.860> that's<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.979> weapon

tell you what does and that's a weapon
and<00:01:43.399> as<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> pond

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
and as you can see here this is a pond

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.730 
and as you can see here this is a pond
from<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.470> Soviet<00:01:47.040> nuclear<00:01:47.070> test<00:01:49.100> look<00:01:50.100> similar

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
from a Soviet nuclear test look similar

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.219 
from a Soviet nuclear test look similar
looks<00:01:52.740> darn<00:01:53.100> similar<00:01:53.520> almost<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.090> exact<00:01:54.570> same

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
looks darn similar almost the exact same

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.240 
looks darn similar almost the exact same
size<00:01:58.009> what<00:01:59.009> kind<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.399> weapon<00:02:00.619> not<00:02:01.619> sure<00:02:01.920> not

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
size what kind of weapon not sure not

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.300 
size what kind of weapon not sure not
even<00:02:02.329> positive<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.380> exactly<00:02:04.860> what

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
even positive that that is exactly what

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.210 
even positive that that is exactly what
took<00:02:05.460> place<00:02:05.549> here<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:07.500> evidence<00:02:07.890> is

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
took place here but the evidence is

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.979 
took place here but the evidence is
screaming<00:02:09.440> as<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.340> see<00:02:11.520> here<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.120> most

touched

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970
