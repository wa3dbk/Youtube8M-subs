 hi all my name is Katya and just 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.779
 back from the cinema with the premiere 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.519
 film telekinesis and here it turns out that I 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.920
 missed the trailer legend who 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.080
 I went out yesterday and now I will watch it 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.670
 and I will give you some 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.580
 trailer review yes so well let's get down to 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.580
 I look so 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.120
 and 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.009
 she and almost 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.070
 when you 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.870
 really understand how 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.730
 how did they show much in this 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.650
 trailer oh god more than 2 minutes 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.440
 showed chicago up 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.970
 I wanted to see the city and it is huge 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.160
 cool that they showed what a huge 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.800
 because when you read a book in 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.090
 Basically, you know the houses are big but 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.930
 it's hard to imagine the scale 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.730
 this city and 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:36.820
 about the bush is cool trece viata inadvertently 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:40.910
 mirror i already like this movie 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.550
 more showed just all this I have to 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.470
 this is a revision of bodily ability like 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.190
 they go well, it is clear do 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.259
 special trick 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.320
 that is, it shows the test first and then 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:02:00.440
 already and the simulation is fearless very 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:02.830
 cool building renunciation shorter showed 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.640
 almost all locations are very cool 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.100
 dauntless and 4 so cool so straight 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.970
 the teacher should all dry on it 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:18.340
 the scene of throwing knives here is a pancake in the trailer 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.340
 really showed the whole scene outback nntv 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.340
 wow 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.130
 showed the train without terrible I thought 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.140
 how does it look because of the previous 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.070
 scraps it was one carriage and I was afraid 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.480
 God forbid that the way one car is they 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.670
 showed this train like they don't 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.920
 jump on the lawn roll 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.930
 and how it enjoyed shaking showed 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.390
 fearless attack on from treatment in 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.760
 late only they are not there like zombies robots 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.860
 go just by shit uv rank 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.670
 a small piece of tear trees 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.430
 Kiss at sunset jump 3 consists Ashka 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.020
 when they had fun with his jura 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.330
 and his brother and generally half 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.920
 fearless i hope it will be mine 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.970
 favorite canonization because here 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.970
 now I came with kerry telekinesis and 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.570
 the coach was more promising that is 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.370
 there inside we showed the whole movie on 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.360
 when I expected it to be there 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.990
 something more but no it didn't turn out 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.600
 brought the end here all the plot to me 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.030
 it seems so maybe there are small 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.989
 discrepancies in the same modeling on 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:34.180
 bali on renunciation radiant lekant 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:36.780
 1 cent drive food altruism on vadim 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.010
 altruists I speak unofficial 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.520
 because reading amateur is not for you 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.780
 like more or strange weapons like 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.440
 fights shaking as they pass his landscape 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.390
 March 21 was a clothing supermarket 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.580
 I thought 20 romar food would be a lot of things 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.960
 interesting about your not burning ears 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.640
 reviewing over and over again and 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.700
 Again, I already look at three iterative 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.300
 ability test i imagined these 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.670
 man-sized bowl 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.370
 they seemed so huge 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.620
 bowls that there somewhere like no blood and 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.560
 Well, in general, in my view 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.570
 it was much larger scale running 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.049
 fearless in red blouse why 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:26.280
 fearless in red blouses that do not 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.540
 there should be a book as a script from there 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.390
 nothing can be removed 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:35.340
 and they did so hopefully aida case 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:38.730
 roles it's beautiful ladies and gentlemen we 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.610
 got what you wanted kind of like 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.700
 rays film adaptation of the year will be March 21 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.830
 February will vampire academy still on 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.150
 let's see it academy know exactly what 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.180
 they had a lot there 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.320
 then the coach at once everything is clear to me 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:59.120
 like janin such a bridge 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.350
 made a mistake in the game fearless torus and 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.650
 I love torre I love torre 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.919
 she when I'm still on the ferris wheel they 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.169
 are taken semi day time that is 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:14.550
 everything is very clear there and this 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:16.770
 scrubber scene let's see 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.530

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.780
 because a lot of high-grade 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.900

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.420
 starving games in the cinema I think 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.400
 i'll dab these people because i need 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:42.070
 all books they need versions all shepherd 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.150
 to all the book although Korea did not take it 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.370
 also took no dancer yet and give 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.770
 he does n't care 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:55.390
 why are we such people are fans 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.480
 divergent and generally everything is waiting for a movie not 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:00.880

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:04.660

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:18.610

 Potter unread those who not read 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:40.060

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:42.010
 well ok maybe not yet take either 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.920
 wait for the film so as not to spoil everything 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.450
 impression is not enough but i'm sure all the same 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.300
 films 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:52.230
 today's disappointment is enough but 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:55.230
 divergent will be people he will 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.230
