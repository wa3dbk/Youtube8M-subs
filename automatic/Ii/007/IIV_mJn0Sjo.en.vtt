right<00:02:27.190> there<00:02:27.250> I<00:02:28.440> really<00:02:29.440> think<00:02:29.620> she<00:02:29.740> was

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
right there I really think she was

right there I really think she was
trying<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.400> stick<00:02:30.790> these<00:02:31.030> vaults<00:02:31.420> she's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
trying to stick these vaults she's

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.900 
trying to stick these vaults she's
usually<00:02:31.810> over<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.560> both<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:33.040> them<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.400> trying

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
usually over on both of them and trying

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.120 
usually over on both of them and trying
to<00:02:34.030> come<00:02:34.240> in<00:02:34.390> with<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> better<00:02:35.140> body<00:02:35.500> position

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
to come in with a better body position

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.520 
to come in with a better body position
and<00:02:36.370> not<00:02:36.640> take<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.209> step<00:02:37.600> that's<00:02:38.050> really<00:02:38.440> the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
and not take that step that's really the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.610 
and not take that step that's really the

only thing that Alicia needs to get a

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.280

she'll<00:02:45.010> incur<00:02:45.280> some<00:02:45.490> deductions<00:02:45.790> stepping
