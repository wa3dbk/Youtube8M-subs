00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.130
 is not rational as opposed to other animals under his control over the 

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.790
 floor that surprise because they are more experienced the course of rational dressing was 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.289
 promoted by the commission, the objective is to guide workers and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.609
 that deal with horses 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.769
 adonai for animals used in sports or day-to-day field tests. 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.669
 Instructor was Omar do Faza has an important curriculum within the sector 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.399
 he said how it is the work we have been working from biomass at the peak 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.530
 of the municipality 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.590
 ef 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.379
 this is the beginning the beginning of everything right 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.090
 in the staging of the horse cavalcanti 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.870
 has a weapon 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.069
 in vain 

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:47.350
 a good profile hand behavior 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.990
 Why does he wear the uniform shirt on this shirt from my team that gave the 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.670
 maximum of himself then 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.249
 as the main agent of the sport, we want 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:57.740
 the one that gives 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.710
 all of it the difference to great performance and expected performance 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.140
 so when you work on a traditional dune with violence you 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.550
 at the same time 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.640
 but still everything from him to you 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.940
 when you work from the sea 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.800
 rational in tomorrow's 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.200
 grandson non violence patience communication relationship 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.320
 You make the horse want to help you. 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.680
 you will have your membership in doing things as a common good 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.440
 you will exercise leadership on climbing it 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.180
 and that horse will give the most of it if it has genetic fitness 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.670
 health nutrition for this is very likely to add to the power 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.830
 he said that first of all it is necessary to create a relationship of the human being with the 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.960
 animal I always speak in costs 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.320
 Effective communication and relationship 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.640
 and I say that the default in the deep code of ethics and red region 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.760
 the nature among your herd 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.850
 How about a wall mounted on a tripod 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.329
 that confidence 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.469
 loyalty work they need to trust others to be loyal to one another and 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.760
 work in groups 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.799
 and I always talk about love, too, musicians, the fear of what we do 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.879
 people often find it strange because she and 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:14.879
 horse right 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.949
 but I can tell you love the ana is the feeling and the way you 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:19.989
 holds 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.639
 then my talk in what I like to treat the horse like would like to be treated 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.699
 Saitama the way you behave with this achievement 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.839
 that horse 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:33.529
 this is to make a set with that horse so that you are 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:34.890
 fossil partners 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.930
 I work in tripoli say he really wants to help 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.620
 so this way really 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.790
 you will get everything said to him are the chances of causing good first 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.389
 impression and this is where the man who will start working with this animal 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.669
 must have autonomy and security to achieve not that there is a second 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.309
 chance and you have a good first impression 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:01.020
 so when he first entered the choir giving name to the term 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.149
 to tame 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:06.679
 I really want him to trust me so I'll get in there 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:10.430
 working on his code of ethics, I need to communicate with him in the 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:12.689
 their language without knowing it 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.149
 to behavior but if nature and psychological 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.389
 the nightmare that who is thinking of reacting according to what is thinking 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.200
 not empirical you will not get there doing things without 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.509
 without having a reason 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.109
 so I think the main 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.060
 my goal here is to make people understand why it is 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:35.140
 things happen that many have already set up many years ago already know 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.999
 and often merge the art 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:40.240
 indignant with the traditional and sometimes even a little violence 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.819
 not because not because they are violent and that information came to them 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:45.659
 So 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.559
 know why things happen because that real horse that way 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:54.129
 explains why the school in the stretch is a pleasure not because of the pain and that he always 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.129
 will connect the defunct product preservation and protect 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.019
 so if you can show that the horse you are not a product only 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.579
 can be a friend 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.249
 he is going to call 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:05.339
 art 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.900
 your curiosity 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.609
 already knows well if he has not forgiven that they want then 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.999
 natura that he can be a companion 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:16.549
 wake up in it so if you're in there who try to hide it 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.870
 Look around you. 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.209
 we tried to see an escape route did not find 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.559
 And I realized that you're not a predator. 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:26.279
 he starts to think about it 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:28.099
 and relate to you 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.099
 so that you start to gain confidence in him 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:35.800
 if you gain blind trust and loyalty blind loyalty you go 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.879
 fix it remember 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.879
 who participated in the course had no doubt is about the use 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.009
 her balance came from saint elena in search of knowledge to deal with 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.099
 animals tel 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.059
 still there is a search 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:51.969
 diddy a very technical service 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:55.110
 as a high quality full professional provides us with 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.209
 Last year I missed the opportunity to do this course I stayed 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.300
 interested in doing 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.720
 and now presents this opportunity is that I moved the village of Cetelem in 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.599
 table 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:13.509
 this great professional and expands much in the knowledge 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.759
 because it's not very easy to enter 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.490
 I got a professional of such a high level that he was worth it 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.919
 I'm already here, cheering for the next coast on the timeline, doing it again 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.919
 What did you see that caught your attention so much? 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.460
 is the intimacy that has with the animal the fall 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.589
 The internet is only good and bad. 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:37.469
 I saw animals very crude future 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:38.849
 and here in the ranking 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.089
 and in a short time he mastered the animal entered animal animal 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.789
 For his fertile class he understood and years making his companion 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.469
 This impresses me now I do not even say that it increases the presence of the magician 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:56.620
 freedon madri cycle is still know as to the direction in the animals other courses 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:01.219
 should be programmed but depend on the availability of the instructor's agenda
