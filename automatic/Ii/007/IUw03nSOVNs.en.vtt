Hi there I got a question from Jjuggles13
on one my videos 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.920
and I thought I'd help answer the
question

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.240
with another video the question was

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.369
if my yarn runs out how do I

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.260
end it and start the same stich well

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.199
let's do this we're going to go down the
line

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.970
with the extended single crochet

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.270
and then I'm gonna show you at the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.629
end how I usually attach a new ball of
yarn

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.930
in the same color or

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.610
in a different color this can be used

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.610
either way

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.820
ok here we are at the final stitch so I'm
going to insert my

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.270
hook into the stitch and pull up a loop

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.570
so that there are 2 loops on

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.220
my hook then the yarn that I'm currently
using which is running out 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.950
I'm going to let drop I'm going to take

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.979
my new yarn in the same color or
different color

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.660
I'm using a different color here to
show contrast

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.640
I'm going to then attach that yarn

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.550
hold it as if it were the 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.100
old yarn I was using and I'm going
to use that yarn 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.100
to create my final stitch

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.270
I'm gonna do that again slowly

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.860
so that you can see so I have 2 loops here

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.860
I dropped that yarn and I take the new
yarn

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.800
take the new yarn

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.340
and use that that to complete the last stitch 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.340
on that line

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.850
chain 1 at the end then turn

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.950
and now I can continue

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.950
with my stitch

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.050
so Jjuggles13 I hope that answers your
question

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.090
of how to change your yarn when you
come to the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.650
end and continue in the same stitch
