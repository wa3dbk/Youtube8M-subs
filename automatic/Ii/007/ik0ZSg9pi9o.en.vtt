the a string the second finger and then

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.580 
the a string the second finger and then
we<00:02:43.920> go<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.250> seven<00:02:44.580> foot<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.910> g<00:02:45.060> string<00:02:45.330> and

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
we go to the seven foot the g string and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.160 
we go to the seven foot the g string and
then<00:02:46.590> fourth<00:02:47.070> fret<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.460> E<00:02:47.550> string<00:02:48.170> the

then fourth fret of the E string the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.350 
then fourth fret of the E string the
first<00:02:49.410> finger<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:50.460> easier<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.760> finger<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.270> this

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
first finger is easier to finger it this

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.900 
first finger is easier to finger it this
way

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
way

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.040 
way
you've<00:02:53.910> kind<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.150> got<00:02:54.210> one<00:02:54.540> finger<00:02:54.900> per<00:02:54.930> fret

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050
