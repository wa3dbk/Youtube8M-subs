 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.580
 new video connects tutorials 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.259
 dotcom my name is rafael tours and in 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.240
 this time we are going to bring a 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.580
 adobe tutorial as usual in the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.710
 community today we want to present you 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.570
 our new creative project a 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.250
 different proposal to learn and 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.560
 practice design through the game 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.630
 the idea under the name of four islands 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.460
 in minecraft it's mainly about 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.800
 the construction and design of a city 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.269
 completely within minecraft and in 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.840
 this video we will explain how 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.840
 you can participate 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.270
 Welcome to connect tutorials 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.300
 your official community of users to the 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.300
 time 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 the vast majority of you already know 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.460
 minecraft is currently one of the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.769
 games with greater possibilities for the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.570
 creative development so much that even 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.489
 some high schools have already 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.260
 introduced the game as a subject in 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.719
 his student agenda as who 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.360
 study mates or geography as they have 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.009
 introduced there minecraft our idea 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.470
 is that we have fun playing and 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.409
 learning design we will try that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.899
 among all we believe a macrocity that 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.319
 work and then anyone can 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.550
 download and play with your friends 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.170
 we will work in creative mode to 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.149
 make it easier and you will see that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.759
 you quickly get the hang of the game 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.740
 since it is very very simple for us 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.710
 we can fly in creative mode and 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.990
 let's see what we have if we press the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.850
 and we see different materials already 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.380
 root of these materials we can 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.020
 keep dropping on the map according to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.610
 we need to go creating 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.509
 different ways for example let's 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.509
 create a door quickly 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.509
 you 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.010
 and from there we can go 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.570
 doing all kinds of constructions if 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.550
 we put a little mischief you will see 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.820
 that can be achieved almost almost any 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.610
 kind of form I downloaded from 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.100
 internet a city to be understood 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.710
 a little more or less what is our idea 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.110
 and in this way we can see everything 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.410
 what can make our 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.580
 concept our main idea is that 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.790
 each one design a building or a part 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.330
 from the city a square a bridge one 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.260
 whatever source and hence create root 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.239
 a city joining in the buildings that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.660
 we are doing each of the users 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:34.110
 for this we have created a web page 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.300
 where are we going to go publishing on one side 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.239
 the most interesting constructions that 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.239
 let's find or even the videos that we 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.500
 you send the users playing 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.570
 our map and that you have uploaded to 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.239
 youtube or we will even comment 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.310
 the odd plugin that you are going to do 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.350
 easier to make constructions 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.510
 big 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.850
 participate is really very simple 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.940
 you just have to download the map from 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.640
 our web four islands point connects 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.860
 dotcom tutorials and save it in the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.950
 folder with the other items that already 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.350
 you have created inside minecraft a 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.690
 Once we have downloaded our map and 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.570
 we have decompressed it and saved it in the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.760
 corresponding folder of minecraft goes 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.340
 to appear to be able to select the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.650
 game and play you will see that we have already 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.840
 generated the terrain of the four islands 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.700
 let's start building first the 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.459
 that we have already started and then we will go 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.770
 expanding to the other islands we have 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.070
 downloaded some standard elements 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.780
 for example the plane the seaplane the 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.550
 control tower in the background there is a 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.160
 helicopter so that we already have 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.740
 small references of more or less by 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.550
 where are you going to go and a little bit that you see the 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.950
 style that we are going to use 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.290
 we have also created a small beach 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.960
 the subway station that is going to have 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.990
 four tracks three of them will communicate 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.230
 with the other islands and the fourth will be a 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.090
 circular to see the whole map 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.880
 we have also divided the streets 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.700
 major of the first island so that 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.620
 it is easier to select the plots and 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.640
 We said that participating is very simple 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.740
 just enter another one is a turn and 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.130
 you see for example a plot that you 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.470
 like to be here for example the ideal is 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.540
 that before you start to build the 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.600
 trade within the web and look at the 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.420
 section to send the map or send the 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.000
 constructions and in the comments 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.100
 we advise you before starting then 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.080
 tell us hey, I'm going to build in the 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.960
 plot that is next to the airport 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.820
 in this case in this way although the 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.330
 user behind you already know that plot 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.580
 they are already building and it is much 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.410
 more practical to look for another one and thus there is more 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.340
 possibilities for buildings to be 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.500
 chosen 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.060
 from there you make the house that 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.060
 you believe once you have it 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.889
 finished simply you save it the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.169
 go back to compress and upload it to 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.620
 any share drop bots service 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.720
 drive or even creative cloud remember 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.020
 that the free version gives us 2 gb of 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.910
 free storage and leave us at 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.090
 the comment when you have the house to 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.620
 the construction what has been finished 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.960
 you enter the web in the section of 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.810
 Send your construction and leave us there 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.820
 in the comments the link so that 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.740
 we can download if we really 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.590
 It seems interesting, creative and original 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.050
 we will select every so often 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.500
 and we are updating the map and we will go 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.690
 indicating what by numbering in 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.520
 every update so that it is very 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.160
 easy to know that you are working 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.710
 really with the map version more 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.340
 current and with the latest creations already 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.620
 included 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.720
 before starting to build you 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.180
 We recommend that you go through the website of 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.270
 that assurance that you are fulfilling 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.040
 The requirements that we have specified 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.770
 think that the project is still in 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.990
 beta phase we want to try and see a little 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.240
 what do you think about the idea of ​​knowing more or less 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.430
 how many are you going to participate and that you give us 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.770
 ideas and suggestions to improve four 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.900
 islands in minecraft we are not 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.330
 used to doing this so 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.850
 we know that you know minecraft 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.590
 much better than us and we want 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.500
 listen to us give us ideas and 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.210
 suggestions based on the number of 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.950
 users that we participate we are going to 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.020
 move forward more or less quickly we will go 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.639
 including the new content even in 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.900
 a future who knows if we do 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:32.210
 selection of tutorials for minecraft 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.460
 we also tell you that we are 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.199
 negotiating some contests with 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.110
 our sponsors the gentlemen 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:41.150
 given in this case of Spain be you to 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.639
 brain that always supports us that is going to 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.280
 give a little bit of training to think that 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.680
 they have training on creation of 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.139
 videogames have creation of 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.320
 animation characters so what 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:56.090
 we have seen very interesting and then in 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.100
 function to the number of users that 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.770
 participate during this phase of 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:03.910
 beta imagine we're going to get more or 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:06.860
 fewer awards so up to here our 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:10.100
 first presentation of the idea in phase 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:12.350
 beta if you like to give us like the video 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.510
 I would love to hear your opinions and 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.220
 suggestions from the comments and 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.990
 will remember that the more 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.910
 let's be faster we can go 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.039
 updating and more benefit are going to us 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.229
 offer the sponsors so if 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.240
 you have friends or acquaintances who play 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:27.199
 minecraft do not hesitate to share this 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.240

 if you have a channel on YouTube and you gra 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.150
 you are playing the map or building

 anything 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.780

 We hope you like the idea of 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.250
 project that is seem fun and
