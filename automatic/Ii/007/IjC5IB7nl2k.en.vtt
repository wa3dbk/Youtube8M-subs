 wrong pick 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.660

 in a recession 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:22.779
 the moment when the market is divided 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.089

 enter it yourself so you do you 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.750
 found the money you spend the money do you believe 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.260
 what's the project 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.590
 don't you understand that when its

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.629
 the biggest risk

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.710
 another risk is desire 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.230
 make everything innovative 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.410
 every person playing the game 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.469

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.790
 that's great that's right that's great

 but on the other hand 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.850
 I venture it is noted that he m 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.890
 you can start reinventing the wheel 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.430
 and give it a lot of time 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.300
 although if you analyze 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.229
 products in that direction 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.930

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.450

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.190
 they are in inventing innovation

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.650

 audience 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.619
 many years ago when I started not 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:13.329
 stop at companies 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.900

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.399
 by opinion 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.149
 my question is why niaara will be his 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.839
 Betori extremists on games that are 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.139
 Kurmanov brings money 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.609
 it has become new for more than 10 15 20 projects 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.899
 you got me this moment with steel 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:37.189
 brought the form communicated with the players 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.659
 I'll remind you what we are doing and gaming 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.499
 entertainment apps 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:42.519

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.459
 project of the Russian Internet and 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.699
 world internet users 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:51.019
 it became that any 10 12 15 applications and you are not 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.050
 can do 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.310
 he was at the moment caught by sales figures 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.340

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.349
 very important things in his opinion 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.430
 it's time he achieved everything I think 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.809
 what will happen next 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.919
 and one 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.539
 I have a lot of projects 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:09.299
 and still moderate forms 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.249
 communicate with use 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:12.659
 actually real is a question more to you 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.129
 my loved ones are respected but the players 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.059
 Is it so 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.829
 It seems to me that this is how we spend more 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.559
 a lot of money at events which 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:22.459
 naturally did not earn anything for that 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.499
 to our audience balan 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.489
 as pretty as possible 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.200
 we provide entertainment 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.200
 appointments must entertain 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.889
 respect your audience she will 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.959
 respect 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.699
 no get sick of star fever 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.769
 or risk glad to lose touch with people 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:45.939
 of course great 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.430
 you formed a team agreed with 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.049
 partner word product 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.930
 he is already popular he has an audience 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.439
 dead end once you do not work 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.499
 everything is great where money appears 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:01.949
 after cars the first apartment in Moscow and in 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:03.869
 St. Petersburg can be in Ryazan 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:05.159
 never mind 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.569
 percent 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.589
 then the team made thirst fine 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:09.609
 are working 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.609
 and more often it appears in the office 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.939
 leafing to work 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.989
 get sick of star fever then talk 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.549
 with all you think arrogantly 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.129
 has reached 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:23.629
 it's difficult to repeat success 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:24.959
 the first successful product is 

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:27.229
 randomness with all these factors that 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.869
 we just discussed it 

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:31.930
 randomness m very lucky 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.430
 and repeat it will not work 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.280
 or not very soon 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.270
 it will be very difficult to repeat 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.210
 if im 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.780
 the most serious disease 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.880
 after the first hastily products the second is 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.020
 most likely you will not create 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.340
 team loss risk 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.270
 but all the disks that I 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.419
 to the story before this mania 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:54.729
 came a significant 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.309
 compared to this 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.279
 what the prize dome team would like 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:59.439
 to pay 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.809
 special attention 

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:04.659
 the fact is that only in the place you can 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.060
 do something good 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.789
 and cool when you think that 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.129
 here is the carefree of this and this man 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.589
 could go further that Tanya 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:13.599
 relaxed 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.459
 or stopped working so well 

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:17.120
 how to 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.340
 it means you stopped understanding them 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.009
 the flood 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.349
 possible enough money maybe still 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.419
 something but the team is the most valuable thing you have 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.050
 there is 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.310
 and at the time of creating a successful business 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.300
 you need to save this command 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.550
 reach only single 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.909
 in a way that you could at any moment 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.389
 come for advice for help they were given out 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:38.370
 professional 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.729
 fall district council 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.020
 they see you kickback saw you 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.800
 worked together with him 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.610
 oh in this case im the risk of losing the team 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.439
 seriously reduced 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:52.199
 their for me tons of business which is 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.649
 Gaspromviet company with the current 3 5 

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:57.189
 million dollars 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:58.439
 oao 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.840
 the most valuable the most important is people 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.800
 and these are not empty words this is really 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.059
 the situation is the company of my team 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:08.589
 I would like to show the percentage of players 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:11.849
 just our company can watch it 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:14.340
 here are the changes 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.259
 by turns of evil 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:19.659
 few years past 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:21.919
 each room must understand this Dniester 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.559
 information we are open to future companies 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:26.689
 For example, this growth can 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.949
 approximately see what awaits 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:31.480
 startup them 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.520
 where can come if not commits 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.820
 mistakes and not inferior to those rakes about which 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.990
 I told 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.990
 besides this, I want to show you more 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.300
 which means tory today 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.690
 then play Vlad our games took the zone 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.249

 this or that topic I grow more detailed 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.330
 Unfortunately, I am limited by time 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.809
