goes

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.940 

a<00:02:47.599> little<00:02:47.959> bit<00:02:48.049> on<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.230> restart<00:02:48.769> oh<00:02:50.290> wow<00:02:51.349> now

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
a little bit on the restart oh wow now

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:01.070 
a little bit on the restart oh wow now
that

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.320 

so<00:03:02.080> there's<00:03:02.260> our<00:03:02.440> difference<00:03:03.090> pump<00:03:04.090> feel

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
so there's our difference pump feel

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.760 
so there's our difference pump feel
that's<00:03:04.630> BP<00:03:05.080> 98<00:03:05.560> versus<00:03:06.280> B<00:03:06.910> 85<00:03:07.450> as<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.470> can<00:03:08.560> see

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
that's BP 98 versus B 85 as you can see

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.560 
that's BP 98 versus B 85 as you can see
it's<00:03:09.220> made<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.550> huge<00:03:09.640> difference<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.420> we

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
it's made a huge difference and we

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:45.040 
it's made a huge difference and we
haven't<00:03:10.810> even<00:03:10.930> touched<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.380> time

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:04:33.950 

yeah<00:03:45.620> like<00:03:46.280> that

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.270 

I'm<00:04:34.960> not<00:04:35.080> 8<00:04:35.290> on<00:04:35.500> top<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:35.800> what<00:04:35.890> we<00:04:35.920> had<00:04:36.130> just

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
I'm not 8 on top of what we had just

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.790 
I'm not 8 on top of what we had just
