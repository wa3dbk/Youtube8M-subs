sharp I really noticed that the Rev
light<00:01:00.640> midsole<00:01:01.239> did<00:01:01.780> offer<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.230> little<00:01:02.500> bit

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
light midsole did offer a little bit

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.740 
light midsole did offer a little bit
more<00:01:02.829> protection<00:01:03.039> than<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:04.150> other<00:01:04.300> minimus

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
more protection than the other minimus

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.350 
more protection than the other minimus
shoes<00:01:05.019> in<00:01:05.320> this<00:01:05.500> line<00:01:05.740> but<00:01:06.610> at<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.820> same<00:01:07.030> time

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
shoes in this line but at the same time

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.920 
shoes in this line but at the same time
I<00:01:07.780> still<00:01:07.900> really<00:01:08.619> felt<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.850> ground<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.900> a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
I still really felt the ground to a

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.420 
I still really felt the ground to a
certain<00:01:11.229> extent<00:01:11.530> where<00:01:11.799> it<00:01:11.890> was<00:01:11.979> comfortable

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
certain extent where it was comfortable

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.310 
certain extent where it was comfortable
and<00:01:12.729> my<00:01:12.850> foot<00:01:13.119> was<00:01:13.240> nimble<00:01:13.659> enough<00:01:13.869> in<00:01:14.229> the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
and my foot was nimble enough in the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.520 
and my foot was nimble enough in the
shoe<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:16.330> was<00:01:16.509> a<00:01:16.540> good<00:01:16.750> shoe<00:01:16.990> I<00:01:17.020> think<00:01:17.290> it's<00:01:17.439> a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
shoe this was a good shoe I think it's a

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.319

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
running on the other minimus shoes how

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.950 
running on the other minimus shoes how
do<00:01:23.170> you<00:01:23.290> feel<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.619> 1010<00:01:24.040> fits<00:01:24.369> into<00:01:24.579> that<00:01:24.960> 1010

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
do you feel the 1010 fits into that 1010

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.050 
do you feel the 1010 fits into that 1010
is<00:01:26.140> definitely<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.650> more<00:01:26.920> protective<00:01:27.850> and

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
is definitely a more protective and

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.690 
is definitely a more protective and
