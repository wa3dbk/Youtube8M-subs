00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
sensitivity and then also changes the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.690 
sensitivity and then also changes the
color<00:01:42.200> then<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.470> got<00:01:43.649> their<00:01:43.860> logo<00:01:44.250> which<00:01:44.520> is

lit up in the back so now once it's all
turned<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.329> what<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.259> can

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
turned on what you can do is you can

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.889 
turned on what you can do is you can
flip<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> bottom<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:54.210> what<00:01:54.810> you

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
flip it to the bottom and this what you

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:55.999 
flip it to the bottom and this what you
do<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.170> there's<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.560> button<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
do is there's just this button the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.330 
do is there's just this button the
bottom<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:57.890> switches<00:01:58.890> all<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.219> colors

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
bottom and that switches all the colors

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.280 
bottom and that switches all the colors
and<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.670> also<00:02:02.790> switches<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.509> top<00:02:03.689> colors<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
and it also switches the top colors and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.219 
and it also switches the top colors and
then<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.670> sensitivity<00:02:06.240> also<00:02:06.990> just

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
then like so for sensitivity also just

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.279 
then like so for sensitivity also just
as<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.649> colors<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.789> what<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.030> does<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.539> it's

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
as the colors and what this does is it's

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.930 
as the colors and what this does is it's
kind<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.500> like<00:02:10.590> an<00:02:10.679> FPS<00:02:11.099> button<00:02:11.430> when<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.670> push

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
kind of like an FPS button when you push

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.990 
kind of like an FPS button when you push
this<00:02:12.180> down

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
this down

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.040 
this down
that<00:02:13.270> it<00:02:13.390> slows<00:02:13.630> down<00:02:13.690> your<00:02:13.870> mouse

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050
