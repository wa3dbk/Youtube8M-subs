so<00:00:00.390> today<00:00:00.630> I<00:00:00.659> have<00:00:00.870> a<00:00:00.900> very<00:00:01.170> interesting<00:00:01.500> topic

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
so today I have a very interesting topic

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.770 
so today I have a very interesting topic
and<00:00:02.190> it's<00:00:02.340> not<00:00:02.520> really<00:00:03.000> interesting<00:00:03.570> in<00:00:03.689> the

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
and it's not really interesting in the

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.329 
and it's not really interesting in the
sense<00:00:03.810> that<00:00:04.140> it's<00:00:04.380> like<00:00:04.500> wow<00:00:04.770> this<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.220> gonna

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
sense that it's like wow this is gonna

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.730 
sense that it's like wow this is gonna
blow<00:00:05.549> your<00:00:05.609> mind<00:00:05.790> but<00:00:06.629> it's<00:00:07.049> interesting<00:00:07.620> in

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
blow your mind but it's interesting in

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.620 
blow your mind but it's interesting in
the<00:00:07.859> sense<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.400> technology<00:00:09.000> behind<00:00:09.179> it

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
the sense that the technology behind it

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.620 
the sense that the technology behind it
is<00:00:10.010> so<00:00:11.010> meaningful<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.910> moving<00:00:12.210> forward<00:00:12.420> with

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
is so meaningful to moving forward with

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.379 
is so meaningful to moving forward with
storage<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:13.380> today<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.280> have<00:00:14.670> with<00:00:14.910> me<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
storage so today I have with me the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.380 
storage so today I have with me the
first<00:00:16.170> advanced<00:00:17.010> format<00:00:17.490> drive<00:00:17.760> from<00:00:18.060> Western

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
first advanced format drive from Western

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.830 
first advanced format drive from Western
Digital<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.230> WD<00:00:20.010> ears<00:00:20.730> okay<00:00:21.660> it's

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
Digital this is the WD ears okay it's

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.300 
Digital this is the WD ears okay it's
not<00:00:21.990> really<00:00:22.230> called<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.500> ears<00:00:22.769> but<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.279> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
not really called the ears but this is a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.580 
not really called the ears but this is a
one<00:00:23.580> terabyte<00:00:23.820> Green<00:00:24.359> Drive<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.350> can

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
one terabyte Green Drive and you can

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.650 
one terabyte Green Drive and you can
tell<00:00:25.859> all<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.550> advanced<00:00:27.000> format<00:00:27.359> drives

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
tell all of the advanced format drives

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.040 
tell all of the advanced format drives
by<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.289> EI<00:00:28.680> RS<00:00:29.580> or<00:00:29.880> ears<00:00:30.240> at<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.539> end<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.960> the

by the EI RS or ears at the end of the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.350 
by the EI RS or ears at the end of the
part<00:00:31.289> number<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:32.969> here<00:00:33.210> I've

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
part number so you can see here I've

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.630 
part number so you can see here I've
done<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> search<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.350> NCI<00:00:34.620> XCOM<00:00:35.219> website

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
done a search on the NCI XCOM website

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.580 
done a search on the NCI XCOM website
for<00:00:35.910> digital<00:00:36.329> ears<00:00:36.630> which<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.170> thought<00:00:37.350> was

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
for digital ears which I thought was

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.590 
for digital ears which I thought was
just<00:00:37.649> kind<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.040> funny<00:00:38.190> because<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:39.059> brings<00:00:39.300> up

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
just kind of funny because it brings up

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.209 
just kind of funny because it brings up
all<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.590> Western<00:00:40.980> Digital<00:00:41.129> caviar<00:00:42.090> green

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
all of the Western Digital caviar green

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.619 
all of the Western Digital caviar green
advanced<00:00:44.219> format<00:00:44.640> hard<00:00:44.879> drives<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.180> what

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
advanced format hard drives now what

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.319 
advanced format hard drives now what
does<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.870> vast<00:00:46.079> format<00:00:46.590> mean<00:00:46.800> basically<00:00:47.730> it's

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
does it vast format mean basically it's

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.779 
does it vast format mean basically it's
a<00:00:48.510> way<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:49.110> your<00:00:49.230> computer<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.010> eventually

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
a way for your computer to eventually

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.939 
a way for your computer to eventually
store<00:00:51.210> far<00:00:51.719> more<00:00:51.960> data<00:00:52.199> than<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.739> capable

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
store far more data than it is capable

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.410 
store far more data than it is capable
of<00:00:53.219> today<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.579> there's<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.149> bit<00:00:54.270> more

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
of today but there's a little bit more

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.299 
of today but there's a little bit more
to<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> than<00:00:54.780> that<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.260> now<00:01:01.680> let's<00:01:01.890> get<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
to it than that so now let's get into a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.860 
to it than that so now let's get into a
little<00:01:02.550> bit<00:01:02.699> more<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> technical<00:01:03.480> aspects

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
little bit more of the technical aspects

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.570 
little bit more of the technical aspects
of<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.140> first<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:04.890> let<00:01:05.100> me<00:01:05.129> start<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.519> by

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
of this first of all let me start out by

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.240 
of this first of all let me start out by
saying<00:01:05.729> hard<00:01:06.540> drives<00:01:06.780> make<00:01:07.049> errors<00:01:07.530> all<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
saying hard drives make errors all the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.030 
saying hard drives make errors all the
time<00:01:08.490> all<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.270> time<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.619> hard<00:01:10.830> drive

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
time all the time but the hard drive

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.830 
time all the time but the hard drive
manufacturers<00:01:11.580> protect<00:01:12.330> us<00:01:12.479> from<00:01:12.630> these

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
manufacturers protect us from these

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.539 
manufacturers protect us from these
errors<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.409> occur<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:14.100> micro<00:01:14.520> level

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
errors that occur on a very micro level

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.359 
errors that occur on a very micro level
by<00:01:15.330> putting<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.750> what's<00:01:15.930> called<00:01:16.080> ECC<00:01:16.890> so

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
by putting in what's called ECC so

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.039 
by putting in what's called ECC so
basically<00:01:17.880> what<00:01:18.240> they're<00:01:18.420> doing<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.900> they're

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
basically what they're doing is they're

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.260 
basically what they're doing is they're
taking<00:01:19.400> every<00:01:20.400> portion<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> drive<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
taking every portion of the drive that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.140 
taking every portion of the drive that
you<00:01:21.570> write<00:01:21.950> some<00:01:22.950> data<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.700> they're

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you write some data to and they're

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.789 
you write some data to and they're
packing<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> little<00:01:25.080> bit<00:01:25.259> extra<00:01:25.500> that

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
packing on a little bit extra that

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.200 
packing on a little bit extra that
includes<00:01:26.130> information<00:01:26.310> about<00:01:26.790> what's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
includes information about what's

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.480 
includes information about what's
supposed<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:28.020> there<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.439> prevents<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
supposed to be there that prevents the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.310 
supposed to be there that prevents the
drive<00:01:29.700> from<00:01:30.030> making<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.420> mistake<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
drive from making a mistake that it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.740 
drive from making a mistake that it
can't<00:01:31.560> recover<00:01:31.890> from<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.820> advanced<00:01:33.270> format

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
can't recover from what advanced format

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.020 
can't recover from what advanced format
does<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.500> increases<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.400> smallest

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
does is it increases that smallest

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.870 
does is it increases that smallest
addressable<00:01:36.420> space<00:01:37.049> called<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.860> sector<00:01:38.340> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
addressable space called a sector to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.600 
addressable space called a sector to
eight<00:01:39.360> times<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.170> traditional<00:01:40.650> size<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.460> we

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
eight times the traditional size so we

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.270 
eight times the traditional size so we
used<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.909> use<00:01:42.090> 512<00:01:42.990> byte<00:01:43.229> sectors<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.860> now

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
used to use 512 byte sectors and now

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060 
used to use 512 byte sectors and now
we're<00:01:44.490> using<00:01:44.729> four<00:01:45.240> kilobyte<00:01:45.600> sectors<00:01:46.170> what

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
we're using four kilobyte sectors what

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.100 
we're using four kilobyte sectors what
does<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.490> mean<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.210> means<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.540> instead<00:01:49.049> of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
does this mean it means that instead of

eight times more data that means that

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.310 
eight times more data that means that

for<00:02:11.129> you

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
for you

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.140 
for you
we<00:02:12.290> can<00:02:12.470> use<00:02:12.709> more<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.400> that<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.970> actually

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
we can use more of that to actually

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.930 
we can use more of that to actually
store<00:02:14.870> our<00:02:15.110> data<00:02:15.349> so<00:02:15.860> why<00:02:16.400> do<00:02:16.459> you<00:02:16.670> care<00:02:16.910> about

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
store our data so why do you care about

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.479 
store our data so why do you care about
this<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:18.019> answer<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.620> because<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.340> can

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
this the answer is because it can

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.190 
this the answer is because it can
dramatically<00:02:20.120> affect<00:02:20.300> performance<00:02:20.690> on

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200

an advanced format drive before using it

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.920 
an advanced format drive before using it
now<00:02:26.629> you<00:02:27.560> can<00:02:27.800> take<00:02:28.040> your<00:02:28.670> 4<00:02:29.090> kilobyte<00:02:29.300> sector

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
now you can take your 4 kilobyte sector
