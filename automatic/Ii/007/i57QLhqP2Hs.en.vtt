00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.080
 change one of the brake hose good morning 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.940
 welcome to marco tv today i want 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.130
 show you how to change the pipe of the 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.830
 brake and how to pump the brake system 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.349
 on our passat in brake tubes 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.879
 they are porous holders must be 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.559
 urgently changed the car is on 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.660
 lifting platform equipped with 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.800
 protections that prevent movement 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.390
 accidental 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.980
 I prepared a carton for 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.620
 protect the work surface 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.870
 I also put a container for the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.579
 loss of brake fluid a key 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.120
 English adapted to slow the boom 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.840
 brake is a strange one before starting 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.550
 work 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.890
 be careful when using the liquid 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.110
 of the brakes and toxic and corrosive 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.540
 in any case it is necessary to avoid his 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.460
 contact with skin and eyes never 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:09.220
 pour it into a suitable container for 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:11.289
 friends drinking water make sure that 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.990
 the train hose was 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:16.180
 installed in the correct position in 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.550
 this will help us the washers of 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:27.160
 safety and brake hose line 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:29.140
 which shows us that we start this a 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.149
 remove the pipe of the phenomenon i 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.050
 Hose connections are 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.599
 been cleaned and I can remove it after that 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.800
 he took down the old kimbo 

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:41.619
 I immediately take the new and the 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.259
 I connect in the same points inhabiting it 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.990
 in the correct position with this 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.700
 quick action we prevent loss 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.450
 of a high quantity of liquid 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.450
 brakes from the system 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.000
 auto technician to a wide range of parts 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.670
 replacement of braking systems for 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.819
 all kinds of cars pieces of 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.330
 spare the cylinder pincers as and meals 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.330
 brake hoses 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.920
 all these elements can be found 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.670
 on the website www.my contract out hotel.de 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.519
 in our case 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.720
 we fix the brake hose with a force 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.880
 of 100 nanometers 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.890
 if the brake hose is screwed 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.140
 directly in the brake calipers e 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.140
 required a force of 35 nanometers 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.290
 after installing the hose 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.780
 of the brake 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.970
 we turn the steering column to the right 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.769
 and left to make sure the hose 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.930
 brake hose follows the movement 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.930
 of the wheel and do not rub 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.730
 after installation or clean all 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.250
 details on which the liquid has fallen 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.810
 brakes with a special substance and lo 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.360
 excerpt 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.730
 pay attention that on the disk of 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.450
 there is no grease or brake oil 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.450
 fuel 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.060
 the brake fluid and the hygroscopic 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.700
 which means that it can absorb 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.620
 humidity from the area for which it loses its 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.330
 heat resistance and consequently 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.480
 its temperature decreases by 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.210
 always use only boiling liquid 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.190
 brakes not aged and never that 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.810
 already used 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.350
 now let's move on to pumping the system 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.510
 braking 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.250
 if you want to purge completely 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.150
 the brake system to change fluid 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.010
 of the brakes 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.110
 be careful where the cylinder is 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.450
 master with the expansion tank 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.770
 in our case this is found of 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.770
 in front of the left side 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.780
 first of all you must always pump the 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.510
 point furthest from the pump in the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.940
 our case is the right rear wheel 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.990
 then the left rear wheel in the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.090
 rear wheels 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.470
 I have already entered the brake fluid 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.550
 on the example of the front wheel 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.650
 right 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.989
 I want to show you the whole process of 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.610
 operation or unscrew the connector 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:11.700
 of the area I put on this a tube of 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.700
 aspiration 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.060
 after which I have the fitting and mine 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.340
 colleague in the car pushes on the pedal 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.900
 to let the brake fluid out e 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.900
 the air from the non-profit system 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.419
 once the system is released from the system 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.099
 brake fluid and no more air than that 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.439
 my colleague holds the brake pedal 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:42.419
 pressed so that the system does not enter 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:42.419
 again the air and I turn around 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.580
 when you pump all the wheels 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.110
 pay attention and make sure that 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.539
 the level of brake fluid in the 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.729
 tank does not fall below the minimum 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.919
 after pumping the whole system is 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.550
 necessary to recharge the liquid a 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.550
 maximum level 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.930
 then you saw that the replacement 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:08.830
 of the brake hoses and the bleeding of the 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.560
 braking system 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.900
 it is not such a difficult task however 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.599
 when you change it, it's better than if 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.610
 next to you an expert this small 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.409
 brake hose is one of the most components 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.360
 important driving safety 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.360
 so do n't underestimate it
