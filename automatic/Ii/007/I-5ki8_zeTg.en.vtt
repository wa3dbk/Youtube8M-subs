00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
generator first off I'm going to start

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.980 
generator first off I'm going to start
off<00:00:08.220> by<00:00:08.250> saying<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.849> take<00:00:09.150> no<00:00:09.330> credit<00:00:09.360> for<00:00:09.750> this

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
off by saying I take no credit for this

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.970 
off by saying I take no credit for this
at<00:00:10.260> all<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.740> just<00:00:11.370> spin<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:12.170> spent<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.440> three

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
at all I just spin I spent about three

at all I just spin I spent about three
hours<00:00:14.160> looking<00:00:14.610> for<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:15.299> sign<00:00:15.540> generator

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
hours looking for a sign generator

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.000 
hours looking for a sign generator
because<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.820> last<00:00:18.150> Sun<00:00:18.630> generator<00:00:19.170> which

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
because of the last Sun generator which

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.840 
because of the last Sun generator which
over<00:00:20.340> there<00:00:21.140> when<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.170> got<00:00:23.100> patched<00:00:23.430> so

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
over there when that got patched so

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.870 
over there when that got patched so
today<00:00:24.660> I'm<00:00:24.840> showing<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.320> new<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.340> I

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
today I'm showing you a new one the I

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.330 
today I'm showing you a new one the I

found it on exuma voice channel the link

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.550 
found it on exuma voice channel the link
will<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.609> description<00:00:30.109> but<00:00:31.109> yeah<00:00:31.260> again<00:00:31.529> I

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
will be in description but yeah again I

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.900 
will be in description but yeah again I
take<00:00:31.830> notes<00:00:32.070> group<00:00:32.430> no<00:00:33.079> thingy<00:00:34.079> no<00:00:34.649> no<00:00:35.579> credit

take notes group no thingy no no credit
first<00:00:36.440> for<00:00:37.440> those<00:00:37.559> who<00:00:37.800> built<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.309> road

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
first for those who built this road

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.040 
first for those who built this road
ain't<00:00:38.930> without<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> tutorial<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.550> need<00:00:41.790> to

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
ain't without the tutorial you need to

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.830 
ain't without the tutorial you need to
put<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> sound<00:00:43.410> up<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.730> its<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.390> line<00:00:45.690> with

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
put the sound up so its up in line with

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.450 
put the sound up so its up in line with
the<00:00:45.899> piston<00:00:46.320> then<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.950> need<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.219> plant

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
the piston then you need to plant

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.869 
the piston then you need to plant
redstone<00:00:48.090> dust<00:00:48.300> or<00:00:48.890> some<00:00:49.890> sand<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.579> as<00:00:50.730> you

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
redstone dust or some sand and as you

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.790 
redstone dust or some sand and as you
can<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.780> generating<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.559> sound

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
can see here it's generating the sound

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.889 
can see here it's generating the sound
so<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.550> does<00:00:53.730> work<00:00:59.180> only<00:01:00.180> thing<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.840> is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
so it does work only thing that this is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.630 
so it does work only thing that this is
that<00:01:01.079> efficient<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.100> think<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.550> go

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
that efficient that I think you can go

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.500 
that efficient that I think you can go
up<00:01:02.789> more<00:01:02.969> anyway<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:04.790> only<00:01:05.790> generates<00:01:06.299> two

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
up more anyway so I only generates two

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.070 
up more anyway so I only generates two
okay<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.080> now<00:01:07.950> we're<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.250> start<00:01:08.900> get<00:01:09.900> to

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
okay so now we're going to start get to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.109 
okay so now we're going to start get to
the<00:01:10.170> actual<00:01:10.290> machine<00:01:10.740> first<00:01:11.580> off<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.030> get

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the actual machine first off you get

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.140 
the actual machine first off you get
them<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> place<00:01:12.659> free<00:01:13.080> blocks<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> floor

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.310 

any<00:01:18.150> these<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.720> any<00:01:18.840> building<00:01:19.140> blocks

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
any these can be any building blocks

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.700 
any these can be any building blocks
then<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:20.130> beyond<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.560> go

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
then to beyond that then you want to go

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.170 
then to beyond that then you want to go
diagonal<00:01:23.400> from<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.729> back<00:01:25.490> then<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.700> an<00:01:26.909> extra

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
diagonal from the back then go an extra

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.990 
diagonal from the back then go an extra
two<00:01:28.310> then<00:01:29.310> you're<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
two then you're going to want to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.649 
two then you're going to want to
basically<00:01:30.210> new<00:01:30.720> pit<00:01:30.960> round<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.360> like<00:01:33.360> one

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
basically new pit round so it's like one

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.590 
basically new pit round so it's like one
in<00:01:33.869> front<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> repair<00:01:35.360> then<00:01:36.360> you're<00:01:36.509> going

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
in front of the repair then you're going

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.200 
in front of the repair then you're going
to<00:01:36.659> want<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> place<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> lever<00:01:38.009> then<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.759> redstone

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
to want to place a lever then a redstone

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.420 
to want to place a lever then a redstone
repair<00:01:39.689> facing<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.710> way<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.100> now<00:01:43.430> so

facing that way then you're going to
want<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> place<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> piston<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.130> normal<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.640> this

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
want to place a piston a normal one this

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.700 
want to place a piston a normal one this
isn't<00:01:48.119> sticky<00:01:48.600> piston<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.439> you're<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.649> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
isn't sticky piston then you're going to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.319 
isn't sticky piston then you're going to
want<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> place<00:01:50.130> redstone<00:01:50.399> dust<00:01:50.820> all<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> way

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
want to place redstone dust all the way

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.050 
want to place redstone dust all the way
round<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.490> don't<00:01:53.610> want<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> place

blocks so from from the weather the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.059 
blocks so from from the weather the
redstone<00:02:12.630> dust<00:02:12.840> end<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.380> want<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.620> build<00:02:13.739> one

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
redstone dust end you want to build one

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.830 
redstone dust end you want to build one
block<00:02:14.310> up<00:02:14.489> then<00:02:15.300> you're<00:02:15.450> going<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.600> want<00:02:15.780> to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
block up then you're going to want to

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.170 
block up then you're going to want to
place<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.080> sticky<00:02:16.560> piston<00:02:16.890> next<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.640> so

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
place a sticky piston next to that so

the<00:03:01.350> middle<00:03:01.620> redstone<00:03:02.250> dust<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.760> left<00:03:02.970> I'm

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
the middle redstone dust on the left I'm

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.479 
the middle redstone dust on the left I'm
resting<00:03:03.600> dust<00:03:03.810> on<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.049> right<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.739> repair<00:03:05.100> you

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
resting dust on the right the repair you

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.690 
resting dust on the right the repair you
want<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.570> it's<00:03:07.079> that<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:08.160> far

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
want to have it so it's that that far

want to have it so it's that that far
away<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:09.150> think<00:03:09.989> it's<00:03:10.170> like<00:03:10.350> free<00:03:10.650> tic<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.700> so

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
away I think it's like free tic it so

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.880 
away I think it's like free tic it so
it's<00:03:12.030> about<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.420> same<00:03:12.570> size<00:03:12.630> as<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.590> little

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
it's about the same size as the little

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.220 
it's about the same size as the little
torch<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.940> then<00:03:15.690> you're<00:03:15.810> going<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.959> want<00:03:16.140> to
