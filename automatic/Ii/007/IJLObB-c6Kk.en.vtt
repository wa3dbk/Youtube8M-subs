sound<00:01:10.240> makes<00:01:11.140> us<00:01:11.290> sound<00:01:11.470> more<00:01:11.770> like<00:01:11.800> a

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
sound makes us sound more like a

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.940

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
we're in the key of E major the chords

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.120 
we're in the key of E major the chords

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
that are built from the key of E are

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.260 
that are built from the key of E are

major F sharp minor G sharp minor a B C
sharp<00:02:26.300> minor<00:02:26.660> then<00:02:26.840> we<00:02:26.900> have<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.050> dich<00:02:27.320> our

that<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.600> in<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.900> key<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.230> E<00:02:30.500> is<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:31.100> one<00:02:31.310> chord

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
that so in the key of E is the one chord

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.780 
that so in the key of E is the one chord
so<00:02:32.360> if<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.510> just<00:02:32.690> play<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.870> chord<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:34.130> doesn't<00:02:34.520> fit

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
so if I just play a chord it doesn't fit

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.880 
so if I just play a chord it doesn't fit
because<00:02:35.000> we<00:02:35.240> have<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:35.570> suite<00:02:35.990> major<00:02:36.380> seven

doesn't bring out the seventh so I'm
just<00:04:17.500> going<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:17.739> demonstrate<00:04:17.979> a<00:04:18.370> bunch<00:04:18.639> of

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
just going to demonstrate a bunch of

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.719 
just going to demonstrate a bunch of
little<00:04:18.880> fills<00:04:19.859> double<00:04:20.859> stops<00:04:21.160> and<00:04:21.459> the

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
hendrix sound is accomplished by doing a

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.140 
hendrix sound is accomplished by doing a
little<00:04:23.889> bar<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.400> then<00:04:26.850> hammering<00:04:27.850> with<00:04:28.030> your

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
little bar and then hammering with your

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.270 
little bar and then hammering with your
third<00:04:28.330> finger<00:04:28.360> up<00:04:28.780> right<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.919> you<00:04:30.039> end<00:04:30.160> up<00:04:30.220> with

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
third finger up right so you end up with

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.040 
third finger up right so you end up with
two<00:04:30.580> voices<00:04:30.789> still<00:04:31.300> ringing<00:04:33.870> anywhere<00:04:34.870> in<00:04:34.960> the

two voices still ringing anywhere in the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.270 
two voices still ringing anywhere in the
pentatonix<00:04:35.650> where<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.889> see<00:04:36.130> this

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
pentatonix where you see this

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.880
