 welcome to with ay 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.350
 here I bring you another video guys and this 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.120
 once I bring you a pretty tutorial 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.280
 interesting about how to make a system 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.619
 Look detector this means 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.690
 for those who are wondering a 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.670
 red stone ton network system that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.990
 let us look at a certain block and that 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.550
 for example a door opens or 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.230
 any other type of mechanism is worth 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.580
 We have already made a system 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.920
 quite similar but this is another 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.230
 method that I think is more effective 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.550
 it even calls more attention besides it 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.469
 can activate in two ways that now 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.789
 let's see the same I'll leave the tutorial 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.199
 old that we already had in the 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.030
 description in case there is someone curious 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.340
 I want to see it good as always 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.900
 guys let's choose the area where 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.489
 let's start with the tutorial for 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.800
 start with the tutorial what are we going to 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.570
 to do is to make a kind of structure 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.239
 of the blocks that we want in the form of 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.640
 t is to say as you are seeing now 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.320
 in that same structure we are going to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.239
 remove that block and let's put a 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.030
 repeater looking to the right with two 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.739
 separation tick under the block that 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.989
 we are seeing here on the right we are going to 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.369
 put red stone and under the block 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.960
 which is on the left we are going to put 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.390
 a torch on the wall of the block 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.950
 central is to say there to finish this 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.509
 small circuit in which we have 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.560
 started what we are going to put is a 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.909
 red stone torch 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.770
 in the block that was on the left 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.600
 from the top left of the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.369
 circuit we are going to put one of stone 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.320
 red and to the left of that red stone 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.570
 let's put a sticky piston looking 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.610
 upwards as you can see the piston 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.079
 adhesive is already activated at the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.179
 left of the adhesive piston we are going to 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.310
 put a surface of three blocks of 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.899
 long to two high and at the end of the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.789
 surface let's put one more block 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.039
 to lower what would be the red stone 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.479
 end to the ground in that first block no 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.460
 you have to put anything in the second let's 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.259
 put a wooden pressure plate and 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.090
 this area that remains here as it 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.770
 was commenting is going to serve us for 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.509
 lower the red stone to the mechanism 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.740
 that we want to activate myself for this 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.000
 tutorial I'm going to put a door 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.390
 just so you can see how 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.770
 it would work and what is the circuit 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.229
 let's say red stone that works 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.819
 automatically this is the only thing that 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.490
 would miss is to put a glass panel 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.319
 above the adhesive piston and in the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.899
 first block of surface three 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.160
 long let's put a little boat like 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.170
 You see the little boat stays 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.330
 let's say flying there in a very 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.560
 strange with the glass panel and what 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.630
 it's that circuit and you do not have to touch 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.940
 absolutely nothing else or connect anything 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.709
 to him now how are we going to activate this 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.460
 circuit how are we going to activate that door 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.830
 Because with 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.420
 detector system looks like we do 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.280
 the trigger of looks simply because 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.890
 let's put a block and in front of that 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.200
 block a glass panel whenever 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.330
 let's look at the glass panel the door 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.300
 As you can see, it will open if we stop looking 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.730
 because it simply closes this is all 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.080
 the system the truth that is very simple 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.570
 you just have to make that circuit 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.130
 follow those steps and as I tell you with that 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.290
 Crystal panel we have here 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.360
 in front the door is activated where 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.740
 we can place the activator well where 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.440
 we want that but at a great distance 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.700
 because if it does not work and it does not matter 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.650
 is not connected to what is the 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.930
 circuit because as you can see it is 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.700
 wireless is wireless wifi like 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.770
 we want to call it and it would work 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.240
 same way now I'm going to show you another 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.980
 way to activate this circuit because 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.900
 could we use to activate any 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.910
 type of circuit but instead of with 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.980
 looks for example with buttons 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.680
 how are we going to do it with buttons 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.240
 we're going to put three blocks around here to 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.010
 that you see, we are going to put a button to the 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.390
 left and one to the right and these 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.740
 are the buttons that will serve us 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.050
 example of the left to open and the 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.340
 from the right to close behind those 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.110
 blocks that we have put we are going to put 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.060
 two dispensers one on the left and 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.600
 another one on the right and in front of those 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.610
 dispenser 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.250
 let's put glass panels like 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.180
 you see here now the idea is the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.640
 following 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.180
 we take and fill those dispensers 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.100
 with arrows I'm going to put 32 here and 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.350
 another 32 on this side 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.210
 and it would be finished what we can 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.320
 do for example is to cover this area of 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.420
 here so that nothing of the 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.550
 circuit but let's go that's the subject of 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.380
 decoration when we press the button 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.130
 the left the door will open as 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.050
 you see and the one on the right will close this 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.000
 as I say you are not connected to any 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.890
 of the circuit areas so we 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.450
 it can serve as a wireless activator 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.940
 or something like that for example if 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.650
 we have water in the middle and we want to make 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.390
 a remote activator or something by the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.280
 style so you can see that it is indifferent 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.830
 where do we put it, what am I going to do 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.270
 further so you can see it but let's go 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.760
 do not touch anything else that circuit 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.620
 it's done once and it's done and now for 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.360
 that you see it as I tell you then we are going to 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.250
 do it somewhere else for example a 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.310
 little more back with the two versions 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.050
 It is worth looking at what this would be like 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.690
 You see when I look at the panel the door 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.090
 open and when I do not look at the door it 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.670
 close and I also take the opportunity to comment 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.400
 the theme of the door is an example can 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.990
 serve for any type of mechanism 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.000
 of red stone that we want to activate and 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.710
 it can be a trap or whatever we want and 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.140
 as you see now I am also testing 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.849
 the activator with buttons and dispensers 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.039
 we are going to fill the dispensers 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.449
 we have done it before and it will work 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.889
 regardless of where we place it 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.080
 more or less at a distance a little 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:59.379
 mean as you see the button on the left 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.389
 opens and the one on the right will close works 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.909
 there is always no problem 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.379
 it does not matter where we place it if not 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.909
 we are too far away and we are going to 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:08.830
 another tip of the map because of the subject of 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.169
 the door is not going to work and around here 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.449
 down there is no cheating this is not a trolley 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.069
 or anything like that there is no stone 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.719
 red or anything connected to the door that 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.459
 it can be opened is that this works 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:20.439
 I really hope you try it guys 

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:21.999
 You know 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.919
 if you liked it if it surprised you 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.169
 this tutorial just leave a like 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.179
 because it helps a lot for more videos 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.979
 if you like the channel and nothing I hope that 

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:33.540
 soon we will see in new videos a 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:36.300
 I welcome you and see you later 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.720
 If you want, you can make me a great 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.720
 favor 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.840
 a like and a favorites for me is what 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.510
 best 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:53.639
 you will not regret this is your channel 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:56.669
 and this is with live and these with live 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:59.419
 the righties with live and these ganasen
