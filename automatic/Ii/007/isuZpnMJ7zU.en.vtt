 fertilizers also come these 2 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.400
 flowerpots 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.300

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.070
 from a drone 90 as you can see

 comes in a trunk cousins ​​the roots 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.600
 they are in the trunk 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.270
 and they are quite enough enough 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.240
 reeds this is a must within a 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.460
 mobile grows in the form of enough reeds 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.880
 comes a little dehydrated but it's 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.570
 normal by the process and time of 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.480
 shipping but it was there everything is perfect 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.990
 nothing else you have to hydrate you go a bit in 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.700
 water and they will grow very very soon and 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.720
 looking for there 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.760
 two 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.950
 it is not 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.030
 with ink so that nothing 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.030
 move 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.230
 paper 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.560
 those who hold place 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.290
 good 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:39.130
 there was a small problem here 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.130
 to this little 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.310
 yes 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.310
 he left the earth 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.670
 can see here we have 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.720
 Let's see 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.700
 name 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.700
 because the bulbs look good 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.080
 you go to not only the leaves you're good 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.630
 they dried up along the way 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.630
 but it will grow again 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.400
 Y 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.079
 this 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.820
 It's unique tees 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.790
 kast of you 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.840
 with his strong name 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.640
 otherwise 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.670
 is a 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.670
 with cinjun 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.090
 This is a tower oven chair 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.990
 those are the elders this is an eleven of 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.990
 a platypus 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.660
 it can be this too 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.290
 yes 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.920
 scatter a little bit but as you can 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.930
 see the sheets are very good 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.120
 with the very pretty and here it seems that 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.120
 I had blooms 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:56.750
 the pseudo bulbs so perfect are a 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:05:00.860
 little full of earth 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:06.130
 and then we will have to do a transplant to 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.130
 a more favorable medium for these planes 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.920
 like us 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.660
 bread 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.050
 the pie 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.550
 with grace 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.550
 you are a rocky embrace me 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.990
 it is also 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.270
 lovely 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.880
 the leaves come the little pseudo 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.550
 bulbs are a little 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.270
 dehydrated but 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.010
 a little water will suffice the roots 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.139
 As you can see they are a bit of saying to 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.430
 all and dry 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:13.990
 but 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.990
 a little water a solution 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.960
 It's a copy 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:35.180
 aromatic 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.180
 two pretty heavy the flowerpot 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.060
 two 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.060
 now 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:02.040
 as you can see they are very bulbs 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.960
 big does not have to leaves but these 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.500
 bulbs produced other bulbs that 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.529
 later, more roots will be produced 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.069
 little bit 

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:12.069
 dried 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:20.370
 and then we will rethink a medium 

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:23.580
 optimal than a few countries out 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:26.779
 and this is a gift orchid is a 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.779
 more ballia flower and sleeve 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:35.920
 look how nice 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:40.670
 are the leaves on a trunk 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:43.400
 and here I bring support to hang 

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.680
 is very very beautiful we want to know in 

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.210
 where we hang it and how are they going after 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.770
 of a long trip and having been 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.620
 packaged we have to hydrate 

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.520
 our orchids very very well this is 

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.970
 the primordial 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.820
 after opening our package and the 

00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:02.120
 I'm going to leave here submerged in the water 

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:06.100
 approximately 30 minutes and now 

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.100
 I'm going to take out and we're going to drain them well 

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.810
 and because maybe the whole fairy collection 

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.790
 you just get to expect soon the 

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.760
 video of the description of each of 

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:18.870
 the plants as well as their care and I 

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.870
 I see them in the next video
