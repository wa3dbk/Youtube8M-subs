00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
which while a very neat decision was

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.070 
which while a very neat decision was
actually<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:45.500> little<00:00:45.860> bit<00:00:47.080> underperforming

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
actually a little bit underperforming

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.719 
actually a little bit underperforming
for<00:00:48.110> what<00:00:48.470> its<00:00:48.619> potential<00:00:49.070> could<00:00:49.400> have<00:00:49.519> been

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
for what its potential could have been

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.500 
for what its potential could have been
this<00:00:50.390> car<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:50.869> a<00:00:50.930> 4<00:00:51.890> liter<00:00:52.100> twin-turbo<00:00:52.699> v8

very cool about this car is how
adjustable<00:01:33.939> everything<00:01:34.939> is<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:35.210> got<00:01:35.329> the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
adjustable everything is you got the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.560 
adjustable everything is you got the
Audi<00:01:35.630> Drive<00:01:36.079> select<00:01:36.109> system<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.219> can

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
Audi Drive select system so you can

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.440 
Audi Drive select system so you can
just<00:01:38.290> with<00:01:38.860> different<00:01:39.250> modes<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.670> suspension

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
just with different modes the suspension

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.330 
just with different modes the suspension
the<00:01:40.930> throttle<00:01:41.530> response<00:01:41.620> the<00:01:42.130> way<00:01:42.220> the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
the throttle response the way the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.340 
the throttle response the way the
transmission<00:01:43.000> shifts<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.990> sport

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
transmission shifts the sport

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.090 
transmission shifts the sport
differential<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.280> now<00:01:45.970> for<00:01:46.450> 2013<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.710> can<00:01:47.920> do

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
differential and now for 2013 you can do

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.650 
differential and now for 2013 you can do
them<00:01:48.250> all<00:01:48.430> individually<00:01:48.670> through<00:01:49.540> their

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
them all individually through their

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.510 
them all individually through their
individual<00:01:50.170> setting<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.860> engine<00:01:54.280> is<00:01:54.430> very

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
individual setting this engine is very

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.230 
individual setting this engine is very
cool<00:01:55.030> like<00:01:55.930> BMWs<00:01:56.770> twin<00:01:57.040> turbo<00:01:57.369> v8<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.910> turbo

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
cool like BMWs twin turbo v8 the turbo

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.120 
cool like BMWs twin turbo v8 the turbo
chargers<00:01:58.690> are<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:58.990> between<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.560> banks<00:01:59.920> of<00:02:00.009> the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
chargers are in between the banks of the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.249 
chargers are in between the banks of the
V<00:02:00.310> so<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.670> inlet<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.119> exhaust<00:02:01.390> valves<00:02:02.140> are

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
V so the inlet and exhaust valves are

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.219 
V so the inlet and exhaust valves are
reversed<00:02:02.650> making<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.670> whole<00:02:03.880> thing<00:02:04.150> very

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
reversed making the whole thing very

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.170 
reversed making the whole thing very
compact<00:02:05.229> in<00:02:05.470> fact<00:02:05.710> outies<00:02:06.580> have<00:02:06.759> always<00:02:06.940> sort

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
compact in fact outies have always sort

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.169 
compact in fact outies have always sort
of<00:02:07.240> had<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.420> problem<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.140> big<00:02:08.740> nose<00:02:09.160> heavy<00:02:09.550> cars

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
of had a problem of big nose heavy cars

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.760 
of had a problem of big nose heavy cars
because<00:02:10.600> their<00:02:10.750> engines<00:02:11.140> are<00:02:11.230> always<00:02:11.410> big

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
because their engines are always big

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.770 
because their engines are always big
they're<00:02:11.980> really<00:02:12.220> focusing<00:02:12.820> on<00:02:13.000> smaller

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
they're really focusing on smaller

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.110 
they're really focusing on smaller
engine<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.470> this<00:02:14.590> engine<00:02:14.860> from<00:02:15.610> front<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.030> back

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
engine so this engine from front to back

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.380 
engine so this engine from front to back
only<00:02:16.660> measures<00:02:17.500> half<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.340> meter<00:02:18.580> which<00:02:19.360> is

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
only measures half a meter which is

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.449 
only measures half a meter which is
really<00:02:20.140> impressive<00:02:20.650> if<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:20.860> see<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.160> engine

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
really impressive if you see the engine

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.330 
really impressive if you see the engine
on<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.550> stand<00:02:21.880> it's<00:02:22.030> very<00:02:22.420> very<00:02:22.720> small<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.920> s6

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
on a stand it's very very small the s6

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.479 
on a stand it's very very small the s6
and<00:02:24.459> s6<00:02:28.110> 420<00:02:29.110> horsepower<00:02:29.200> whereas<00:02:30.160> this<00:02:30.280> one

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
and s6 420 horsepower whereas this one

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.180 
and s6 420 horsepower whereas this one
makes<00:02:30.730> 520<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:32.440> way<00:02:32.560> they<00:02:32.769> do<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.130> is

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
makes 520 and the way they do that is

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.520 
makes 520 and the way they do that is
with<00:02:33.519> not<00:02:33.850> only<00:02:34.150> bigger<00:02:34.390> turbochargers<00:02:35.320> but<00:02:35.500> a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
with not only bigger turbochargers but a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.949 
with not only bigger turbochargers but a
lower<00:02:35.709> compression<00:02:36.220> ratio<00:02:36.790> different<00:02:37.630> cams

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
lower compression ratio different cams

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.130 
lower compression ratio different cams
and<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.410> different<00:02:39.340> crank<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.360> it's<00:02:40.630> not<00:02:40.810> like

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
and a different crank so it's not like

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.530 
and a different crank so it's not like
they're<00:02:41.350> just<00:02:41.560> running<00:02:41.799> more<00:02:42.160> boost<00:02:42.640> through

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
they're just running more boost through

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.520 
they're just running more boost through
the<00:02:43.720> s6<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.320> s6

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530
