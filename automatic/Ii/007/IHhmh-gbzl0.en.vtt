00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.690
 er chs 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.720
 you have to be professionals 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.960
 and we go with a shield directly a 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.960
 flag 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.789
 and god is that it's too weird 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.110
 by choosing and going directly I will 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.110
 say 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:52.080
 let's see we go here 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:54.530

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.530
 here 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.810
 but without bullets 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.800
 look 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:11.510
 because that leaves more red than the ciborium 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.610
 equally we hope because it's one thing 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.720
 very rare 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.380
