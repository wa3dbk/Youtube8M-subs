even<00:00:11.490> get<00:00:11.670> started<00:00:12.030> here<00:00:12.179> with<00:00:12.300> what<00:00:13.019> this

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
even get started here with what this

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.379 
even get started here with what this
pedal<00:00:13.440> does<00:00:13.679> we've<00:00:14.250> got<00:00:14.400> four<00:00:14.849> knobs<00:00:15.030> across

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
pedal does we've got four knobs across

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.330 
pedal does we've got four knobs across
the<00:00:15.540> top<00:00:15.750> first<00:00:16.230> one's<00:00:16.470> sensitivity<00:00:17.160> then

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the top first one's sensitivity then

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.029 
the top first one's sensitivity then
control<00:00:17.930> range<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.230> then<00:00:19.320> type<00:00:19.529> type

basically<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.640> switches<00:00:20.939> between<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
basically just switches between the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.060 
basically just switches between the
different<00:00:21.900> synthesizer<00:00:22.680> or

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
different synthesizer or

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.420 
different synthesizer or
filter<00:00:23.820> types<00:00:24.060> that's<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> pedal

filter types that's on the pedal

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.650 
filter types that's on the pedal
sensitivity<00:00:26.430> will<00:00:26.580> affect<00:00:26.939> how<00:00:27.150> sensitive

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
sensitivity will affect how sensitive

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.679 
sensitivity will affect how sensitive
the<00:00:28.109> effect<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:30.150> notes<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.480> are

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the effect is to the notes that are

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.110 
the effect is to the notes that are
coming<00:00:31.019> into<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> pedal<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.910> if<00:00:32.910> you're<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
coming into the pedal so if you're a

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.580 
coming into the pedal so if you're a
punchy<00:00:33.510> ER<00:00:33.630> player<00:00:33.870> you're<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> want<00:00:34.530> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
punchy ER player you're going to want to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.889 
punchy ER player you're going to want to
leave<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.920> down<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> lower<00:00:35.610> end<00:00:36.030> but

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
leave it down here at the lower end but

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.020 
leave it down here at the lower end but
if<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.020> play<00:00:37.200> pretty<00:00:37.320> lightly<00:00:37.820> you'll<00:00:38.820> want

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
if you play pretty lightly you'll want

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.310 
if you play pretty lightly you'll want
to<00:00:39.059> crank<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> little<00:00:39.660> bit<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.020> it'll<00:00:40.170> be

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
to crank it up a little bit so it'll be

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.490 
to crank it up a little bit so it'll be
more<00:00:40.829> sensitive<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.399> your<00:00:41.430> playing<00:00:41.730> style

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
more sensitive to your playing style

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.319 
more sensitive to your playing style
control<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.340> crank<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.239> way

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
control if you crank this all the way

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.069 
control if you crank this all the way
down<00:00:45.710> ends<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:47.090> kind<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> making<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.600> filter

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
down ends up kind of making the filter

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.810 
down ends up kind of making the filter
sound<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.950> same<00:00:50.129> no<00:00:50.309> matter<00:00:50.370> what<00:00:50.670> you're

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
sound the same no matter what you're

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.060 
sound the same no matter what you're
playing<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.570> move<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.379> control<00:00:52.829> up

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
playing and as you move the control up

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.310 
playing and as you move the control up
you<00:00:53.879> feel<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.360> more<00:00:54.510> control<00:00:55.079> over

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
you feel like you have more control over

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.770 
you feel like you have more control over
what<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> actual<00:00:56.370> filter<00:00:56.640> effect<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.239> doing

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
what the actual filter effect is doing

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.160 
what the actual filter effect is doing
just<00:00:58.620> through<00:00:58.980> your<00:00:59.129> own<00:00:59.280> play<00:00:59.520> style<00:01:00.170> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
just through your own play style the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.910 
just through your own play style the
range<00:01:01.440> knob<00:01:01.800> will<00:01:02.100> affect<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:03.920> frequency

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
range knob will affect the frequency

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
range knob will affect the frequency
range<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> actual<00:01:06.030> effect<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:07.229> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
range of the actual effect so as you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.890 
range of the actual effect so as you
increase<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.799> range<00:01:08.159> knob<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.330> effect<00:01:09.689> will

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
increase the range knob the effect will

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260 
increase the range knob the effect will
spread<00:01:10.830> from<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.040> much<00:01:11.280> starting<00:01:11.909> at<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.060> lower

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
spread from a much starting at a lower

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.460 
spread from a much starting at a lower
frequency<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.930> moving<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> higher

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
frequency to moving to a higher

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.390 
frequency to moving to a higher
frequency<00:01:13.670> as<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:15.450> takes<00:01:15.659> its<00:01:15.840> effect<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:17.009> as

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
frequency as it takes its effect so as

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.039 
frequency as it takes its effect so as
we<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.820> through<00:01:18.060> these<00:01:18.180> I'll<00:01:18.509> kind<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.840> let<00:01:18.930> you

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
we go through these I'll kind of let you

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.810 
we go through these I'll kind of let you
hear<00:01:19.200> what<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> different<00:01:19.820> synth

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
hear what all the different synth

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
hear what all the different synth
effects<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.780> I'll<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.140> kind<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> play

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
effects are and I'll just kind of play

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.830 
effects are and I'll just kind of play
with<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.770> knobs<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.159> get<00:01:23.400> an<00:01:23.460> idea<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.850> how

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
with the knobs you get an idea of how

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.510 
with the knobs you get an idea of how
they<00:01:24.960> each<00:01:25.049> affect<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.710> signal<00:01:26.250> that's

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
they each affect the signal that's

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.050 
they each affect the signal that's
coming<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.829> here's<00:01:28.829> our<00:01:29.040> here's<00:01:29.670> our<00:01:29.820> bass

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.240 
coming in so here's our here's our bass
loop<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:33.150> as<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.420> turn<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.840> filter<00:01:34.530> now

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
loop here and as we turn the filter now

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.249 
loop here and as we turn the filter now
the<00:01:35.310> first<00:01:35.700> type<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.450> we're<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the first type that we're on is the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.649 
the first type that we're on is the

the<00:01:58.190> next<00:01:58.430> type<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.880> our<00:02:00.040> sub<00:02:01.040> envelope<00:02:17.980> next

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
the next type is our sub envelope next

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:29.920 
the next type is our sub envelope next

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
type is the first synth what was once

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.770 
type is the first synth what was once
was<00:02:30.350> like<00:02:30.650> white<00:02:30.950> white<00:02:31.310> what<00:02:31.580> was<00:02:31.850> my<00:02:32.300> voice

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
was like white white what was my voice
