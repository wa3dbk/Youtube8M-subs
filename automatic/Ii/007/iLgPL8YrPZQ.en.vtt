 barroso I did not tell you to do not 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.030
 never again set foot here I 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.790
 put your feet to the cheeks often in the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.610
 mouth to all is proud the copyrights 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.659
 Christian is nothing yes then young 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.010
 were supposed to put back more feet 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.329
 here in his memory 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.590
 but as now we are in the 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.090
 true okay they will continue the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.219
 discussion so I found a book 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.579
 strange the other day in the reserve and 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:08.930
 that I did not know horcruxes I 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.189
 have not understood everything but it seems to me 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.540
 that seven years his parents are before 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.730
 several pieces that we come to 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.439
 create you have lost the mind this is 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.479
 no heart to laugh professor is holding 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.250
 although yes indeed to create a 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.139
 other luxury you have to divide your year 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.370
 for that it is necessary to be bitter but not 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.900
 after not mix as it works 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.430
 exactly because in the future you 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.270
 go key several gibson and coming 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.949
 I will enter through their account 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.419
 automatically I fiddle with a ring 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.810
 mysterious coming out of I do not know 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.889
 not so much the movie 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.330
 otherwise you can create as many 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.910
 recruits since you want it good I'm 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.910
 will be satisfied with 16.4 says no I said 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:54.680
 I 'm scared all alone in Tom forest 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.880
 they give me colitis and you 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.130
 can give me clues for them 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.570
 next horcruxes not everything you 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.340
 we see it is that we leave to the recruits 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.500
 are extremely difficult to destroy 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.520
 here we destroy each horcruxes we 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.520
 can finally kill voldemort 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.540
 our inception references I tell you 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.060
 but says he too expect that 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.949
 I'm telling 2h crisis have already been 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.020
 destroyed I took care in the pact 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.880
 to the ribs the grandfather of voldemort and 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.310
 you destroyed the Thursday gold newspaper 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.229
 them or on others they are masters 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.840
 of our destiny is that they 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:31.410
 decide our fate live or die 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.030
 this is the problem peace to your soul where liam 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.710
 in short, I am not at all advanced 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.120
 to find the horcruxes there and as 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.169
 I still have the list in the film 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.370
 that in the book as much seek a 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.199
 grinding in a haystack 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.820
 yes and volcom to orapi put all his 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.229
 heart to create the horcruxes had 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.419
 hidden and that's someone we find a 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.370
 heart paper I eat my hat but 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.630
 I think to have found another 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.729
 so first you can eat your 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.590
 hat and secondly I would not arrive 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.530
 not destroy it alone I will need 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.240
 of you this fair see there see a 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.919
 old homosexuals who wants me to come 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.539
 with him in a cave isolated from everything 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.800
 it is very dark inside where we do not 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.240
 will be that both having knowing 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.860
 than old ones with one hand so worn 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.310
 by a use that is ambiguous 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.020
 I can only trust him say 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.470
 so you 're late who's jerking off 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.030
 my idol I warn you harry if I tell you 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.430
 give an order you must obey without 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.200
 discuss nothing to do with the bdsm but 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.419
 if I tell you to run away you're running away 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.490
 if I tell you to hide, you hide 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.840
 if I tell you to sing of the miley cyrus 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.580
 always mali cyrus 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.960
 if I tell you to let me die 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.970
 two bars and you let me die 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.050
 you bats rockets hoya his wallet 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.900
 on hearing but that's a lot 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.520
 of silver lying and where you are shot yes 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.900
 so let's go my kiki 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.250
 oh well we can transpose in 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.030
 Hogwarts now it's because I 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.470
 am the director 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.419
 another trick added by the 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.950
 writers but hey it still goes that 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.389
 quite since in the first movie 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.200
 when voldemort wants to seize the 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:48.060
 philosopher's Stone 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.230
 i'm in london and i made the trip 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.540
 pack up 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:59.480
 oh but that did not pack me more than 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:59.480
 that all I have to lose 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.030
 we interrupt his programs for 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.460
 introduce you to the story of courage the 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:11.300
 crazy dog that with starring courage 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.300
