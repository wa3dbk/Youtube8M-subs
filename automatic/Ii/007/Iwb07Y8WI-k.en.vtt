00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
of times but it's not something I think

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.699 
of times but it's not something I think
I<00:04:13.769> would<00:04:14.190> switch<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:15.180> or<00:04:15.599> use<00:04:16.320> for<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.560> long

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
I would switch to or use for a long

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.039 
I would switch to or use for a long
period<00:04:17.220> of<00:04:17.310> time<00:04:17.519> some<00:04:17.909> people<00:04:18.239> though<00:04:18.419> have

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049
