00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:29.093
 Years ago, when I was younger 

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:32.888
 Let's say I liked a girl I met 

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:38.269
 She was mine and we were boyfriends 

00:00:38.974 --> 00:00:42.127
 That was before, but then it was true 

00:00:43.573 --> 00:00:47.490
 I'm in love with a fairy tale 

00:00:47.944 --> 00:00:51.760
 Even if it hurts 

00:00:52.292 --> 00:00:56.513
 Because I do not care if I lose my mind 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.327
 I'm already damn 

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:23.443
 Every day we started a fight 

00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:27.391
 Every night we fell in love 

00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:32.564
 Nobody else could make me feel so sad 

00:01:33.388 --> 00:01:37.973
 But nobody else could take me higher 

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:41.219
 I do not know what I was doing 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.709
 When suddenly we parted 

00:01:47.047 --> 00:01:50.156
 Today I can not find it 

00:01:51.053 --> 00:01:56.067
 But when it does, we'll have a brand-new start 

00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:01.924
 I'm in love with a fairy tale 

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:06.405
 Even if it hurts 

00:02:06.773 --> 00:02:10.894
 Because I do not care if I lose my mind 

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:15.719
 I'm already damn 

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:39.986
 She is a fairy tale 

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:46.243
 Even if it hurts 

00:02:46.752 --> 00:02:50.973
 Because I do not care if I lose my mind 

00:02:51.292 --> 00:02:55.880
 I'm already damn
