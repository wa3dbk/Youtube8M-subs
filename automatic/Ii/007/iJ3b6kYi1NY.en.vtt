the<00:01:12.070> black<00:01:12.280> label<00:01:12.729> is<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:12.909> fact<00:01:13.240> that<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.600> one

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
the black label is the fact that the one

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.210 
the black label is the fact that the one
with<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:13.990> black<00:01:14.170> label<00:01:14.619> is<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.799> little<00:01:15.100> bit

of the year the the hair gel that I was

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.630 
of the year the the hair gel that I was

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
really good but for some reason in the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.400 
really good but for some reason in the
winter<00:04:50.340> time<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.970> is<00:04:51.210> just<00:04:51.480> not<00:04:51.840> working<00:04:52.140> well

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
in my hair it's probably because it has

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.660 
in my hair it's probably because it has
like<00:04:55.230> a<00:04:55.260> higher<00:04:55.530> percentage<00:04:56.100> of<00:04:56.190> glycerin
