00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.430
 Hello, good savers, today we are going to 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.139
 learn to do pam pam but so that 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.179
 we do not have much good idea either 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.589
 find the other day in the profile of 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.050
 facebook of a friend of marta in 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.750
 I saw that he had made bread and 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.779
 I asked and I told him but Esteban is easy 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.269
 to do he told me he deals very easy to 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.599
 make an hour included the baking that 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.640
 it's 45 minutes like that of confectionery and I'm going to 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.699
 learn let's learn together from you 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.250
 from home and I from here do our 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.870
 video the bread to see how it goes well 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.549
 these are the ingredients for our 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.970
 first bread that we are going to make together 

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:46.750
 We need 315 grams of flour 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.699
 flour force a tablespoon of salt 30 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.830
 grams of peeled nuts in this case 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.110
 chosen nuts because the bread you want 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.570
 to make is nut bread also 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.280
 we need fresh yeast I have 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.500
 got like this in the supermarket the 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.010
 you can find in mercadona in consumption 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.530
 extra in a lot of places 175 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.950
 milliliters of water and a spoonful of 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.920
 oil 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.509
 let's go back to the good work well what 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.719
 first thing we're going to do is tune a 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.470
 we miss little water in a bowl on 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.960
 a small gap 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.560
 and a spoon together with the spoon 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.560
 oil 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.930
 this we put about 5 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.450
 between 5 and 10 seconds depending on the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.280
 microwave power I usually put it 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.220
 I always have the microwave 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.320
 maximum power 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.360
 well then we throw the mixture we have 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.670
 tempered with water and oil in a 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.150
 larger bowl the fresh yeast the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.660
 we are also throwing 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.660
 d 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.530
 I'm crumbling 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.530
 let's move 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.280
 here, basically, what matters is 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:03.030
 that stays well dissolved so that it is 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.030
 well dissolved 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.619
 and now the flour to see advice from me 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.770
 Friend marta the flour you have bought 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.450
 she had been recommended as leader 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.970
 a flour of strength that there is in video 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.070
 that I have far away what I've done 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.630
 been picking up another strength flour that 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.650
 they will have their but that already as 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.650
 you go boiling 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.329
 and the nuts 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.220
 Well, once we have the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.320
 well-removed mass 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.300
 we are going to work here so that we do not 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:49.730
 paste we add a little flour 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.730
 and this is our mass 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.819
 to see how this first bread comes out that 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.160
 being here in direct sure that 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.010
 you then improve it 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.070
 the idea is to have a ball that is not 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.430
 neither too dry nor too sticky on the fingers 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.990
 because we already have the mass made you give 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.930
 the way you want in this case I'm going to 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.070
 use an elongated mold so what 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.170
 What I have done is to give it the elongated shape 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:21.450
 some cuts here in the bread and like that and already 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.260
 they have ready then now we take the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.379
 mold 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.200
 and one we give with a little bit of oil and 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:33.180
 We give with a little oil after 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.180
 Boreas a little more flour 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.950
 albal paper so that it is well covered 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.740
 Now let's introduce the mass in the 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.140
 oven the key is that the oven has to 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:53.060
 be cold then we directly put 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.010
 the mass 45 minutes at 220 degrees now not 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.890
 we lose and there is bread because I do not 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.880
 you have seen but it is difficult for me to hit boats 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.670
 because we're going to go has made me a lot 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.310
 Illusion this my first nut bread that 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.870
 I have done and well I hope you have seen 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.600
 that if I have done it for you 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.280
 able to do it and notice that we are 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.350
 eating bread without any kind of 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.760
 artificial ingredient that you have seen 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.010
 with very simple ingredients 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.239
 get and very cheap as we 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.239
 like in savers
