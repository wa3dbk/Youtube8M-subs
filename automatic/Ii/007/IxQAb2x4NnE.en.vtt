00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 to press to thank one for 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.170
 its existence through so many efforts 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.269
 thank mom who always thought that 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.700
 we could succeed 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.910
 perhaps there will be one more being in the world 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.070
 positive and hotter than a mother 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.650
 perhaps they have met someone else 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.230
 convinced that a mother 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.900
 ask a mother if her son is the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.330
 the world's most beautiful ask a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.390
 mother if your girl is the most beautiful girl 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.489
 of the world that contains a mother and her 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.199
 daughter is the smartest or your child is 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.879
 the smartest in the world is never 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.480
 a mother who says that 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:42.930
 son of an intelligence given with two 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.620
 years and like the one of clever nobody so 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.920
 convinced as mom no one so believer 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.339
 with mom nobody with so much faith for someone 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.820
 as a mom that's why we dedicate these 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:00.470
 reflections mom and we all hear them 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:06.110
 and we all learn 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:08.150
 a reflection the most evil mom in the world 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.800
 perhaps you had the most bad mom 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.760
 of the world 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.270
 says our reflection I had the mom 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.340
 the worst in the world 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.340
 while the children did not have to 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.030
 I had to eat cereal 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.820
 eggs and toast 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.280
 when others were drinking soda 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.890
 Soda and candy for lunch I 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.960
 I had to eat sandwich 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.659
 I had the most bad mom of all 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.770
 world while the children did not have 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.020
 I had to enjoy breakfast 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.540
 as healthy as I was what I did not 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.260
 I liked it but it was what I liked best 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.750
 that's how my mom was 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.260
 my mother always insisted on knowing where 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.080
 we were looking like we were 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.760
 imprisoned did not let us live had 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.230
 to know who our friends were 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.960
 we had no right to choose them and 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.750
 simply that she did not have to 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.080
 know them 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.170
 the very bad my mom 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.730
 insisted that if we said that we were going to 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.590
 take an hour only us 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.130
 we would not spend an hour 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.560
 that's why cruel was my mom 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.930
 I'm ashamed to admit it but until 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.790
 my mother had the nerve 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.270
 to break the law against the work of 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.440
 the younger children and she did that 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.390
 we wash the dishes we would have the beds 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.970
 We learned to cook, helped in 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.910
 Housework and many things 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.770
 equally cruel that cruel and that the 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.720
 same mom 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.370
 I think she stayed awake in the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.920
 night thinking about the things he could 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.340
 force us to do always insisted on 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.640
 that we should tell the truth and only the truth 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.580
 we had to say that 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.069
 but when we reach adolescence 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.019
 and I was much wiser my mom 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.489
 in our lives they became even more 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.690
 miserable my mom became possessive 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:10.569
 who washes with everyone 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.150
 nobody could touch the horn 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.090
 so that we could run out 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.889
 embarrassed to the extreme forcing 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.250
 our friends to get to the door 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:25.420
 to ask about us 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.970
 we were ashamed going to the houses of the 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.730
 neighbors to check if it was the party 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.730
 where we had told him what 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.720
 shame 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.390
 I still asked my mom 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.240
 he asked us to kiss him in the 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.060
 door of the school and we told him to 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.120
 Water 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:51.560
 what a shame with our friends my 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.709
 mother was a complete failure none of 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.650
 we have been arrested none of 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.510
 our brothers has been arrested every 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.640
 one of my brothers has served his 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.370
 homeland and to whom we should blame 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.840
 our terrible future for he is right 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.410
 to our mother 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.790
 see everything we have ever missed 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.220
 we were able to participate in a 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.320
 demonstration and violent acts and thousands 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.139
 of things that many of our 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.100
 friends if they are in prisons 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.000
 they died 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:28.090
 who they are no longer with us they us 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.840
 made us become educated adults and 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:35.710
 honest that mom's cruelty made that 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.410
 we were educated and honest using this 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.830
 As an example I'm trying to educate 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.850
 my children in the same way 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.490
 that is why you will understand today that I 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:52.410
 I thank you very much God I thank you 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:57.860
 to the gentleman for giving me the mom more 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.860
 bad and cruelest in the world
