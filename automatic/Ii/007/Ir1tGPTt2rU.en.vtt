do<00:02:01.679> I<00:02:01.799> think<00:02:01.859> about<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.310> product<00:02:02.630> one<00:02:03.630> thing

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
do I think about this product one thing

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.480 
do I think about this product one thing
that<00:02:04.049> was<00:02:04.170> kind<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.530> weird<00:02:04.740> for<00:02:05.039> me<00:02:05.130> at<00:02:05.249> first

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that was kind of weird for me at first

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.210 
that was kind of weird for me at first
actually<00:02:05.999> is<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> lack<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.600> scent<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.799> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
actually is the lack of scent so the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.609 
actually is the lack of scent so the
Emma<00:02:08.369> Hardy<00:02:08.700> balm<00:02:09.270> definitely<00:02:10.110> has<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> smell

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
Emma Hardy balm definitely has a smell

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.969 
Emma Hardy balm definitely has a smell
to<00:02:10.800> it

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
to it

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.920 
to it
I<00:02:11.129> had<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> Sarah<00:02:11.970> Chapman<00:02:12.450> one<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.629> can't

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
I had a Sarah Chapman one I can't

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.059 
I had a Sarah Chapman one I can't
remember<00:02:13.110> if<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.349> had

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
remember if that had

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.429 
remember if that had
but<00:02:14.640> they<00:02:14.879> always<00:02:15.060> are<00:02:15.450> sort<00:02:15.689> of<00:02:15.719> like<00:02:15.930> more<00:02:16.319> on

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
but they always are sort of like more on

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.130 
but they always are sort of like more on
the<00:02:16.560> yellow<00:02:17.010> side<00:02:17.340> or<00:02:17.700> Brown<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.569> this<00:02:18.959> is

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the yellow side or Brown and this is

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.130 
the yellow side or Brown and this is
just<00:02:19.379> white<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.489> completely<00:02:21.450> scentless<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.079> I

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
just white and completely scentless so I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.530 
just white and completely scentless so I
was<00:02:22.319> kind<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.709> weirded<00:02:23.069> out<00:02:23.189> by<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.480> um<00:02:24.480> and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
was kind of weirded out by this um and

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.630 
was kind of weirded out by this um and
that<00:02:25.109> was<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.769> things<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.219> wasn't

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
that was one of the things I wasn't

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.880 
that was one of the things I wasn't
really<00:02:26.730> sure<00:02:27.000> if<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.269> like<00:02:27.299> this<00:02:27.719> product<00:02:27.989> but

really sure if I like this product but

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.309 
really sure if I like this product but
then<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.370> started<00:02:29.640> realizing<00:02:29.730> why<00:02:30.720> do<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.959> care

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
then I started realizing why do I care

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.990 
then I started realizing why do I care
if<00:02:31.349> they're<00:02:31.620> sent<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.069> it<00:02:32.159> or<00:02:32.280> not<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.670> know<00:02:32.790> if

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:41.729 
very very gentle I don't say I wouldn't

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.879 
very very gentle I don't say I wouldn't
necessarily<00:03:41.849> say<00:03:42.359> it's<00:03:42.389> moisturizing<00:03:43.379> but<00:03:43.769> it

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
necessarily say it's moisturizing but it

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.949 
necessarily say it's moisturizing but it
definitely<00:03:44.310> does<00:03:44.489> not<00:03:44.519> dry<00:03:45.030> all<00:03:45.389> your<00:03:45.690> skin's

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
definitely does not dry all your skin's

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.629 
definitely does not dry all your skin's

for<00:03:59.159> a<00:03:59.189> couple<00:03:59.280> months<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.669> have<00:03:59.819> not<00:03:59.970> been

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
for a couple months I have not been

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.330 
for a couple months I have not been
using<00:04:00.359> this<00:04:00.629> every<00:04:01.409> day<00:04:01.650> for<00:04:01.949> the<00:04:02.010> last<00:04:02.159> couple

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
using this every day for the last couple

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.759 
using this every day for the last couple
months<00:04:02.519> but<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.419> could<00:04:03.750> say<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.049> know<00:04:04.229> if<00:04:04.439> I<00:04:04.560> was

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
months but I could say you know if I was

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.550 
months but I could say you know if I was
just<00:04:05.069> using<00:04:05.250> this<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.729> would<00:04:06.329> guess<00:04:06.540> maybe<00:04:07.349> I

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
just using this I would guess maybe I

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.199 
just using this I would guess maybe I
can<00:04:07.829> get<00:04:07.889> through<00:04:08.099> two<00:04:08.310> months<00:04:08.819> maybe<00:04:09.030> even

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
can get through two months maybe even

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.689 
can get through two months maybe even
three<00:04:09.840> because<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:10.829> don't<00:04:11.040> use<00:04:11.189> that<00:04:11.220> much<00:04:11.519> of

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
three because you don't use that much of

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.909 
three because you don't use that much of
it<00:04:11.819> at<00:04:11.970> all<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.659> anyway<00:04:13.019> really<00:04:13.530> like<00:04:13.769> this
