00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.070 
like maybe one of the best balances I

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.550 
like maybe one of the best balances I
had<00:00:05.310> but<00:00:05.910> uh<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.390> got<00:00:06.750> two<00:00:06.870> three<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.170> four<00:00:07.410> it

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
