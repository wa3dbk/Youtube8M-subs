00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:12.789
 division or quotient of natural numbers 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.950
 quotients of two specific numbers are 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:19.119
 call quotient between two numbers 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:22.300
 concrete to the concrete or natural number 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.930
 which is obtained by dividing the 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.350
 coefficients of the given numbers and whose 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:34.120
 symbolic unit is the quotient of the 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:38.199
 Dividend units and divisor provided 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:42.690
 that has interpretation, let's see a 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:47.499
 first simple example 250 meters 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.069
 divided 10 meters equal to 25 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:55.960
 we could interpret it as a tablet 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:59.979
 of 250 meters that we want to divide into 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:04.170
 pieces of 10 meters each one we will obtain 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:07.620
 so the quantity of resulting pieces 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.430
 when the two numbers that we divide are 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.970
 homogeneous 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:18.100
 the same unit the result is a 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:21.870
 natural number or be a quantity let's see 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:26.500
 this second example 10 square meters 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:29.200
 divided 10 decimeters the dividend is 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.830
 expressed in square meters and the 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.460
 divider in decimeters the first thing that 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.390
 we must do is reduce the meters 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.990
 square to square decimeters for 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.320
 that are expressed in the same unit 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.680
 well 1000 square decimeters divided 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.050
 10 decimeters allows us to obtain the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:59.500
 final result that is 10 decimeters 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.800
 we can interpret this example as a 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.340
 10 square meter box 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:10.810
 surface of which we know a side 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.790
 whose length is 10 decimeters and 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:19.010
 we want to know the length of the other side 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:23.189
 the resulting 100 decimeters can 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.549
 express yourself as 10 meters now let's see 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:31.799
 what happens if the concrete numbers that 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:35.790
 they are divided they are not homogeneous 384 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:41.280
 kilometers divided two hours gives us 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:45.030
 as a result 192 and the symbolic unit 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.450
 it will be kilometers about hour which is the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.170
 quotient between the symbolic unit of 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:57.329
 dividend and that of the divisor we can 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:02.730
 suppose this example as a distance 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:06.870
 of 384 kilometers that has been traveled 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.680
 in two hours and we want to find out the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:14.280
 mobile speed that has traveled that 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:18.349
 kilometer road is a unit of 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.290
 distance is now a unit of time 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:25.189
 and kilometers about 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.939
 is a unit of speed to this we 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:34.269
 we refer when the statement requires 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:34.269
 that the quotient has interpretation
