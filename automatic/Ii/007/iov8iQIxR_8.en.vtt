00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
piece of fabric and this is actually

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.209 
piece of fabric and this is actually
going<00:00:11.360> to<00:00:11.480> be<00:00:11.570> what<00:00:11.780> we<00:00:11.900> called<00:00:12.110> a<00:00:12.230> leader<00:00:12.469> i'm

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
going to so this first doesn't really

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.080 
going to so this first doesn't really
matter<00:00:15.320> how<00:00:15.590> you<00:00:15.650> so<00:00:16.010> it<00:00:16.190> because<00:00:16.369> it<00:00:16.520> is<00:00:16.730> scrap

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
matter how you so it because it is scrap

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.210 
matter how you so it because it is scrap
and<00:00:17.360> then<00:00:18.020> from<00:00:18.500> there<00:00:18.710> we're<00:00:19.039> going<00:00:19.160> to

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
and then from there we're going to

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.180 
and then from there we're going to
follow<00:00:19.490> it<00:00:19.700> with<00:00:20.000> our<00:00:20.270> brick<00:00:20.630> sets<00:00:21.340> which<00:00:22.340> are

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
follow it with our brick sets which are

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.680 
follow it with our brick sets which are
these<00:00:25.190> guys<00:00:25.400> and<00:00:25.730> i'm<00:00:26.180> going<00:00:26.300> to<00:00:26.360> show<00:00:26.540> you<00:00:26.570> how

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.690 
these guys and i'm going to show you how

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.540 
these guys and i'm going to show you how
the<00:00:26.810> chain<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:27.320> all<00:00:27.530> of<00:00:27.560> them<00:00:29.350> alright<00:00:30.350> so<00:00:31.280> to

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
the chain so all of them alright so to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.729 
the chain so all of them alright so to
get<00:00:31.640> started<00:00:31.700> it<00:00:32.119> pull<00:00:33.050> your<00:00:33.170> needle<00:00:33.320> all<00:00:33.590> the

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
get started it pull your needle all the

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.939 
get started it pull your needle all the
way<00:00:33.829> up<00:00:34.449> you<00:00:35.449> should<00:00:35.749> have<00:00:36.109> some<00:00:37.100> thread<00:00:37.550> here

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
way up you should have some thread here

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.819 
way up you should have some thread here
actually<00:00:39.949> probably<00:00:40.429> won't<00:00:41.420> matter<00:00:42.350> so<00:00:42.769> much

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
actually probably won't matter so much

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.040 
actually probably won't matter so much
this<00:00:43.159> time<00:00:43.269> usually<00:00:44.269> when<00:00:44.420> you<00:00:44.510> start<00:00:44.749> to<00:00:44.870> so

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
this time usually when you start to so

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.229 
this time usually when you start to so
you're<00:00:45.289> going<00:00:45.409> to<00:00:45.469> pull<00:00:45.739> your<00:00:45.769> bottom<00:00:46.249> thread

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
you're going to pull your bottom thread

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.959 
you're going to pull your bottom thread
up<00:00:47.480> through<00:00:47.960> your<00:00:47.989> fabric<00:00:48.620> because<00:00:49.579> this<00:00:49.789> is

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
up through your fabric because this is

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.149 
up through your fabric because this is
just<00:00:50.269> a<00:00:50.420> piece<00:00:50.629> of<00:00:50.659> scrap<00:00:51.140> fabric<00:00:51.440> it<00:00:51.800> really

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
just a piece of scrap fabric it really

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.439 
just a piece of scrap fabric it really
won't<00:00:52.640> make<00:00:52.850> a<00:00:52.879> difference<00:00:54.129> so<00:00:55.389> you're<00:00:56.389> just

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
won't make a difference so you're just

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.690 
won't make a difference so you're just
going<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:56.719> say<00:00:56.870> that

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.420 

and<00:01:00.700> before<00:01:01.600> you<00:01:01.840> get<00:01:02.170> finished<00:01:02.470> you're

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
and before you get finished you're

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.430 
and before you get finished you're
actually<00:01:03.580> going<00:01:03.910> to<00:01:04.269> line<00:01:04.600> these<00:01:04.839> pieces<00:01:05.140> up

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
actually going to line these pieces up

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.460 
actually going to line these pieces up
now<00:01:06.070> because<00:01:06.310> these<00:01:06.700> are<00:01:06.910> so<00:01:07.180> small<00:01:07.540> i<00:01:07.840> usually

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
now because these are so small i usually

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.460 
now because these are so small i usually
don't<00:01:08.770> pin<00:01:09.100> them<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:10.570> if<00:01:10.660> you<00:01:10.720> find<00:01:10.990> that<00:01:11.229> it's

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
don't pin them but if you find that it's

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.380 
don't pin them but if you find that it's
hard<00:01:11.680> for<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.100> sew<00:01:12.610> these<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.060> keep<00:01:13.210> them

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
hard for you to sew these and keep them

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.200 
hard for you to sew these and keep them
even<00:01:13.870> then<00:01:14.860> go<00:01:15.010> ahead<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.550> pin<00:01:15.790> them<00:01:15.940> and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
even then go ahead and pin them and

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.130 
even then go ahead and pin them and
you're<00:01:16.330> just<00:01:16.420> going<00:01:16.690> to<00:01:16.810> pin<00:01:16.990> them

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
you're just going to pin them

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.630 
you're just going to pin them
perpendicular<00:01:18.030> let<00:01:19.030> me<00:01:19.119> hold<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:19.360> up<00:01:19.510> and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
perpendicular let me hold that up and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.440 
perpendicular let me hold that up and
you're<00:01:21.640> just<00:01:21.760> going<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:22.000> pin<00:01:22.270> them

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
you're just going to pin them

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.700 
you're just going to pin them
perpendicular<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.350> way<00:01:23.440> that<00:01:23.590> you're

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
perpendicular to the way that you're

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.950 
perpendicular to the way that you're
selling<00:01:23.920> so<00:01:24.190> when<00:01:24.310> I<00:01:24.369> put<00:01:24.550> this<00:01:24.640> down<00:01:24.880> my<00:01:25.630> pins

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
selling so when I put this down my pins

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:35.640 
selling so when I put this down my pins
would<00:01:26.440> be<00:01:26.590> going<00:01:26.950> this<00:01:27.520> way

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.040 

and<00:01:36.220> so<00:01:36.490> what<00:01:36.670> you'll<00:01:36.820> notice<00:01:37.000> is<00:01:37.390> that<00:01:37.450> i'm

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
and so what you'll notice is that i'm

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.050 
and so what you'll notice is that i'm
using<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:38.500> quarter<00:01:38.890> inch<00:01:39.040> foot<00:01:39.340> i<00:01:39.550> also<00:01:39.790> have<00:01:40.030> a

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
using a quarter inch foot i also have a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.950 
using a quarter inch foot i also have a
quarter<00:01:40.540> inch<00:01:40.690> seam<00:01:41.020> line<00:01:41.410> on<00:01:41.650> my<00:01:42.550> machine

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
quarter inch seam line on my machine

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.050 
quarter inch seam line on my machine
which<00:01:43.960> will<00:01:44.110> help<00:01:44.230> me<00:01:44.440> sew<00:01:44.650> this<00:01:44.860> straight<00:01:48.060> so

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
which will help me sew this straight so

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.340 
which will help me sew this straight so
we're<00:01:49.180> gonna<00:01:49.360> hear<00:01:49.480> through<00:01:49.720> here

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.530 

and<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:53.710> is<00:01:53.860> just<00:01:54.100> before<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:54.700> finish<00:01:55.180> that

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
and that is just before I finish that

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.230 
and that is just before I finish that
one<00:01:55.750> I'm<00:01:55.900> going<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.140> stop<00:01:56.460> I'm<00:01:57.460> going<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.910> prep

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
one I'm going to stop I'm going to prep

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.790 
one I'm going to stop I'm going to prep
the<00:01:58.390> second<00:01:58.750> one<00:01:58.900> or<00:01:59.110> just<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.350> make<00:01:59.470> sure<00:01:59.500> that

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
the second one or just to make sure that

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800 
the second one or just to make sure that
it's<00:01:59.950> it's<00:02:00.910> all<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.120> way<00:02:01.240> even<00:02:01.570> all<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:01.690> way

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
it's it's all the way even all the way

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.160 
it's it's all the way even all the way
down<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.290> from<00:02:03.130> there<00:02:03.370> I'm<00:02:03.900> going<00:02:04.900> to<00:02:05.080> go

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
down and from there I'm going to go

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.740 
down and from there I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.640> this<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.970> just<00:02:10.119> sort<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.479> feed

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
ahead and so this and just sort of feed

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.660 
ahead and so this and just sort of feed
it<00:02:10.899> through<00:02:10.929> now<00:02:11.410> you<00:02:11.740> might<00:02:12.040> need<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.280> pull

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
it through now you might need to pull

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.750 
it through now you might need to pull
this<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.450> SEC<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.230> first<00:02:14.470> one<00:02:14.709> a<00:02:14.950> little<00:02:15.490> bit

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
this the SEC the first one a little bit

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.870 
this the SEC the first one a little bit
just<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.090> make<00:02:16.120> sure<00:02:16.240> it<00:02:16.540> clears<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:18.640> the

just to make sure it clears and that the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:28.930 
just to make sure it clears and that the
second<00:02:19.270> one<00:02:19.360> doesn't<00:02:19.630> run<00:02:19.780> into<00:02:20.080> it

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.140 

and<00:02:29.540> there<00:02:29.690> we<00:02:29.810> go<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.920> we've<00:02:31.100> just<00:02:31.130> changed<00:02:31.820> so

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
and there we go so we've just changed so

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.250 
and there we go so we've just changed so
two<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.600> these<00:02:32.780> um<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.710> have<00:02:34.240> 13<00:02:35.240> in<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.690> row<00:02:35.720> and

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
two of these um you have 13 in a row and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.000 
two of these um you have 13 in a row and
so<00:02:37.220> those<00:02:37.700> would<00:02:38.090> be<00:02:38.330> done<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:39.500> know<00:02:39.590> my<00:02:39.770> sets

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
so those would be done you know my sets

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.540 
so those would be done you know my sets
of<00:02:40.130> two<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.760> then<00:02:40.850> sets<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.240> four<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:42.550> your

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
of two and then sets of four and your

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.280 
of two and then sets of four and your
old<00:02:43.700> since<00:02:44.060> its<00:02:44.210> 13<00:02:44.660> you'll<00:02:44.870> wind<00:02:44.990> up<00:02:45.080> having

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
old since its 13 you'll wind up having

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.470 
old since its 13 you'll wind up having
this<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.830> one<00:02:46.310> additional<00:02:46.760> block<00:02:47.000> onto<00:02:47.240> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
this so one additional block onto the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.690 
this so one additional block onto the
row<00:02:47.630> I'm<00:02:48.440> going<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:48.920> go<00:02:49.010> ahead<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.220> cut<00:02:49.520> this

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
row I'm going to go ahead and cut this

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.340 
row I'm going to go ahead and cut this
and<00:02:50.290> pull<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:51.380> out<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:51.710> you<00:02:51.800> can<00:02:51.920> see<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.310> and

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
and pull it out so you can see it and

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.340 
and pull it out so you can see it and
what<00:02:54.350> you<00:02:54.530> will<00:02:54.650> see<00:02:54.920> see<00:02:55.760> if<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:55.940> get<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.350> make

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
what you will see see if I get that make

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.950 
what you will see see if I get that make
sure<00:02:57.500> it's<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:57.770> focus<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.570> little<00:02:59.750> bit

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
sure it's in focus is this a little bit

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.410 
sure it's in focus is this a little bit
of<00:03:00.050> thread<00:03:00.320> right<00:03:00.560> here<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:02.090> sort<00:03:02.270> of<00:03:02.300> it

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
of thread right here and it sort of it

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.940 
of thread right here and it sort of it
just<00:03:02.570> keeps<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:02.900> connected<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.800> don't

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
just keeps it connected you don't

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.210 
just keeps it connected you don't
actually<00:03:04.100> have<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.370> cut<00:03:04.580> these<00:03:04.760> until<00:03:05.210> now<00:03:05.270> oh

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
actually have to cut these until now oh

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.460 
actually have to cut these until now oh
come<00:03:07.220> on<00:03:07.310> put<00:03:07.610> them<00:03:07.790> on<00:03:07.940> my<00:03:07.970> machine<00:03:08.320> this<00:03:09.320> is<00:03:09.440> a

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
come on put them on my machine this is a

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.230 
come on put them on my machine this is a
scrap<00:03:09.950> one<00:03:10.250> that's<00:03:10.790> there<00:03:11.150> cut<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:13.240> and

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
scrap one that's there cut that and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.910 
scrap one that's there cut that and
you'll<00:03:14.900> know<00:03:15.020> this<00:03:15.170> i<00:03:15.320> just<00:03:15.350> did<00:03:15.650> these<00:03:15.800> were

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
you'll know this i just did these were

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.410 
you'll know this i just did these were
two<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.280> same<00:03:16.460> block<00:03:16.730> your<00:03:16.970> blocks<00:03:17.210> are

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
two of the same block your blocks are

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.170 
two of the same block your blocks are
going<00:03:17.570> to<00:03:17.630> be<00:03:17.720> completely<00:03:18.110> different<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:19.180> so

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
going to be completely different and so

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.500 
going to be completely different and so
that's<00:03:21.170> what<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:21.500> have<00:03:23.470> again<00:03:25.270> left<00:03:26.270> two<00:03:26.480> of

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
that's what you have again left two of

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.030 
that's what you have again left two of
these<00:03:27.640> your<00:03:28.640> fours<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.390> then<00:03:29.710> what<00:03:30.710> you<00:03:30.890> would

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
these your fours and then what you would

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.070 
these your fours and then what you would
do<00:03:31.250> is<00:03:31.550> go<00:03:31.850> back<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.360> so<00:03:32.570> these<00:03:32.720> again

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
do is go back and so these again

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:43.660 
do is go back and so these again
together

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.630 

and<00:03:44.300> actually<00:03:44.720> that's<00:03:45.110> not<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.560> right<00:03:45.680> way<00:03:45.890> if

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
and actually that's not the right way if

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.580 
and actually that's not the right way if
you're<00:03:46.790> going<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:46.970> do<00:03:47.150> every<00:03:47.720> other<00:03:47.750> one<00:03:48.110> is

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
you're going to do every other one is

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.979 
you're going to do every other one is
going<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.610> be<00:03:49.700> a<00:03:49.730> print<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.270> then<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.420> white<00:03:50.690> so

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
going to be a print and then a white so

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.170 
going to be a print and then a white so
what<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.290> want<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.560> do<00:03:51.680> is<00:03:51.830> make<00:03:51.860> sure<00:03:52.180> that

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
what you want to do is make sure that

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.729 
what you want to do is make sure that
when<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:53.480> start<00:03:53.780> matching<00:03:54.230> these<00:03:54.530> together

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
when you start matching these together

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.199 
when you start matching these together
that<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.730> opposite<00:03:56.090> colors<00:03:56.770> opposite<00:03:57.770> colors

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
that the opposite colors opposite colors

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.780 
that the opposite colors opposite colors
yeah<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.910> then<00:04:02.330> we<00:04:02.510> would<00:04:02.860> either<00:04:03.860> pin<00:04:04.610> this

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
yeah and then we would either pin this

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.280 
yeah and then we would either pin this
or<00:04:05.060> not<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:06.520> we<00:04:07.520> would<00:04:07.670> so<00:04:07.910> again<00:04:08.780> on<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.080> row

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
or not and we would so again on this row

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.830 
or not and we would so again on this row
so<00:04:09.769> we're<00:04:09.920> going<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.100> do<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:10.400> for<00:04:10.760> all<00:04:11.030> 13

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
so we're going to do this for all 13

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.770 
so we're going to do this for all 13
blocks<00:04:12.080> that<00:04:12.350> are<00:04:12.470> in<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.769> room<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.780> you'll

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
blocks that are in the room and you'll

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.879 
blocks that are in the room and you'll
notice<00:04:14.989> it'll<00:04:15.290> end<00:04:15.440> up<00:04:15.500> coming<00:04:16.190> out<00:04:16.340> like<00:04:16.579> this

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
notice it'll end up coming out like this

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.129 
notice it'll end up coming out like this
since<00:04:18.889> I<00:04:18.979> do<00:04:19.100> have<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:19.400> here<00:04:19.579> what<00:04:20.150> we<00:04:20.329> do<00:04:20.750> at

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.500 
since I do have you here what we do at
the<00:04:21.590> end<00:04:21.889> after<00:04:22.220> you've<00:04:22.460> sewn<00:04:22.760> all<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.300> blocks

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
the end after you've sewn all the blocks

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.900 
the end after you've sewn all the blocks
together<00:04:23.810> I'll<00:04:24.380> chase<00:04:24.620> it<00:04:24.830> again<00:04:25.040> of<00:04:25.220> a<00:04:25.550> repeat

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
together I'll chase it again of a repeat

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.969 
together I'll chase it again of a repeat
that's<00:04:26.120> 13<00:04:27.340> 13<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.460> these<00:04:28.610> blocks<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.300> two

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
that's 13 13 of these blocks of two

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.440 
that's 13 13 of these blocks of two
you're<00:04:30.979> actually<00:04:31.100> going<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.669> take<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.210> and

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
you're actually going to take it and

you're actually going to take it and
you're<00:04:33.080> going<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.260> press<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.770> seams<00:04:35.740> towards

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
you're going to press the seams towards

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.940 
you're going to press the seams towards
the<00:04:36.979> printed<00:04:37.280> pieces<00:04:37.490> there<00:04:38.450> we<00:04:38.570> go<00:04:38.720> so<00:04:39.710> it<00:04:39.800> all

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
the printed pieces there we go so it all

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.230 
the printed pieces there we go so it all
seems<00:04:40.280> are<00:04:40.430> going<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.639> be<00:04:40.729> towards<00:04:41.090> the

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
seems are going to be towards the
