00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
around 4,400 pounds so even though it is

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.470 
around 4,400 pounds so even though it is

the result of all that mass reduction is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.340 
the result of all that mass reduction is
dramatically<00:01:02.760> improved<00:01:02.940> fuel<00:01:03.600> economy<00:01:03.780> the
