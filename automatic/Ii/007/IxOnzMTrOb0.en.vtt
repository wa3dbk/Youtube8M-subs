different<00:00:53.070> buildings<00:00:54.230> how<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.289> bring<00:00:55.469> them

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
different buildings how to bring them

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.639 
different buildings how to bring them
down<00:00:55.590> lad<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.219> properly<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.879> safely

something<00:02:44.780> perfectly<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.320> building<00:02:45.650> but<00:02:45.920> if

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
something perfectly to building but if

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.520 
something perfectly to building but if
we<00:02:46.459> train<00:02:46.760> now<00:02:47.000> hopefully<00:02:47.780> someday<00:02:48.140> what's

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
we train now hopefully someday what's

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.010 
we train now hopefully someday what's
the<00:02:48.650> last<00:02:48.799> thing<00:02:48.920> between<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.400> Jeff

something<00:03:12.460> we're<00:03:13.030> doing<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.390> lot<00:03:13.900> more<00:03:13.930> with

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
something we're doing a lot more with

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.200 
something we're doing a lot more with
less<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:15.100> know<00:03:15.190> putting<00:03:15.460> ourselves<00:03:15.610> in<00:03:16.000> more
