00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
and if we wasn't going fast enough to

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.659 
and if we wasn't going fast enough to
the<00:04:15.060> dude<00:04:15.270> threw<00:04:15.630> him<00:04:15.870> out<00:04:16.080> too<00:04:16.440> mad<00:04:17.370> that<00:04:17.609> day

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.760 
the dude threw him out too mad that day
I<00:04:17.820> probably<00:04:18.090> threw<00:04:18.450> him<00:04:18.600> first<00:04:18.870> because<00:04:19.080> if

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
I probably threw him first because if

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.650 
I probably threw him first because if
you<00:04:20.010> throw<00:04:20.220> him<00:04:20.459> they've<00:04:20.910> tightened<00:04:21.299> might

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
you throw him they've tightened might

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.480 
you throw him they've tightened might
stop<00:04:22.020> to<00:04:22.290> eat<00:04:22.320> him<00:04:22.770> for<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.070> minute

stop to eat him for a minute

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.250
