another episode of Minecraft
myth-busting<00:00:04.560> today's<00:00:05.160> myth<00:00:05.490> may<00:00:05.730> be<00:00:05.790> one

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
myth-busting today's myth may be one

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.000 
myth-busting today's myth may be one
that<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.270> actually<00:00:06.450> started<00:00:07.020> myself<00:00:07.560> in<00:00:07.830> my

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
that I actually started myself in my

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.799 
that I actually started myself in my
hermit<00:00:08.280> craft<00:00:08.519> LP<00:00:08.880> I've<00:00:09.120> been<00:00:09.330> saying<00:00:09.660> that

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
hermit craft LP I've been saying that

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.959 
hermit craft LP I've been saying that
the<00:00:09.990> protection<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:10.679> charmin<00:00:11.070> absorbs<00:00:11.820> the

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
the protection in charmin absorbs the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.240 
the protection in charmin absorbs the
damage<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> durability<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
damage in to the durability so the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.980 
damage in to the durability so the
higher<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.460> protection<00:00:15.089> level<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.780> less

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
higher the protection level is the less

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.779 
higher the protection level is the less
damage<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.529> will<00:00:16.619> take<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:17.369> at<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> same

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
damage you will take but at the same

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.150 
damage you will take but at the same
time<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.240> will<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.420> more<00:00:18.690> durability

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
time you will have more durability

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.050 
time you will have more durability

enchantment<00:00:21.270> now<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> have<00:00:22.470> been<00:00:22.650> challenged

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
enchantment now I have been challenged

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.099 
enchantment now I have been challenged
in<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> comments<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.910> my<00:00:24.060> videos<00:00:24.420> about<00:00:24.630> this

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
in the comments of my videos about this

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.380 
in the comments of my videos about this
another<00:00:25.740> user<00:00:26.039> supposedly<00:00:26.789> has<00:00:26.970> done<00:00:27.150> some

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
another user supposedly has done some

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.000 
another user supposedly has done some
tests<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:27.869> proved<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.410> am<00:00:28.619> wrong<00:00:28.830> and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
tests and proved that I am wrong and

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.580 
tests and proved that I am wrong and
I'll<00:00:29.429> happily<00:00:29.730> omit<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.539> feat<00:00:30.750> if<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.289> see

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
I'll happily omit the feat if I can see

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.770 
I'll happily omit the feat if I can see
the<00:00:31.769> same<00:00:31.980> results<00:00:32.399> myself<00:00:32.579> now<00:00:33.480> where<00:00:33.690> did

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the same results myself now where did

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.389 
the same results myself now where did
all<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.170> start<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.739> am<00:00:34.829> fairly<00:00:35.100> sure<00:00:35.219> I

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
all of this start I am fairly sure I

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.430 
all of this start I am fairly sure I
heard<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> video<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.420> another<00:00:36.600> youtuber

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
heard in the video of another youtuber

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.380 
heard in the video of another youtuber
and<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:38.070> seems<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.489> be<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.820> based<00:00:39.149> off<00:00:39.329> of

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and it seems to be so based off of

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.600 
and it seems to be so based off of
observations<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.469> how<00:00:40.649> quickly<00:00:40.950> armor<00:00:41.460> would

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
observations of how quickly armor would

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.280 
observations of how quickly armor would
deteriorate<00:00:42.149> with<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> protection

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
deteriorate with the protection

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.319 
deteriorate with the protection
enchantment<00:00:43.860> by<00:00:44.219> never<00:00:44.460> actually<00:00:44.640> tested

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
enchantment by never actually tested

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.270 
enchantment by never actually tested
their<00:00:45.539> theory<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.890> course<00:00:47.100> what

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
their theory so this is of course what

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.220 
their theory so this is of course what
we<00:00:47.399> are<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.969> doing<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.960> episode

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
we are going to be doing in this episode

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.069 
we are going to be doing in this episode
so<00:00:49.800> around<00:00:50.670> me<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> testing<00:00:51.539> area<00:00:51.690> from

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so around me is the testing area from

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
so around me is the testing area from
our<00:00:52.320> episode<00:00:52.829> about<00:00:53.160> what<00:00:53.370> damage<00:00:53.699> types<00:00:54.000> we

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
our episode about what damage types we

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.240 
our episode about what damage types we
can<00:00:54.420> block<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> sword<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.500> using<00:00:56.129> this

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
can block with a sword and using this

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.250 
can block with a sword and using this
area<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.789> expose<00:00:57.300> myself<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.870> different

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
area I can expose myself to different

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.049 
area I can expose myself to different
types<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.590> damage<00:00:58.829> when<00:00:59.430> wearing<00:00:59.730> both

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
types of damage when wearing both

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.420 
types of damage when wearing both
protection<00:01:00.660> 1<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.079> protection<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.250> make

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
protection 1 and protection for to make

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.429 
protection 1 and protection for to make
a<00:01:02.579> comparison<00:01:03.120> now<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.809> course<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.260> will<00:01:04.350> be

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
a comparison now of course I will be

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.320 
a comparison now of course I will be
exposing<00:01:04.799> myself<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.460> equal<00:01:05.880> amounts<00:01:06.210> of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
exposing myself to equal amounts of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.240 
exposing myself to equal amounts of
damage<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> take<00:01:07.860> me<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> while

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
damage and it's going to take me a while

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.070 
damage and it's going to take me a while
to<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
to do all of that so like in the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
to do all of that so like in the
previous<00:01:10.439> episodes<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.310> cast<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.850> vote<00:01:12.000> on

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
previous episodes you can cast a vote on

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.149 
previous episodes you can cast a vote on
what<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.540> think<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.990> outcome<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.070> to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
what you think the outcome is going to

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.660 
what you think the outcome is going to
be<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:16.110> I've<00:01:16.229> finished<00:01:16.439> doing<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:16.830> testing<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
be so I've finished doing my testing and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.219 
be so I've finished doing my testing and
I've<00:01:17.759> got<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.060> say<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.630> into<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.020> one<00:01:19.200> I

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
I've got to say going into this one I

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.719 
I've got to say going into this one I
was<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.799> confident<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.400> was<00:01:20.549> right

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
was really confident that I was right

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.999 
was really confident that I was right
turns<00:01:21.390> out<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.810> was<00:01:21.990> completely<00:01:22.350> wrong<00:01:22.590> so

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
turns out that I was completely wrong so

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.530 
turns out that I was completely wrong so
what<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.220> did<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.549> my<00:01:23.610> testing<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.420> went

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
what I did for my testing is I went

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.149 
what I did for my testing is I went
around<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.080> these<00:01:25.200> different<00:01:25.650> types

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
around to all of these different types

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.679 
around to all of these different types
of<00:01:26.369> damage<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.119> set<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.479> for

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
of damage that we have set up here for

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.840 
of damage that we have set up here for
testing<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.530> I've<00:01:28.950> done<00:01:29.100> an<00:01:29.250> equal<00:01:29.520> amount<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
testing and I've done an equal amount of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.969 
testing and I've done an equal amount of
damage<00:01:30.180> when<00:01:30.509> wearing<00:01:30.780> protection<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.650> as<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
damage when wearing protection one as I

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.039 
damage when wearing protection one as I
did<00:01:32.159> when<00:01:32.310> wearing<00:01:32.549> protection<00:01:32.880> 4<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> at<00:01:33.900> no

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
did when wearing protection 4 and at no

did when wearing protection 4 and at no
point<00:01:34.259> did<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.530> ever<00:01:34.680> see<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> discrepancy<00:01:35.490> in

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
point did I ever see a discrepancy in

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.460 
point did I ever see a discrepancy in
the<00:01:36.030> amount<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.479> durability<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.290> was

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the amount of durability that was

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.950 
the amount of durability that was
effected<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.130> these<00:01:38.729> items<00:01:39.210> now<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.689> thing<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
effected on these items now one thing I

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.200 
effected on these items now one thing I
did<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> health<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.189> damage<00:01:41.549> that

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
did see was the health the damage that

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.219 
did see was the health the damage that
was<00:01:42.299> done<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.540> your<00:01:42.810> health<00:01:43.020> would<00:01:43.170> be

affected<00:01:43.799> obviously<00:01:43.920> by<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.090> protection

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
affected obviously by what protection

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.840 
affected obviously by what protection
level<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.930> had<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> decided<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.700> take

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
level you had on now I decided to take

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.280 
level you had on now I decided to take
this<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.030> step<00:01:48.299> further<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.810> do<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.079> with

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
this a step further and do this with

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.200 
this a step further and do this with
damage<00:01:49.619> specific<00:01:50.159> enchantments<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:50.850> example

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
damage specific enchantments for example

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.210 
damage specific enchantments for example
we<00:01:51.299> got<00:01:51.390> further<00:01:51.630> falling<00:01:52.079> here<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.439> over<00:01:53.130> in

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
we got further falling here and over in

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.219 
we got further falling here and over in
these<00:01:53.369> chests<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.090> have<00:01:54.360> projectile

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
these chests we have projectile

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.649 
these chests we have projectile

protection<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.320> saw<00:01:58.530> exactly<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.189> same

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
protection and I saw exactly the same

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.249 
protection and I saw exactly the same
results<00:01:59.820> with<00:01:59.969> those<00:02:00.149> as<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.810> did<00:02:00.990> with<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
results with those as I did with the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.560 
results with those as I did with the
regular<00:02:01.890> protection<00:02:02.460> now<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.149> did<00:02:03.390> learn

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
regular protection now what I did learn

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.969 
regular protection now what I did learn
when<00:02:03.780> doing<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.680> there<00:02:04.860> are

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
when doing this is that there are

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.830 
when doing this is that there are
certain<00:02:05.310> types<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.850> damage<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.600> don't

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
certain types of damage that don't

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.190 
certain types of damage that don't
affect<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.259> durability<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:08.129> your<00:02:08.849> items<00:02:09.270> so

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
affect the durability of your items so

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290 
affect the durability of your items so
being<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.800> fire<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.640> those<00:02:11.760> now<00:02:12.030> if<00:02:12.180> you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
being on fire is one of those now if you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.940 
being on fire is one of those now if you
stand<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.810> top<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.050> fire<00:02:13.319> like<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.530> over

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
stand on top of fire like that over

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.199 
stand on top of fire like that over
there<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.250> will<00:02:14.370> take<00:02:14.550> damage<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.150> would

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
there you will take damage that would

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.660 
there you will take damage that would
cause<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.319> durability<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.099> lower<00:02:17.310> on<00:02:17.520> your

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
cause the durability to lower on your

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.030 
cause the durability to lower on your
items<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.720> being<00:02:18.989> on<00:02:19.140> fire<00:02:19.349> itself<00:02:19.709> doesn't

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
items but being on fire itself doesn't

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.119 
items but being on fire itself doesn't
actually<00:02:20.250> affect<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.599> durability<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.590> so

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
actually affect that durability and so

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.740 
actually affect that durability and so
other<00:02:23.310> ones<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.760> list<00:02:24.090> are<00:02:24.300> poison

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
other ones on that list are poison

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.369 
other ones on that list are poison
you've<00:02:25.470> got<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.680> river<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.580> river<00:02:26.730> effect

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
you've got the river so the river effect

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.869 
you've got the river so the river effect
starvation<00:02:28.379> falling<00:02:29.340> damage<00:02:29.670> which<00:02:29.849> is

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
starvation falling damage which is

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.940 
starvation falling damage which is
interesting<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.750> also<00:02:30.930> tested<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.709> one

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
interesting and I also tested that one

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.890 
interesting and I also tested that one
with<00:02:32.130> further<00:02:32.310> falling<00:02:32.760> as<00:02:32.880> well<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.660> when<00:02:33.870> you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
with further falling as well so when you

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.390 
with further falling as well so when you
fall<00:02:34.200> from<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.470> high<00:02:34.590> distance<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.190> further

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
fall from a high distance with further

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.770 
fall from a high distance with further
falling<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.060> doesn't<00:02:36.239> affect<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
falling on it doesn't affect the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.740 
falling on it doesn't affect the
durability<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.530> that<00:02:37.950> item<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.790> slightest

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
durability of that item in the slightest

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.920 
durability of that item in the slightest
so<00:02:40.349> drowning<00:02:40.860> suffocation<00:02:41.280> damage<00:02:42.150> potions

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930

and enderpearls or the other ones as
well<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:44.910> another<00:02:45.180> interesting<00:02:45.360> one<00:02:45.870> there

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
well so another interesting one there

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.259 
well so another interesting one there
throwing<00:02:46.769> an<00:02:47.010> ender<00:02:47.340> pearl<00:02:47.549> will<00:02:47.730> not<00:02:47.880> affect

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
throwing an ender pearl will not affect

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.420 
throwing an ender pearl will not affect
the<00:02:49.080> further<00:02:49.530> falling<00:02:49.860> at<00:02:49.950> all<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.310> show

a<00:03:09.930> cactus<00:03:10.170> all<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.709> those<00:03:10.829> will<00:03:11.130> affect<00:03:11.819> the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
a cactus all of those will affect the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.120 
a cactus all of those will affect the
durability<00:03:12.329> of<00:03:12.750> your<00:03:13.230> item<00:03:13.530> now<00:03:13.680> all<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:14.010> these

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
durability of your item now all of these

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.009 
durability of your item now all of these
will<00:03:14.310> do<00:03:14.430> just<00:03:14.670> one<00:03:14.940> piece<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.209> damage<00:03:15.810> one

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
will do just one piece of damage one

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.630 
will do just one piece of damage one
piece<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.349> durability<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.190> each<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.519> those

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
piece of durability to each of those

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.090 
piece of durability to each of those
each<00:03:18.329> time<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.810> are<00:03:18.840> damaged<00:03:19.290> by<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:19.920> for

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
each time you are damaged by it so for

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.240 
each time you are damaged by it so for
example<00:03:20.519> standing<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.630> cactus<00:03:22.069> causes<00:03:23.069> you

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
example standing in a cactus causes you

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.069 
example standing in a cactus causes you
to<00:03:23.280> take<00:03:23.459> damage<00:03:23.639> quite<00:03:24.209> fast<00:03:24.480> each<00:03:24.750> one<00:03:24.989> of

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
to take damage quite fast each one of

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.379 
to take damage quite fast each one of
those<00:03:25.170> will<00:03:25.470> do<00:03:25.760> durability<00:03:26.760> damage<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.299> as

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
those will do durability damage and as

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.479 
those will do durability damage and as
you<00:03:27.540> can<00:03:27.720> see<00:03:27.989> there<00:03:28.319> now<00:03:28.889> there<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.130> only<00:03:29.250> one

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
you can see there now there is only one

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.640 
you can see there now there is only one
type<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.790> damage<00:03:30.209> in<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.630> game<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.350> affects

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
type of damage in the game that affects

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.840 
type of damage in the game that affects
your<00:03:31.859> ability<00:03:31.980> different<00:03:32.639> and<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.790> is

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
your ability different and that is

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.000 
your ability different and that is
explosion<00:03:33.540> so<00:03:33.780> over<00:03:34.049> here<00:03:34.200> is<00:03:34.350> where<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.560> tested

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
explosion so over here is where I tested

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.210 
explosion so over here is where I tested
creepers<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.579> also<00:03:36.480> TNT<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.380> based<00:03:37.859> on<00:03:38.069> your

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
creepers and also TNT and based on your

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.729 
creepers and also TNT and based on your
proximity<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.269> creeper<00:03:39.660> explosion<00:03:40.319> or

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
proximity to the creeper explosion or

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.620 
proximity to the creeper explosion or
the<00:03:40.769> TNT<00:03:41.340> explosion<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:42.060> does<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.239> different

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
the TNT explosion it does a different

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.910 
the TNT explosion it does a different
amount<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.930> damage<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.440> ranges<00:03:43.859> from

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
amount of damage and that ranges from

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.830 
amount of damage and that ranges from
one<00:03:44.340> all<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.060> way<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.180> when<00:03:45.480> you're<00:03:45.600> standing

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
one all the way to when you're standing

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.360 
one all the way to when you're standing
right<00:03:46.170> where<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.410> explosion<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:47.069> where<00:03:47.280> it

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
right where the explosion is where it

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.640 
right where the explosion is where it
can<00:03:47.489> do<00:03:47.639> up<00:03:47.819> to<00:03:48.000> seven<00:03:48.329> points<00:03:48.630> of<00:03:48.750> durability

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
can do up to seven points of durability

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.670 
can do up to seven points of durability
damage<00:03:50.299> so<00:03:51.299> when<00:03:51.510> doing<00:03:51.690> my<00:03:51.870> testing<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.470> had<00:03:52.650> a

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
damage so when doing my testing I had a

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.410 
damage so when doing my testing I had a
feeling<00:03:53.100> of<00:03:53.280> deja<00:03:53.519> vu<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:53.910> that's<00:03:54.120> because<00:03:54.299> we

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
feeling of deja vu and that's because we

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.449 
feeling of deja vu and that's because we
actually<00:03:54.870> covered<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.350> bit<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.829> this<00:03:56.069> topic

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
actually covered a bit of this topic

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.580 
actually covered a bit of this topic
before<00:03:56.639> we<00:03:56.880> did<00:03:57.120> do<00:03:57.269> an<00:03:57.389> episode<00:03:57.690> on<00:03:58.109> item

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
before we did do an episode on item

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.559 
before we did do an episode on item
durability<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.579> what<00:03:59.790> types<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.239> damage

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
durability and what types of damage

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.300 
durability and what types of damage
affect<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.230> but<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.769> course<00:04:01.980> what<00:04:02.160> we've

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
affect it but of course what we've

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.770 
affect it but of course what we've
learned<00:04:02.579> in<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:02.940> episode<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.750> that

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
learned in this episode is that

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.839 
learned in this episode is that
enchantments<00:04:04.440> have<00:04:04.560> no<00:04:04.739> bearing<00:04:05.160> on<00:04:05.250> that

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
enchantments have no bearing on that

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.240 
enchantments have no bearing on that
whatsoever<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.440> only<00:04:07.680> enchantment<00:04:08.220> that

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
whatsoever and the only enchantment that

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.620 
whatsoever and the only enchantment that
is<00:04:08.400> an<00:04:08.489> exception<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.150> rule<00:04:09.269> would<00:04:09.599> be

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
is an exception to that rule would be

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.449 
is an exception to that rule would be
I'm<00:04:09.930> breaking<00:04:10.349> of<00:04:10.500> course<00:04:10.680> with<00:04:10.919> I'm<00:04:11.040> breaking

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
I'm breaking of course with I'm breaking

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.729 
I'm breaking of course with I'm breaking
on<00:04:11.609> an<00:04:11.730> item<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.180> means<00:04:12.359> every<00:04:12.660> time<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:13.380> takes

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
on an item it means every time it takes

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.740 
on an item it means every time it takes
durability<00:04:14.340> damage<00:04:14.730> there<00:04:14.940> is<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.120> chance<00:04:15.569> that

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
durability damage there is a chance that

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.610 
durability damage there is a chance that
that<00:04:16.049> will<00:04:16.229> be<00:04:16.410> ignored<00:04:17.660> so<00:04:18.660> last<00:04:18.930> episode<00:04:19.470> we

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
that will be ignored so last episode we

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.560 
that will be ignored so last episode we
covered<00:04:19.950> mob<00:04:20.130> spawning<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:20.849> if<00:04:21.000> light<00:04:21.269> levels

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
covered mob spawning and if light levels

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.330 
covered mob spawning and if light levels
below<00:04:21.810> seven<00:04:22.349> would<00:04:22.470> affect<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.979> rates<00:04:23.159> at

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
below seven would affect the rates at

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.680 
below seven would affect the rates at
which<00:04:23.370> those<00:04:23.669> mobs<00:04:24.000> spawn<00:04:24.330> at<00:04:24.479> which<00:04:24.659> of
