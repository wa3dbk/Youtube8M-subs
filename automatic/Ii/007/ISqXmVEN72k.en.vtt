00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.910 
from the water in our body why not use
that<00:01:59.079> kind<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.469> energy<00:01:59.619> one<00:01:59.890> is<00:02:00.009> available<00:02:01.920> so

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
that kind of energy one is available so

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.219 
that kind of energy one is available so
in<00:02:03.159> a<00:02:03.250> house<00:02:03.430> with<00:02:03.670> ocean<00:02:04.000> view<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.810> was<00:02:05.079> the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
in a house with ocean view it was the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.709 
in a house with ocean view it was the
3rd<00:02:05.500> days<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.549> was<00:02:06.610> really<00:02:06.820> experiment<00:02:07.509> it

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
3rd days and it was really experiment it

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.960 
3rd days and it was really experiment it
was<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:07.990> really<00:02:08.470> important<00:02:08.950> thing<00:02:08.979> it<00:02:09.489> came

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
was a really important thing it came

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.569 
was a really important thing it came
just<00:02:10.000> after<00:02:10.450> September<00:02:11.049> 11<00:02:11.530> when<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.160> think<00:02:12.489> the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
just after September 11 when I think the

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.420 
just after September 11 when I think the
American<00:02:13.060> public<00:02:13.420> becomes<00:02:14.140> vulnerable<00:02:14.290> in<00:02:14.890> a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
American public becomes vulnerable in a

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.009 
American public becomes vulnerable in a
different<00:02:15.880> way<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.329> I<00:02:16.480> never<00:02:16.630> left<00:02:16.870> the

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
different way and I never left the

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.690 
different way and I never left the
gallery<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.530> know<00:02:17.650> for<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:17.890> 12<00:02:18.130> days<00:02:18.160> so

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
gallery you know for the 12 days so

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.880 
gallery you know for the 12 days so
experimental<00:02:19.120> this<00:02:19.750> if<00:02:20.079> I<00:02:20.260> don't<00:02:20.500> eat<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.859> I

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
experimental this if I don't eat and I

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.440 
experimental this if I don't eat and I
don't<00:02:20.950> talk<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.579> I<00:02:21.670> purely<00:02:21.910> for<00:02:22.030> myself

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
don't talk and I purely for myself

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.270 
don't talk and I purely for myself
without<00:02:22.630> eating<00:02:23.049> anything<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:23.799> during<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.070> pure

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
without eating anything so during a pure

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.729 
without eating anything so during a pure
water<00:02:24.549> can<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.359> provide<00:02:25.870> space<00:02:26.200> in<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.470> way

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
water can I provide space in this way

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.250 
water can I provide space in this way
and<00:02:26.920> can<00:02:27.160> me<00:02:27.549> and<00:02:27.790> space<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.420> actually<00:02:28.870> change

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
and can me and space can actually change

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.830 
and can me and space can actually change
kind<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.890> molecular<00:02:30.519> structure<00:02:31.329> of<00:02:31.359> the<00:02:31.660> other

kind of molecular structure of the other

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.440 
kind of molecular structure of the other

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
and the energy that the public will come

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.870 
and the energy that the public will come
and<00:02:34.720> there<00:02:34.959> will<00:02:35.079> be<00:02:35.109> there<00:02:35.410> just<00:02:35.620> for<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.980> short

and there will be there just for a short

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.759 
and there will be there just for a short
period<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.329> time<00:02:37.389> or<00:02:37.780> longer<00:02:38.169> period<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.530> time

and just be with me and the public
really<00:02:41.019> complete<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.470> work

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
really complete the work

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.589 
really complete the work
my<00:02:42.500> work<00:02:42.770> is<00:02:43.010> very<00:02:43.280> long<00:02:43.730> durational<00:02:44.209> lately

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
my work is very long durational lately

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.540 
my work is very long durational lately
takes<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.140> long<00:02:45.260> time<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.680> very<00:02:46.040> little<00:02:46.220> taste

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
takes a long time and very little taste

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.360 
takes a long time and very little taste
is<00:02:46.730> happening<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.530> mean<00:02:48.530> when<00:02:49.220> you're

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
is happening and that mean when you're

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.580 
is happening and that mean when you're
dealing<00:02:49.610> with<00:02:49.790> almost<00:02:50.180> nothing<00:02:50.450> that's<00:02:51.349> the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
dealing with almost nothing that's the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.070 
dealing with almost nothing that's the
really<00:02:51.860> point<00:02:52.129> because<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.330> everybody

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
really point because the everybody

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.360 
really point because the everybody
wanted<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.590> have<00:02:54.709> this<00:02:55.269> how<00:02:56.269> you<00:02:56.330> call<00:02:57.250> kind<00:02:58.250> of

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
wanted to have this how you call kind of

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.809 
wanted to have this how you call kind of
a<00:02:58.750> big<00:02:59.750> big<00:03:00.290> concept<00:03:00.860> when<00:03:01.099> many<00:03:01.400> things<00:03:01.640> are

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
a big big concept when many things are

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.699 
a big big concept when many things are
happening<00:03:01.940> but<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:03.050> many<00:03:03.349> things<00:03:03.560> are

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
happening but this many things are

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.440 
happening but this many things are
happening<00:03:03.800> is<00:03:04.220> just<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.489> security<00:03:04.819> that<00:03:05.300> you

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
happening is just a security that you

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.360 
happening is just a security that you
hide<00:03:05.720> yourself<00:03:05.900> between<00:03:06.530> objects<00:03:07.010> between

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
hide yourself between objects between

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.720 
hide yourself between objects between
ideas<00:03:08.090> between<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.540> don't<00:03:08.870> know<00:03:08.959> all<00:03:09.170> kinds<00:03:09.560> of

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
ideas between I don't know all kinds of

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.280 
ideas between I don't know all kinds of
ideas<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:11.530> wanted<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.620> expose<00:03:12.980> actually<00:03:14.290> just

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
ideas you wanted to expose actually just

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.190 
ideas you wanted to expose actually just
being<00:03:15.560> present<00:03:15.830> as<00:03:16.280> an<00:03:16.970> artist<00:03:17.390> in<00:03:17.599> the<00:03:17.900> space

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
being present as an artist in the space

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.680 
being present as an artist in the space
with<00:03:18.799> for<00:03:19.069> consciousness<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:20.329> your

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
with for consciousness and and your

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.839 
with for consciousness and and your
attitude<00:03:21.290> with<00:03:21.470> your<00:03:21.590> body<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.040> I'm<00:03:22.250> telling

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
attitude with your body and I'm telling

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.699 
attitude with your body and I'm telling
the<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.599> minimum<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.140> meaning<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.530> that's

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
the the minimum the meaning and that's

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.680 
the the minimum the meaning and that's
the<00:03:24.829> most<00:03:24.980> difficult<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.610> this<00:03:26.030> is<00:03:26.180> my

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
the most difficult and this is my

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.300 
the most difficult and this is my
process<00:03:27.110> always<00:03:27.290> start<00:03:27.620> which<00:03:27.769> is<00:03:27.920> very<00:03:28.099> very

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
process always start which is very very

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.640 
process always start which is very very
complicated<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:29.120> then<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.510> strip<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.959> that<00:03:30.140> to

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
complicated and then I strip to that to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.030 
complicated and then I strip to that to
the<00:03:30.799> just<00:03:31.190> bare<00:03:31.599> bare<00:03:32.599> you<00:03:33.200> know<00:03:33.410> idea<00:03:33.799> and

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
the just bare bare you know idea and

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.850 
the just bare bare you know idea and
that's<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:34.970> my<00:03:35.390> kind<00:03:35.690> of<00:03:35.840> formula<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.650> could

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
that's it so my kind of formula I could

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.770 
that's it so my kind of formula I could
say<00:03:37.069> that<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.400> for<00:03:37.700> me<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.209> performance<00:03:38.840> is

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
say that the for me the performance is

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.110 
say that the for me the performance is
mental<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:41.959> physical<00:03:42.349> structure<00:03:43.130> which<00:03:43.940> you

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
mental and physical structure which you

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.360 
mental and physical structure which you
create<00:03:44.599> in<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.650> front<00:03:45.920> of<00:03:46.099> the<00:03:46.190> audience<00:03:46.489> in<00:03:46.970> a

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
create in the front of the audience in a

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.550 
create in the front of the audience in a
fixed<00:03:49.370> time<00:03:49.609> in<00:03:49.880> space<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:51.049> know<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.410> you

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
fixed time in space you know and you

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.620 
fixed time in space you know and you
enter<00:03:51.950> into<00:03:52.069> that<00:03:52.310> construction<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.090> then

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
enter into that construction and then
