00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.030
 now it's passion for motor tb the ends 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.830
 of revision of a very charismatic model 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.490
 for us Mexicans to whom 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.289
 it touched us in its moment or live it or see it 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.750
 now yes that as a recent model 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.760
 we're practically talking about r 5 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.770
 shoe that as it was commonly 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.650
 known the call of love in Mexico 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.630
 it was a model dies of new ones more 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.940
 contacts made in our country in your 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.430
 epoch us in our 80s and late the 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.039
 70 on this occasion it is not 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.769
 offering what is the version to 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:45.280
 tank to the most powerful by the end of the 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:49.329
 70s this one had a 1.4 engine 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:53.079
 liters and 93 horses and good will be the most 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.149
 powerful let's say from that moment in the 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.309
 range r 5 and it was a little bit the 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.460
 answer something that happened with the 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.010
 volkswagen golf gti that well then here 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.140
 we know as Caribbean in this model in 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.990
 concrete then without and we will remember good 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.690
 appeared from 1972 in france 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.300
 as a substitute for r4 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.980
 and good among its innovations that it had and 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.630
 it was very much like that it is a snag for him 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.130
 for the car that was the first 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.230
 model practically they had the 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.240
 defenses in plastic and many are 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.610
 it was fragile but since it will be all 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.090
 used to the mastodons to the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.100
 cars with them completely metal 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.440
 and in this case well, part of the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.550
 lightness of the car because it also lies 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.220
 in which they began to occupy 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.010
 plastics practically in one of the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.870
 initiators of the plastic cam 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.060
 of the cars that are practically all 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.550
 the cars already come that well in this 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.430
 case and in the nine model we have what 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.890
 which is the opening of what the chest is 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.900
 and the doors the trunk does not open it 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.690
 It was a piece that was also very 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.030
 in the original model was a part that 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.210
 there was very limited and apparently 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.240
 that's why he has not decided not to have this 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.149
 opening of this part remember that 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.040
 the French models have to do 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.000
 very special in terms of their 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.950
 characteristics usually find 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.620
 so differentiated solutions sometimes 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.659
 for the same purpose unlike others 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.700
 American German action models 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:27.159
 here we have what is the opening of the 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.109
 chest that is against wind the engine 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.819
 it comes very well detailed as it has us 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.180
 accustomed 9 lately that is 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.290
 I work in a very good quality 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.629
 we are really talking a level 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.300
 close to what is a mini chance a 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.310
 auto let's say basic 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.830
 the opening of doors so good is a 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.800
 the most basic is the leg of a rooster 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.200
 we have a feature that is 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.530
 consider that we have to express to 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.290
 half up that give you some true 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.670
 touch something that we liked about the model that 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.770
 it also replicates the movement of 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.840
 seats to the front to be able to 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.730
 enter the back that is what 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.740
 what happens in these cases no more like 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.050
 when we want to take companions 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.720
 all the interior as practical extension 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.090
 is well defined brings very good to 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.730
 quality belts are made in 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.990
 plastic what are we going to make of fabric there 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.690
 steering movement with the steering wheel 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:25.240
 of course connected to the 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.770
 the wheels is already more than common this in 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.200
 the bottom part there is practically no 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.750
 nothing different that we have some 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.520
 pieces to relief or separated that would be 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.140
 very well that they would raise it where there 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.380
 put some paint and they would have 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.080
 lifted the piece but a lot is what 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.520
 which is what corresponds to the model 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.430
 skulls headlights all those pieces 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.069
 separate are well made 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.459
 and the good model is now yes 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.950
 we are very well executed in everything 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.590
 its conception a part of this model r 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.010
 5 or the country is also making the 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.239
 most basic model of 72 s subsequently 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.730
 If we have the opportunity, what 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.840
 we will try to see if and how much 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.840
 changes relative thereto
