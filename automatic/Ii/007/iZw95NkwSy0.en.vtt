00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.289

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.410
 provide comfort 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.580
 I must immediately say that this basket is it 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.769
 demo ie bike goes 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.160
 no basket but it shows great 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.949
 how can it look like if you buy and food 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.890

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.780
 attention leather grips are all the details 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.200
 which distinguish this bike 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.260
 low class bike shock absorbing 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.719
 and I am a fork very correct fat 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.530
 tires for the city comfortable that is 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.770
 few 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.129
 Cherry shop and forks thick comfortable 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.430
 rubber adjustable takeaway by the corner of it 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.760
 you can change the angle all the time to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.120
 to alternate into an active fit and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.030
 comfortable switches all three 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.299
 speeds but what's the back wheel 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.150
 the planetary bushing is located 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:15.210
 the planetary sleeve is just with a huge 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.490
 a resource that is not afraid of water and dirt 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.490
 and everything else 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.560
 that is, many thousands of kilometers to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.840
 tens of thousands of kilometers you will forget 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.939
 was the service itself 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.400
 bicycle maintenance is a problem 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.290
 which limits women to 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.930
 using 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.200
 there is no problem here this 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.130
 the sleeve passes her guarantee of 10 thousand 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.140
 kilometers without any lubrication and 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.240
 bulkheads and in fact it represents 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.300
 at first glance, the usual sleeve is 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.300
 is a box of speeds 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.270
 which is enclosed within it all no 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.750
 inside there are no stars outside except 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.200
 one we do not see here what else is done 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.590
 for comfort, curved feathers on the frame give 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.490
 comfort shock absorbing pieces and gives comfort 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.950
 saddle with springs wide massive too 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.920
 gives comfort ie it is a bicycle 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.360
 uncompromising comfort wings from 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.880
 plastic and rubber mud flaps swing 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.520
 ki all this will not allow to get dirty 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.890
 and you know the bike you want 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.910

 never knew any problems man 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.040
 driving a bike like that 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.959
 i just like that i can say how 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.060
 it is a pity that he is not male because he 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.019
 goes but just divinely so 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.330
 cool rolls and switching 3 speeds 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.090
 The shaman's item delivers a tremendous 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.709
 pleasure no backlash no yes 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.959
 by the way the planetary bushing has another 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.860
 one advantage is the opportunity 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.140
 switch speeds right on the spot then 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.330
 there is no need to pedal to 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.690
 go to the transfer is something that is not 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.910
 say about external switches and 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.940
 stars that need to be scrolled to 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:18.140
 go to the next gear here 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.930

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.660
 cartridge carriage which is 10-20 thousand 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.819
 kilometers goes without maintenance and 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.359
 bulkheads 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:32.980
