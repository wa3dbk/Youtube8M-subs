00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.789
 one more workout shown to you 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:26.640
 the positioning today we are 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:32.040
 working here marking pass 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.230
 the drive then I did is 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.629
 divided into four circuits by the number 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.190
 students that I have an accent 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:45.030
 space for more space. 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.809
 square well enough space 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.320
 within two years the marking to create a 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.980
 Difficulty book also here the circuit 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.600
 2 square also with smaller space 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:09.930
 reduced space slightly better 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:14.310
 that you here the 50 38 orange with the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.759
 square also the space even more 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.750
 reduced than red and green and 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.750
 here the circuit 1 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:34.610
 or 4 or the smallest of all are easy and 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:40.579
 faster and with more quality and with 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.920
 bookmark just a good job in the 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.560
 The 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.039
 Do you have control part problem? 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.039
 ball 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.000
 the dollar 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:59.490
 helps improve pass speed 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.490
 the child thinking is smart 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:18.200
 you can vary the way you want more 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.940
 the g20 process over the internet to have 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.940
 helped share short videos 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.690
 thanks
