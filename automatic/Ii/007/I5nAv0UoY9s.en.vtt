2600 k intel processor so it's going to

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.959 
2600 k intel processor so it's going to
be<00:00:37.140> pretty<00:00:37.380> speedy<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.160> might<00:00:38.280> overclock<00:00:38.760> that

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
be pretty speedy it might overclock that

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.750 
below set that down I'm going out for
the<00:04:19.519> CPU<00:04:19.970> got<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.780> core<00:04:21.019> i7<00:04:22.270> 2600<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:25.550> I

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
the CPU got the core i7 2600 and I

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.720 
the CPU got the core i7 2600 and I
believe<00:04:26.060> this<00:04:26.240> can<00:04:26.450> go<00:04:26.630> up<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:27.370> 3.4<00:04:28.370> gigahertz

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
believe this can go up to 3.4 gigahertz

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.590 
believe this can go up to 3.4 gigahertz
and<00:04:29.720> I've<00:04:29.930> heard<00:04:30.110> this<00:04:30.310> this<00:04:31.310> can<00:04:31.490> be

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
and I've heard this this can be

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.690 
and I've heard this this can be
overclocked<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.630> about<00:04:33.020> 4.5<00:04:33.830> or<00:04:34.100> even<00:04:34.430> further

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
overclocked to about 4.5 or even further

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.640

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
clean energy to the computer be

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.590 
clean energy to the computer be
consistent<00:04:48.980> and<00:04:49.340> it's<00:04:49.580> rated<00:04:50.060> 80<00:04:50.300> plus<00:04:50.570> gold

which<00:04:51.139> is<00:04:51.260> great<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.790> little<00:04:52.790> bit<00:04:52.910> pricey<00:04:53.330> but<00:04:53.360> I

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
which is great a little bit pricey but I

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.890 
which is great a little bit pricey but I
figured<00:04:54.230> you<00:04:54.350> know<00:04:54.470> what<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:55.490> the<00:04:56.270> psu<00:04:56.660> will

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
figured you know what the the psu will

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.570 
figured you know what the the psu will
last<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.230> while<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:57.740> even<00:04:58.160> if<00:04:58.220> i<00:04:58.310> have<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.460> new

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
last a while so even if i have a new

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.180 
last a while so even if i have a new
computer<00:04:58.940> i<00:04:58.970> can<00:04:59.120> just<00:04:59.240> transfer<00:04:59.660> it<00:04:59.780> over

intention is kind of getting an SSD
later<00:05:13.490> on<00:05:13.700> kind<00:05:14.540> of<00:05:14.600> booting<00:05:14.930> them<00:05:14.990> together

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
later on kind of booting them together

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.510 
later on kind of booting them together
using<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:16.240> Intel<00:05:17.240> technology<00:05:17.870> that<00:05:18.080> supports

using the Intel technology that supports

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.020 
using the Intel technology that supports

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
camera what it's called rapid technology

camera what it's called rapid technology
whatever<00:05:23.450> where<00:05:23.810> it<00:05:23.930> kind<00:05:24.050> of<00:05:24.169> runs<00:05:24.440> it<00:05:24.650> much
