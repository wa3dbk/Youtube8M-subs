00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
enough me a chipped sorry made that's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.630 
enough me a chipped sorry made that's
certainly<00:01:16.620> the<00:01:16.770> argument<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.250> Allie

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640

Williams<00:01:18.120> was<00:01:18.210> trying<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.510> put<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:18.810> referee

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
Williams was trying to put to referee

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.160 
Williams was trying to put to referee
Steve<00:01:19.530> Walsh<00:01:19.860> there<00:01:20.160> and<00:01:20.370> it<00:01:20.430> was

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
Steve Walsh there and it was

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.480 
Steve Walsh there and it was
unintentional<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.320> they're<00:01:22.560> properly<00:01:22.950> had

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
unintentional and they're properly had

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.450 
unintentional and they're properly had
gone<00:01:23.760> down<00:01:24.060> well<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.680> anticipated

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
gone down well then the anticipated

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.300 
gone down well then the anticipated
light<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.820> was<00:01:26.910> going<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:27.180> be<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:28.070> referee<00:01:29.070> Walsh

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
light it was going to be a referee Walsh

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.580 
light it was going to be a referee Walsh
said<00:01:29.580> I've<00:01:29.790> given<00:01:30.060> him<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.390> yellow<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.320> that's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
said I've given him a yellow so that's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.560 
said I've given him a yellow so that's
probably<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> better<00:01:32.220> alternative<00:01:32.760> than<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
probably the better alternative than the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.740 
probably the better alternative than the
other<00:01:33.750> option<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.380> he<00:01:34.830> Williams<00:01:35.330> took<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:36.570> as

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
other option so he Williams took that as

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.020 
other option so he Williams took that as
read<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:38.070> certainly<00:01:38.340> don't<00:01:38.550> think<00:01:38.670> there

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
read and I certainly don't think there

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.510 
read and I certainly don't think there
was<00:01:39.150> an<00:01:39.300> teeth<00:01:39.570> beer<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.740> take<00:01:40.950> him<00:01:41.070> out<00:01:41.130> it's
