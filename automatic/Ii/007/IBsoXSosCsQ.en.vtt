iPhone so it wouldn't scratch your
device<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.830> anything<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.369> should<00:01:14.549> have

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
device or anything so you should have

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.370 
device or anything so you should have
any<00:01:14.760> problems<00:01:15.090> with<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.659> I'm<00:01:16.290> just

any problems with that and I'm just
going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.560> throw<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.979> nice<00:01:17.159> little<00:01:17.369> card

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
there slide in and probably should have

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.219 
there slide in and probably should have
put<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.150> before<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.450> put<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> iphone<00:01:22.049> in
