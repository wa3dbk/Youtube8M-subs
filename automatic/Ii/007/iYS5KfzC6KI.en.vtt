so<00:01:51.940> it's<00:01:52.060> basically<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.479> exact<00:01:53.080> same<00:01:53.409> I'll

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
so it's basically the exact same I'll

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.000 
so it's basically the exact same I'll
compare<00:01:54.640> them<00:01:54.760> side-by-side<00:01:55.560> except<00:01:56.560> now<00:01:56.950> the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
compare them side-by-side except now the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.940 
compare them side-by-side except now the
mouth<00:01:57.400> is<00:01:57.610> closed<00:01:58.299> instead<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.049> open<00:02:01.770> I'll<00:02:02.770> put

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
mouth is closed instead of open I'll put

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.230 
mouth is closed instead of open I'll put
the<00:02:03.070> helmet<00:02:03.310> back<00:02:03.490> on<00:02:03.610> there<00:02:03.850> so<00:02:04.000> you<00:02:04.060> can<00:02:04.150> get

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
the helmet back on there so you can get

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.320 
the helmet back on there so you can get
another<00:02:04.630> just<00:02:04.990> quick<00:02:05.920> look<00:02:06.189> at<00:02:06.369> that<00:02:06.909> minifig

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
another just quick look at that minifig

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.119 
another just quick look at that minifig
again<00:02:07.750> great<00:02:08.110> for<00:02:08.319> clone<00:02:08.470> army<00:02:08.679> building<00:02:08.950> and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
again great for clone army building and

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.350 
again great for clone army building and
just<00:02:09.280> cool<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:09.519> have<00:02:09.729> this<00:02:09.759> collection

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
just cool to have this collection

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.679 
just cool to have this collection
although<00:02:10.780> we<00:02:11.530> don't<00:02:11.650> really<00:02:11.920> see<00:02:12.689> airborne

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
although we don't really see airborne

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.509 
although we don't really see airborne
troopers<00:02:14.049> on<00:02:14.230> Geonosis<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.129> Clone<00:02:15.340> Wars

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
troopers on Geonosis and the Clone Wars

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.479 
troopers on Geonosis and the Clone Wars
or<00:02:15.849> in<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.450> movies<00:02:16.569> so<00:02:17.379> let's<00:02:17.920> get<00:02:18.129> back<00:02:18.340> to

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
or in the movies so let's get back to

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.099 
or in the movies so let's get back to
alright<00:02:18.819> so<00:02:19.030> back<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> main<00:02:19.659> part<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:19.989> the

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.109 
alright so back to the main part of the

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.170 
alright so back to the main part of the
set<00:02:20.290> which<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:20.889> the<00:02:21.159> Walker<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.730> this<00:02:21.909> is<00:02:22.060> the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
set which is the Walker and this is the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.300 
set which is the Walker and this is the
second<00:02:22.629> Walker<00:02:23.200> we've<00:02:23.469> gotten<00:02:23.739> in<00:02:23.889> a<00:02:24.010> battle

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
second Walker we've gotten in a battle

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.770 
second Walker we've gotten in a battle
pack<00:02:24.489> in<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.760> lego<00:02:25.150> star<00:02:25.329> wars<00:02:25.359> line

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
pack in the lego star wars line

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.449 
pack in the lego star wars line
and<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:26.200> got<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.500> say<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.770> one<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.160> lot

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
and I got to say this one is a lot

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.550 
and I got to say this one is a lot
better<00:02:27.670> than<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.060> first<00:02:28.180> one<00:02:28.330> we've<00:02:28.630> seen<00:02:28.870> has

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
better than the first one we've seen has

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.260 
better than the first one we've seen has
a<00:02:29.590> lot<00:02:29.920> more<00:02:29.950> detail<00:02:30.459> on<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.880> leg<00:02:31.060> design

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
a lot more detail on it the leg design

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.270 
a lot more detail on it the leg design
is<00:02:31.540> pretty<00:02:31.780> much<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.959> same<00:02:32.319> on<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:33.069> back<00:02:33.250> here

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
is pretty much the same on the back here

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.460 
is pretty much the same on the back here
we<00:02:33.580> do<00:02:33.730> have<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.880> large<00:02:34.240> antenna<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.020> then<00:02:35.410> we

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
we do have a large antenna and then we

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.650 
we do have a large antenna and then we
do<00:02:35.590> have<00:02:35.709> two<00:02:35.920> seats<00:02:36.160> for<00:02:36.459> some<00:02:36.610> clones<00:02:36.910> so

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
do have two seats for some clones so

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.690 
do have two seats for some clones so
I'll<00:02:37.990> take<00:02:38.530> an<00:02:38.650> airborne<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.250> just<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.490> regular

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
I'll take an airborne and just a regular

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.390 
I'll take an airborne and just a regular
Geonosis<00:02:40.390> super<00:02:40.720> take<00:02:41.530> out<00:02:41.680> their<00:02:41.860> blasters

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
Geonosis super take out their blasters

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.080 
Geonosis super take out their blasters
and<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:44.140> can<00:02:44.290> just<00:02:44.470> easily<00:02:44.800> sit<00:02:45.550> them<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:45.850> the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
and you can just easily sit them in the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.400 
and you can just easily sit them in the
cockpit<00:02:46.330> here<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:48.569> then<00:02:49.569> one<00:02:50.050> in<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.230> back

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
cockpit here and then one in the back

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.140 
cockpit here and then one in the back
and<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.680> can<00:02:50.860> face<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.220> one<00:02:51.430> forward<00:02:51.850> or<00:02:52.030> if

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
and you can face this one forward or if

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.210 
and you can face this one forward or if
you<00:02:52.239> want<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.450> face<00:02:52.569> them<00:02:52.780> behind<00:02:53.110> it's<00:02:53.800> really

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
you want to face them behind it's really

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.090 
you want to face them behind it's really
up<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.080> then<00:02:56.080> there<00:02:56.230> are<00:02:56.260> some<00:02:56.830> spots

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
up to you and then there are some spots

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.960 
up to you and then there are some spots
for<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:58.000> put<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.269> blasters<00:02:58.780> in<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.200> back<00:02:59.380> here

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
for to put the blasters in the back here

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.310 
for to put the blasters in the back here
which<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.120> really<00:03:01.330> nice<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.540> don't<00:03:01.810> lose<00:03:02.050> them

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
which is really nice you don't lose them

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.130 
which is really nice you don't lose them
so<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:02.650> can<00:03:02.800> either<00:03:02.950> face<00:03:03.250> them<00:03:03.459> backwards<00:03:03.850> or

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
so you can either face them backwards or

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.229 
so you can either face them backwards or
forwards<00:03:05.140> or<00:03:05.470> even<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.280> side<00:03:06.610> if<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.000> want

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
forwards or even to the side if you want

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.660 
forwards or even to the side if you want
if<00:03:08.080> you<00:03:08.200> want<00:03:08.410> them<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.830> be<00:03:09.130> shooting<00:03:09.550> out

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
if you want them to be shooting out

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.970 
if you want them to be shooting out
sideways<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.630> kind<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:10.840> looks<00:03:10.900> cool<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.440> you

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
sideways that kind of looks cool and you

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.830 
sideways that kind of looks cool and you
have<00:03:12.130> these<00:03:12.250> blasters<00:03:13.060> shields<00:03:13.420> right<00:03:13.569> here

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
have these blasters shields right here

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.570 
have these blasters shields right here
and<00:03:14.019> they<00:03:14.680> can<00:03:14.950> fold<00:03:15.310> all<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.790> way<00:03:16.150> out<00:03:16.510> and

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
and they can fold all the way out and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.130 
and they can fold all the way out and
with<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.610> person<00:03:19.030> in<00:03:19.180> there<00:03:19.330> that's<00:03:19.510> about<00:03:19.930> as

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
with a person in there that's about as

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.830 
with a person in there that's about as
far<00:03:20.380> as<00:03:20.620> they<00:03:20.830> can<00:03:20.890> come<00:03:21.280> in<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:21.970> wish<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.780> would

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
far as they can come in I wish it would

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.960 
far as they can come in I wish it would
have<00:03:22.959> put<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.440> little<00:03:23.709> one<00:03:23.950> of<00:03:24.069> those<00:03:24.220> on<00:03:24.580> the

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
have put a little one of those on the

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.699 
have put a little one of those on the
front<00:03:25.120> here<00:03:25.390> kind<00:03:25.660> of<00:03:25.690> protecting<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.380> front

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
front here kind of protecting the front

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.180 
front here kind of protecting the front
of<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:28.120> airborne<00:03:28.510> trooper<00:03:28.810> however<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.769> know

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
of the airborne trooper however I know

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.650 
of the airborne trooper however I know
they<00:03:30.459> are<00:03:30.489> limited<00:03:31.030> on<00:03:31.150> pieces<00:03:33.450> again<00:03:34.450> here's

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
they are limited on pieces again here's

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.690 
they are limited on pieces again here's
just<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.930> better<00:03:35.140> look<00:03:35.380> this<00:03:35.860> whole<00:03:36.100> part<00:03:36.430> does

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
just a better look this whole part does

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.150 
just a better look this whole part does
fold<00:03:37.060> down<00:03:37.269> so<00:03:37.540> if<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:37.720> want<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.709> be<00:03:38.799> easier

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
fold down so if you want it to be easier

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.130 
fold down so if you want it to be easier
when<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.400> put<00:03:39.610> in<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.970> pilot<00:03:40.450> you<00:03:40.810> can<00:03:40.959> fold

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
when you put in the pilot you can fold

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.930 
when you put in the pilot you can fold
this<00:03:41.290> down<00:03:41.350> there<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:41.829> no<00:03:42.130> control<00:03:42.579> panel

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
this down there is no control panel

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.280 
this down there is no control panel
unfortunately<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.690> would<00:03:43.780> have<00:03:43.930> been<00:03:43.989> nice<00:03:44.140> to

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
unfortunately it would have been nice to

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.259 
unfortunately it would have been nice to
get<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.440> sticker<00:03:44.739> there<00:03:44.950> but<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.940> guess<00:03:46.120> you

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
get a sticker there but I guess you

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.789 
get a sticker there but I guess you
could<00:03:46.299> technically<00:03:46.840> use<00:03:47.049> this<00:03:47.260> thing<00:03:47.530> as<00:03:47.739> a

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
could technically use this thing as a

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.690 
could technically use this thing as a
little<00:03:48.160> control<00:03:48.489> panel<00:03:50.160> like<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.250> said<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.579> leg

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
little control panel like I said the leg

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.120 
little control panel like I said the leg
design<00:03:51.880> is<00:03:52.209> basically<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.170> same<00:03:53.380> as<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.920> last

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
design is basically the same as the last

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.849 
design is basically the same as the last
Walker<00:03:54.519> however<00:03:55.420> this<00:03:55.660> one<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:55.930> notice<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.500> on<00:03:56.560> a

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
Walker however this one I notice is on a

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:58.860 
Walker however this one I notice is on a
little<00:03:57.340> bit<00:03:57.459> of<00:03:57.549> a<00:03:57.640> slant<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.329> can<00:03:58.510> kind<00:03:58.780> of

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
little bit of a slant you can kind of

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.449 
little bit of a slant you can kind of
see<00:03:58.930> it<00:03:59.109> there<00:03:59.350> I<00:03:59.590> don't<00:04:00.130> really<00:04:00.250> remember

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
see it there I don't really remember

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.530 
see it there I don't really remember
that<00:04:00.820> one<00:04:01.030> with<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.570> last<00:04:01.840> one<00:04:02.140> so<00:04:02.500> um<00:04:03.540> you

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
that one with the last one so um you

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.180 
that one with the last one so um you
can't<00:04:04.810> position<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.290> leg<00:04:05.440> so<00:04:05.620> differently<00:04:06.010> if

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
can't position the leg so differently if

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.039 
can't position the leg so differently if
you'd<00:04:06.370> like<00:04:06.640> so<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.180> guess<00:04:07.299> if<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:07.750> put<00:04:07.780> them

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
you'd like so I guess if you put them

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.270 
you'd like so I guess if you put them
straight<00:04:08.380> up<00:04:08.859> like<00:04:09.820> so<00:04:10.920> you<00:04:11.920> wouldn't<00:04:12.160> really

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
straight up like so you wouldn't really

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.000 
straight up like so you wouldn't really
see<00:04:12.609> a<00:04:12.790> slant<00:04:13.450> there<00:04:13.750> however<00:04:14.410> I<00:04:14.500> kind<00:04:14.799> of<00:04:14.829> like

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
see a slant there however I kind of like

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.729 
see a slant there however I kind of like
the<00:04:15.970> slanted<00:04:16.750> look<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.380> legs<00:04:18.810> so<00:04:19.810> on<00:04:20.560> the

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
the slanted look of the legs so on the

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.590 
the slanted look of the legs so on the
front<00:04:20.979> there's<00:04:21.160> this<00:04:21.280> new<00:04:21.729> turret<00:04:22.210> which<00:04:22.390> i

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
front there's this new turret which i

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.390 
front there's this new turret which i
think<00:04:22.660> is<00:04:22.960> just<00:04:23.229> awesome<00:04:23.830> lego<00:04:24.039> did<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:24.220> great

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
think is just awesome lego did a great

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.969 
think is just awesome lego did a great
job<00:04:24.430> again<00:04:25.180> sound<00:04:25.450> really<00:04:25.600> accurate<00:04:26.200> to<00:04:26.620> any

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
job again sound really accurate to any

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.620 
job again sound really accurate to any
Walker<00:04:27.310> I've<00:04:27.580> ever<00:04:27.789> seen<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.300> Star<00:04:28.510> Wars

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
Walker I've ever seen in the Star Wars

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.230 
Walker I've ever seen in the Star Wars
universe<00:04:28.720> however<00:04:29.560> is<00:04:29.890> a<00:04:29.919> really<00:04:30.520> cool<00:04:30.760> Play

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
universe however is a really cool Play

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.800 
universe however is a really cool Play
feature<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:32.200> if<00:04:32.440> I<00:04:32.710> take<00:04:32.979> off<00:04:33.390> two<00:04:34.390> studs<00:04:34.690> you

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
feature so if I take off two studs you

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.170 
feature so if I take off two studs you
can<00:04:34.960> see<00:04:35.169> how<00:04:35.289> it<00:04:35.320> works<00:04:35.650> it's<00:04:36.070> basically<00:04:36.849> that

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
can see how it works it's basically that

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.270 
can see how it works it's basically that
light<00:04:37.599> bluish<00:04:37.870> gray<00:04:38.110> piece<00:04:38.349> right<00:04:38.560> there<00:04:38.590> and

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
light bluish gray piece right there and

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.280 
light bluish gray piece right there and
it<00:04:39.370> spins<00:04:39.730> you<00:04:39.940> can<00:04:40.090> see<00:04:40.389> that<00:04:41.050> little

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
it spins you can see that little

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.090 
it spins you can see that little
elevated<00:04:41.920> part<00:04:42.340> right<00:04:42.670> there<00:04:43.620> spins<00:04:44.620> with<00:04:44.860> it

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
elevated part right there spins with it

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.580 
elevated part right there spins with it
and<00:04:45.430> when<00:04:45.730> it<00:04:45.820> spins<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.540> hits<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.960> bottom<00:04:47.440> of

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
and when it spins it hits the bottom of

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.830 
and when it spins it hits the bottom of
the<00:04:47.740> stud<00:04:48.100> and<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.760> basically<00:04:48.910> shoots<00:04:49.540> it<00:04:49.660> out

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
the stud and it basically shoots it out

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.500 
the stud and it basically shoots it out
so<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:50.530> can<00:04:50.889> go<00:04:51.040> slowly<00:04:51.400> which<00:04:52.090> will<00:04:52.240> kind<00:04:52.389> of

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
so you can go slowly which will kind of

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.000 
so you can go slowly which will kind of
shoot<00:04:52.660> them<00:04:52.750> out<00:04:52.840> one<00:04:53.200> at<00:04:53.290> a<00:04:53.350> time<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:53.830> it's

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
shoot them out one at a time and it's

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.890 
shoot them out one at a time and it's
just<00:04:54.190> amount<00:04:54.460> pretty<00:04:54.669> far<00:04:54.880> actually<00:04:55.090> or<00:04:55.660> you

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
just amount pretty far actually or you

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.080 
just amount pretty far actually or you
can<00:04:56.050> go<00:04:56.200> fast<00:04:56.530> and<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:57.370> can<00:04:57.520> basically<00:04:57.700> shoot

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
can go fast and you can basically shoot

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.240 
can go fast and you can basically shoot
all<00:04:58.240> of<00:04:58.300> them<00:04:58.660> within<00:04:59.050> a<00:04:59.260> matter<00:04:59.470> of<00:04:59.590> seconds

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
all of them within a matter of seconds

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.250 
all of them within a matter of seconds
over<00:05:00.820> they<00:05:00.940> are<00:05:01.000> very<00:05:01.360> easy<00:05:01.480> to<00:05:01.810> lose<00:05:02.020> that's

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
over they are very easy to lose that's

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.200 
over they are very easy to lose that's
why<00:05:02.410> you<00:05:02.470> do<00:05:02.650> get<00:05:02.800> a<00:05:02.830> ton<00:05:03.280> of<00:05:03.310> them<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.820> ton<00:05:04.180> of

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
why you do get a ton of them a ton of

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.870 
why you do get a ton of them a ton of
extra<00:05:04.660> ones<00:05:04.840> with<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.200> set<00:05:05.669> there's<00:05:06.669> also

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
extra ones with the set there's also

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.790 
extra ones with the set there's also
another<00:05:07.060> blaster<00:05:07.810> here<00:05:07.990> over<00:05:08.320> does<00:05:08.500> not<00:05:08.650> shoot

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
another blaster here over does not shoot

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.590 
another blaster here over does not shoot
anything<00:05:09.040> it's<00:05:09.310> just<00:05:09.370> for<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:09.700> looks<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:10.480> it's

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
anything it's just for the looks so it's

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.330 
anything it's just for the looks so it's
kind<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:10.810> cool<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.260> there's<00:05:11.860> just<00:05:12.010> a<00:05:12.160> better

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
kind of cool and there's just a better

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.950 
kind of cool and there's just a better
look<00:05:12.520> at<00:05:12.640> some<00:05:13.060> of<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.180> detailing<00:05:13.630> on<00:05:13.870> the

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
look at some of the detailing on the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.880 
look at some of the detailing on the
legs<00:05:14.650> there<00:05:16.080> so<00:05:17.080> that<00:05:17.200> does<00:05:17.350> it<00:05:17.470> for<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.680> set

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
legs there so that does it for the set

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.540 
legs there so that does it for the set
