number<00:06:37.050> one<00:06:37.199> now<00:06:37.499> that<00:06:37.709> maybe<00:06:37.830> 15<00:06:38.429> 20<00:06:38.580> years

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
number one now that maybe 15 20 years

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.249 
number one now that maybe 15 20 years
ago<00:06:38.939> because<00:06:39.179> there's<00:06:39.330> that<00:06:39.449> constant<00:06:39.929> media

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 
ago because there's that constant media

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.829 
ago because there's that constant media
attention<00:06:40.589> all<00:06:40.889> the<00:06:40.919> time<00:06:41.389> probably<00:06:42.389> so<00:06:42.599> I

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:42.839 
attention all the time probably so I

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:44.419 
attention all the time probably so I
would<00:06:43.259> probably<00:06:43.379> say<00:06:43.589> from<00:06:43.889> the<00:06:43.979> standpoint<00:06:44.219> I

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:44.429 
would probably say from the standpoint I

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:46.129 
would probably say from the standpoint I
think<00:06:44.459> everything's<00:06:45.119> different<00:06:45.330> there<00:06:45.599> I
