00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
cut out a circular border around a tree

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.720 
cut out a circular border around a tree
it'll<00:00:21.990> work<00:00:22.200> for<00:00:22.350> any<00:00:22.439> size<00:00:22.710> tree<00:00:23.040> just<00:00:23.580> need<00:00:23.700> a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
it'll work for any size tree just need a

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.950 
it'll work for any size tree just need a
little<00:00:23.790> bit<00:00:23.939> longer<00:00:24.150> string<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:24.779> doing<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
little bit longer string for doing a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.440 
little bit longer string for doing a
larger<00:00:25.460> stop<00:00:27.260> just<00:00:28.260> some<00:00:28.380> builders<00:00:28.619> twine<00:00:28.890> I

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
larger stop just some builders twine I

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.920 
larger stop just some builders twine I
want<00:00:30.450> to<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.570> about<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> foot<00:00:31.489> radius<00:00:32.690> so<00:00:33.690> roll

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
want to do about a foot radius so roll

out a foot from the twine and then add

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:50.800 
out a foot from the twine and then add
another<00:00:43.470> three<00:00:43.800> or<00:00:43.830> four<00:00:43.920> runs

to use this put around the knife and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.860 
to use this put around the knife and
we'll<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> knife<00:00:57.380> to<00:00:58.380> actually<00:00:58.650> create

a little bit long enough thought it

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:45.570 
a little bit long enough thought it
would<00:01:40.440> write<00:01:41.440> so<00:01:42.840> carefully<00:01:44.250> once<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.400> don't

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
would write so carefully once you don't

oh<00:02:42.670> she<00:02:43.210> cut<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:43.780> real<00:02:44.020> deep<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:45.250> want<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
oh she cut it in real deep you want a

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.120 
oh she cut it in real deep you want a
nice<00:02:45.580> crisp<00:02:46.030> deep<00:02:46.780> page<00:02:49.440> once<00:02:50.440> that's<00:02:50.650> created

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
nice crisp deep page once that's created

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.330 
nice crisp deep page once that's created
when<00:02:52.020> you've<00:02:53.020> dug<00:02:53.200> out<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.680> then<00:02:53.830> taking<00:02:54.220> out

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
when you've dug out and then taking out

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.680 
when you've dug out and then taking out
all<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.760> stones<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.120> then<00:02:55.240> we<00:02:55.360> did<00:02:55.540> that

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
all the stones and then we did that

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.390 
all the stones and then we did that
you'll<00:02:56.050> have<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.230> nice<00:02:56.440> deep<00:02:56.680> slope<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.280> you've

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
you'll have a nice deep slope so you've

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.980 
you'll have a nice deep slope so you've
got<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.550> nice<00:02:57.790> tidy<00:02:58.330> edge<00:02:58.540> all<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.810> way<00:02:58.900> around

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
got a nice tidy edge all the way around

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.550 
got a nice tidy edge all the way around
and<00:02:59.560> I'll<00:02:59.710> show<00:02:59.740> that<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.100> when<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.400> finished

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
and I'll show that and when it finished

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.340 
and I'll show that and when it finished
as<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.680> can<00:03:02.890> see<00:03:03.070> now<00:03:03.550> finished<00:03:04.080> bear<00:03:05.080> in<00:03:05.170> mind

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
as you can see now finished bear in mind

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.140 
as you can see now finished bear in mind
that<00:03:05.470> when<00:03:05.680> you're<00:03:05.800> clearing<00:03:06.550> out<00:03:06.640> soil<00:03:06.910> there

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
that when you're clearing out soil there

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.750 
that when you're clearing out soil there
will<00:03:07.240> be<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.360> bulking<00:03:07.750> factor<00:03:08.310> for<00:03:09.310> every<00:03:09.550> cubic

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
will be a bulking factor for every cubic

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.030 
will be a bulking factor for every cubic
metre<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.210> dig<00:03:10.420> out<00:03:10.600> it's<00:03:10.900> gonna<00:03:11.050> increase<00:03:11.830> in

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
metre you dig out it's gonna increase in

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.980 
metre you dig out it's gonna increase in
volume<00:03:12.250> by<00:03:12.520> about<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:13.000> third<00:03:13.390> or<00:03:13.570> perhaps<00:03:13.750> even

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
volume by about a third or perhaps even

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.140 
volume by about a third or perhaps even
two<00:03:14.320> thirds<00:03:14.730> depending<00:03:15.730> on<00:03:15.820> what<00:03:15.910> it's<00:03:16.030> made

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
two thirds depending on what it's made

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.330 
two thirds depending on what it's made
of<00:03:16.230> but<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.710> see<00:03:17.860> I<00:03:17.890> filled<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.280> the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
of but you see I filled it the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.380 
of but you see I filled it the
wheelbarrow<00:03:18.670> there<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:18.940> then<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.090> can<00:03:19.240> see

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
wheelbarrow there and then you can see

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.670 
wheelbarrow there and then you can see
that's<00:03:19.480> hardly<00:03:19.780> anything<00:03:20.080> that's<00:03:20.200> been<00:03:20.290> taken

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
that's hardly anything that's been taken

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.730 
that's hardly anything that's been taken
out<00:03:21.720> when<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.810> want<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.020> tidy<00:03:23.200> up<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.440> edges

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
out when you want to tidy up the edges

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.370 
out when you want to tidy up the edges
use<00:03:24.010> your<00:03:24.160> knife<00:03:24.340> for<00:03:24.670> just<00:03:25.030> garden<00:03:25.330> fork<00:03:25.600> make

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
use your knife for just garden fork make

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.780 
use your knife for just garden fork make
sure<00:03:26.500> all<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.620> weeds<00:03:26.800> are<00:03:26.950> out<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.280> just

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
sure all the weeds are out and just

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.030
