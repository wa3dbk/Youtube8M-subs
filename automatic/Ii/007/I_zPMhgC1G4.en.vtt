00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 considers the whole the double interval - 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.370
 sink - one open - one which 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.320
 statements is true. 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.230
 we do not want to know which of these values 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.170
 belong together to what is good 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.119
 I'm going to explain better represent 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.010
 here a straight oriented with our 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.330
 main reference which is zero both 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.949
 to the right side the positive numbers 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.730
 to the left are the numbers 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.369
 negative 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.529
 we already have here a relation of order which 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.269
 we must know that the more 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.520
 to the right if they have the highest numbers 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.770
 are or are we to buy two 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.500
 numbers between you and what is more 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.800
 is superior to the other and this in 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.110
 Positive numbers are easy to give 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.520
 example is going to be got here the 3 5 2 o 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.750
 stretch is to the right or three is 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.309
 greater than 2 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.289
 is we have some caution when analyzing 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.870
 negative numbers when your team drops 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.270
 example - 3 and that the least two 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.109
 the greater of these two in at least two 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:03.750
 spend more to the right than 1 - 3 both 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.369
 1 - 2 is greater than the minimum of three objectives 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.180
 we must be careful about these relationships 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.780
 on here 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.369
 So let's try to figure out what the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.560
 destination more by tension between valparaiso 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.450
 I'm going to score here in the final stretch this year. 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.810
 this interval paulo then goes - pi is 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.490
 least one is closed at minus 1 and so 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.350
 Let's put a ball here that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.900
 presented that they were less than one 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.479
 pretended interval is that ewerthon wants 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.400
 say that - pi does not belong to this 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.770
 range are automatically 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.460
 excluding the option b the cap with the option of 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.479
 risk - pi pretended not - pi can not 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.180
 belong to why it's open there - pi 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.200
 belongs this then Alvitre to be 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.229
 closed 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.880
 well then we are in between these three 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.280
 months here one that is also very easy 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.740
 the day in the air for is it says it intends 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.600
 cast masp to a positive number 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.509
 Then we can talk about 3.14 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.100
 15 and never ending is we here 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.610
 talk about my infinite performance does not 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.380
 harms is what is 4 house descends more 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.930
 we can write that it is 3014 15 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.970
 important that it can not belong to the 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.370
 because the values ​​that are in action 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.560
 all negative values and pawn value 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.350
 positive before also seems clear 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.310
 good now we're entering or less 32 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:32.590
 14 - 3,15 which god is in the range 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.900
 good then how can we see - pi is less 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.510
 3.14 15 and so on 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.630
 so there we have here an infinite tithe 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.760
 do not prove any it 's from here we can 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.830
 see that the - 3014 option really is a 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.810
 number that is in the range is in the 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.080
 because it is a number that 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.550
 is greater than at least pi for which 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:02.120
 we are talking - 3,14 and 1 - p 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.360
 we can see here that it is less than 3014 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.240
 15 is a little lower than 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.150
 we are talking about negative numbers 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:14.090
 is slightly left is of that value - 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.030
 3014 means that the value minus three 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.960
 players are around here I'm going to put 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.440
 here's an option I already dropped option to 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.260
 minus 3.15 for me is a lower value 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.330
 At least three out of 1415 we are talking about 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.480
 negative numbers ok - three ranking 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.010
 is a little to the left of - pi 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.020
 therefore it is the option the option is is that 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.440
 I think it really is out of the 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:48.430
 interval then and in this way then no 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.430
 can be and we have the option of
