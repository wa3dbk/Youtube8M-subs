almost like an exact replica as close as
it<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.800> possibly<00:00:25.830> get<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:27.359> can<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:27.720> there

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
this could be become a 100% perfect

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.630 
this could be become a 100% perfect
ported<00:00:42.210> map<00:00:42.420> or<00:00:42.719> at<00:00:43.110> least<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:44.070> some<00:00:44.280> edits

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
ported map or at least with some edits

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.660 
ported map or at least with some edits
because<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.329> its<00:00:45.480> supported<00:00:46.050> Ness<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:47.489> as<00:00:47.579> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
because of its supported Ness so as you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.190 
because of its supported Ness so as you
can<00:00:47.789> see<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.180> there's<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.899> some

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
can see here there's just like some

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.590 
can see here there's just like some
weird-looking<00:00:49.620> spots<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.300> can't<00:00:51.480> really

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
weird-looking spots but you can't really

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.119 
weird-looking spots but you can't really
see<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.809> from<00:00:52.050> spawn<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.010> was

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
see that from spawn so I think that was

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.189 
see that from spawn so I think that was
purposely<00:00:53.730> done<00:00:53.969> because<00:00:54.719> you're<00:00:54.870> not<00:00:54.989> really

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
purposely done because you're not really

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.930 
purposely done because you're not really
supposed<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.620> venture<00:00:56.010> out<00:00:56.190> there<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.820> an

is pretty cool-looking and it goes just

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.719 
is pretty cool-looking and it goes just
as<00:01:40.079> in-depth<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.070> real<00:01:41.280> thing

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
as in-depth as the real thing

lighting errors so you're going to have

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.499 
lighting errors so you're going to have
the<00:01:50.250> bare<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> lighting<00:01:51.060> errors<00:01:51.360> in

the bare with the lighting errors in
this<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> super<00:01:53.100> cool<00:01:53.310> map<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:53.880> you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
this but this is a super cool map as you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.359 
this but this is a super cool map as you
can<00:01:54.630> see<00:01:54.869> once<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.380> get<00:01:55.500> down<00:01:55.649> into<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:56.219> it

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
can see once you get down into here it

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.340 
can see once you get down into here it
gets<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.640> little<00:01:56.759> sketchy<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.990> once<00:01:58.200> again

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
gets a little sketchy but once again

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.170 
gets a little sketchy but once again
this<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:58.950> supposed<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.640> a<00:02:00.890> perfect

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
this is not supposed to be a perfect

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.639 
this is not supposed to be a perfect
perfect<00:02:03.180> map<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.930> know<00:02:04.049> what<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.200> mean<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.469> is

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
perfect map you know what I mean this is

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.010 
perfect map you know what I mean this is
just<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.149> adventure<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.840> is

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
just not really for adventure this is

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.050 
just not really for adventure this is

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
more for aesthetics so we're not really

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.240 
more for aesthetics so we're not really
going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.420> go<00:02:09.569> too<00:02:10.289> much<00:02:10.440> into<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.860> there<00:02:11.160> you

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
so as you can see there's like a ton of

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.400 
so as you can see there's like a ton of
rooms<00:03:34.000> all<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.329> rooms<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:34.959> you<00:03:35.079> would<00:03:35.199> Nam

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
that that were in the real thing to the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.089 
that that were in the real thing to the
fullest<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.569> its<00:03:40.959> abilities<00:03:41.470> there<00:03:41.709> are<00:03:41.859> some

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
fullest of its abilities there are some

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.670 
fullest of its abilities there are some
update<00:03:42.459> blocks<00:03:42.790> some<00:03:43.209> from<00:03:43.629> the<00:03:43.870> non<00:03:44.049> portable

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
update blocks some from the non portable

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.069 
update blocks some from the non portable
things<00:03:45.400> but<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:45.819> know<00:03:45.940> once<00:03:46.569> again<00:03:46.810> this<00:03:46.930> is

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
things but you know once again this is

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.140 
things but you know once again this is
huge<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.799> can't<00:03:48.069> you<00:03:48.250> can't<00:03:48.459> possibly<00:03:48.730> get

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
huge you can't you can't possibly get

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.640 
huge you can't you can't possibly get
everything<00:03:49.810> so<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:51.660> mean<00:03:52.660> like<00:03:52.840> all<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.260> rooms

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
everything so I mean like all the rooms

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.280 
everything so I mean like all the rooms
are<00:03:53.919> in<00:03:54.040> here<00:03:54.449> everything<00:03:55.449> is<00:03:55.569> in<00:03:55.720> here<00:03:56.019> um

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
are in here everything is in here um

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.409 
are in here everything is in here um
they<00:03:57.099> might<00:03:57.250> not<00:03:57.430> have<00:03:57.639> all<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.909> stuff<00:03:58.180> in<00:03:58.329> it

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
they might not have all the stuff in it

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.559 
they might not have all the stuff in it
but<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:58.989> know<00:03:59.109> honestly<00:03:59.760> it's<00:04:00.760> just<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.180> really

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
but you know honestly it's just a really

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.289 
but you know honestly it's just a really
impressive<00:04:01.919> build<00:04:02.919> so<00:04:03.190> down<00:04:03.400> here<00:04:03.819> I<00:04:03.970> think

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
impressive build so down here I think

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.809 
impressive build so down here I think
this<00:04:04.599> is<00:04:04.720> where<00:04:04.900> hero<00:04:05.199> Brian<00:04:05.440> was<00:04:05.769> maybe<00:04:06.489> in

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
this is where hero Brian was maybe in

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.930 
this is where hero Brian was maybe in
the<00:04:07.000> in<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:08.260> thing<00:04:08.769> now<00:04:09.099> probably<00:04:09.579> not<00:04:09.699> know<00:04:09.909> I

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
the in the thing now probably not know I

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.750 
the in the thing now probably not know I
don't<00:04:10.479> remember<00:04:10.629> exactly<00:04:11.349> where<00:04:12.129> he<00:04:12.430> or<00:04:12.489> run

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
don't remember exactly where he or run

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.809 
don't remember exactly where he or run
was<00:04:13.379> no<00:04:14.379> we<00:04:14.560> just<00:04:14.590> went<00:04:14.859> down<00:04:15.099> we<00:04:15.280> just<00:04:15.310> circled

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
was no we just went down we just circled

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.839 
was no we just went down we just circled
so<00:04:15.940> I<00:04:15.970> guess<00:04:16.180> I'll<00:04:16.329> go<00:04:16.479> to<00:04:16.510> this<00:04:16.750> side<00:04:17.220> um<00:04:18.220> I'm

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
so I guess I'll go to this side um I'm

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.240 
so I guess I'll go to this side um I'm
trying<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.180> find<00:04:19.510> where<00:04:20.289> the<00:04:20.500> bosses<00:04:21.010> were<00:04:21.220> I

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.850 
I forget we're here about was though I
don't<00:04:58.910> really<00:04:59.060> remember<00:04:59.210> but<00:04:59.570> anyway<00:05:00.560> this<00:05:00.710> is

don't really remember but anyway this is
just<00:05:00.890> a<00:05:01.160> really<00:05:01.690> really<00:05:02.690> cool<00:05:02.900> build<00:05:03.170> I<00:05:03.380> think

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
just a really really cool build I think

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.990 
just a really really cool build I think
we've<00:05:03.710> seen<00:05:03.860> enough<00:05:04.130> of<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.310> inside<00:05:04.730> it's

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
we've seen enough of the inside it's

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.270 
we've seen enough of the inside it's
kind<00:05:05.180> of<00:05:05.240> hard<00:05:05.450> to<00:05:05.510> really<00:05:06.290> grasp<00:05:06.650> everything

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
kind of hard to really grasp everything

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.420 
kind of hard to really grasp everything
on<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:07.430> inside<00:05:07.760> if<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:07.970> haven't<00:05:08.300> seen<00:05:08.570> the

on the inside if you haven't seen the

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.870 
on the inside if you haven't seen the
playthrough<00:05:10.430> itself<00:05:11.000> on<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.360> PC<00:05:11.840> but<00:05:12.620> I<00:05:13.010> want

of<00:05:18.650> this<00:05:18.830> must<00:05:19.310> have<00:05:19.460> taken<00:05:19.490> forever<00:05:20.000> um<00:05:20.510> the

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
of this must have taken forever um the

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.470 
of this must have taken forever um the
original<00:05:21.260> map<00:05:21.680> was<00:05:21.890> by<00:05:22.040> a<00:05:22.070> high<00:05:22.310> pixel<00:05:22.850> but<00:05:23.120> the
