especially<00:02:43.800> if<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.910> have<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.030> passenger<00:02:45.360> with

why<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:51.000> navigation<00:02:51.660> can't<00:02:51.930> use<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.260> same

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
why the navigation can't use the same

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.100 
why the navigation can't use the same
sensor<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.340> give<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.850> full<00:02:54.060> control<00:02:54.240> while
