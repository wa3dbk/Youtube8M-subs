let's<00:02:07.890> hit<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.250> real<00:02:08.489> quick<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.509> back

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
let's hit on that real quick on the back

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.559 
let's hit on that real quick on the back
you<00:02:10.229> only<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.649> elevator<00:02:11.190> control<00:02:11.550> no<00:02:12.330> rudder

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
you only have elevator control no rudder

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.309 
you only have elevator control no rudder
control<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.110> you

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
control so you

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.890 
control so you
elevator<00:02:13.799> control<00:02:14.189> and<00:02:14.489> Elrond<00:02:15.450> control

elevator control and Elrond control

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.629 
elevator control and Elrond control
which<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.439> more<00:02:16.620> than<00:02:16.769> enough<00:02:16.890> for<00:02:17.280> this

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:17.639 
which is more than enough for this

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:22.069 
which is more than enough for this
airplane<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.790> everything<00:02:21.480> came<00:02:21.659> pretty<00:02:21.870> much

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
that is candy I'm going slow as I can

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.820 
that is candy I'm going slow as I can
right<00:04:07.020> now<00:04:07.050> to<00:04:07.260> keep<00:04:07.530> it<00:04:07.680> in<00:04:07.800> frame<00:04:09.650> how's<00:04:10.650> it

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
right now to keep it in frame how's it

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.850 
right now to keep it in frame how's it
looking<00:04:11.130> mm-hmm<00:04:11.850> yeah<00:04:12.660> we<00:04:13.170> got<00:04:13.350> just<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.620> little

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
looking mm-hmm yeah we got just a little

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.770 
looking mm-hmm yeah we got just a little
bit<00:04:13.980> of<00:04:14.070> wind<00:04:14.250> today<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:15.150> can<00:04:15.270> kind<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.510> see<00:04:15.660> us

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
bit of wind today you can kind of see us

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.630 
bit of wind today you can kind of see us
getting<00:04:15.960> pushed<00:04:16.260> around<00:04:16.410> out<00:04:16.860> there<00:04:16.890> so<00:04:17.400> I

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
getting pushed around out there so I

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.740 
getting pushed around out there so I
would<00:04:17.790> really<00:04:18.060> think<00:04:18.420> this<00:04:19.230> would<00:04:19.380> be<00:04:19.440> a

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
would really think this would be a

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.150 
would really think this would be a
airplane<00:04:21.750> that<00:04:21.870> you<00:04:21.989> would<00:04:22.080> fly<00:04:22.290> in<00:04:22.650> low<00:04:22.950> wind

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
airplane that you would fly in low wind

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160 
airplane that you would fly in low wind
conditions<00:04:23.610> I'm<00:04:24.030> I'm<00:04:24.690> kind<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.020> getting

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
conditions I'm I'm kind of getting

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.750 
conditions I'm I'm kind of getting
bounced<00:04:25.530> around<00:04:25.590> up<00:04:25.920> there<00:04:25.950> right<00:04:26.310> now<00:04:26.550> and

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
bounced around up there right now and

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.670 
bounced around up there right now and
we're<00:04:26.910> only<00:04:27.030> we<00:04:27.720> only<00:04:27.840> have<00:04:28.050> what<00:04:28.260> maybe<00:04:28.440> three

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
we're only we only have what maybe three

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.560 
we're only we only have what maybe three
to<00:04:28.770> five<00:04:28.920> miles<00:04:29.160> an<00:04:29.340> hour<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:30.030> I<00:04:30.270> don't<00:04:30.330> even

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
to five miles an hour and I don't even

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.080 
to five miles an hour and I don't even
think<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:31.650> hard<00:04:31.920> let's<00:04:32.370> try<00:04:32.610> let's<00:04:33.000> try

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
think that so hard let's try let's try

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.920 
think that so hard let's try let's try
go<00:04:33.390> for<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.660> loop<00:04:33.870> here<00:04:34.940> that<00:04:35.940> was<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.120> nice<00:04:36.420> slow

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
go for a loop here that was a nice slow

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.670 
go for a loop here that was a nice slow
loop<00:04:38.060> do<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.150> think<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.330> got<00:04:39.510> it<00:04:39.690> I<00:04:39.870> think<00:04:40.290> so

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
loop do you think you got it I think so

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.050 
loop do you think you got it I think so
okay<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.950> have<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.190> go<00:04:44.310> a<00:04:44.340> little<00:04:44.520> faster<00:04:44.790> on

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
okay you have to go a little faster on

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.840 
okay you have to go a little faster on
the<00:04:45.120> takeoffs<00:04:47.600> having<00:04:48.600> Elrond<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.850> elevator

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
the takeoffs having Elrond and elevator

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.730 
the takeoffs having Elrond and elevator
control<00:04:51.210> I'm<00:04:51.390> not<00:04:51.570> having<00:04:51.810> issues<00:04:52.290> with<00:04:52.500> it<00:04:52.620> at

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
control I'm not having issues with it at

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.860 
control I'm not having issues with it at
the<00:04:52.860> moment<00:04:55.250> seems<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.340> little<00:04:56.550> touchy<00:04:56.880> maybe<00:04:57.780> I

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
the moment seems a little touchy maybe I

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.540 
the moment seems a little touchy maybe I
need<00:04:58.050> to<00:04:58.080> dial<00:04:58.350> my<00:04:58.500> rates<00:04:58.980> down<00:04:59.160> just<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.520> little

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
need to dial my rates down just a little

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.260 
need to dial my rates down just a little
bit<00:04:59.820> on<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.870> next<00:05:01.080> flight<00:05:01.290> but<00:05:02.120> having<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.180> good

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
bit on the next flight but having a good

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.540 
bit on the next flight but having a good
time<00:05:03.450> with<00:05:03.690> it<00:05:03.720> so<00:05:03.930> far<00:05:04.169> Kenny<00:05:04.950> you<00:05:05.220> like<00:05:05.370> it

mm-hmm
when<00:05:06.660> I<00:05:06.690> can<00:05:06.840> keep<00:05:06.990> up<00:05:07.169> with<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:07.350> when<00:05:07.680> you<00:05:07.710> keep

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
when I can keep up with it when you keep

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.540 
when I can keep up with it when you keep
up<00:05:08.100> with<00:05:08.310> it<00:05:08.460> all<00:05:08.850> right<00:05:09.000> well<00:05:09.180> we<00:05:09.360> did<00:05:09.540> a<00:05:09.570> loop

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
up with it all right well we did a loop

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.800 
up with it all right well we did a loop
let's<00:05:11.550> see<00:05:11.940> if<00:05:12.000> I<00:05:12.060> can't<00:05:12.270> get<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.419> roll<00:05:12.600> out<00:05:12.780> of

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
let's see if I can't get a roll out of

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.000 
let's see if I can't get a roll out of
this<00:05:12.990> bad<00:05:13.200> boy<00:05:13.230> ooh<00:05:14.900> that<00:05:15.900> dihedral<00:05:16.290> on<00:05:16.740> the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
this bad boy ooh that dihedral on the

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.880 
this bad boy ooh that dihedral on the
the<00:05:17.430> wings<00:05:17.640> really<00:05:17.910> makes<00:05:18.210> that<00:05:18.480> roll<00:05:19.380> kind<00:05:19.770> of

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
the wings really makes that roll kind of

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.970 
the wings really makes that roll kind of
a<00:05:20.010> barrel<00:05:20.370> roll<00:05:20.720> I'm<00:05:21.720> not<00:05:21.930> sure<00:05:22.110> it's<00:05:22.620> supposed

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
a barrel roll I'm not sure it's supposed

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.770 
a barrel roll I'm not sure it's supposed
to<00:05:23.040> have<00:05:23.190> that<00:05:23.340> much<00:05:23.490> dye<00:05:23.700> he<00:05:23.880> drew<00:05:24.060> on<00:05:24.330> the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
to have that much dye he drew on the

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.460 
to have that much dye he drew on the
wings<00:05:24.990> you<00:05:25.140> know<00:05:25.350> but<00:05:26.630> I'm<00:05:27.630> managing<00:05:27.990> with<00:05:28.350> it

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
wings you know but I'm managing with it

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.100 
wings you know but I'm managing with it
right<00:05:28.620> now

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110

Flyknit<00:05:32.110> low<00:05:32.530> speeds<00:05:32.860> so<00:05:33.760> far<00:05:35.040> seems<00:05:36.040> to<00:05:36.160> be

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
Flyknit low speeds so far seems to be

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.610 
Flyknit low speeds so far seems to be
handling<00:05:36.430> fairly<00:05:37.000> well<00:05:37.150> all<00:05:37.990> right<00:05:38.020> Kenny<00:05:38.290> I'm

handling fairly well all right Kenny I'm
gonna<00:05:38.860> speed<00:05:39.100> it<00:05:39.130> up<00:05:39.310> on<00:05:39.460> this<00:05:39.610> pass<00:05:39.880> right

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
gonna speed it up on this pass right

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.990 
gonna speed it up on this pass right
yeah

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000

Wow I'm gonna say that was around 45 to

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.490 
Wow I'm gonna say that was around 45 to
50<00:05:54.560> miles<00:05:54.740> an<00:05:54.890> hour

cool flying airplane now I don't think

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.560 
cool flying airplane now I don't think
I'd<00:06:00.980> recommend<00:06:01.400> this<00:06:01.460> for<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.790> beginner<00:06:02.120> you

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
bit of a handful on the takeoff but for

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.620 
bit of a handful on the takeoff but for
the<00:06:08.960> intermediate<00:06:09.290> and<00:06:10.090> advanced<00:06:11.090> pilots<00:06:11.510> I

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630
