then there would be opportunities for
small<00:00:40.079> group<00:00:40.440> work<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.579> example<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
small group work we for example have a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.299 
small group work we for example have a
