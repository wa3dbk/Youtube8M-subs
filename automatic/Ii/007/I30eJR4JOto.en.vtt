00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.729 

also<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.369> camera<00:00:32.579> has<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> stereo<00:00:33.120> speaker<00:00:33.780> so

normally<00:00:36.270> hear<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> fucking<00:00:37.290> ambient

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
normally hear like the fucking ambient

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.680 
normally hear like the fucking ambient
noise<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.129> my<00:00:38.219> air<00:00:38.370> conditioner<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.450> think

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
noise for my air conditioner but I think

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.450 
noise for my air conditioner but I think
overall<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.140> shot<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.980> see<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> shot

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
overall the shot as you can see the shot

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.040 
overall the shot as you can see the shot
seems<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:41.910> more<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.270> screen<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
seems to get more of the screen in it

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.910 
seems to get more of the screen in it
because<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> wide-angle<00:00:44.219> lens<00:00:44.550> actually

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920
