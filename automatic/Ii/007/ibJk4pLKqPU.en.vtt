are just simply amazing pickups

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.070 
are just simply amazing pickups
basically<00:00:17.490> what<00:00:17.640> you've<00:00:17.760> got<00:00:17.970> here<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.270> p90

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
basically what you've got here is a p90

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.609 
basically what you've got here is a p90
and<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.640> hot<00:00:20.910> rail<00:00:21.119> or<00:00:21.449> not<00:00:21.900> hot<00:00:22.050> railway<00:00:22.350> rail

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
and a hot rail or not hot railway rail

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.920 
and a hot rail or not hot railway rail
coil<00:00:23.150> and<00:00:24.150> when<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.390> combine<00:00:24.689> them<00:00:24.750> together

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
coil and when you combine them together

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.689 
coil and when you combine them together
you<00:00:25.170> get<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.350> kind<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.710> humbucker<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.460> what<00:00:26.580> this

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
you get a kind of humbucker so what this

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.089 
you get a kind of humbucker so what this
basically<00:00:26.910> means<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.920> you<00:00:28.920> have<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
basically means is you have the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.370 
basically means is you have the
potential<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:30.390> three<00:00:30.869> different<00:00:31.170> types

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
potential to have three different types

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.959 
potential to have three different types
of<00:00:31.590> pickup<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.759> one<00:00:33.120> which<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.930> simply<00:00:34.680> a

the<00:01:07.770> push<00:01:07.950> pulls<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.729> pots<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> guitar

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
the push pulls of the pots of the guitar

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.030 
the push pulls of the pots of the guitar
with<00:01:10.820> both<00:01:11.820> pots<00:01:12.090> down<00:01:12.330> I'm<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.229> standard

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
series mode so that's just that both

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.289 
series mode so that's just that both
pickups<00:01:16.830> connected<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:17.820> going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.180> be

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
pickups connected and it's going to be

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.300 
pickups connected and it's going to be
sounding<00:01:18.689> quite<00:01:18.840> humbucker<00:01:19.259> ish<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:20.159> I'm

festival<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.380> take<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.740> through<00:01:22.770> some<00:01:23.070> of

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
festival and take you through some of

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:37.240 
festival and take you through some of
the<00:01:23.220> pickup<00:01:23.460> configuration<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.479> go

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.620 

so<00:01:38.250> I'm<00:01:38.340> moving<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.790> middle<00:01:39.030> position<00:01:39.180> so

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
so I'm moving to the middle position so

00:01:39.630 --> 00:02:17.170 
so I'm moving to the middle position so
that's<00:01:39.810> between<00:01:40.409> two<00:01:40.619> pickups<00:01:41.040> here

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.730 

and<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.300> was<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.630> net<00:02:18.780> pick<00:02:18.960> up<00:02:19.140> moving

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
and that was in the net pick up moving

00:02:19.740 --> 00:03:00.150 
and that was in the net pick up moving
into<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.070> mid<00:02:20.220> position

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.580 

okay<00:03:00.760> quickly<00:03:01.360> switching<00:03:01.780> back<00:03:01.960> over<00:03:02.020> into

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
okay quickly switching back over into

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:35.160 
okay quickly switching back over into
the<00:03:02.710> position<00:03:33.660> finally<00:03:34.660> now<00:03:34.810> I'm<00:03:34.990> going<00:03:35.110> to

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
the position finally now I'm going to

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.700 
the position finally now I'm going to
pull<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:35.560> both<00:03:36.300> of<00:03:37.300> these<00:03:37.510> up<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:37.930> we<00:03:38.380> are<00:03:38.530> in

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
pull the both of these up and we are in

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.520 
pull the both of these up and we are in
basically<00:03:39.450> humbucker<00:03:40.450> mode<00:03:40.480> again<00:03:40.900> but<00:03:41.410> this

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
basically humbucker mode again but this

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:57.120 
basically humbucker mode again but this
is<00:03:41.740> in<00:03:42.690> parallel<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.070> here<00:03:45.070> we<00:03:45.160> go<00:03:55.770> that<00:03:56.770> was<00:03:56.890> in

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
is in parallel so here we go that was in

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.630 
is in parallel so here we go that was in
the<00:03:58.290> neck<00:03:59.290> position<00:03:59.470> now<00:04:00.100> switching<00:04:00.400> through

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
the neck position now switching through

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:12.310 
the neck position now switching through
into<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:00.910> bridge<00:04:01.060> position

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:24.140 

then<00:04:13.320> finally<00:04:13.770> in<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.400> middle<00:04:14.430> position<00:04:23.150> okay

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
then finally in the middle position okay

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.550 
then finally in the middle position okay
and<00:04:24.390> now<00:04:24.480> you're<00:04:24.690> probably<00:04:24.840> wondering<00:04:25.260> what

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
and now you're probably wondering what

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.160 
and now you're probably wondering what
it<00:04:25.710> sounds<00:04:26.040> like<00:04:26.220> with<00:04:26.460> some<00:04:26.910> distortion<00:04:27.540> so

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
it sounds like with some distortion so

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.610 
it sounds like with some distortion so
I'm<00:04:28.470> gonna<00:04:28.650> switch<00:04:28.860> on<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.130> distortion
