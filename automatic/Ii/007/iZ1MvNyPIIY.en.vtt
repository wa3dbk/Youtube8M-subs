00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
moves for 19 kills right at the

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.150 
moves for 19 kills right at the
beginning<00:06:16.990> like<00:06:17.410> that<00:06:17.680> first<00:06:17.950> little

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
beginning like that first little

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.620 
beginning like that first little
boosting<00:06:18.520> session<00:06:18.820> underground<00:06:19.150> he<00:06:19.330> got<00:06:19.479> like

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
boosting session underground he got like

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.350 
boosting session underground he got like
19<00:06:20.080> kills<00:06:20.290> I<00:06:20.500> believe<00:06:20.770> and<00:06:21.180> they<00:06:22.180> keep

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
19 kills I believe and they keep

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.940 
19 kills I believe and they keep
boosting<00:06:22.630> so<00:06:23.050> if<00:06:23.169> you<00:06:23.290> know<00:06:23.410> it<00:06:23.500> only<00:06:23.650> needed

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
boosting so if you know it only needed

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.090 
boosting so if you know it only needed
15<00:06:24.460> headshots<00:06:24.910> why<00:06:25.900> are<00:06:25.960> you<00:06:26.260> going<00:06:26.500> for<00:06:26.680> more

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
15 headshots why are you going for more

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.469 
15 headshots why are you going for more
so<00:06:28.060> I<00:06:28.540> think<00:06:29.020> he<00:06:29.320> was<00:06:29.440> just<00:06:29.530> trying<00:06:29.710> to<00:06:30.180> yacht<00:06:31.180> I

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 
so I think he was just trying to yacht I

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.150 
so I think he was just trying to yacht I
mean<00:06:31.900> I<00:06:32.200> believe<00:06:32.320> that<00:06:32.590> he<00:06:32.830> was<00:06:32.890> going<00:06:33.070> for

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
mean I believe that he was going for

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.370 
mean I believe that he was going for
head<00:06:33.310> shots<00:06:33.599> but<00:06:34.599> I<00:06:34.630> also<00:06:34.870> believe<00:06:34.990> he<00:06:35.289> was

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
head shots but I also believe he was

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.750 
head shots but I also believe he was
trying<00:06:35.590> to<00:06:35.620> get<00:06:35.740> something<00:06:35.979> more<00:06:36.250> maybe<00:06:36.490> a<00:06:36.580> new

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
trying to get something more maybe a new

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.890 
trying to get something more maybe a new
killer<00:06:37.030> or<00:06:37.090> something

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
killer or something

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.800 
killer or something
I don't<00:06:38.080> know<00:06:38.669> but<00:06:39.669> the<00:06:40.150> gamer<00:06:40.360> tags<00:06:40.660> are

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
I don't know but the gamer tags are

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.990 
I don't know but the gamer tags are
gonna<00:06:40.900> be<00:06:41.110> on<00:06:41.139> screen<00:06:41.669> you<00:06:42.669> know<00:06:42.790> if<00:06:42.880> you

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
gonna be on screen you know if you

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.400 
gonna be on screen you know if you
didn't<00:06:43.300> see<00:06:43.449> him<00:06:43.570> enough<00:06:43.750> in<00:06:43.870> the<00:06:43.960> kill<00:06:44.139> feed

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
didn't see him enough in the kill feed

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.100 
didn't see him enough in the kill feed
of<00:06:44.680> lead<00:06:45.009> man<00:06:45.220> killing<00:06:45.520> King<00:06:46.000> X<00:06:46.300> predator<00:06:46.900> I

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
of lead man killing King X predator I

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.810 
of lead man killing King X predator I
think<00:06:47.770> yeah<00:06:47.949> that<00:06:48.190> that's<00:06:48.310> what<00:06:48.550> his<00:06:48.639> name<00:06:48.759> is

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
think yeah that that's what his name is

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.700

though because that's where he's been

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.870 
though because that's where he's been
the<00:07:29.800> entire<00:07:30.120> second<00:07:31.120> round<00:07:31.530> so<00:07:32.530> I<00:07:32.830> do<00:07:32.889> a<00:07:33.340> salute

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:33.880 
the entire second round so I do a salute

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.570 
the entire second round so I do a salute
predator<00:07:34.389> for<00:07:34.840> the<00:07:35.260> trying<00:07:35.889> to<00:07:35.949> cap<00:07:36.099> the<00:07:36.280> flags

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:36.580
