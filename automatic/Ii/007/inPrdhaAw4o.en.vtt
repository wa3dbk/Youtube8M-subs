00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello to you, pathos, and now I 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.759
 tell you how easy it is to rob 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.620
 absolutely any ship in assassin's 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.750
 creed 4 as a target we will use 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.730
 this frigate but in fact you can 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.190
 rob absolutely any ship 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.859
 By the way, please note that there is a number 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.600
 fight is not a requirement but if 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.859
 it will happen then itâ€™s just 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.050
 ideal conditions to 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.150
 poison any ship and so us 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.580
 you must first catch up with our 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.949
 the purpose of the benefit is it is easy daw most 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.699
 fast ship in the game and any ship 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.699
 we can catch up 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.559
 when we get close to the ship we need 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.730
 go literally aboard 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.489
 use the fact that next 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.290
 there is a battle it will help you perfectly 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.420
 approach the ship so that it is not from you 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.690
 tried to leave so when you come to 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.379
 it we go down all the sails depart from 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.760
 steering wheel 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.350
 and jump on the enemy ship game 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.630
 so arranged at the moment of hitting 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.030
 the game is on someone else's ladder or all 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.800
 stops the ship stops 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.300
 move stops engaging the battlefield and 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.950
 other ships don't see him 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.440
 accordingly what is happening is sad 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.479
 failure absolutely does not concern us we can 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.420
 calmly crawl around the ship calmly 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.170
 deal with our business first 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.310
 need to kill all guards 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.310
 this can be done on the map h 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.540
 so in the open 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.190
 do not forget that very often on ships 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.570
 there are arrows so before you 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.490
 start interrupting the whole team 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.520
 try to quietly kill the shooters 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.180
 one is usually located behind the ship and 2 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.180
 in the middle 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.410
 when you kill the last arrow 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.350
 the fact 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.540
 the battle is over you have won left 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.700
 kill the rest of the soldiers a little 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.550
 make it pretty simple because 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.410
 being in this position the guard is not 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.030
 raises an alarm for this easily 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.030
 you can shoot at everyone 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.780
 when the goal is left just left 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.780
 jump to the deck and finish off the remaining 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.390
 after that we return to the tree 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.390
 take a tear ship control 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.120
 how do you see the result of our actions 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.370
 it turned out that the ship is empty 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.970
 and no other ship wants us 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.010
 attack we are completely clean and all 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.180
 what we have to do is give a salvo 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.910
 just 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.950
 we cleaned us ship as you see 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.200
 it immediately becomes empty and immediately 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.030
 becomes available for boarding take 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.350
 him on boarding nothing else to do 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.350
 Need to get profit
