00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:19.190
 mum own zero but all this book 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:21.380
 of recipes I wanted to do but search 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.660
 something to the text do n't take the idea 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.910
 Mum thinks of this book 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.770
 today we make linguine with pesto alla 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.770
 I say Genoese how to do it 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.989
 first we need 400 g of 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.820
 linguine instead to prepare pesto 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.760
 to the Genoese we need two segments 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.970
 of garlic a pinch of coarse sea salt 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.910
 100,000 extra virgin olive oil e 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.899
 50 grams of Genoese basil leaves 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.850
 2 tablespoons of pecorino cheese 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.640
 grated 6 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.920
 grated reggiano and finally a 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.840
 spoon of pine nuts the basil must 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.420
 be cool so we buy it at 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.270
 market where we will also buy pine nuts 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.049
 we will get the different foods 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.639
 cheeses for pesto now we go 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.380
 immediately to the recipe 

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:11.840
 let us first specify that the leaves 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.999
 basil should not be washed but 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.549
 clean with a soft cloth and yes 

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:18.529
 stretches of Ligurian or Genoese basil a 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.289
 narrow leaves and not the southern one 

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:22.670
 to large leaves that often has an aroma 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.679
 of mint 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.959
 let's proceed with the preparation of the pesto 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.209
 place the peeled garlic in the mortar 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:32.209
 along with a few grains of coarse salt 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:34.579
 start pounding and when the garlic comes 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:36.590
 will be reduced to cream I would add some 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.139
 basil leaves together with a pinch 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.060
 of coarse salt that will serve to crush 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:43.909
 better the fibers and to maintain a beautiful 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.909
 light green color crushed then 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.560
 basil against the walls of the mortar 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.229
 turning the pestle from left to 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.240
 right and at the same time rotate the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.119
 mortar in the opposite direction 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.009
 continuing like this since 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.450
 basil leaves will not come out a liquid 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.340
 bright green 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.739
 at this point add pine nuts and 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.179
 you will start pounding again to reduce the 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:06.950
 all in cream 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.649
 add the cheeses a little at a time 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.930
 continuously stirring which will go to 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.450
 make the sauce even creamier and 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.090
 lastly the oil 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.209
 extra virgin olive oil which will be poured flush 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.560
 always stirring with the pestle 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.690
 mix the ingredients well until 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.269
 get a homogeneous sauce 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.220
 in the meantime cook the linguine 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.769
 in abundant salted water 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.510
 once ready take one or two 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.160
 spoons of cooking water e 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.050
 add them to the pesto 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.530
 drain the linguine and season with 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.530
 pesto 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.730
 how complicated you are driving 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.420
 this recipe book precisely because 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.630
 these are the tips for cooking well 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.090
 spending little time therefore little money 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.910
 I don't know what you can have you can have 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.410
 something more I would ask you for a piece 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.690
 because you say that if you really mustache in 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.510
 ten minutes five minutes do not cook 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.600
 more like you do how do you women of 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.700
 once you do not do that you say to me 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.940
 I imagine how this text appears in 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.010
 ten minutes you want very strong 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.600
 I tell you go to the supermarket 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.900
 bought a nice pack of linguine 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.060
 different jar already prepared an idea e 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.550
 eat that it takes nothing 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.070
 I knew it but how can you call it pesto 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.300
 A thing like that 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.920
 someone did before saying that 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.200
 proceeding and then putting it in the chain 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.010
 of food distribution no 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.070
 the world agreement ate a dish 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.010
 of pesto made as I say that 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.570
 so much judges that you say it's not good 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.230
 yes I tasted it but nothing to that 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.820
 see with why I am so heavy 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.709
 very simple we continue with the 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.720
 preparation of the recipe then 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.380
 however one thing I wanted to say was not me 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.840
 vida king maya dinner when you do something 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.489
 like that then let me finish once 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.410
 arrived home 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.780
 boil the linguine in the 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.580
 meanwhile put the different jar 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.470
 in a bowl of water and do it 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.480
 heat 5 about 10 minutes on 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.090
 stove when the groin is ready 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.910
 Drain the pesto and dry 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.870
 and add a teaspoon of water 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.520
 the cooking one 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.710
 and then a little extra virgin olive oil 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.470
 olive in this cat is ready from 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.540
 enjoy to eat a delicacy for 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.460
 the palate but also for the eyes for 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.860
 the list the courage to say that it is 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.080
 approached the text well I was here a 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:42.000

 so that someone from the two hours has 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.990
 right or not this tug of war 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.310
 this tug of war in some way 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.580
 will have to have to finish 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.580
