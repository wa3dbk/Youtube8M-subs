make their indoor world championship for
this<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.729> use<00:01:51.740> 304<00:01:52.740> shook

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
this I I think I going to use 304 shook

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.649 
this I I think I going to use 304 shook
and<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:55.020> know<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.740> track<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.939> 450

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
and you know it's the track to the 450

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.020 
and you know it's the track to the 450
is<00:01:57.780> quite<00:01:58.049> difficult<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.799> bikes<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.610> lot

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
is quite difficult the bikes are a lot

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.870 
is quite difficult the bikes are a lot
of<00:02:00.060> power<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.930> more<00:02:01.560> heavy<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.340> think

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
of power and and more heavy so I think

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.810 
of power and and more heavy so I think
you<00:02:03.719> know<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.130> try<00:02:05.430> some<00:02:05.640> more

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
you know and we have to try some more

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.960 
you know and we have to try some more
but<00:02:06.060> at<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.630> moment<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.979> 304<00:02:08.729> show

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
but at the moment I I like the 304 show

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.590 
but at the moment I I like the 304 show
can<00:02:09.379> it's

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
can it's

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.250 
can it's
very<00:02:10.840> good<00:02:11.050> power<00:02:11.260> for<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:12.100> small<00:02:12.370> bike<00:02:12.580> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
very good power for a small bike and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.340 
very good power for a small bike and
it's<00:02:14.260> very<00:02:14.590> light<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.820> think<00:02:16.210> we<00:02:17.020> can<00:02:17.200> do

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
it's very light and I think we can do

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.560 
it's very light and I think we can do
some<00:02:17.560> damage<00:02:17.590> with<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.070> bike<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.670> races

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
some damage with this bike in the races
