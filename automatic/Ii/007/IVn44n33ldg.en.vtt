00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
mouse pointer so for example since I'm

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.810 
mouse pointer so for example since I'm
in<00:02:44.050> here<00:02:45.360> well<00:02:46.360> let's<00:02:46.600> say<00:02:46.720> frame<00:02:47.020> 10<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.920> want

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
in here well let's say frame 10 I want

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.300 
in here well let's say frame 10 I want
to<00:02:48.880> fill<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.090> with<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.330> different<00:02:49.750> color<00:02:49.930> like

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
to fill it with a different color like

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.940 
to fill it with a different color like
the<00:02:51.310> metal<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:53.230> somewhere<00:02:53.710> in<00:02:53.770> the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
the metal and then somewhere in the

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.040 
the metal and then somewhere in the
middle<00:02:54.190> here<00:02:54.330> i'm<00:02:55.330> going<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.660> do<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.750> shape

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
middle here i'm going to do a shape

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.560 
middle here i'm going to do a shape
tween<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:57.280> when<00:02:57.550> this<00:02:57.670> plays<00:02:58.030> it's<00:02:58.330> going<00:02:58.510> to

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
tween so when this plays it's going to

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.340 
tween so when this plays it's going to
change<00:02:58.600> colors<00:02:59.350> like<00:02:59.530> this<00:03:00.570> all<00:03:01.570> right<00:03:01.840> so<00:03:02.320> i

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
change colors like this all right so i

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.220
