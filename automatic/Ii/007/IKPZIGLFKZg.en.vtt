hey<00:00:00.599> guys<00:00:00.810> some<00:00:01.079> Watson<00:00:01.380> from<00:00:01.589> tech<00:00:01.829> fusions

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hey guys some Watson from tech fusions

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.770 
hey guys some Watson from tech fusions
here<00:00:02.490> and<00:00:02.669> today<00:00:02.820> we're<00:00:03.120> going<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.419> be<00:00:03.540> doing

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
here and today we're going to be doing

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.170 
here and today we're going to be doing
some<00:00:04.080> benchmark<00:00:04.620> tests<00:00:05.160> on<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.819> samsung

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
some benchmark tests on the samsung

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.179 
some benchmark tests on the samsung
galaxy<00:00:06.569> ace<00:00:06.600> 2<00:00:06.750> so<00:00:07.529> can<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:07.740> watching<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.130> find

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
galaxy ace 2 so can you watching to find

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:27.320 
galaxy ace 2 so can you watching to find
out<00:00:08.429> more

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.970 

so<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:28.510> benchmark<00:00:29.020> test<00:00:29.289> we<00:00:29.470> will<00:00:29.500> be<00:00:29.770> doing

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
so the benchmark test we will be doing

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.490 
so the benchmark test we will be doing
today<00:00:30.250> is<00:00:30.660> quadrant<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:32.470> a<00:00:32.710> 2<00:00:32.890> 2<00:00:33.100> 2<00:00:33.370> 2<00:00:33.580> 2<00:00:33.700> 2<00:00:34.030> 2

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
today is quadrant and a 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.940 
today is quadrant and a 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
and<00:00:35.500> Anna<00:00:36.190> 2<00:00:36.370> to<00:00:36.610> 3<00:00:37.420> D<00:00:37.660> so<00:00:38.200> that's<00:00:38.410> just<00:00:38.770> for

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
and Anna 2 to 3 D so that's just for

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.530 
and Anna 2 to 3 D so that's just for
like<00:00:39.129> graphics<00:00:39.610> and<00:00:39.760> gaming<00:00:40.059> them<00:00:40.180> what<00:00:40.360> not

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
like graphics and gaming them what not

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.420 
like graphics and gaming them what not
and<00:00:40.720> I<00:00:41.110> thought<00:00:41.350> this<00:00:41.590> pain<00:00:41.769> is<00:00:41.920> pretty<00:00:42.190> neat

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
and I thought this pain is pretty neat

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.729 
and I thought this pain is pretty neat
and<00:00:42.640> good<00:00:42.910> full<00:00:43.120> of<00:00:43.239> its<00:00:43.809> price<00:00:44.140> it's<00:00:44.559> a

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
and good full of its price it's a

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.729 
and good full of its price it's a
mid-range<00:00:45.190> frame<00:00:45.610> and<00:00:45.820> it<00:00:46.510> does<00:00:46.780> bring<00:00:47.440> good

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
mid-range frame and it does bring good

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.430 
mid-range frame and it does bring good
performance<00:00:48.400> so<00:00:48.940> let's<00:00:49.510> see<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:49.839> benchmarks

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
performance so let's see the benchmarks

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.310 
performance so let's see the benchmarks
we're<00:00:51.100> going<00:00:51.220> to<00:00:51.280> do<00:00:51.460> quadrant<00:00:52.000> first<00:00:52.300> I'm<00:00:53.080> not

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
we're going to do quadrant first I'm not

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.290 
we're going to do quadrant first I'm not
going<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.650> keep<00:00:54.250> talking<00:00:54.430> throughout<00:00:54.970> the

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
going to keep talking throughout the

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.319 
going to keep talking throughout the
whole<00:00:55.480> video<00:00:55.809> or<00:00:56.019> speed<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.469> up<00:00:56.590> and<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:58.149> can

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
whole video or speed it up and you can

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.029 
whole video or speed it up and you can
just<00:00:58.480> see<00:00:58.629> it<00:00:58.660> run<00:00:58.930> and<00:00:59.230> play<00:00:59.379> some<00:00:59.469> awesome

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039

jokin okay let's press test and see what
it<00:02:17.640> does<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.870> before<00:02:19.049> it<00:02:19.230> was<00:02:19.349> like<00:02:19.530> pretty

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
it does so before it was like pretty

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.610 
it does so before it was like pretty
high<00:02:20.010> brains<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:21.110> don't<00:02:22.110> know<00:02:22.170> why<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.349> going

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
high brains so don't know why is going

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.530 
high brains so don't know why is going
on<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.890> internet<00:02:23.220> probably<00:02:24.060> tap<00:02:24.239> something

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
on the internet probably tap something

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.530 
on the internet probably tap something
now<00:02:24.660> right<00:02:25.349> so<00:02:26.130> let's<00:02:26.579> see<00:02:26.790> how<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:27.000> performs

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
now right so let's see how it performs

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.460 
now right so let's see how it performs
on<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.319> benchmark<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.660> lets<00:02:31.079> you<00:02:31.290> use<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
on this benchmark and lets you use the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:03:23.390 
on this benchmark and lets you use the
domestic

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.570 

and<00:03:24.930> we're<00:03:25.930> back<00:03:26.200> so<00:03:26.590> as<00:03:26.890> you<00:03:27.010> can<00:03:27.129> see<00:03:27.370> to

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
and we're back so as you can see to

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.589 
and we're back so as you can see to
score<00:03:27.849> is<00:03:28.120> actually<00:03:28.569> pretty<00:03:29.319> good<00:03:29.470> it's<00:03:29.709> of<00:03:29.890> a

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
score is actually pretty good it's of a

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.550 
score is actually pretty good it's of a
4614<00:03:31.599> and<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.739> good<00:03:32.980> for<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.450> mid-range

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
4614 and that is good for a mid-range

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.860 
4614 and that is good for a mid-range
android<00:03:35.560> device<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.220> pretty<00:03:37.209> fast<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.659> snappy

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
android device is pretty fast and snappy

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.320 
android device is pretty fast and snappy
or<00:03:38.440> gotta<00:03:38.650> say<00:03:38.860> you<00:03:38.920> don't<00:03:39.310> notice<00:03:39.640> any<00:03:39.910> lag<00:03:40.150> on

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
or gotta say you don't notice any lag on

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.780 
or gotta say you don't notice any lag on
this<00:03:40.480> device<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.080> this<00:03:41.830> that<00:03:42.069> benchmarks

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
this device and this that benchmarks

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.640 
this device and this that benchmarks
just<00:03:43.030> shows<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.390> so<00:03:43.569> it's<00:03:43.720> got<00:03:43.959> three<00:03:44.440> stars

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
just shows it so it's got three stars

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.780 
just shows it so it's got three stars
out<00:03:44.890> five<00:03:45.310> which<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.269> what<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:47.230> expect<00:03:47.650> from<00:03:48.519> a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
out five which is what to expect from a
