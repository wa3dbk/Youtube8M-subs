00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
this video I'm going to show something

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.610 
this video I'm going to show something
that's<00:00:35.700> never<00:00:36.030> been<00:00:36.300> shown<00:00:36.690> before<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
web the first video game ever built by

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.410 
web the first video game ever built by
yours<00:00:40.530> truly<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.790> don't<00:00:42.059> want<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> stick

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
yours truly if you don't want to stick

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.700 
yours truly if you don't want to stick
around<00:00:42.450> I've<00:00:42.809> got<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.079> formula<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
around I've got the formula on the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.410 
around I've got the formula on the
screen<00:00:43.980> otherwise<00:00:44.789> let's<00:00:45.120> start<00:00:45.300> digging

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
screen otherwise let's start digging

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.950 
screen otherwise let's start digging
into<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.219> so<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> first<00:00:47.370> step<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.000> start<00:00:48.360> small

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
into it so the first step is start small

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.319 
into it so the first step is start small
and<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> more<00:00:50.789> important

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and this is one of the more important

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.119 
and this is one of the more important
steps<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> lot<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> people<00:00:52.440> don't<00:00:52.680> realize

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
steps that a lot of people don't realize

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.250 
steps that a lot of people don't realize
when<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.000> talk<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> lot<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.629> people<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.020> want

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
when I talk to a lot of people that want

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
when I talk to a lot of people that want
to<00:00:55.410> build<00:00:55.530> games<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.160> lot<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.730> times<00:00:56.910> they<00:00:57.030> tell

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
to build games a lot of times they tell

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
to build games a lot of times they tell
me<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.480> want<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> build<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.109> an<00:00:58.289> MMO<00:00:58.770> or<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
me they want to build like an MMO or a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.389 
me they want to build like an MMO or a
3d<00:01:00.239> first-person<00:01:00.480> shooter<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> these<00:01:02.129> games

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
3d first-person shooter and these games

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.729 
3d first-person shooter and these games
are<00:01:02.579> really<00:01:03.000> difficult<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.870> build<00:01:04.019> especially

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
are really difficult to build especially

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.190 
are really difficult to build especially
when<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.129> no<00:01:05.159> foundational<00:01:06.090> knowledge

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
when you have no foundational knowledge

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.870 
when you have no foundational knowledge
as<00:01:07.200> humans<00:01:07.710> were<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.100> driven<00:01:08.310> by<00:01:08.490> feedback

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
as humans were really driven by feedback

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.210 
as humans were really driven by feedback
and<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.810> start<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.320> big<00:01:10.500> game<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.040> may

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and if you start on a big game you may

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.340 
and if you start on a big game you may
never<00:01:11.490> finish<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.810> may<00:01:12.960> never<00:01:13.170> get

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
never finish it and you may never get

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.410 
never finish it and you may never get
that<00:01:13.530> valuable<00:01:13.979> feedback<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> get<00:01:15.180> from

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
that valuable feedback that you get from

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.380 
that valuable feedback that you get from
actually<00:01:15.630> playing<00:01:16.140> your<00:01:16.350> own<00:01:16.380> finished<00:01:17.009> game

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
actually playing your own finished game

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.640 
actually playing your own finished game
but<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.630> start<00:01:18.900> with<00:01:18.930> something<00:01:19.229> small

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
but if you start with something small

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.070 
but if you start with something small
you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.100> finish<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.479> polish<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.990> up

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
you can finish it you can polish it up

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.980 
you can finish it you can polish it up
and<00:01:22.350> hey<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> working<00:01:23.970> game<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.840> can

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
and hey you have a working game you can

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.570 
and hey you have a working game you can
look<00:01:25.170> back<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.890> think<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.189> all<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
look back on it and think of all the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.280 
look back on it and think of all the
steps<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.060> took<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.450> build<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.780> from<00:01:27.930> start<00:01:28.200> to

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
steps it took to build it from start to

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.469 
steps it took to build it from start to
finish<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.829> then<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.670> can<00:01:29.850> think<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.270> what

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
finish and then you can think of what

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.149 
finish and then you can think of what
steps<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.079> would<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> modify<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.920> make

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
steps you would have to modify to make

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.460 
steps you would have to modify to make
it<00:01:32.430> bigger<00:01:32.689> so<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.990> why<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.140> think

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it bigger so this is why I think

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.859 
it bigger so this is why I think
starting<00:01:34.890> small<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.460> important<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> on

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
starting small is so important and on

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.450 
starting small is so important and on
the<00:01:37.049> screen<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.470> see<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> second<00:01:38.159> game<00:01:38.340> I

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the screen you see the second game I

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.940 
the screen you see the second game I
ever<00:01:38.490> built<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.119> space<00:01:39.780> shooter<00:01:40.140> game<00:01:40.350> written

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
ever built a space shooter game written

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.490 
ever built a space shooter game written
in<00:01:41.100> JavaScript<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> second<00:01:43.200> thing<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
in JavaScript so the second thing in the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.800 
in JavaScript so the second thing in the
equation<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.130> practice<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> screen

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
equation is practice and on the screen

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.569 
equation is practice and on the screen
you'll<00:01:46.079> see<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> third<00:01:46.619> game<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.009> built<00:01:47.250> which

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
you'll see the third game I built which

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.550 
you'll see the third game I built which
is<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> multiplayer<00:01:48.420> tic-tac-toe<00:01:49.290> game

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
is a multiplayer tic-tac-toe game

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.850 
is a multiplayer tic-tac-toe game
written<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.640> c-sharp<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.500> top<00:01:52.680> of

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
written in c-sharp and it's on top of

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 
written in c-sharp and it's on top of
the<00:01:52.950> Unity<00:01:53.369> game<00:01:53.399> engine<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.540> brings<00:01:54.840> us

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the Unity game engine and this brings us

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.569 
the Unity game engine and this brings us
to<00:01:55.140> part<00:01:55.290> two<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.710> equation<00:01:56.189> which<00:01:56.549> is

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
to part two of the equation which is

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.700 
to part two of the equation which is
practice<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.869> think<00:01:57.899> practice<00:01:58.560> is

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
practice and I think practice is

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.889 
practice and I think practice is
essential<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.219> anyone<00:01:59.790> who<00:02:00.329> works<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
essential for anyone who works in a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.050 
essential for anyone who works in a
profession<00:02:01.409> where<00:02:01.560> they're<00:02:02.189> surrounded<00:02:03.030> by

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
profession where they're surrounded by

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.480 
profession where they're surrounded by
software<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.560> America<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.189> have<00:02:05.219> this

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
software so in America we have this

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.850 
software so in America we have this
misconception<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.079> misconception<00:02:07.770> is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
misconception and the misconception is

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.740 
misconception and the misconception is
that<00:02:07.920> some<00:02:08.310> programmers<00:02:08.819> are<00:02:09.179> naturally

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that some programmers are naturally

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.520 
that some programmers are naturally
better<00:02:09.899> than

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
better than

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.500 
better than
others<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.520> entire<00:02:11.790> films<00:02:12.300> based

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
others and we have entire films based

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.600 
others and we have entire films based
off<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:13.140> we<00:02:13.350> have<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.890> Facebook<00:02:14.130> film

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
off of this we have the Facebook film

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.430 
off of this we have the Facebook film
with<00:02:14.790> Mark<00:02:15.030> Zuckerberg<00:02:15.080> where<00:02:16.080> they<00:02:16.170> make<00:02:16.319> him

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
with Mark Zuckerberg where they make him

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.900 
with Mark Zuckerberg where they make him
out<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:16.800> some<00:02:16.830> type<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.130> genius<00:02:17.459> that

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
out to be some type of genius that

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.240 
out to be some type of genius that
everyone<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:18.990> his<00:02:19.170> class<00:02:19.410> at<00:02:19.620> Harvard<00:02:19.920> no<00:02:20.100> one

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
everyone in his class at Harvard no one

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.309 
everyone in his class at Harvard no one
could<00:02:20.430> keep<00:02:20.520> up<00:02:20.730> with<00:02:20.880> him<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.840> we<00:02:21.959> even<00:02:22.110> have

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
could keep up with him and we even have

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.590 
could keep up with him and we even have
terminology<00:02:23.010> like<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.459> 10x<00:02:23.910> programmer<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
terminology like the 10x programmer the

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.110 
terminology like the 10x programmer the
program<00:02:24.959> are<00:02:25.080> capable<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.680> doing<00:02:26.220> ten<00:02:26.790> times

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
program are capable of doing ten times

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.580 
program are capable of doing ten times
the<00:02:27.330> amount<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.569> things<00:02:27.780> as<00:02:27.959> your<00:02:28.080> average<00:02:28.260> one

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
the amount of things as your average one

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.979 
the amount of things as your average one
just<00:02:29.250> because<00:02:29.370> he's<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:29.760> intelligent<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.569> I'm

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
just because he's so intelligent so I'm

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.270 
just because he's so intelligent so I'm
going<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.200> tell<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.440> right<00:02:31.620> off<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.920> bat<00:02:32.100> that

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
going to tell you right off the bat that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.680 
going to tell you right off the bat that
this<00:02:32.520> is<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> load<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.090> bullcrap

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
this is a load of bullcrap

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.600 
this is a load of bullcrap
and<00:02:33.780> there's<00:02:34.230> no<00:02:34.410> such<00:02:34.620> thing<00:02:34.860> as<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.100> genius

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
and there's no such thing as a genius

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.090 
and there's no such thing as a genius
programmer<00:02:35.819> for<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> most<00:02:36.690> part<00:02:37.010> when<00:02:38.010> you

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
programmer for the most part when you

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.620 
programmer for the most part when you
meet<00:02:38.250> someone<00:02:38.489> who<00:02:38.610> seems<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.000> be<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.180> genius

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
meet someone who seems to be a genius

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.479 
meet someone who seems to be a genius
programmer<00:02:39.840> nine<00:02:40.470> times<00:02:40.770> out<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:40.980> ten<00:02:41.220> they're

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
programmer nine times out of ten they're

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.610 
programmer nine times out of ten they're
not<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.670> genius<00:02:42.120> programmer<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:43.320> reality

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
not a genius programmer and in reality

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.590 
not a genius programmer and in reality
they<00:02:44.010> just<00:02:44.250> practice<00:02:44.430> way<00:02:44.850> more<00:02:45.090> than<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.390> and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
they just practice way more than you and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600 
they just practice way more than you and
possibly<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.470> better<00:02:46.709> study<00:02:47.040> habits<00:02:47.430> than

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
possibly have better study habits than

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.310 
possibly have better study habits than
you<00:02:47.730> do<00:02:47.910> see<00:02:48.390> humans<00:02:48.720> are<00:02:48.810> naturally<00:02:49.140> very

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
you do see humans are naturally very

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.680 
you do see humans are naturally very
ambiguous<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.220> software<00:02:50.880> has<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.090> lack<00:02:51.450> all

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
ambiguous and software has to lack all

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.380 
ambiguous and software has to lack all
ambiguity<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:53.160> naturally<00:02:53.670> one<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.150> best

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
ambiguity so naturally one of the best

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.729 
ambiguity so naturally one of the best
things<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.720> can<00:02:54.900> do<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.200> become<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> better

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
things you can do to become a better

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.340 
things you can do to become a better
developer<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.489> just<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.569> write<00:02:57.780> more<00:02:57.930> software

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
developer is just to write more software

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.229 
developer is just to write more software
so<00:02:59.160> here's<00:02:59.370> one<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.730> games<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.180> came

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
so here's one of the games that came

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.059 
so here's one of the games that came
after<00:03:00.750> my<00:03:00.900> multiplayer<00:03:01.410> tic-tac-toe<00:03:02.040> game

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
after my multiplayer tic-tac-toe game

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.340 
after my multiplayer tic-tac-toe game
and<00:03:02.459> quite<00:03:03.060> frankly<00:03:03.420> it's<00:03:03.690> nothing<00:03:04.110> but<00:03:04.290> a

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
and quite frankly it's nothing but a

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.860 
and quite frankly it's nothing but a
flappy<00:03:04.830> bird<00:03:04.860> club<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.550> in<00:03:06.150> order<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.569> build

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
flappy bird club and in order to build

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.600 
flappy bird club and in order to build
this<00:03:07.140> game<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.620> just<00:03:07.920> spent<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.220> ton<00:03:08.430> of<00:03:08.489> time

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
this game I just spent a ton of time

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.520 
this game I just spent a ton of time
googling<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.660> many<00:03:09.840> other<00:03:10.019> people<00:03:10.230> had

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.900 
built the game etc and the reason I
built<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.709> game<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.190> because<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.489> realized

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
built this game is because I realized

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.819 
built this game is because I realized
that<00:03:21.030> flappy<00:03:21.510> bird<00:03:21.660> was<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.900> wild<00:03:22.200> success<00:03:22.350> and

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
that flappy bird was a wild success and

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.319 
that flappy bird was a wild success and
I<00:03:22.950> want<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.250> try<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.459> tear<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.850> apart<00:03:23.910> and

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
I want to try to tear that apart and

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.509 
I want to try to tear that apart and
figure<00:03:24.570> out<00:03:24.600> why<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:25.350> was<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:25.920> entertaining

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
figure out why it was so entertaining

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.280 
figure out why it was so entertaining
and<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.269> brings<00:03:27.570> me<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.810> my<00:03:27.959> third<00:03:27.989> point

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
and that brings me to my third point

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.699 
and that brings me to my third point
which<00:03:28.920> is<00:03:29.130> polish<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:29.850> polish<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:31.079> critical

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709

when you're implementing the core

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.810 
when you're implementing the core
features<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.890> learn<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.310> lot<00:03:44.549> about

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
programming as a game developer it's

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.569 
programming as a game developer it's
very<00:03:48.840> important<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.440> have<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.590> solid<00:03:50.040> grasp<00:03:50.160> of

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
very important to have a solid grasp of

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.849 
very important to have a solid grasp of

programming fundamentals and this is

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.949 
programming fundamentals and this is
because<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.459> code<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.970> basically<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.750> glue

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
because the code is basically the glue

because the code is basically the glue

that ties your game together it's almost

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.190 
that ties your game together it's almost

some<00:04:17.880> mayonnaise<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:19.109> all<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.919> sudden<00:04:20.190> you

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
some mayonnaise and all of a sudden you

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.790 
some mayonnaise and all of a sudden you
have<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.430> BLT<00:04:20.789> it's<00:04:21.659> not<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:22.260> two<00:04:22.409> pieces<00:04:22.770> of

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
have a BLT it's not just two pieces of

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.330 
have a BLT it's not just two pieces of
bread<00:04:23.039> any

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
bread any

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.970 
bread any
now<00:04:24.060> it's<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.389> fully-fledged<00:04:24.980> delicious

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
now it's a fully-fledged delicious

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.550 
now it's a fully-fledged delicious
sandwich<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.790> that<00:04:27.480> just<00:04:27.720> sounds<00:04:28.020> so<00:04:28.290> much

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
sandwich and that just sounds so much

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.159 
sandwich and that just sounds so much
more<00:04:28.919> appetizing<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:30.060> this<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:30.990> why<00:04:31.110> the

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
more appetizing and this is why the

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.560 
more appetizing and this is why the
Polish<00:04:31.680> element<00:04:32.130> is<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:32.430> critical<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.090> this

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
Polish element is so critical and this

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.600 
Polish element is so critical and this
is<00:04:33.720> why<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:33.900> can't<00:04:34.290> just<00:04:34.380> stop<00:04:34.830> at<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.370> coat

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
is why you can't just stop at the coat

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.300 
is why you can't just stop at the coat
if<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.419> stop<00:04:36.690> at<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.930> code<00:04:37.169> your<00:04:37.830> game<00:04:38.100> is

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
if you stop at the code your game is

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.740 
if you stop at the code your game is
going<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:38.490> be<00:04:38.580> really<00:04:38.940> dry<00:04:39.150> as<00:04:39.449> could<00:04:39.660> be

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
going to be really dry as could be

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.590 
going to be really dry as could be
really<00:04:40.020> boring<00:04:40.430> right<00:04:41.430> so<00:04:42.210> you<00:04:42.300> need<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.570> think

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
really boring right so you need to think

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.600 
really boring right so you need to think
of<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.169> art<00:04:43.320> assets<00:04:43.770> you<00:04:44.010> need<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.280> think<00:04:44.460> of

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
of the art assets you need to think of

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.969 
of the art assets you need to think of
the<00:04:44.729> sounds<00:04:45.270> you<00:04:45.870> need<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.110> think<00:04:46.290> of<00:04:46.440> how<00:04:46.740> does

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
the sounds you need to think of how does

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.760 
the sounds you need to think of how does
the<00:04:47.220> user<00:04:47.460> interact<00:04:48.150> with<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.540> game<00:04:48.840> how<00:04:49.530> does

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
the user interact with the game how does

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.770 
the user interact with the game how does
the<00:04:49.979> graphic<00:04:50.400> user<00:04:50.610> interface<00:04:50.729> work<00:04:51.360> if<00:04:51.600> there

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
the graphic user interface work if there

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.370 
the graphic user interface work if there
is<00:04:51.930> one

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
is one

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.250 
is one
what's<00:04:52.949> the<00:04:53.100> control<00:04:53.490> scheme<00:04:53.729> and<00:04:53.970> then<00:04:54.840> some

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
what's the control scheme and then some

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.200 
what's the control scheme and then some
things<00:04:55.410> that<00:04:55.710> indie<00:04:56.220> game<00:04:56.400> developers<00:04:56.880> don't

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
things that indie game developers don't

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.909 
things that indie game developers don't
seem<00:04:57.450> to<00:04:57.570> think<00:04:57.750> about<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:57.990> lot<00:04:58.200> is<00:04:58.440> the

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
seem to think about a lot is the

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.580 
seem to think about a lot is the
psychology<00:04:59.340> of<00:04:59.820> the<00:05:00.450> user<00:05:00.690> playing<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.380> game

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
psychology of the user playing the game

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.920 
psychology of the user playing the game
so<00:05:02.250> I'd<00:05:02.460> like<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.669> use<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:02.970> game<00:05:03.300> as<00:05:03.510> an<00:05:03.660> example

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
so I'd like to use a game as an example

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.930 
so I'd like to use a game as an example
for<00:05:04.080> this<00:05:04.350> and<00:05:04.590> that<00:05:04.950> game<00:05:05.220> is<00:05:05.430> League<00:05:05.820> of

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
but one thing I can say about that was

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.969 
but one thing I can say about that was
League<00:05:24.360> of<00:05:24.479> Legends<00:05:24.810> was<00:05:24.960> not<00:05:25.229> a<00:05:25.440> very<00:05:25.710> good

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
League of Legends was not a very good

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.810 
League of Legends was not a very good

were<00:05:29.940> very<00:05:30.210> poor<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:31.080> gameplay<00:05:31.530> was<00:05:31.680> really

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
were very poor the gameplay was really

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.940

entirely by accident so League of

be<00:05:48.630> the<00:05:48.750> right<00:05:48.960> environment<00:05:49.470> where<00:05:50.099> you<00:05:50.220> could

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
be the right environment where you could

be the right environment where you could
really<00:05:50.639> get<00:05:50.849> into<00:05:50.910> the<00:05:51.210> game<00:05:51.240> and<00:05:51.660> you<00:05:52.110> could

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
really get into the game and you could

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:53.420 
really get into the game and you could
play<00:05:52.500> with<00:05:52.590> your<00:05:52.740> friends<00:05:53.220> and<00:05:53.340> you're

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
how to beat the enemy team so I believe

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.279 
how to beat the enemy team so I believe
that's<00:05:59.849> what<00:06:00.060> has<00:06:00.240> allowed<00:06:00.510> League<00:06:01.139> of

that's what has allowed League of

first game I ever made I made this game
in<00:06:23.880> late<00:06:24.120> middle<00:06:24.389> school<00:06:24.660> and<00:06:24.840> I<00:06:25.320> called<00:06:25.590> it

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
in late middle school and I called it

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.190 
in late middle school and I called it
weight<00:06:25.889> loss<00:06:26.130> simulator<00:06:26.669> the<00:06:27.389> idea<00:06:27.690> was<00:06:27.990> if

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
weight loss simulator the idea was if

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.690 
weight loss simulator the idea was if
you<00:06:28.320> run<00:06:28.560> on<00:06:28.590> the<00:06:28.770> treadmills<00:06:29.220> long<00:06:29.460> enough

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
you run on the treadmills long enough

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.760 
you run on the treadmills long enough
without<00:06:30.000> falling<00:06:30.419> your<00:06:31.169> character<00:06:31.560> will

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
without falling your character will

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.070 
without falling your character will
eventually<00:06:32.340> become<00:06:32.550> skinnier<00:06:33.419> and<00:06:33.570> while

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
eventually become skinnier and while

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.020 
eventually become skinnier and while
that's<00:06:34.289> a<00:06:34.469> little<00:06:34.710> bit<00:06:34.860> humorous<00:06:35.219> it's<00:06:35.580> not
