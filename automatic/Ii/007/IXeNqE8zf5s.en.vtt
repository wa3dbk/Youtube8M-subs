I<00:00:41.829> don't<00:00:42.610> think<00:00:42.670> super<00:00:43.329> fussy<00:00:43.720> first<00:00:43.989> couple

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
I don't think super fussy first couple

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.750 
I don't think super fussy first couple
of<00:00:44.379> years<00:00:44.440> when<00:00:44.769> we<00:00:44.890> had<00:00:45.040> to<00:00:45.160> add<00:00:45.280> an<00:00:45.430> under

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
of years when we had to add an under

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.780 
of years when we had to add an under
there<00:00:45.970> was<00:00:46.059> a<00:00:46.090> lot<00:00:46.300> of<00:00:46.860> individual<00:00:47.860> needs<00:00:48.129> that

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
there was a lot of individual needs that

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.610 
there was a lot of individual needs that
needed<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.210> be<00:00:49.329> taken<00:00:49.540> care<00:00:49.720> of<00:00:49.900> but<00:00:50.140> not<00:00:50.409> so

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
needed to be taken care of but not so

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.189 
needed to be taken care of but not so
much<00:00:50.769> this<00:00:51.010> year<00:00:51.070> I<00:00:51.280> think<00:00:52.170> predominantly<00:00:53.170> a

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
much this year I think predominantly a

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.439 
much this year I think predominantly a
lot<00:00:53.500> of<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.800> teams<00:00:54.460> are<00:00:54.699> quite<00:00:54.970> happy<00:00:55.210> with

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
lot of the teams are quite happy with

buffet<00:00:58.150> so<00:00:58.420> which<00:00:58.930> is<00:00:59.079> kind<00:00:59.320> of<00:00:59.409> good<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.680> it

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
buffet so which is kind of good to it
