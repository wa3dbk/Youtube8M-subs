00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello my name is laurence guarneri 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.620
 I have a cooking school in Paris that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.820
 is called tips and tricks i 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.460
 go today show you how 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.430
 make clarified butter without skimmer 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.570
 we need a packet of butter 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.369
 from 250 grams of a bowl to bottom and 3 and 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.910
 so of a wafer of butter that I 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.769
 cut in half we will lead this bowl 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.630
 with the teeth butter in the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.450
 microwave and we're going to do it 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.200
 melt thawing position is 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.969
 Very important 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.950
 never hotter if not the butter 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.460
 explodes in the microwave the butter 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.739
 molten 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.989
 I let him rest for three minutes 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.690
 in the kitchen especially without mixing it 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.320
 with a spoon neither anything and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.000
 I take it in the fridge 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.510
 for a few hours the time he's re 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.590
 harden the butter is back come 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.370
 to do well but cold I take a 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.799
 little knife and games turn all 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.130
 around the disc 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:10.710
 the disc comes off the hatch 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.930
 I return it you see all the little 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.570
 lake fell to the bottom of my bowl all the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.130
 rest of the whey that is still 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.780
 stuck on my record that I scratch I 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.680
 shave my butter in very cold water 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.840
 I finish clusters and what's left of 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.840
 little milk I drop them 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.689
 I take a piece of films and I pose 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:47.319
 my record 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.990
 I close you have a butter 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.659
 clarified also called butter town 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.289
 who does not have whey anymore 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.049
 is it 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.849
 there is more whey so the little 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.469
 butter can heat without risking 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:00.700
 burn when you want to make 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.170
 scallops when you 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.750
 want to make small potatoes 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.579
 when you want to skip a little vegetable 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.899
 you'll actually a Beur that tastes 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.879
 hazelnut 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.709
 but who can not blacken anymore who does not 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.910
 can no longer have small black dots 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.950
 in time we called in particular 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.569

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.720
 extremely harmful to health 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.030
 and it's a very, very easy technique 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.519
 because you do not have to skim the 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.319
 butter to skim the whey as are 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.569
