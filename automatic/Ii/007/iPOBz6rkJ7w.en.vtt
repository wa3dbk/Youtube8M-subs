 company represents your farm 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:12.090
 attention petrol huter dy6500lx and 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.400
 footer electric produces portable 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.310
 diesel and gasoline generators 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.920
 filter is an indispensable source of energy for 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.150
 provide backup seasonal or 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.859
 emergency power supply these 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.080
 generators can be used in 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.789
 a country house in an office while on holiday 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.369
 construction yes wherever only 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.890
 need a powerful and mobile source 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.190
 power generator dy6500lx 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.559
 and 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.890
 cope even with such consumers 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.140
 as a welding inverter this generator 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.680
 can work both on gasoline and on 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.079
 gas 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.670
 but to work on gas you need 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.940
 purchase an additional kit 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.399
 gas supply systems serve 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.530
 such a generator is quite simply necessary 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.280
 just before every run or every 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.930
 12 hours 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.930
 check the oil level 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.240
 after 100 hours of work or six months 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.789
 replace the spark plug after 50 hours 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.520
 operating or three months rinse 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.090
 air filter in soapy water 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.820
 rinse in clean 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:28.310
 dry completely immerse in lubricant 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.619
 oil and set it in place every 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.250
 100 hours of work or three months 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.689
 service filter power system 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.030
 remember that when detecting any 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.310
 defect filter elements needed 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.200
 replace with new 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.259
 rated voltage 220 volts 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.090
 rated power 5 kilowatt way 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.020
 run manual or 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.020
 electric starter 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.090
 fuel consumption 2.3 liters of petrol per hour 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.170
 fuel tank capacity 22 liters weight 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.820
 generator seventy seven kilograms 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.290
 This model is equipped with an automatic 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.030
 reserve transfer system 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.530
 what is it now show this system 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.000
 automatically turns on the generator 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.000
 at power off 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.790
 and also automatically disables 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.410
 generator when resuming feed 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:49.790
 power supplies 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:51.440
 central network besides work and 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.020
 the generator can be controlled by 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.760
 remote control on 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.760
 distance up to 15 meters 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.939
