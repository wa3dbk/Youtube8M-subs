00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
of the Year but it would be a shame if

of the Year but it would be a shame if
this<00:00:43.770> was<00:00:43.980> basically<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.850> carbon<00:00:45.180> copy<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.899> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
this was basically a carbon copy with a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.959 
this was basically a carbon copy with a
different<00:00:46.350> branch<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.920> front<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
different branch on the front but the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.690 
different branch on the front but the
good<00:00:48.329> news<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.140> identical

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
good news is that it's not identical

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.979 
good news is that it's not identical
certainly<00:00:50.700> from<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> outside<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
certainly from the outside and the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.569 
certainly from the outside and the
inside<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.530> they<00:00:52.620> say<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.949> everything

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
inside that they say that everything

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.700 
inside that they say that everything
that<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.629> different<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that you can see is different so in the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.709 
that you can see is different so in the
bits<00:00:55.860> underneath<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.699> oily<00:00:56.910> stuff<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.449> the

bits underneath the oily stuff and the

bits underneath the oily stuff and the
chassis<00:00:58.079> etc<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.010> shared<00:00:59.250> between<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
chassis etc that is shared between the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.170 
chassis etc that is shared between the
two<00:00:59.699> cars<00:01:01.129> as<00:01:02.129> well<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.309> looking<00:01:02.820> difference

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
two cars as well as looking difference

two cars as well as looking difference
than<00:01:03.359> ascent<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> car<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.320> also<00:01:04.530> slightly

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
than ascent the car is also slightly

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.859 
than ascent the car is also slightly
bigger<00:01:05.400> than<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> cash<00:01:05.880> guide<00:01:06.150> not<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:06.720> much

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
bigger than the cash guide not so much

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.179 
bigger than the cash guide not so much
that<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.140> should<00:01:07.290> notice<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.979> about

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
that you should notice it out and about

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.100 
that you should notice it out and about
it's<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.670> fairly<00:01:08.909> marginal<00:01:09.270> difference<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.930> far

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it's a fairly marginal difference as far

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.140 
it's a fairly marginal difference as far
as<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:10.350> concerned<00:01:10.500> however<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.640> does<00:01:11.880> mean

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
as that's concerned however it does mean

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.969 
as that's concerned however it does mean
that<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.510> things<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.900> eight<00:01:13.260> slightly

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
that you get things like eight slightly

or more in the case of the CRV it is a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.140 
or more in the case of the CRV it is a
fairly<00:01:31.979> practical<00:01:32.579> space<00:01:32.790> though<00:01:33.000> you've<00:01:33.119> got

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
fairly practical space though you've got

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.080 
fairly practical space though you've got
little<00:01:33.420> things<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.520> divider<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:35.939> so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
little things like this divider here so

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.090 
little things like this divider here so
you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.329> split<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.020> boot<00:01:37.350> space<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.950> keep

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
you can split up the boot space and keep

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310 
you can split up the boot space and keep
things<00:01:38.369> separate<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.600> also<00:01:39.780> use

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
things separate and you can also use

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.530 
things separate and you can also use
them<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.650> an<00:01:41.009> adjustable<00:01:41.640> boot<00:01:41.939> floor<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
them as an adjustable boot floor so you

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.539 
them as an adjustable boot floor so you
can<00:01:42.600> raise<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.320> lower<00:01:43.350> things<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.159> nice
