think<00:04:49.910> you<00:04:50.180> have<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.390> pay<00:04:50.570> for<00:04:50.630> this<00:04:50.870> one

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
think you have to pay for this one

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.500 
think you have to pay for this one
though<00:04:51.260> but<00:04:51.950> it's<00:04:52.130> not<00:04:52.250> worth<00:04:52.550> it<00:04:52.700> because<00:04:52.850> you

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
though but it's not worth it because you

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.830 
though but it's not worth it because you
can<00:04:53.690> like<00:04:53.870> make<00:04:54.110> them<00:04:54.290> mirrored<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:56.600> think

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
can like make them mirrored and I think

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.020 
can like make them mirrored and I think
it's<00:04:56.960> really<00:04:57.080> cool<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:58.460> next<00:04:58.760> thing<00:04:58.850> that<00:04:58.910> I

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
it's really cool the next thing that I

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.880 
it's really cool the next thing that I
have<00:04:59.150> is<00:04:59.300> Photoshop<00:04:59.840> Express<00:04:59.990> which<00:05:00.650> i<00:05:00.800> think

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
have is Photoshop Express which i think
