00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.899
 fourth place in contrast to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.120
 prejudices minecraft is not a world 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.640

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.159
 in intangible quotes after number 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.860

 that I put you several small 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.360
 information that in my opinion together 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.430
 was doing something huge 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.950
 as you can see when we open the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.550
 texture of zombies girls lead in 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.440
 Minecraft 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.420
 we notice that there is written down to 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.880

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.430

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.890
 thanks to the creator who created the 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.050
 texture for the zombie pittman on 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.150
 continues and one notices by way in 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.680
 minecraft there are some frames that 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.680
 you can see on the front row 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.480

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.780

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.730

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.530
