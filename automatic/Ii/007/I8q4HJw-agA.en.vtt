00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello everyone here greets you again 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.690
 your good friend lord shuar and today 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.389
 I'm here to show you how 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.900
 find slides in your version of 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.000
 minecraft xbox 360 good in order so that 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.100
 see that like the last time the tutorial 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.160
 it's one hundred percent I'm going to load my 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.289
 starting from this point too 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.750
 see this same as the last time in 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.539
 survival mode and difficulty 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.800
 hard 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:33.050
 now or by environment are not it line 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.480
 in front of us but it was that what 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.510
 I found good the question is that I 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.570
 I was exploring this mine that I eat 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.460
 can see you have already wanted and I have put 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.519
 torches although they do not have to take the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.309
 minerals and was about to return to me 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.079
 Previous location to exit the mine 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.930
 to understand me and against it 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.710
 you're there now I'm going to kill him for 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.710
 can pass 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.030
 there 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.040
 i 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.450
 now note the little kids is never 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.450
 more have your materials 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.390
 stop dancing darn life 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.730
 in short the easiest way to find 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.150
 what is the one you just saw is to be 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.280
 in the deepest parts of the map that 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.550
 as you can see this was generated to us 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.430
 height of 14 bone the aie that tells us the 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.640
 height from what source or 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.250
 made of rock as you like to say that 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.470
 so whether they find a cesc 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.410
 lines that means that area is 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.950
 prone to be generated then 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:58.250
 we can proceed to create our farm 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.530
 des lines that I will show you now 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.380
 in my tutor I the past showed you how 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.350
 create the incorporate of the expanded more 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.270
 of what I was and see, a c 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.270
 another is line are here 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.780
 in itself you have to have patience to be able 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.420
 find these is line because as you 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.360
 said 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:27.860
 the slim ones are only generated in locations 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.860
 fixed and very deep heights 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.810
 in this case, I put it like I said 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.720
 previously to a height block the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.340
 source block 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.340
 as you can see here is 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.730
 a block of height 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.540
 good this 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.709
 and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.769
 in 100 if this is a lot of patience since 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.709
 the zones although the let's say the grams 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.870
 In these areas, it is not easy to 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.659
 Exact location as you can see this 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.739
 this is another land farm and I do not know 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:08.079
 generated nothing and the first sly I found 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.180
 I was just in this area but 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.260
 will say why it does not generate it below 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:18.510
 this place the answer is very simple 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.510
 let me below this 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.570
 lava river, well, that 's how 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.940
 you can find the olive trees 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.150
 as you like to say on your map 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.040
 minecraft xbox360 edition these can 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.260
 generated while we are exploring 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.270
 the deepest mines of the map already 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.190
 from that point we can start the 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.930
 creation of farms in order if 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.910
 they ask why I am now with the 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.070
 Loquendo instead of continuing with the video 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.140
 who were watching that is very simple 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.150
 As I fell to the lava I ended up saying 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.980
 some things that should not be said 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.200
 but in the end I hope that this little 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.950
 tutorial has pleased them and be of 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.080
 a lot of help 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.120
 there are only two last data according to my 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.430
 SLIM own research is 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.350
 generate at a maximum height of 16 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.540
 blocks and if we stay in the area 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.030
 a new one will be generated every five or ten 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.220
 minutes for that reason it's always good 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.230
 bring a map to hand in good order a 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.870
 once said all this I say goodbye so 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.030
 until the next video I finally ask 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.010
 apologies for the failures that occurred in the 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.900
 video but after investigating I've 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.970
 realized that as my compu is very 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.950
 old when recording is slow and then in those 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.950
 moments the sound is synchronized
