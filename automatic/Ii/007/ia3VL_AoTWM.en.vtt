the years as well John and it seems like

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.440 
the years as well John and it seems like
we're<00:00:34.980> getting<00:00:35.160> more<00:00:35.280> compact<00:00:35.730> more<00:00:36.090> features

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
we're getting more compact more features

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.569 
we're getting more compact more features
built<00:00:36.690> into<00:00:36.870> smaller<00:00:37.170> space<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.250> lot<00:00:38.399> more

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
built into smaller space and a lot more

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.549 
built into smaller space and a lot more
integration<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:39.270> well<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.780> looking<00:00:40.379> at<00:00:40.469> the

integration as well and looking at the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.500 
integration as well and looking at the
vector<00:00:40.860> system<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.700> pretty<00:00:42.059> much<00:00:42.180> ever<00:00:42.420> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
applications tell us a little bit about

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.049 
applications tell us a little bit about
the<00:00:50.219> vector<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.640> what<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> thought<00:00:51.030> process

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the vector and what the thought process

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.389 
the vector and what the thought process
was<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.020> what<00:00:52.379> we're<00:00:52.530> now<00:00:52.620> looking<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:53.129> that

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
was and what we're now looking at that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.240 
was and what we're now looking at that
completes<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.320> well<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.469> took<00:00:55.649> some<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.190> our

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
completes this well we took some of our

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.369 
completes this well we took some of our
best<00:00:56.489> technology<00:00:57.120> from<00:00:57.480> all<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.870> our<00:00:57.960> products

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
best technology from all of our products

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.590 
best technology from all of our products
and<00:00:58.500> put<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.710> into<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.309> have<00:00:59.600> technology

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and put it into this we have technology

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.200 
and put it into this we have technology
from<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> OSD<00:01:01.199> probe<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.859> data<00:01:02.070> recorder<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
from the OSD probe the data recorder the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
from the OSD probe the data recorder the
guardian<00:01:04.049> stabilized<00:01:04.439> our<00:01:04.589> all-in-one<00:01:04.890> then

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
guardian stabilized our all-in-one then

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.250 
guardian stabilized our all-in-one then
we<00:01:05.309> added<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> lot<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.820> new<00:01:06.000> features<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.750> so

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
we added a lot of new features to it so

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.960 
we added a lot of new features to it so
basically<00:01:07.560> when<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.799> get<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> vector<00:01:08.520> you're

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
basically when you get the vector you're

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.850 
basically when you get the vector you're
getting<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.720> Guardian<00:01:10.110> technology<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.770> it

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
getting the Guardian technology in it

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.649 
getting the Guardian technology in it
from<00:01:10.950> stabilization<00:01:11.700> you're<00:01:12.270> getting<00:01:12.510> our

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
from stabilization you're getting our

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.170 
from stabilization you're getting our
OSD<00:01:13.110> -<00:01:13.290> pro<00:01:13.740> technology<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:15.060> screen

built-in voltage regulator everything

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.560 
built-in voltage regulator everything
you<00:01:23.490> need<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> get<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.119> running<00:01:24.270> right

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
you need to get up and running right

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.450 
you need to get up and running right
away<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.259> package<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:25.890> opposed<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> having

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
away in one package as opposed to having

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.460 
away in one package as opposed to having
to<00:01:26.670> add<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.000> different<00:01:27.360> other<00:01:27.810> pieces<00:01:28.080> yeah

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
to add on different other pieces yeah

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.270 
to add on different other pieces yeah
and<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:28.979> thing<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
and that was one thing with the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.649 
and that was one thing with the
challenge<00:01:29.579> before<00:01:29.850> because<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.360> wasn't

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
challenge before because it just wasn't

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.270 
challenge before because it just wasn't
there<00:01:30.810> yet<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.290> technology<00:01:31.890> wasn't<00:01:32.070> all

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
there yet the technology wasn't all

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.310 
there yet the technology wasn't all
unified<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.909> integrated<00:01:33.000> way<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> buy<00:01:34.049> pieces

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
unified and integrated way to buy pieces

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.050 
unified and integrated way to buy pieces
here<00:01:34.650> there<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.040> everything<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> connect

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
here there and everything to connect

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.399 
here there and everything to connect
together<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.659> when<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.900> when<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> was

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
together and when that when that was

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.830 
together and when that when that was
released<00:01:37.770> some<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.880> technology<00:01:39.240> wasn't

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
released some of that technology wasn't

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.450 
released some of that technology wasn't
available<00:01:40.020> yet<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.040> became<00:01:41.280> available

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
available yet so as it became available

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.460 
available yet so as it became available
we<00:01:41.790> made<00:01:42.210> add-ons<00:01:42.659> for<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.320> made<00:01:43.439> it

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
we made add-ons for it and made it

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.620 
we made add-ons for it and made it
available<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.070> upgraded<00:01:44.820> our<00:01:44.939> firmware<00:01:45.180> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
available and upgraded our firmware and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.210 
available and upgraded our firmware and
made<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.990> available<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.619> already<00:01:46.829> had<00:01:46.979> the

now with the vector at a real high level

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.950 
now with the vector at a real high level
you've<00:01:56.460> got<00:01:56.490> on-screen<00:01:56.969> displays<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.479> GPS

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
you've got on-screen displays that GPS

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.190 
you've got on-screen displays that GPS

big<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.960> big<00:02:07.170> difference<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.009> does

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
big a big difference is that it does

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.949 
big a big difference is that it does
support<00:02:08.369> multi<00:02:09.060> rotor<00:02:09.239> which<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.929> uh

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
to home at you can have it for a

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.030 
to home at you can have it for a
multicopter<00:02:26.050> land<00:02:26.290> if<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.590> want<00:02:26.800> or<00:02:27.010> just

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
multicopter land if you want or just

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.950 
multicopter land if you want or just
hover<00:02:27.400> when<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.760> comes<00:02:27.910> back<00:02:28.060> really<00:02:28.420> okay<00:02:28.750> and

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
hover when it comes back really okay and

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.980 
hover when it comes back really okay and
you<00:02:29.260> can<00:02:29.350> do<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.620> by<00:02:29.860> command<00:02:30.280> or<00:02:30.670> by

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
you can do that by command or by

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.780 
you can do that by command or by
failsafe<00:02:31.990> so<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:32.920> can<00:02:33.280> have<00:02:33.460> it<00:02:33.580> as<00:02:33.730> a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
failsafe so you can have it as a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.550 
failsafe so you can have it as a
fail-safe<00:02:34.180> if<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:34.810> lose<00:02:35.020> signal<00:02:35.290> or

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
fail-safe if you lose signal or

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.650 
fail-safe if you lose signal or
something<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:36.130> or<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.060> can<00:02:37.210> command<00:02:37.480> it

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
something and or you can command it

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.270 
something and or you can command it
anytime<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.020> want<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.410> do<00:02:38.560> yeah<00:02:38.890> that's

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
anytime you want to do yeah that's

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.130 
anytime you want to do yeah that's
really<00:02:39.430> practical<00:02:39.970> now<00:02:40.690> when<00:02:40.840> we<00:02:40.930> talk<00:02:41.110> about

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
really practical now when we talk about

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.480 
really practical now when we talk about
the<00:02:41.440> capabilities<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.980> vector<00:02:42.220> being

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
the capabilities of the vector being

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.400 
the capabilities of the vector being
kind<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:42.940> at<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.180> at<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.810> large<00:02:44.050> end<00:02:44.320> of

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
kind of at the at the large end of

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.230 
kind of at the at the large end of
things<00:02:44.620> for<00:02:44.920> full<00:02:45.280> spectrum<00:02:45.670> capabilities

is<00:03:07.360> can<00:03:07.690> interface<00:03:07.990> with<00:03:08.050> any<00:03:08.320> of<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.530> current

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
is can interface with any of the current

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.880 
is can interface with any of the current
receivers<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.750> control<00:03:11.230> systems<00:03:11.530> out<00:03:11.680> there

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
receivers and control systems out there

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.130 
receivers and control systems out there
right<00:03:12.070> now<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.790> just<00:03:12.850> has<00:03:13.240> standard<00:03:13.810> servo

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
right now it just has standard servo

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.960 
right now it just has standard servo
plugs<00:03:14.410> standard<00:03:14.920> connections<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.610> plug<00:03:15.850> it

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
plugs standard connections you plug it

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.340 
plugs standard connections you plug it
in<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.269> put<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.510> in<00:03:16.600> between<00:03:16.720> your<00:03:16.900> receiver

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
in you put it in between your receiver

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.290 
in you put it in between your receiver
and<00:03:17.650> your<00:03:17.709> servos<00:03:18.100> on<00:03:18.250> your<00:03:18.370> plane<00:03:18.610> it'll<00:03:19.150> work

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
and your servos on your plane it'll work

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.660 
and your servos on your plane it'll work
pretty<00:03:19.480> much<00:03:19.630> on<00:03:19.780> any<00:03:19.930> plane<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.310> has

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
pretty much on any plane and it has

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.630 
pretty much on any plane and it has
basically<00:03:22.300> two<00:03:22.720> modes<00:03:22.959> 2d<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.560> 3d<00:03:23.640> which

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
basically two modes 2d and 3d which

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.400 
basically two modes 2d and 3d which
don't<00:03:25.000> necessarily<00:03:25.450> mean<00:03:25.630> if<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.050> want<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.320> do

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
don't necessarily mean if you want to do

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.520 
don't necessarily mean if you want to do
3d<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.890> go<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.040> 3d<00:03:27.310> mode<00:03:27.580> or<00:03:27.820> 2d<00:03:28.090> mode<00:03:28.350> 2d<00:03:29.350> mode

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
3d you go to 3d mode or 2d mode 2d mode

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.710 
3d you go to 3d mode or 2d mode 2d mode
is<00:03:29.650> basically<00:03:29.680> Auto<00:03:30.400> leveling<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.150> gives<00:03:31.600> you

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
is basically Auto leveling it gives you

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.410 
is basically Auto leveling it gives you
a<00:03:31.750> good<00:03:31.959> fail<00:03:32.290> back<00:03:32.560> or<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.430> failsafe<00:03:33.910> if<00:03:34.330> you

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
a good fail back or a failsafe if you

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.790 
a good fail back or a failsafe if you
have<00:03:34.570> a<00:03:34.600> problem<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:35.350> lose<00:03:35.620> orientation

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
have a problem and you lose orientation

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.310 
have a problem and you lose orientation
or<00:03:36.430> for<00:03:36.970> whatever<00:03:37.120> reason<00:03:37.269> somebody<00:03:37.810> new<00:03:38.110> is

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
or for whatever reason somebody new is

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.320 
or for whatever reason somebody new is
learning<00:03:38.530> how<00:03:38.769> to<00:03:38.800> fly<00:03:39.010> it's<00:03:39.700> always<00:03:40.000> gonna<00:03:40.120> go

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
learning how to fly it's always gonna go

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.850 
learning how to fly it's always gonna go
back<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.570> level<00:03:40.900> flight<00:03:41.170> when<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.560> release

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
back to level flight when you release

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.590 
back to level flight when you release
the<00:03:41.890> stick<00:03:42.310> okay<00:03:42.610> so<00:03:42.940> it's<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.180> good<00:03:43.330> failsafe

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
the stick okay so it's a good failsafe

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.710 
the stick okay so it's a good failsafe
and<00:03:44.050> a<00:03:44.110> good<00:03:44.290> recovery<00:03:44.590> set<00:03:45.310> up<00:03:45.430> 3d<00:03:46.330> is<00:03:46.480> gonna

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
and a good recovery set up 3d is gonna

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.140 
and a good recovery set up 3d is gonna
hold<00:03:46.989> orientation<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.769> put<00:03:47.950> it<00:03:48.040> into<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:49.000> if

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
hold orientation you put it into so if

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.000 
hold orientation you put it into so if
you're<00:03:49.300> learning<00:03:49.570> a<00:03:49.660> new<00:03:49.690> maneuver<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.440> of

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
you're learning a new maneuver and of

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.860 
you're learning a new maneuver and of
hovering<00:03:51.610> or<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:51.940> high<00:03:52.360> area

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870

hi Harry ER or knife edge it's gonna

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.210 
hi Harry ER or knife edge it's gonna
really<00:03:55.630> help<00:03:55.870> you<00:03:56.019> learn<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:57.010> give<00:03:57.190> you

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
in 3d mode is okay works great now in 2d

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.400 
in 3d mode is okay works great now in 2d
mode<00:04:07.209> we<00:04:07.330> talked<00:04:07.540> about<00:04:07.660> not<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.049> best<00:04:08.230> thing

get it up in the air and his personal
preference<00:04:10.299> a<00:04:10.360> lot<00:04:10.510> of<00:04:10.600> guys<00:04:10.799> use<00:04:11.799> it<00:04:11.950> in<00:04:12.040> both

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
preference a lot of guys use it in both

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.430 
preference a lot of guys use it in both
modes<00:04:12.519> okay<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:13.090> like<00:04:13.420> 3d<00:04:13.750> mode<00:04:13.930> better<00:04:14.140> because

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
modes okay I like 3d mode better because

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.110 
modes okay I like 3d mode better because
a<00:04:14.470> holds<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:14.920> orientation<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.549> put<00:04:15.730> it<00:04:15.820> into

as you start to release the sticks it's

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.500 
as you start to release the sticks it's

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
still going to hold that orientation

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.630 
still going to hold that orientation
2d<00:04:20.229> mode<00:04:20.470> as<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:20.739> start<00:04:21.100> to<00:04:21.160> release<00:04:21.340> sticks

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.860 
2d mode as you start to release sticks
it's<00:04:21.729> going<00:04:21.850> to<00:04:21.910> try<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.120> level<00:04:22.390> off<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.630> little

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
it's going to try to level off a little

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.570 
it's going to try to level off a little
bit<00:04:22.990> more<00:04:23.169> if<00:04:23.289> you

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
bit more if you

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.339 
bit more if you
enough<00:04:23.819> altitude<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.389> can<00:04:24.509> be<00:04:24.659> concerning<00:04:25.020> but

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
enough altitude it can be concerning but

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.929 
enough altitude it can be concerning but
here<00:04:25.620> again<00:04:26.129> it's<00:04:26.430> personal<00:04:26.729> preference

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:26.939 
here again it's personal preference

here again it's personal preference
there's<00:04:27.240> guys<00:04:27.389> doing<00:04:27.689> it<00:04:27.780> in<00:04:27.870> both<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.199> prefer

when<00:04:50.580> you're<00:04:50.669> setting<00:04:51.000> up<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.210> Guardian<00:04:51.599> of

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
when you're setting up the Guardian of

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:52.640 
when you're setting up the Guardian of
course<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:51.990> need<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.139> make<00:04:52.289> sure<00:04:52.319> your

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
course you need to make sure your

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.050 
course you need to make sure your
transmitters<00:04:53.310> making<00:04:53.669> your<00:04:53.759> control

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
transmitters making your control

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.480 
transmitters making your control
surfaces<00:04:54.419> move<00:04:54.629> the<00:04:54.780> correct<00:04:55.020> direction<00:04:55.490> then

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
surfaces move the correct direction then

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.070 
surfaces move the correct direction then
you<00:04:56.580> need<00:04:56.729> to<00:04:56.789> make<00:04:56.909> sure<00:04:56.969> that<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.479> Guardians

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
you need to make sure that the Guardians

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.719 
you need to make sure that the Guardians
control<00:04:58.710> is<00:04:58.919> moving<00:04:59.219> the<00:04:59.310> correct<00:04:59.610> direction

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
control is moving the correct direction

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.580 
control is moving the correct direction
in<00:05:00.150> other<00:05:00.330> words<00:05:00.479> when<00:05:00.659> you<00:05:00.780> move<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.349> plane

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
in other words when you move the plane

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.339 
in other words when you move the plane
around<00:05:01.949> you<00:05:02.550> want<00:05:02.699> it<00:05:02.789> to<00:05:02.879> counteract<00:05:03.419> you

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
around you want it to counteract you

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:05.600 
around you want it to counteract you
know<00:05:04.440> what<00:05:04.650> what's<00:05:04.979> happening<00:05:05.430> with<00:05:05.520> the

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
know what what's happening with the

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.850 
know what what's happening with the
control<00:05:05.909> surfaces<00:05:06.389> once<00:05:07.080> you<00:05:07.229> get<00:05:07.379> those<00:05:07.560> set

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
control surfaces once you get those set

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.230 
control surfaces once you get those set
then<00:05:08.039> you<00:05:08.069> don't<00:05:08.219> want<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.430> fly<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.639> plane<00:05:08.909> and

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
then you don't want to fly the plane and

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.689 
then you don't want to fly the plane and
trim<00:05:09.419> it<00:05:09.539> with<00:05:09.569> the<00:05:09.750> Guardian<00:05:10.110> off<00:05:10.289> you<00:05:11.039> need

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
trim it with the Guardian off you need

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:12.800 
trim it with the Guardian off you need
to<00:05:11.759> make<00:05:11.940> sure<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.389> airframe<00:05:12.690> is

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
to make sure that the airframe is

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.180 
to make sure that the airframe is
capable<00:05:13.169> of<00:05:13.289> flying<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.860> is<00:05:13.919> set<00:05:14.099> up

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
capable of flying and is set up

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.010 
capable of flying and is set up
correctly<00:05:14.430> you<00:05:14.639> have<00:05:14.819> a<00:05:14.849> good<00:05:15.000> CG<00:05:15.449> mm-hmm<00:05:15.930> and

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
correctly you have a good CG mm-hmm and

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.540 
correctly you have a good CG mm-hmm and
you<00:05:16.319> know<00:05:16.409> the<00:05:16.529> Guardian<00:05:16.889> is<00:05:16.979> so<00:05:17.129> good<00:05:17.310> it<00:05:17.430> can

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
you know the Guardian is so good it can

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.219 
you know the Guardian is so good it can
mask<00:05:17.789> some<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.090> those<00:05:18.240> problems<00:05:18.539> if<00:05:18.870> you<00:05:18.960> do<00:05:19.080> it

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
mask some of those problems if you do it

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.439 
mask some of those problems if you do it
without<00:05:19.379> setting<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.069> plane<00:05:20.250> up<00:05:20.400> first<00:05:20.699> so

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
without setting the plane up first so

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.149 
without setting the plane up first so
you<00:05:21.539> know<00:05:21.719> you<00:05:21.870> get<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.229> CG<00:05:22.560> right<00:05:22.770> fly<00:05:23.099> the

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
you know you get the CG right fly the

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.339 
you know you get the CG right fly the
plane<00:05:23.430> trim<00:05:23.789> it<00:05:23.909> you<00:05:24.479> bring<00:05:24.719> it<00:05:24.840> down<00:05:25.020> then<00:05:25.259> you

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
plane trim it you bring it down then you

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.499 
plane trim it you bring it down then you
set<00:05:25.590> level<00:05:25.919> flight<00:05:26.159> you<00:05:26.430> put<00:05:26.699> the<00:05:26.789> plane<00:05:27.000> level

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
set level flight you put the plane level

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.100 
set level flight you put the plane level
and<00:05:27.719> there's<00:05:28.319> a<00:05:28.520> mode<00:05:29.520> switch<00:05:29.990> operation<00:05:30.990> that

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
and there's a mode switch operation that

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.110 
and there's a mode switch operation that
you<00:05:31.229> do<00:05:31.379> that<00:05:31.590> teaches<00:05:32.009> the<00:05:32.159> Guardian<00:05:32.520> okay

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
you do that teaches the Guardian okay

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.730 
you do that teaches the Guardian okay
that's<00:05:33.330> level<00:05:33.509> flight<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.169> that's<00:05:34.289> the<00:05:34.529> trim

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
that's level flight and that's the trim

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.499 
that's level flight and that's the trim
that<00:05:34.860> needs<00:05:35.069> to<00:05:35.159> be<00:05:35.279> in<00:05:35.400> it<00:05:35.520> normal<00:05:36.270> flying

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
that needs to be in it normal flying

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.390 
that needs to be in it normal flying
after<00:05:37.409> that<00:05:37.590> then<00:05:37.830> you're<00:05:37.949> just<00:05:38.009> gonna<00:05:38.159> work

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
after that then you're just gonna work

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.159 
after that then you're just gonna work
on<00:05:38.639> flying<00:05:39.060> it<00:05:39.300> with<00:05:39.599> the<00:05:39.719> different<00:05:40.020> game

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
on flying it with the different game

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.570 
on flying it with the different game
settings<00:05:40.650> and<00:05:40.830> get<00:05:40.889> it<00:05:41.009> so<00:05:41.159> you<00:05:41.219> don't<00:05:41.400> have

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
settings and get it so you don't have

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.480 
settings and get it so you don't have
too<00:05:41.789> much<00:05:41.909> game<00:05:42.240> and<00:05:42.889> make<00:05:43.889> sure<00:05:44.039> that's<00:05:44.190> tuned

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
too much game and make sure that's tuned

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.800 
too much game and make sure that's tuned
correctly<00:05:44.729> for<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.210> type<00:05:45.389> of<00:05:45.509> fly<00:05:45.629> and<00:05:45.750> you're

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
correctly for the type of fly and you're

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.629 
correctly for the type of fly and you're
gonna<00:05:45.960> do<00:05:46.199> after<00:05:46.889> that<00:05:46.979> you<00:05:47.250> don't<00:05:47.310> have<00:05:47.430> to<00:05:47.550> do

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
gonna do after that you don't have to do

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.399 
gonna do after that you don't have to do
that<00:05:47.789> every<00:05:48.000> time<00:05:48.029> that's<00:05:48.419> done<00:05:48.810> you

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
that every time that's done you

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:50.839 
that every time that's done you
shouldn't<00:05:49.680> have<00:05:49.770> to<00:05:49.919> reset<00:05:50.219> level<00:05:50.460> flight<00:05:50.669> or

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
shouldn't have to reset level flight or

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.189 
shouldn't have to reset level flight or
trims<00:05:51.150> unless<00:05:51.360> you<00:05:51.509> make<00:05:51.659> a<00:05:51.690> change<00:05:51.990> of<00:05:52.110> the

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
trims unless you make a change of the

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.050 
trims unless you make a change of the
airframe<00:05:52.589> so<00:05:52.830> yeah<00:05:53.009> that's<00:05:53.460> pretty<00:05:53.520> much<00:05:53.819> done

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
airframe so yeah that's pretty much done

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.129 
airframe so yeah that's pretty much done
for<00:05:54.089> the<00:05:54.330> rest<00:05:54.479> of<00:05:54.539> your<00:05:54.629> plan<00:05:54.779> a<00:05:54.870> couple<00:05:55.080> of

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
for the rest of your plan a couple of

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.450

capability<00:06:27.000> basically<00:06:27.690> just<00:06:27.779> run<00:06:27.930> a<00:06:27.960> y4y

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
capability basically just run a y4y

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.920 
capability basically just run a y4y
around<00:06:28.830> both<00:06:29.009> sides<00:06:29.219> right<00:06:29.490> so<00:06:30.419> it's<00:06:30.599> not<00:06:30.659> all

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
around both sides right so it's not all

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.790
