some<00:00:47.520> 410<00:00:48.000> gear<00:00:48.300> car<00:00:49.020> was<00:00:49.200> pretty<00:00:49.500> much<00:00:49.650> moving

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
some 410 gear car was pretty much moving

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.820 
some 410 gear car was pretty much moving
pretty<00:00:50.190> fast<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.820> had<00:00:51.059> at<00:00:51.180> 740<00:00:51.960> s<00:00:52.110> which<00:00:52.559> pretty

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
pretty fast I had at 740 s which pretty

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.549 
pretty fast I had at 740 s which pretty
much<00:00:52.920> equated<00:00:53.400> to<00:00:53.430> 1139<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.080> quarter-mile

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
much equated to 1139 in the quarter-mile

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.670 
much equated to 1139 in the quarter-mile
so<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.930> car<00:00:58.140> was<00:00:58.320> putting

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
so and this is this car was putting

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.400 
so and this is this car was putting
those<00:00:58.800> numbers<00:00:59.129> down<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> bracket<00:00:59.910> racer

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
those numbers down like a bracket racer

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.990 
those numbers down like a bracket racer
every<00:01:01.410> time<00:01:01.650> at<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:01.949> strip<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.550> obviously<00:01:02.910> I

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
every time at the strip so obviously I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.640 
every time at the strip so obviously I
wanted<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.360> go<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> little<00:01:03.600> bit<00:01:03.809> faster<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.440> my

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
wanted to go a little bit faster with my

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.890

was<00:01:07.110> naturally<00:01:07.590> aspirated<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.220> really<00:01:08.850> wanted

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
was naturally aspirated I really wanted

the supercharger into the actual intake
manifold<00:02:26.950> which<00:02:27.069> has<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.220> couple<00:02:27.640> really<00:02:27.819> cool

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
manifold which has a couple really cool

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.369 
manifold which has a couple really cool
things<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.599> actually<00:02:28.959> dropped<00:02:29.230> the

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
things it actually dropped the

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.530 
things it actually dropped the
supercharger<00:02:30.069> down<00:02:30.430> into<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.060> valley<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.510> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
supercharger down into the valley of the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.660 
supercharger down into the valley of the
motor<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:32.379> allows<00:02:32.650> for<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.890> 15-inch<00:02:33.400> runner

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
motor this allows for a 15-inch runner

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.250 
motor this allows for a 15-inch runner
which<00:02:33.880> really<00:02:34.150> maximizes<00:02:34.720> your<00:02:34.840> torque<00:02:35.079> and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
which really maximizes your torque and

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.080 
which really maximizes your torque and
also<00:02:35.859> allows<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.130> factory<00:02:36.670> hood<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.910> clear

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
also allows a factory hood to clear

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.009 
also allows a factory hood to clear
because<00:02:37.209> of<00:02:37.329> how<00:02:37.540> low<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.989> supercharger

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
because of how low the supercharger

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.650 
because of how low the supercharger
actually<00:02:38.859> sits

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.870 

so<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.350> overall<00:02:42.620> installation<00:02:42.980> is<00:02:43.310> kit<00:02:43.580> was

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
so the overall installation is kit was

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.130 
so the overall installation is kit was
pretty<00:02:44.120> basic<00:02:44.270> first<00:02:44.720> we<00:02:44.810> start<00:02:44.990> with<00:02:45.050> the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
pretty basic first we start with the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.990 
pretty basic first we start with the
disassembly<00:02:45.560> which<00:02:45.980> was<00:02:46.310> removing<00:02:46.820> hood

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
disassembly which was removing hood

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.690 
disassembly which was removing hood
removing<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.960> front<00:02:48.170> bumper<00:02:48.380> cover<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:49.130> just

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
removing the front bumper cover and just

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.920 
removing the front bumper cover and just
getting<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:49.940> couple<00:02:50.090> general<00:02:50.450> things<00:02:50.750> out<00:02:50.900> of

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
getting a couple general things out of

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.370 
getting a couple general things out of
the<00:02:51.080> way

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
the way

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.410 
the way
then<00:02:52.190> once<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.460> get<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.640> intake<00:02:52.970> manifold

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
then once you get the intake manifold

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.520 
then once you get the intake manifold
out<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.630> way<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:53.780> ready<00:02:54.050> start<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.380> couple

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
out of the way you ready start a couple

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.290 
out of the way you ready start a couple
modifications<00:02:55.310> now<00:02:55.520> we<00:02:55.820> don't<00:02:55.910> really<00:02:56.150> make<00:02:56.270> a

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
modifications now we don't really make a

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.090 
modifications now we don't really make a
lot<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.630> major<00:02:56.750> modifications<00:02:57.410> but<00:02:57.740> main

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
lot of major modifications but main

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.290 
lot of major modifications but main
thing<00:02:58.130> that<00:02:58.370> we<00:02:58.460> have<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.610> do<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:58.910> modify<00:02:59.150> the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
thing that we have to do is modify the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.300 
thing that we have to do is modify the
cooling<00:02:59.630> system<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.990> little<00:03:00.080> bit<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.440> allow<00:03:00.560> for

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
cooling system a little bit to allow for

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.590 
cooling system a little bit to allow for
the<00:03:01.370> actual<00:03:01.610> new<00:03:01.820> cooling<00:03:02.120> system<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.510> we're

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
the actual new cooling system that we're

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.850 
the actual new cooling system that we're
going<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.750> install<00:03:03.080> for<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.320> supercharger

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
going to install for the supercharger

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.560 
going to install for the supercharger
the<00:03:04.310> main<00:03:04.460> wiring<00:03:04.730> is<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:04.970> water<00:03:05.180> pump<00:03:05.390> which

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
the main wiring is a water pump which

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.940 
the main wiring is a water pump which
itself<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.020> pretty<00:03:06.170> simple<00:03:06.290> but<00:03:06.740> you<00:03:06.800> also

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
itself is pretty simple but you also

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.350 
itself is pretty simple but you also
have<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.160> couple<00:03:07.310> other<00:03:07.460> harnesses<00:03:08.030> like<00:03:08.180> for

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
have a couple other harnesses like for

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.090 
have a couple other harnesses like for
example<00:03:08.750> get<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.260> separate<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.710> mass<00:03:09.860> airflow

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
example get to separate the mass airflow

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.190 
example get to separate the mass airflow
sensor<00:03:10.280> signal<00:03:10.910> out<00:03:11.030> from<00:03:11.210> the<00:03:11.300> IAT<00:03:11.540> because

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
sensor signal out from the IAT because

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.330 
sensor signal out from the IAT because
IAT<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.710> want<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:12.920> see<00:03:12.980> what<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:13.160> temperature

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
IAT you want to see what the temperature

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.040 
IAT you want to see what the temperature
is<00:03:13.580> at<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.030> supercharger<00:03:14.630> so<00:03:14.810> there's<00:03:14.990> a

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
is at the supercharger so there's a

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.690 
is at the supercharger so there's a
simple<00:03:15.230> harness<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.800> separates<00:03:16.310> out<00:03:16.490> that

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
simple harness that separates out that

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.580 
simple harness that separates out that
IAT<00:03:17.030> signal<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.720> puts<00:03:17.990> it<00:03:18.080> right<00:03:18.110> into<00:03:18.440> the

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
IAT signal and puts it right into the

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.470 
IAT signal and puts it right into the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
back of the intake manifold okay now

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.700 
back of the intake manifold okay now
we've<00:03:20.630> got<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.900> supercharger<00:03:21.440> actually

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
we've got the supercharger actually

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.320 
we've got the supercharger actually
sitting<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.070> place<00:03:22.280> installed<00:03:22.760> torque<00:03:23.150> down

bay<00:03:31.940> just<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.180> nice<00:03:32.420> good<00:03:32.750> once-over<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.320> make

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
bay just a nice good once-over to make

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:46.820 
bay just a nice good once-over to make
sure<00:03:33.590> we<00:03:33.680> didn't<00:03:33.890> forget<00:03:34.070> anything

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.370 

it<00:03:47.830> went<00:03:48.040> for<00:03:48.220> 50<00:03:48.760> at<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.330> 3:30<00:03:49.720> if<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.260> were

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
it went for 50 at the 3:30 if you were

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.830 
it went for 50 at the 3:30 if you were
to<00:03:50.440> go<00:03:50.560> all<00:03:50.890> out<00:03:50.920> if<00:03:51.460> I<00:03:51.730> would<00:03:51.910> have<00:03:52.000> ran<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.150> 690

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
to go all out if I would have ran a 690

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.320 
to go all out if I would have ran a 690
we<00:03:53.140> think<00:03:53.410> absolutely<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.700> car<00:03:54.880> had<00:03:55.030> just<00:03:55.060> a

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
we think absolutely the car had just a

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.230 
we think absolutely the car had just a
ton<00:03:55.480> of<00:03:55.750> power<00:03:56.050> still<00:03:56.440> in<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:56.880> it's<00:03:57.880> so<00:03:58.000> kind<00:03:58.150> of

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
ton of power still in it it's so kind of

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.030 
ton of power still in it it's so kind of
weird<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.540> hit<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.780> brakes<00:03:59.020> at<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.350> end<00:03:59.470> but

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
weird to hit the brakes at the end but

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.820 
weird to hit the brakes at the end but
it<00:04:00.880> is<00:04:01.000> what<00:04:01.210> it<00:04:01.330> is<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.630> got<00:04:01.750> no<00:04:01.930> cage<00:04:02.200> you<00:04:02.680> got

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
it is what it is you got no cage you got

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.410 
it is what it is you got no cage you got
to<00:04:02.920> make<00:04:03.070> sure<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.940> guys<00:04:04.060> do<00:04:04.210> it<00:04:04.270> you<00:04:04.360> guys

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
to make sure you guys do it you guys

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.850 
to make sure you guys do it you guys
need<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.720> make<00:04:04.840> sure<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:05.050> can<00:04:05.200> make<00:04:05.590> another

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
need to make sure you can make another

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.400 
need to make sure you can make another
pass<00:04:06.100> but<00:04:06.430> this<00:04:07.030> next<00:04:07.360> pop<00:04:07.540> we're<00:04:08.140> going<00:04:08.350> to

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
pass but this next pop we're going to

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.670 
pass but this next pop we're going to
get<00:04:08.560> thrown<00:04:08.740> out<00:04:08.980> so<00:04:09.310> I'm<00:04:09.670> going<00:04:10.000> all<00:04:10.150> out

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.949 

so<00:04:13.280> my<00:04:13.459> 13<00:04:13.879> finally<00:04:14.180> got<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:14.450> numbers<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:14.840> we

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
so my 13 finally got the numbers that we

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.060 
so my 13 finally got the numbers that we
were<00:04:15.079> really<00:04:15.260> looking<00:04:15.409> for<00:04:15.769> with<00:04:15.980> the

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
were really looking for with the

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.550 
were really looking for with the
supercharger<00:04:16.340> I<00:04:16.639> went<00:04:17.509> six<00:04:17.810> ninety<00:04:18.169> five<00:04:18.350> in

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
supercharger I went six ninety five in

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.620 
supercharger I went six ninety five in
the<00:04:18.650> eighth<00:04:18.799> mile<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.549> 98<00:04:20.090> miles<00:04:20.329> an<00:04:20.509> hour

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
the eighth mile and 98 miles an hour

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.240 
the eighth mile and 98 miles an hour
which<00:04:20.989> pretty<00:04:21.229> much<00:04:21.320> equated<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:21.799> about<00:04:22.039> ten

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
which pretty much equated to about ten

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.400 
which pretty much equated to about ten
sixty<00:04:22.639> threes<00:04:22.880> in<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.210> porter<00:04:23.509> model<00:04:23.810> which

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
sixty threes in the porter model which

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.580 
sixty threes in the porter model which
in<00:04:24.740> my<00:04:25.190> opinion<00:04:25.280> is<00:04:25.699> great<00:04:26.449> but<00:04:26.900> I<00:04:27.110> did<00:04:27.470> get

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
in my opinion is great but I did get

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.960 
in my opinion is great but I did get
warned<00:04:27.889> out<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.070> truck<00:04:28.310> because<00:04:28.580> I<00:04:28.699> did<00:04:28.850> not

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
warned out the truck because I did not

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.520 
warned out the truck because I did not
have<00:04:29.090> a<00:04:29.150> roll<00:04:29.360> cage<00:04:29.570> that<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:29.810> was<00:04:30.050> going<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.380> get

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
have a roll cage that I was going to get

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.520 
have a roll cage that I was going to get
thrown<00:04:30.740> out<00:04:30.979> so<00:04:31.639> the<00:04:31.820> next<00:04:32.030> run<00:04:32.330> I<00:04:32.539> ran<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.750> 705<00:04:33.500> a

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
thrown out so the next run I ran a 705 a

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.010 
thrown out so the next run I ran a 705 a
97<00:04:34.280> miles<00:04:34.460> an<00:04:34.580> hour<00:04:34.729> which<00:04:35.060> leads<00:04:35.509> to<00:04:35.630> about<00:04:35.900> of

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
97 miles an hour which leads to about of

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.580 
97 miles an hour which leads to about of
1075<00:04:37.009> 1078<00:04:37.789> and<00:04:38.120> of<00:04:38.750> course<00:04:38.960> yes<00:04:39.139> I<00:04:39.320> did<00:04:39.470> get

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
so did achieve the numbers and the times

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.680 
so did achieve the numbers and the times
I<00:04:43.220> was<00:04:43.370> looking<00:04:43.639> for<00:04:43.850> so<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:44.240> didn't<00:04:44.449> get<00:04:44.509> to<00:04:44.630> go

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690
