you charge a couple batteries I mean one
after<00:00:53.550> another<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:54.360> gonna<00:00:54.510> get<00:00:54.750> hurt<00:00:54.960> pretty

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
after another it's gonna get hurt pretty

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.290 
after another it's gonna get hurt pretty
bad<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:56.280> know<00:00:56.430> especially<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> running

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
bad you know especially if you running

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.049 
bad you know especially if you running
from<00:00:57.449> easy<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.680> when<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> open<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.609> find<00:00:59.910> it

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
from easy and when I open it I find it

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.290 
from easy and when I open it I find it
the<00:01:00.570> power<00:01:00.840> supply<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.879> it's

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
the power supply it's like that it's

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.590 
the power supply it's like that it's
like<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.600> little<00:01:04.080> computer<00:01:04.589> laptop<00:01:05.600> power

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
like a little computer laptop power

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.399 
like a little computer laptop power
supply<00:01:07.110> 12<00:01:07.890> volts<00:01:08.310> v<00:01:08.520> app<00:01:08.820> which<00:01:09.780> doesn't<00:01:10.290> have

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
supply 12 volts v app which doesn't have

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.300 
supply 12 volts v app which doesn't have
any<00:01:10.970> initialization<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.510> that's<00:01:12.900> what<00:01:13.310> did

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
any initialization and that's what did

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.450 
any initialization and that's what did
get<00:01:14.790> had<00:01:15.090> pretty<00:01:15.390> bad<00:01:15.570> its<00:01:15.990> power<00:01:16.560> supply<00:01:16.740> what

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
get had pretty bad its power supply what

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.820 
get had pretty bad its power supply what
I<00:01:17.490> did<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.000> take<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.360> apart<00:01:18.720> old<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.229> here's<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
I did I take it apart old one here's a

cover<00:01:20.100> from<00:01:20.460> old<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:20.900> I'll<00:01:21.900> show<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
cover from old one I'll show you is a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.969 
cover from old one I'll show you is a
metal<00:01:24.420> piece<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.930> don't<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.170> why<00:01:25.259> they<00:01:25.409> put<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
metal piece I don't know why they put a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.609 
metal piece I don't know why they put a
dip<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:26.670> aluminum<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.780> will<00:01:28.140> understand

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
dip with aluminum one I will understand

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.499 
dip with aluminum one I will understand
it's<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.799> collusion<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.420> is

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it's like collusion but this one is

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.170 
it's like collusion but this one is
still<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.200> heavy<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.369> not<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> little

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
still it's heavy and it's not a little

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.350 
still it's heavy and it's not a little
observing<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.259> very<00:01:34.890> well<00:01:35.100> hit<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:35.579> aluminum

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
observing to very well hit as aluminum

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.249 
observing to very well hit as aluminum
that's<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.140> bottom<00:01:37.640> portion<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.880> case<00:01:39.259> has

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
that's a bottom portion of a case has

that's a bottom portion of a case has
been<00:01:40.320> attached<00:01:40.799> inside<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.460> double<00:01:41.820> stick

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
been attached inside the double stick

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.450 
been attached inside the double stick
tape<00:01:42.439> basically<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> crack<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.040> off<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
tape basically a crack it off with the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.340 
tape basically a crack it off with the
power<00:01:44.670> supply<00:01:45.170> then<00:01:46.250> original<00:01:47.250> 3-pin<00:01:48.350> outlet

power supply then original 3-pin outlet

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.240 
power supply then original 3-pin outlet
was<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.890> female<00:01:50.750> outlet<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:52.079> connector<00:01:53.009> for

was a female outlet for connector for
power<00:01:54.119> supply<00:01:54.420> itself<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:55.070> take<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.250> out<00:01:56.399> why

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
power supply itself I take it out why

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.080 
power supply itself I take it out why
because<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.600> tripping<00:01:58.079> with<00:01:58.439> ground<00:01:58.820> but<00:01:59.820> an

original power supply and the demon uses
ground<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:03.200> pretty<00:02:04.200> much<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.770> mean<00:02:05.130> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
ground and pretty much it I mean I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.520 
ground and pretty much it I mean I
didn't<00:02:05.700> use<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.119> while<00:02:06.810> they<00:02:07.140> didn't<00:02:07.380> use

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
didn't use it while they didn't use

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.680 
didn't use it while they didn't use
atropine<00:02:08.069> connector<00:02:08.929> what<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> did

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
atropine connector what I did

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.710 
atropine connector what I did
right<00:02:12.380> here<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.740> can<00:02:12.770> see<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.580> board<00:02:13.850> itself

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
right here you can see the board itself

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.370 
right here you can see the board itself
I<00:02:14.750> mean<00:02:15.110> power<00:02:15.350> supply<00:02:15.650> itself<00:02:16.010> no<00:02:16.930> plus<00:02:17.930> no

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
I mean power supply itself no plus no

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.160 
I mean power supply itself no plus no
black<00:02:18.650> housing<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.340> right<00:02:20.030> now<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.930> case

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
black housing it right now that case

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.910

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
I use it to pian I mean it's a much

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.140 
I use it to pian I mean it's a much
smaller<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:45.340> it's<00:02:46.340> pretty<00:02:46.730> simple<00:02:47.090> to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
smaller and it's pretty simple to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.970 
smaller and it's pretty simple to
connect<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.750> also<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.200> like<00:02:48.410> tripping<00:02:48.830> two

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
connect it it also is like tripping two
