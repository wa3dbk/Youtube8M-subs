00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.550
 then now to our water he does today 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.200
 his driving test 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.940
 we were not allowed to use the cbr this time 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.490
 Bring your camera on board 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.470
 that might distract too much though 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.529
 we were allowed to follow the ride with our camera 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.150
 car and that is quite a bit because still 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.240
 never is there on television and really 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.210
 driving test shown and the exam is still 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.489
 but one minute out of water has the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.589
 first brake and grip 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.570
 he wants a road where that is not allowed 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.770
 where to stay there is at least left 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.770
 one becomes that it indicates 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.219
 so backwards and immediately the first dark 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.719
 to tackle 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.879
 you can imagine that he would think 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.980
 I have now dropped 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.750
 but if that were the case the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.969
 examiner to send it another house 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.969
 and not let this drive for another bit 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.960
 but the ride continues 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.790
 so there is still hope 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.490
 I am 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.950
 yes then you should n't stick to that 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:23.170
 Take me think only yourself but 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.860
 examiner gives the candidate a little more try 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.860
 hope to speak 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.990
 it goes from left to right a lot 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.990
 the built-up area some difficult situations 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.460
 and the now well-known bridge 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.460
 utrecht about 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.840
 then we turn right into a bumpy one 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.939
 road over 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:11.140
 speed bumps gate through the 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.140
 last speed bump 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.410
 and right through again on a plate off 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.410
 forbidden to enter water 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.270
 he joined the examiner at the same time 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.720
 on the brake but it is near to the 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.720
 second error 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.780
 so turn left and not right on it 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.560
 it starts right now gradually be 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.560
 a bit bad for water 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.680
 neat for sorting and then another 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.680
 now notorious traffic square 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.860
 the end of the ride is in sight 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.760
 it did not go smoothly 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.760
 turn on the road 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.659
 not the quietest way either 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.709
 but luckily that goes well 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.550
 ends with the first with one 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.400
 then a bit to conclude 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.400
 highway 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.599
 that is already a little better 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.500
 a last special operation it 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.400
 backwards and he has 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.400
 done everything better 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.829
 hello again succeeded no why not 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.959
 well mainly because i am a one way street 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.400
 in re very soon start by us 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.259
 just us and stupid and later again 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.150
 almost 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.979
 and where some more things 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.770
 noticeable lateral movements 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.180
 were not quite right and behavior or 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.479
 traffic square is not entirely that either 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.810
 one hundred percent if you're a nervous 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.009
 well very briefly but that examiner 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.720
 is at your ease with a fairly quick 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.000
 set 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.960
 yes no too much so actually participate 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.360
 so for your feeling it went well 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.410
 but not successful yes I actually knew 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.970
 well they mean that you have one 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.380
 try to drive in one way 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.880
 you should not do it but the rest went 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.320
 the I already feel that it 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.320
 went well but that is too late
