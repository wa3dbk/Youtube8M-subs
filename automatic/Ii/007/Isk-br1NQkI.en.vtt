fly<00:00:39.230> flip<00:00:39.500> is<00:00:39.920> this<00:00:40.219> flick<00:00:40.670> of<00:00:40.879> your<00:00:41.000> back<00:00:41.210> foot

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
fly flip is this flick of your back foot

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.060 
fly flip is this flick of your back foot
that's<00:00:42.199> this<00:00:42.379> is<00:00:42.649> probably<00:00:42.859> the<00:00:42.980> most

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
that's this is probably the most

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
your foot around just not on the wheel

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.290 
your foot around just not on the wheel
but<00:01:00.620> just<00:01:01.550> behind<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:02.079> when<00:01:03.079> you<00:01:03.140> do<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.379> flick

but just behind it when you do the flick
kick<00:01:05.300> it<00:01:05.420> enough<00:01:05.660> so<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:05.960> spins<00:01:06.140> a<00:01:06.320> half<00:01:08.260> step

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
kick it enough so it spins a half step

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.070 
kick it enough so it spins a half step
three<00:01:09.740> of<00:01:09.980> the<00:01:10.100> flight<00:01:10.310> foot<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.760> this<00:01:11.360> after

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
three of the flight foot is this after

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.550 
three of the flight foot is this after
the<00:01:12.200> flick<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.310> catch<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:14.030> land<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.410> after

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
the flick to the catch and land so after

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.160 
the flick to the catch and land so after
you<00:01:15.710> do<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.920> flick<00:01:16.250> which<00:01:16.640> is<00:01:16.820> spin<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:17.930> grab

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
you do the flick which is spin and grab

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.640 
you do the flick which is spin and grab
it<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.640> board's<00:01:19.910> midair<00:01:20.320> so<00:01:21.320> once<00:01:21.500> it's

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
it so the board's midair so once it's

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.130 
it so the board's midair so once it's
sitting<00:01:21.980> there<00:01:22.220> like<00:01:22.490> flat<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:23.690> take<00:01:23.930> one

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
sitting there like flat you take one

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.040 
sitting there like flat you take one
step<00:01:24.310> that's<00:01:25.310> when<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:25.580> scoop<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.030> board<00:01:26.270> in

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
step that's when you scoop the board in

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.830 
step that's when you scoop the board in
words<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:27.410> deepen<00:01:28.010> it<00:01:28.510> i'll<00:01:29.510> show<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.750> in

you<00:01:38.240> a<00:01:38.360> full<00:01:38.510> demonstration<00:01:38.690> of<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.170> fly<00:01:39.350> flu

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.050 

okay<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:48.950> three<00:01:49.340> things<00:01:49.670> that<00:01:49.760> can<00:01:49.910> go<00:01:49.940> wrong

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
okay so three things that can go wrong

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.510 
okay so three things that can go wrong
with<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:50.420> fly<00:01:50.630> flip<00:01:50.900> is<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.890> overwrought<00:01:52.310> a

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
with the fly flip is the overwrought a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.890 
with the fly flip is the overwrought a
shin<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.910> board<00:01:53.150> which<00:01:53.360> will<00:01:53.510> spend<00:01:53.780> too

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
shin of the board which will spend too

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.410 
shin of the board which will spend too
much<00:01:54.220> going<00:01:55.220> too<00:01:55.370> fast<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:56.000> landing<00:01:56.330> on<00:01:56.360> the

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
much going too fast and landing on the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.090 
much going too fast and landing on the
thickness<00:01:56.690> of<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:56.990> horn<00:01:57.170> I'll<00:01:57.710> give<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.010> an

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
thickness of the horn I'll give you an

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.760 
thickness of the horn I'll give you an
example<00:01:58.160> of<00:01:58.550> each<00:01:59.110> that's<00:02:00.110> main<00:02:00.320> problem<00:02:00.650> with

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
example of each that's main problem with

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.920 
example of each that's main problem with
the<00:02:01.040> fly<00:02:01.310> flip<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:01.970> speed<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.570> over<00:02:02.810> it

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
the fly flip is the speed and over it

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.930 
the fly flip is the speed and over it
ation<00:02:03.110> with<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.130> speed<00:02:04.370> you<00:02:04.580> don't<00:02:04.760> want<00:02:04.880> to

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
ation with the speed you don't want to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.030 
ation with the speed you don't want to
be<00:02:05.000> going<00:02:05.090> too<00:02:05.330> fast<00:02:05.570> because<00:02:06.290> when<00:02:06.890> you're

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
be going too fast because when you're

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.790 
be going too fast because when you're
going<00:02:07.400> fast<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:07.850> tend<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.229> kick<00:02:09.229> down<00:02:09.259> harder

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
going fast you tend to kick down harder

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800 
going fast you tend to kick down harder
on<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.979> back<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.239> board's<00:02:11.540> going<00:02:11.690> to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
on the back and the board's going to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.530 
on the back and the board's going to
flip<00:02:12.319> out<00:02:12.500> in<00:02:12.739> frontier<00:02:13.189> so<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.120> can't<00:02:14.329> catch

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
flip out in frontier so you can't catch

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.750 
flip out in frontier so you can't catch
the<00:02:14.689> board<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.170> by<00:02:15.829> that<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.459> board<00:02:16.640> will

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
the board and by that the board will

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.039 
the board and by that the board will
over<00:02:16.969> rotate<00:02:17.359> and<00:02:17.569> you<00:02:17.629> won't<00:02:17.780> be<00:02:17.810> able<00:02:17.870> to

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
over rotate and you won't be able to

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:29.620 
over rotate and you won't be able to
catch<00:02:18.170> it

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.730 

allow<00:02:30.630> out<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:32.490> third<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.910> last<00:02:33.650> danger<00:02:34.650> of
