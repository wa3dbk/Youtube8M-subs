00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
our come back out of reach so we lost

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.190 
our come back out of reach so we lost
again<00:03:32.850> they're<00:03:33.060> still<00:03:33.300> presold<00:03:33.750> start<00:03:34.050> there

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
again they're still presold start there

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.110 
again they're still presold start there
at<00:03:34.290> three<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.709> one<00:03:35.010> all<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.580> gotta<00:03:35.730> do<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:35.880> win

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
at three and one all you gotta do is win

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.030 
at three and one all you gotta do is win
like<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.390> next<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.810> think<00:03:36.840> for<00:03:37.470> three<00:03:37.920> or<00:03:38.010> four

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
like the next I think for three or four

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.340 
like the next I think for three or four
games<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.610> we're<00:03:39.420> in<00:03:39.480> Division<00:03:39.840> two<00:03:39.930> so

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
games and we're in Division two so

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.810 
games and we're in Division two so
nothing<00:03:40.769> too<00:03:40.920> hard<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.130> think<00:03:41.220> three<00:03:41.459> games<00:03:41.670> for

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
nothing too hard I think three games for

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.670 
nothing too hard I think three games for
division<00:03:42.120> 2<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.480> four<00:03:42.810> games<00:03:43.019> for<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.350> title

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
division 2 and four games for the title

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.470 
division 2 and four games for the title
so<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.100> mean<00:03:44.459> guys<00:03:44.580> were<00:03:44.700> here<00:03:44.850> mcdavid<00:03:45.239> on<00:03:45.360> the

so I mean guys were here mcdavid on the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.180 
so I mean guys were here mcdavid on the
breakaway<00:03:45.870> nice<00:03:46.440> cool<00:03:46.680> there's<00:03:46.860> opened<00:03:47.160> up

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190

scoring this game makes it 1 nothing i'm
pretty<00:03:49.019> much<00:03:49.049> right<00:03:49.290> after<00:03:49.320> that<00:03:49.620> Gaborik

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
pretty much right after that Gaborik

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.590 
pretty much right after that Gaborik
they're<00:03:50.280> getting<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.820> pass<00:03:50.970> from<00:03:51.150> cobra<00:03:51.450> tire

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
no way the goalie gets that one makes it

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.350 
no way the goalie gets that one makes it
two<00:03:53.430> nothing<00:03:53.549> that's<00:03:53.880> likely<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.120> final

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
two nothing that's likely the final

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.570 
two nothing that's likely the final
score<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.720> game<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.140> now<00:03:55.590> four<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.040> one<00:03:56.190> so

for<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.360> title<00:04:00.720> should<00:04:00.959> be<00:04:01.110> pretty<00:04:01.290> easy<00:04:01.440> to

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
for the title should be pretty easy to

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.750 
for the title should be pretty easy to
do<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:01.830> think<00:04:02.190> we're<00:04:02.340> playing<00:04:02.430> pretty<00:04:02.670> good

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
do I think we're playing pretty good

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.370 
do I think we're playing pretty good

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
hockey right now this exact same program

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.190 
hockey right now this exact same program
begins<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.769> caged<00:04:05.480> buckle<00:04:06.480> up<00:04:06.630> thinking<00:04:07.110> they

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
begins to caged buckle up thinking they

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.600 
begins to caged buckle up thinking they
say<00:04:07.380> his<00:04:07.500> name<00:04:07.680> i'm<00:04:07.830> not<00:04:07.950> exactly<00:04:08.220> sure<00:04:08.400> but
