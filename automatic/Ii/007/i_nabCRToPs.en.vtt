have<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> server<00:00:21.510> here<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:23.100> is

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
have a server here so this is on this is

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.950 
have a server here so this is on this is
on<00:00:23.430> not<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.820> multiplayer<00:00:24.240> right<00:00:24.510> now<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:24.840> in

on not on multiplayer right now but in
multiplayer<00:00:25.410> servers<00:00:25.949> this<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.430> be<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> little

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
multiplayer servers this can be a little

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.939 
multiplayer servers this can be a little
finicky<00:00:27.180> don't<00:00:27.570> be<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:27.869> hey<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.650> know<00:00:28.859> I'm

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
finicky don't be like hey you know I'm

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.349 
finicky don't be like hey you know I'm
going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.099> bust<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.460> at<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> top<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.150> map

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
going to bust this at the top of the map

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.179 
going to bust this at the top of the map
and<00:00:30.630> we're<00:00:30.840> going<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.019> use<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:32.009> best

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
and we're going to use it as the best

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.280 
and we're going to use it as the best
source<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.759> find<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.300> multiplayer<00:00:33.809> servers

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
source I find for multiplayer servers

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.510 
source I find for multiplayer servers
guys<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.680> keep<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.070> little<00:00:35.219> smaller

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
guys to keep it a little smaller

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.330 
guys to keep it a little smaller
distance<00:00:36.030> because<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:36.600> if<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.800> visitor<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.309> your

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
distance because if if a visitor to your

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.459 
distance because if if a visitor to your
server<00:00:38.640> lags<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.329> could<00:00:39.660> potentially<00:00:39.899> kill

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
server lags it could potentially kill

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.830 
server lags it could potentially kill
them<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> most<00:00:42.000> part<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.390> works<00:00:42.600> in

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
them but for the most part it works in

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.630 
them but for the most part it works in
my<00:00:43.050> world<00:00:43.290> especially<00:00:43.680> since<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.219> keep<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.610> for

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
my world especially since I keep it for

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.569 
my world especially since I keep it for
some<00:00:44.969> shorter<00:00:45.390> builds<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.590> perfectly<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.399> is

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
some shorter builds so perfectly this is

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
some shorter builds so perfectly this is
how<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.059> works<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> real<00:00:48.780> simple

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
how this one works is a real simple

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
how this one works is a real simple
build<00:00:49.379> guys<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.640> want<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.850> get<00:00:51.000> down

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
build guys but I just want to get down

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.000 
build guys but I just want to get down
there<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.719> quick<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> fireman's<00:00:52.739> pole

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
there like quick like a fireman's pole

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.810 
there like quick like a fireman's pole
so<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.510> press<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.050> button<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
so all you do is press the button and

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.639 
so all you do is press the button and
there<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.940> go<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.780> go<00:00:57.840> faster<00:00:58.350> or<00:00:58.379> slower

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
there you go you can go faster or slower

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.229 
there you go you can go faster or slower
again<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.370> could<00:00:59.520> go<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> longer

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
again that could go for a longer

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.080 
again that could go for a longer
distance<00:01:00.449> or<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> shorter<00:01:01.170> distance<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.550> is

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
distance or a shorter distance but it is

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.770 
distance or a shorter distance but it is
a<00:01:03.120> very<00:01:03.420> easy<00:01:03.719> build<00:01:05.390> I'm<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> go<00:01:06.750> ahead

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
a very easy build I'm going to go ahead

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.920 
a very easy build I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.890> show<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.189> again<00:01:08.909> I'm<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and just show you again I'm not going to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.719 
and just show you again I'm not going to
make<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.140> from<00:01:10.439> my<00:01:10.560> grinder<00:01:11.070> down<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.610> know

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
make it from my grinder down you know

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.730 
make it from my grinder down you know
for<00:01:12.360> me<00:01:12.510> it'll<00:01:12.689> work<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.930> fine<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
for me it'll work just fine for the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.350 
for me it'll work just fine for the
owner<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.280> server<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.790> definitely<00:01:15.180> one

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
owner of the server it's definitely one

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.670 
owner of the server it's definitely one
hundred<00:01:15.570> percent<00:01:15.630> perfect<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> know

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
hundred percent perfect and you know

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.080 
hundred percent perfect and you know
what<00:01:16.830> depending<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> update<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.000> we

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
what depending on the update that we

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.580 
what depending on the update that we
have<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.600> works<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.140> better<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.500> little

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
have it works a little better a little

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.429 
have it works a little better a little
worse<00:01:19.979> at<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> decent<00:01:21.330> distance<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
worse at a decent distance like this I

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.870 
worse at a decent distance like this I
find<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.220> bad<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:23.850> here

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
find that it's not that bad so up here

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.550 
find that it's not that bad so up here
we<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.270> my<00:01:24.299> turrets<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> got<00:01:25.229> kind<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
we have my turrets that I got kind of

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.410 
we have my turrets that I got kind of
out<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.710> my<00:01:25.860> front<00:01:26.070> wall<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.970> kind<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> want

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
out of my front wall and I kind of want

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.120 
out of my front wall and I kind of want
to<00:01:27.509> put<00:01:27.659> one<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.200> side<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.650> after

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
to put one up on the side so after

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.340 
to put one up on the side so after
immediately<00:01:29.790> shooting<00:01:30.090> people<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.689> get

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
immediately shooting people you can get
