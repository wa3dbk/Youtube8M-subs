is<00:01:54.119> around<00:01:54.420> two<00:01:54.689> dollars<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.200> believe<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.040> this

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
is around two dollars I believe so this

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.550 
is around two dollars I believe so this
is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> pretty<00:01:56.880> nice-looking<00:01:57.509> cheap<00:01:58.200> assault

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
is a pretty nice-looking cheap assault

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.069 
is a pretty nice-looking cheap assault
rifle<00:01:58.890> scam<00:01:59.100> that's<00:01:59.399> actually<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> read<00:02:00.299> rarity

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079
