00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.539 
you've got sequins or glitter whatever
you<00:01:57.869> fancy<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.740> even<00:01:58.890> put<00:01:59.069> flowers<00:01:59.310> in

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.830 
you fancy you can even put flowers in
there<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.729> suppose<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.360> might<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> nice

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
there I suppose that might be a nice

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.520 
there I suppose that might be a nice
idea<00:02:02.329> now<00:02:03.329> I'm<00:02:03.569> going<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.780> add<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:04.289> toe

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
idea now I'm going to add the toe

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.130 
idea now I'm going to add the toe
separators<00:02:05.100> first<00:02:05.719> just<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:06.990> they're

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
separators first just because they're

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.859 
separators first just because they're
more<00:02:07.289> flexible<00:02:07.469> than<00:02:07.979> everything<00:02:08.250> else<00:02:08.869> so

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
more flexible than everything else so

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.460 
more flexible than everything else so
that<00:02:10.049> gives<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.440> good<00:02:10.619> base<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:11.069> go<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:12.470> all

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that gives you a good base to go on all

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.009

you'll need to cook a bigger sheet of
tissue<00:04:45.370> paper<00:04:46.080> just<00:04:47.080> be<00:04:47.289> close<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.680> jars<00:04:47.919> a

bigger<00:04:50.310> as<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:51.490> can<00:04:51.640> see<00:04:51.850> I'm<00:04:52.060> just

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
bigger as you can see I'm just

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.810 
bigger as you can see I'm just
scrunching<00:04:52.630> up<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.810> tissue<00:04:52.990> paper<00:04:53.640> just<00:04:54.640> so

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
scrunching up the tissue paper just so

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.790 
scrunching up the tissue paper just so
that<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.300> peaks<00:04:55.630> will<00:04:55.930> still<00:04:56.260> be<00:04:56.650> there

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
that the peaks will still be there

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.060 
that the peaks will still be there
around<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.280> edge<00:04:57.660> by<00:04:58.660> that<00:04:58.900> I<00:04:58.930> just<00:04:59.020> mean<00:04:59.289> the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
around the edge by that I just mean the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.710 
around the edge by that I just mean the
bits<00:05:00.250> of<00:05:00.340> tissue<00:05:00.520> paper<00:05:00.850> that<00:05:01.090> stand<00:05:01.479> up<00:05:01.600> on

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
bits of tissue paper that stand up on

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.250 
bits of tissue paper that stand up on
their<00:05:01.840> own<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:04.240> just<00:05:04.270> squashed<00:05:04.780> that<00:05:04.930> into

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
their own and I just squashed that into

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.740 
their own and I just squashed that into
the<00:05:05.350> bottom<00:05:05.620> of<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.710> jar<00:05:06.039> just<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.880> you<00:05:07.720> know

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
the bottom of the jar just to you know

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.130 
the bottom of the jar just to you know
give<00:05:08.169> it<00:05:08.289> a<00:05:08.350> bit<00:05:08.500> more<00:05:08.650> life<00:05:09.419> now<00:05:10.419> I'll<00:05:10.690> put<00:05:10.900> two

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
give it a bit more life now I'll put two

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.719 
give it a bit more life now I'll put two
different<00:05:11.260> types<00:05:11.650> of<00:05:11.860> tissue<00:05:12.039> paper<00:05:12.160> and<00:05:12.550> it's

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
different types of tissue paper and it's

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.820 
different types of tissue paper and it's
just<00:05:13.090> to<00:05:13.150> make<00:05:13.300> it<00:05:13.479> look<00:05:14.140> a<00:05:14.260> bit<00:05:14.289> more<00:05:14.440> layered

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
just to make it look a bit more layered

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.639 
just to make it look a bit more layered
and<00:05:15.160> a<00:05:15.250> bit<00:05:15.400> more<00:05:15.550> colourful

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:17.649 
and a bit more colourful

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:19.989 
and a bit more colourful
so<00:05:18.649> you<00:05:18.740> just<00:05:18.949> squash<00:05:19.249> those<00:05:19.460> down<00:05:19.669> until

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:19.999 
so you just squash those down until

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:22.029 
so you just squash those down until
they're<00:05:20.149> pretty<00:05:20.360> flat<00:05:20.689> and<00:05:20.899> then<00:05:21.619> you<00:05:21.710> can<00:05:21.860> put

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
they're pretty flat and then you can put

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.540 
they're pretty flat and then you can put
everything<00:05:22.279> else<00:05:22.490> in<00:05:23.710> as<00:05:24.710> with<00:05:25.129> the<00:05:25.490> earlier

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
everything else in as with the earlier

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.389 
everything else in as with the earlier
jar<00:05:26.240> I<00:05:26.389> put<00:05:26.749> the<00:05:26.990> toe<00:05:27.379> separators<00:05:27.949> in<00:05:27.979> first

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:28.399 
jar I put the toe separators in first

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:29.980 
jar I put the toe separators in first
just<00:05:28.759> because<00:05:28.879> then<00:05:29.209> they<00:05:29.300> flexible<00:05:29.719> than

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
just because then they flexible than

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.949 
just because then they flexible than
everything<00:05:30.229> else<00:05:31.419> and<00:05:32.419> that<00:05:32.599> gives<00:05:32.809> you<00:05:32.899> a

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:32.959 
everything else and that gives you a

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:37.419 
everything else and that gives you a
good<00:05:33.139> base<00:05:33.199> to<00:05:33.649> build<00:05:33.800> on<00:05:35.679> as<00:05:36.679> you<00:05:36.860> can<00:05:36.889> see<00:05:37.189> I'm

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:37.429 
good base to build on as you can see I'm

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:39.279 
good base to build on as you can see I'm
adding<00:05:37.610> two<00:05:38.029> more<00:05:38.240> Technic<00:05:38.689> nail<00:05:38.869> varnishes

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:43.969 
and they were both 99p you can find

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:45.399 
and they were both 99p you can find
those<00:05:44.089> in<00:05:44.149> body<00:05:44.479> care<00:05:44.719> and<00:05:44.899> they're<00:05:45.080> really

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:49.579 
terrible bow on top I just think this is

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:52.359 
terrible bow on top I just think this is
a<00:06:49.610> really<00:06:49.879> really<00:06:50.119> cool<00:06:50.769> simple<00:06:51.769> and<00:06:52.069> quite

00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:52.369

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:54.189 
a really really cool simple and quite
cheap<00:06:52.639> gift<00:06:52.879> idea<00:06:53.269> it's<00:06:53.839> a<00:06:53.899> bit<00:06:54.079> more

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199
