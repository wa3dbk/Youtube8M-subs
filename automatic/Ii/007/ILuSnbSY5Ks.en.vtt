00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.640
 most important is before we have the hair 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.820
 should have clean structures once 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.380
 clean by then dannheimer von 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.960
 ear to ear over head the hair parted 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.870
 fixed the front part with brackets 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.059
 she does not have too many hair at once 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.140
 behind the head then beautiful large area 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:48.920
 triangles divided to the ponytail 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.080
 then summarized 13 sections then 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.660
 where we chance every single horse 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.390
 divided off three times and then each 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.660
 single braided ones 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.489
 I have braided until that leaves 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.560
 I pulled myself apart 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.990
 just more volume and then the hairstyle 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.610
 student looks at the whole i have 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.160
 then with all three cases tails 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.380
 made by 13 divisions and all three 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.009
 braided and casually apart 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.580
 If I have that then I will have it 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.890
 every single strands individually like that 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.090
 how to have fun and fun casual 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.610
 in the middle he stuck it so 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.560
 looks more elegant and festive 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.210
 so it'll be you really spray properly 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.100
 how to get that all together almost 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.680
 So it's important that you tend to be 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.780
 not the trade is and you can 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.640
 also that he has this triangle down 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.260
 put that he says brussels again 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.710
 but I do now have more upstairs 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.500
 made 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.760
 left a strand out so that 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.260
 I then finish a nice one 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.810
 can sit back 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.650
 then cranked it and then around the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.960
 Attached to the rear end labels only visited 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.730
 Of course you have to practice that first 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.150
 Today one says brings the new clean 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.560
 that it really looks like that 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.330
 difficulty is of course 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.160
 Of course you should be able to do bad 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.740
 you have to practice that today 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.720
 pull apart that it also possible 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.150
 whistler volume and build up when you are 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.190
 Too little hair, he looks better 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.560
 then thin out so that it 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.450
 he really is the back of the head 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.520
 So far, the proportions brings in that 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.800
 it is not so right now but right 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.190
 already in the middle or right side 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.190
 put 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.100
 in demand compartment I have then me 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.790
 pulled a nice crest and hopped 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.459
 cranked front side and back also 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.170
 turn it on to the hairstyle 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.120
 always look the other side the same way 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.640
 that he already has the proportions together 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.390
 fit and the back of the head though 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.390
 evenly in the middle 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.840
 if you can not help yourself anymore 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.000
 then you should go through the best 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.800
 and then we are for every council and did 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.800
 agree to help
