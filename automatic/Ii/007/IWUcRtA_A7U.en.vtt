computer and discovered that all sorts
of<00:00:07.080> new<00:00:07.259> mods<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.919> new<00:00:08.700> version<00:00:09.120> and

of new mods and new version and
everything<00:00:09.719> self<00:00:09.960> missed<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.290> ball<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.440> little

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
everything self missed the ball a little

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.049 
everything self missed the ball a little
bit

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
bit

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.299 
bit
speaking<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.179> boats<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.630> noticed<00:00:13.559> that<00:00:13.590> Erica

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
speaking of boats and noticed that Erica

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.060 
speaking of boats and noticed that Erica
had<00:00:14.639> put<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> new<00:00:15.330> water<00:00:16.170> mod<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.039> a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
had put a new water mod and this is a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.439 
had put a new water mod and this is a
hero<00:00:17.430> work<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.640> know<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.210> absolutely

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
hero work you know and it's absolutely

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.290 
hero work you know and it's absolutely
fantastic<00:00:18.690> looking<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.850> so<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.910> thought<00:00:21.119> I

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
fantastic looking and so I thought I

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.480 
fantastic looking and so I thought I
would<00:00:21.449> make<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.930> more<00:00:22.289> impressive<00:00:22.590> behaving

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
would make a more impressive behaving

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.089 
would make a more impressive behaving
boats<00:00:23.880> something<00:00:24.689> actually<00:00:24.900> responds<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
boats something actually responds to a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.419 
boats something actually responds to a
bit<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.730> water<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.660> nobody<00:00:28.019> would<00:00:28.170> expect<00:00:28.500> so

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
bit of water and nobody would expect so

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.269 
bit of water and nobody would expect so
here<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.449> I've<00:00:30.750> used<00:00:30.990> what<00:00:31.560> are<00:00:31.679> thrusters<00:00:32.070> all

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
here is I've used what are thrusters all

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.370 
here is I've used what are thrusters all
rounds<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:33.420> rushed<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.809> nose

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
rounds to rushed up the nose

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.229 
rounds to rushed up the nose
so<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> glaze<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.460> ordinary<00:00:35.700> easily<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so the glaze for ordinary easily to

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.740 
so the glaze for ordinary easily to
propel<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.750> from<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> back<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.710> as<00:00:38.510> keel<00:00:39.510> or

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
propel it from the back and as keel or

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.139 
propel it from the back and as keel or
bow<00:00:40.230> thrusters<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> couple<00:00:41.879> are<00:00:41.969> just

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
bow thrusters and as a couple are just

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.610 
bow thrusters and as a couple are just
there<00:00:42.300> for<00:00:42.390> effect<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.200> D'Amico

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
there for effect it's this D'Amico

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.740 
there for effect it's this D'Amico
watery<00:00:44.489> that's<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.000> simple<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.539> that

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
watery that's it simple as that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.549 
watery that's it simple as that
because<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.190> quick<00:00:47.340> data<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> war

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
because it's that quick data in the war

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.979 
because it's that quick data in the war
these<00:00:49.559> water<00:00:49.829> modes<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:51.000> those<00:00:51.270> things<00:00:51.390> work

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
these water modes and those things work

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.010 
these water modes and those things work
very<00:00:52.020> well<00:00:52.289> really<00:00:52.829> well<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.789> that's<00:00:54.690> where<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
very well really well so that's where it

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.010 
very well really well so that's where it
gets<00:00:55.110> all<00:00:55.289> its<00:00:55.410> power<00:00:55.649> from<00:00:55.890> above<00:00:56.670> board<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
gets all its power from above board the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.939 
gets all its power from above board the
underneath<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.770> got<00:00:59.039> too<00:00:59.250> fat<00:00:59.579> preparers<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
underneath is got too fat preparers and

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.170 
underneath is got too fat preparers and
they're<00:01:01.949> churning<00:01:02.190> away<00:01:02.489> that's<00:01:02.820> again

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
they're churning away that's again

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210 
they're churning away that's again
another<00:01:03.210> reason<00:01:03.660> why<00:01:03.960> then<00:01:04.500> those<00:01:04.739> needs<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
another reason why then those needs to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.679 
another reason why then those needs to
be<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:05.939> fight<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:06.450> used

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
be up so that it's not fight when used

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.780 
be up so that it's not fight when used
of<00:01:06.840> water<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> time<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.549> quite

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
of water all the time but as this quite

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.730 
of water all the time but as this quite
visually<00:01:09.180> appealing<00:01:09.479> tesseract<00:01:10.290> cat's<00:01:10.530> done

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
visually appealing tesseract cat's done

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.890 
visually appealing tesseract cat's done
a<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:10.979> good<00:01:11.189> job<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.700> nice<00:01:12.030> yeah

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
a really good job it's very nice yeah

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.770 
a really good job it's very nice yeah
like<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.409> okay<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.720> I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
like it okay what can we do with it so I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.929 
like it okay what can we do with it so I
started<00:01:15.960> off<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.530> fairly<00:01:17.250> low<00:01:17.400> power<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
started off on a fairly low power and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.120 
started off on a fairly low power and
discovered<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.170> was<00:01:19.290> very<00:01:19.530> maneuverable

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
discovered that it was very maneuverable

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.969 
discovered that it was very maneuverable
what's<00:01:20.549> about<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.090> water<00:01:21.360> quite<00:01:21.659> nicely<00:01:21.979> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
what's about the water quite nicely it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.649 
what's about the water quite nicely it
jumps<00:01:23.250> over<00:01:23.310> obstacles<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.119> stuff<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
jumps over obstacles and stuff like that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.690 
jumps over obstacles and stuff like that
you<00:01:24.869> know<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:25.950> too<00:01:26.159> bad<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.580> good

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
you know it's it's not too bad it's good

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.499 
you know it's it's not too bad it's good
one<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:28.220> make<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.310> little<00:01:29.460> launched<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.000> body<00:01:30.270> that

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
one I make a little launched a body that

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.999 
one I make a little launched a body that
I<00:01:30.570> could<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.869> fell<00:01:31.079> other<00:01:31.229> stuff<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.650> till<00:01:31.890> it

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
I could just fell other stuff on till it

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.560 
I could just fell other stuff on till it
on<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:32.340> you'll<00:01:32.460> see<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> idea<00:01:33.390> this

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
on as you'll see that was the idea this

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.069 
on as you'll see that was the idea this
is<00:01:33.630> my<00:01:33.840> first<00:01:34.110> boat<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.590> now<00:01:35.579> when<00:01:35.729> she<00:01:36.079> just

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
is my first boat so now when she just

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.600 
is my first boat so now when she just
powered<00:01:37.530> up<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.770> bet<00:01:37.950> you've<00:01:38.130> used<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:38.579> sorts

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
powered up I bet you've used all sorts

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.480 
powered up I bet you've used all sorts
of<00:01:39.030> modes<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:39.659> all<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.960> time<00:01:40.170> later

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
of modes and that's all this time later

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.710 
of modes and that's all this time later
the<00:01:41.490> nose<00:01:41.640> starts<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> come<00:01:42.210> right<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.509> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the nose starts to come right up and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.389 
the nose starts to come right up and
then<00:01:42.869> when<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.200> starts<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.860> happen<00:01:43.950> it

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
then when that starts to happen it

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.160 
then when that starts to happen it
really<00:01:44.490> starts<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> move<00:01:45.210> fast<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.960> looks

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
really starts to move fast and it looks

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.440 
really starts to move fast and it looks
a<00:01:46.320> lot<00:01:46.470> better<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.860> well<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:48.149> got<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
a lot better as well and it's got a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.060 
a lot better as well and it's got a
better<00:01:48.689> scale<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.140> me<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> control<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.890> but

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
better scale for me to control it but

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.190 
better scale for me to control it but
after<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> while<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.240> was<00:01:51.420> getting<00:01:51.630> there<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
after a while I was getting there and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.649 
after a while I was getting there and
not<00:01:52.380> falling<00:01:52.649> over<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:52.979> much<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.270> realized

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
not falling over so much then I realized

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.289 
not falling over so much then I realized
if<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.759> chances<00:01:57.149> are

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
if it can do this then the chances are

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.480 
if it can do this then the chances are
it<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.869> flip<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.649> was<00:01:58.799> an<00:01:58.890> accident<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.369> was

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
it can flip that was an accident it was

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.130 
it can flip that was an accident it was
sort<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.640> work<00:01:59.820> surely<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.450> make<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.899> flip

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
sort of work surely I can make it flip

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.289 
sort of work surely I can make it flip
keeping<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.920> controlled<00:02:02.340> tight<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.969> getting

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
keeping it controlled tight and getting

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.800 
keeping it controlled tight and getting
a<00:02:03.360> full<00:02:03.570> 360<00:02:04.229> here's<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> first<00:02:05.280> one

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
a full 360 here's the first one

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.260 
a full 360 here's the first one
and<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.829> prove<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.879> wasn't<00:02:09.060> a

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and then just to prove that it wasn't a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.210 
and then just to prove that it wasn't a
fluke<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.750> did<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.110> again

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
fluke I did it again

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.040 
fluke I did it again
that's<00:02:11.580> good<00:02:11.760> come<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.030> our<00:02:12.270> like<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.570> not

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
that's good come to our like that not

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.290 
that's good come to our like that not
that<00:02:13.230> one<00:02:13.440> here<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.040> go<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> best<00:02:15.060> one

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
that one here we go this is the best one

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.900 
that one here we go this is the best one
just<00:02:16.140> about<00:02:16.380> anyway<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:20.580> what<00:02:20.730> we're<00:02:20.820> gonna

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
just about anyway so what we're gonna

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.690 
just about anyway so what we're gonna
use<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.300> for<00:02:21.950> okay<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.190> thought<00:02:23.400> well<00:02:23.580> go

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
use that for okay so I thought well go

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.270 
use that for okay so I thought well go
over<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.180> crystal<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:25.410> I'm<00:02:25.830> all<00:02:25.950> triumph

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
over to the crystal and I'm all triumph

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.100 
over to the crystal and I'm all triumph
like<00:02:26.400> anything<00:02:26.790> at<00:02:26.940> that's<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.600> tower<00:02:27.870> and

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
like anything at that's the tower and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.320 
like anything at that's the tower and
see<00:02:28.290> if<00:02:28.350> we<00:02:28.470> can<00:02:28.620> knock<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.160> crystal<00:02:29.520> off<00:02:29.670> and

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
see if we can knock the crystal off and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.730 
see if we can knock the crystal off and
grab<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.570> somehow<00:02:30.990> I've<00:02:31.080> got<00:02:31.230> grabbers<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
grab it somehow I've got grabbers on the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.400 
grab it somehow I've got grabbers on the
bottom<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.130> boat<00:02:32.280> here<00:02:32.780> we<00:02:33.780> just<00:02:33.900> whack<00:02:34.170> it

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
bottom of the boat here we just whack it

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.300 
bottom of the boat here we just whack it
I'm<00:02:35.750> not<00:02:36.750> success<00:02:37.170> really<00:02:37.470> not<00:02:37.800> really<00:02:38.010> good<00:02:38.190> V

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
I'm not success really not really good V

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.980 
I'm not success really not really good V
star<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:38.760> as<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> good<00:02:39.060> bet<00:02:39.210> fun<00:02:39.420> go<00:02:39.780> suddenly

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
star but as a good bet fun go suddenly

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.220 
star but as a good bet fun go suddenly
spends<00:02:40.530> again<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:41.940> was<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.240> so<00:02:42.960> then

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
spends again and but that was it so then

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.810 
spends again and but that was it so then
I<00:02:43.290> thought<00:02:43.440> all<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.860> just<00:02:44.100> stop<00:02:44.250> knock<00:02:44.610> one

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
I thought all of you just stop knock one

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.250 
I thought all of you just stop knock one
side<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.240> is<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.450> haven't<00:02:45.660> get<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.020> fall

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
side of is you haven't get it to fall

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.250 
side of is you haven't get it to fall
into<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.710> book<00:02:47.180> it's<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.270> bit<00:02:48.420> bit<00:02:48.840> more<00:02:48.990> clever

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
into the book it's a bit bit more clever

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.680 
into the book it's a bit bit more clever
of<00:02:49.740> approach<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:50.430> again<00:02:50.730> nothing<00:02:51.240> doing<00:02:51.540> it

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
of approach but again nothing doing it

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.030 
of approach but again nothing doing it
just<00:02:51.810> ran<00:02:51.930> up<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.170> garbage<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.680> then<00:02:52.770> slipped

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
just ran up the garbage and then slipped

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.610 
just ran up the garbage and then slipped
off<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.490> don't<00:02:54.300> cut<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.690> Gore's<00:02:54.960> in<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.560> I

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
off I don't cut the Gore's in it and I

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.380 
off I don't cut the Gore's in it and I
don't<00:02:55.680> know<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.890> couple<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.310> flips<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.820> really

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
don't know a couple of flips it really

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.990 
don't know a couple of flips it really
likes<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.720> flip<00:02:57.960> this<00:02:58.110> as<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.070> see<00:02:59.430> it's

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
likes to flip this as you can see it's

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.590 
likes to flip this as you can see it's
forever<00:03:00.330> ticking<00:03:00.810> off<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.770> I<00:03:02.400> give<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.510> a

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
forever ticking off and I give up a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.000 
forever ticking off and I give up a
season<00:03:03.840> no<00:03:03.930> we<00:03:04.050> need<00:03:04.200> something<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> bit<00:03:04.770> more

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
season no we need something a bit more

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.590 
season no we need something a bit more
clever<00:03:05.250> tonight<00:03:05.550> no<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.700> did<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.240> crystal

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
clever tonight no I did get the crystal

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.920 
clever tonight no I did get the crystal
as<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.810> can<00:03:06.960> see<00:03:07.140> here<00:03:07.670> but<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.730> employed<00:03:09.210> more

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
as you can see here but I employed more

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.680 
as you can see here but I employed more
stealthy<00:03:10.380> techniques<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.310> what<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.520> did<00:03:11.850> was<00:03:12.300> I

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
stealthy techniques and what I did was I

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.560 
stealthy techniques and what I did was I
developed<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.380> little<00:03:13.650> harpoon<00:03:14.100> and<00:03:14.640> nothing

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
developed a little harpoon and nothing

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.980 
developed a little harpoon and nothing
too<00:03:15.720> special<00:03:16.020> two<00:03:16.470> ropes<00:03:16.709> now<00:03:16.980> rocket<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
too special two ropes now rocket and

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.240 
too special two ropes now rocket and
just<00:03:18.990> trying<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.230> control<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.740> one<00:03:20.100> with

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
just trying to control that one with

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.410 
just trying to control that one with
something<00:03:20.459> cuz<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:20.640> wobbles<00:03:21.030> all<00:03:21.120> over<00:03:21.300> the

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
something cuz it wobbles all over the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.510 
something cuz it wobbles all over the
place<00:03:21.570> because<00:03:21.690> it's<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.990> book<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.430> know<00:03:23.430> if

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
place because it's a book you know if

and then a real him like a big fish
I<00:03:42.300> just<00:03:42.660> went<00:03:42.840> round<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.140> terror<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:44.840> used<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
I just went round to terror and used the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.229 
I just went round to terror and used the
actual<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.860> launcher<00:03:47.280> itself<00:03:47.430> like<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:47.940> mini

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
actual the launcher itself like a mini

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.940 
actual the launcher itself like a mini
crane<00:03:48.540> well<00:03:48.840> hadn't<00:03:49.110> intended<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.709> but

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
crane well hadn't intended that but

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.220 
crane well hadn't intended that but
that's<00:03:50.070> when<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.250> begin<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:50.850> they<00:03:51.720> struggled

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
that's when it begin and they struggled

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.570 
that's when it begin and they struggled
to<00:03:52.290> get<00:03:52.470> over<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.800> wall<00:03:53.010> cause<00:03:53.220> of<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.430> weight

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
to get over the wall cause of the weight

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.460 
to get over the wall cause of the weight
so<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:54.180> was<00:03:54.330> like<00:03:54.480> catching<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.900> big<00:03:55.020> fish<00:03:55.080> it
