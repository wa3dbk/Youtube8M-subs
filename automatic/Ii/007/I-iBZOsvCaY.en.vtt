probably have some stimulus in the
united<00:01:11.700> states<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.110> investors<00:01:13.650> are

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
united states and so investors are

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
saying gee eventually that will be

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.820 
saying gee eventually that will be
somewhat<00:01:16.740> inflationary<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.750> course

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
somewhat inflationary and of course

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.850 
somewhat inflationary and of course
inflation<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.189> reason<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.880> own<00:01:21.000> gold

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860

inflation is the reason to own gold
George<00:01:22.860> last<00:01:23.070> time<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.430> spoke<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.970> also<00:01:24.360> said

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
George last time we spoke you also said

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.080 
George last time we spoke you also said
that<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.900> don't<00:01:25.530> expect<00:01:26.009> Greece<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.880> leave

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
that you don't expect Greece to leave

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.030 
that you don't expect Greece to leave
the<00:01:27.270> euro<00:01:27.509> anytime<00:01:27.990> soon<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.530> changed

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the euro anytime soon have you changed

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.280 
the euro anytime soon have you changed
your<00:01:29.460> mind<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.090> no<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> think<00:01:31.049> perhaps

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
your mind on that no I think perhaps

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.880 
your mind on that no I think perhaps
Greece<00:01:31.890> somehow<00:01:32.659> we'll<00:01:33.659> muddle<00:01:33.930> through<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
Greece somehow we'll muddle through that

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.310 
Greece somehow we'll muddle through that
June<00:01:35.250> seventeenth<00:01:35.970> election<00:01:36.570> upcoming<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
June seventeenth election upcoming and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.580 
June seventeenth election upcoming and
it<00:01:38.189> looks<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.869> people<00:01:39.869> are<00:01:40.049> beginning<00:01:40.229> to

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
it looks like people are beginning to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.670 
it looks like people are beginning to
understand<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.369> Greece<00:01:41.869> what<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.990> would<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.170> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
understand in Greece what it would be to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.700 
understand in Greece what it would be to
leave<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.850> euro<00:01:45.090> because<00:01:45.570> their<00:01:46.079> expenses

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
leave of the euro because their expenses

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.429 
leave of the euro because their expenses
would<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:47.070> even<00:01:47.340> higher<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.049> their<00:01:49.049> income

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
would be even higher and their income

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.039 
would be even higher and their income
would<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.649> even<00:01:50.070> lower<00:01:50.340> than<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.420> now<00:01:51.659> which

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
would be even lower than it is now which

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.069 
would be even lower than it is now which
is<00:01:52.229> unfortunate<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.450> path<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.869> least

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
is unfortunate and so the path of least

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.889 
is unfortunate and so the path of least
resistance<00:01:55.729> will<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:57.119> them<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.450> stay<00:01:57.719> in

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
resistance will be for them to stay in

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.410 
resistance will be for them to stay in
the<00:01:58.020> euro<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.530> try<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.950> fix<00:01:59.310> things<00:01:59.460> okay

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the euro and try to fix things okay

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.550 
the euro and try to fix things okay
George<00:02:00.630> let's<00:02:00.810> get<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.290> 1,600

with<00:03:31.500> weaker<00:03:31.830> demand<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.580> was<00:03:32.730> bound<00:03:32.940> to

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
with weaker demand it was bound to

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.360 
with weaker demand it was bound to
