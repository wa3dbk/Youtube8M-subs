00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.069 
my businesses and so I guess that
classified<00:01:37.409> me<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> housewife<00:01:38.990> Miami<00:01:39.990> I

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
classified me as a housewife Miami I

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.660 
classified me as a housewife Miami I
think<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> little<00:01:40.649> bit<00:01:40.740> harder<00:01:41.100> right<00:01:41.310> for

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
think it's a little bit harder right for

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.800 
think it's a little bit harder right for
you<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.819> be<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> housewife<00:01:42.149> everybody
