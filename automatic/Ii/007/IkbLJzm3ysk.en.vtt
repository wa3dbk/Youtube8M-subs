facility here and we found some stairs

in<00:00:30.240> there<00:00:30.359> was<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> bit<00:00:30.779> up<00:00:30.900> there<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> slept

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
in there was a bit up there so I slept

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.340 
in there was a bit up there so I slept
so<00:00:32.040> now<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.489> rain<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.700> gone<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.170> these

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
so now the rain is gone and I have these

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.530 
so now the rain is gone and I have these
stairs<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.070> first<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.700> couldn't<00:00:36.030> figure

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
stairs and at first I couldn't figure

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.760 
stairs and at first I couldn't figure
out<00:00:36.780> what<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.350> them<00:00:37.500> because<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.989> guess

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
out what to do with them because I guess

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.160 
out what to do with them because I guess
at<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.280> time<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:42.390> look<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.930> was<00:00:42.989> too

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
at the time this look like it was too

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.950 
at the time this look like it was too
high<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> stairs<00:00:44.210> but<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.690> all<00:00:45.930> actuality

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
high for the stairs but in all actuality

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.080 
high for the stairs but in all actuality
that's<00:00:46.649> only<00:00:46.770> two<00:00:46.950> blocks<00:00:47.070> high<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.910> for

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that's only two blocks high just for

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.520 
that's only two blocks high just for
half<00:00:48.300> blocks<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.989> guess<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.260> was<00:00:49.350> being

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
half blocks and I guess I was being

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.680 
half blocks and I guess I was being
stupid<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.070> didn't<00:00:50.340> see<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.550> via<00:00:51.390> that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
stupid and I didn't see it via that

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.330 
stupid and I didn't see it via that
