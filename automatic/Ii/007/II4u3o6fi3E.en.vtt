00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 at a time when this country had a 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.620
 great company that gave wings to its 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.139
 growth and its modernization 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.900
 the company was privatized then came the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.890
 crisis and finally the news that 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.570
 Iberia was run with British Airways 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.359
 let's compare two mergers of different 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.710
 airlines let's see what happens in air 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.500
 france with klm 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.960
 merged but following the agreements and 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.260
 commitments that they had acquired 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.730
 both companies grew equally 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.399
 he told us that the agreement between British 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.469
 airways and iberia was a fusion between 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.839
 same and that everything was going to be fantastic 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.909
 for both and for all their happy 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:47.500
 workers who were made 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.500
 a lot of promises 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.760
 a merger between equals has been 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.410
 really like that while british airways 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.410
 grows buying late planes 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.930
 technology and opens new routes liberia 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.870
 decreases the company reduces it 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.240
 in the new cost violates the pacts that 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:14.110
 had with his templates and dismisses 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.440
 8,000 workers was a merger or more 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.630
 well a transfusion before the merger 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.040
 british airways was on the verge of 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.190
 bankruptcy 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.220
 Liberia had a box of 2,500 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.900
 million euros just the amount that 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.830
 I needed British Airways to 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.920
 survive 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.830
 after the merger announcement iag hair is born 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.600
 that has been of the 2,500 million 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.600
 iberia where are 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.170
 the Spanish company eliminates the routes 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.689
 more profitable and they give them british 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.960
 airways reduces long-haul flights to 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.719
 mexico or brazil eliminate routes to recife 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.689
 or fortress iberia stops flying to 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:02:00.289
 johannesburg and surrender all those 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.539
 flights to british airways the spanish 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.759
 We have spent more than 7,000 million 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.459
 euros in decks and the prat so that 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.940
 iberia spanair and other 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.500
 Spanish companies we have given them 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.370
 where is the growth of our 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.870
 airlines 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.760
 now british airways wants 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.670
 convert them to low cost airports 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.970
 of europe we are the paradise of tourism 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.280
 shabby from ryanair or easyjet now also 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.790
 I should express 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.400
 at what price both low cost 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.950
 'Spain the ideal destination for a long 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.870
 and cheap drunkenness that touches us then 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.540
 scour the citizens while the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.250
 architects of this dismantling 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.590
 organized they rub their hands 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.360
 the workers of iberia and many of 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.460
 the millions of passengers that we have 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.930
 lived and seen grow we want to prevent 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.030
 that a company that has 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.760
 represented better than none the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.760
 potential the strength and capacity of 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.900
 this country to modernize 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.470
 internationalize and take flight 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:07.050
 they are cutting our wings please 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.050
