the external battery charger and the
thumb<00:00:32.660> screw<00:00:32.990> this<00:00:33.560> is<00:00:33.740> the<00:00:33.890> basic<00:00:34.280> kit<00:00:34.520> but<00:00:35.330> I

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
thumb screw this is the basic kit but I

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.810 
thumb screw this is the basic kit but I
also<00:00:35.660> have<00:00:36.050> a<00:00:36.080> car<00:00:36.440> suction<00:00:36.860> mount<00:00:37.070> but<00:00:37.640> that's

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
also have a car suction mount but that's

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.030 
also have a car suction mount but that's
not<00:00:38.000> going<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.300> fit<00:00:38.570> in<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:38.840> small<00:00:39.110> case<00:00:39.380> it's

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
not going to fit in this small case it's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.710 
not going to fit in this small case it's
also<00:00:40.220> unlikely<00:00:40.460> that<00:00:40.910> I<00:00:40.970> will<00:00:41.060> need<00:00:41.330> it<00:00:41.390> except

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
also unlikely that I will need it except

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.540 
also unlikely that I will need it except
for<00:00:41.870> filming<00:00:42.140> stuff<00:00:42.350> with<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.650> car<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.460> it

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
for filming stuff with the car so it

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.150 
for filming stuff with the car so it
doesn't<00:00:43.610> need<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:44.000> be<00:00:44.030> with<00:00:44.300> me<00:00:44.480> all<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.750> time

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
doesn't need to be with me all the time

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.440 
doesn't need to be with me all the time
let's<00:00:46.160> take<00:00:46.340> a<00:00:46.400> quick<00:00:46.670> look<00:00:46.850> around<00:00:46.970> the<00:00:47.210> case

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
let's take a quick look around the case

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.050 
let's take a quick look around the case
so<00:00:48.290> here<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:48.650> is<00:00:48.770> again<00:00:48.800> it's<00:00:49.670> made<00:00:49.910> out<00:00:50.030> of

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
so here it is again it's made out of

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.510 
so here it is again it's made out of
some<00:00:50.420> neoprene<00:00:51.110> type<00:00:51.410> material<00:00:52.010> which<00:00:52.340> will

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
some neoprene type material which will

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.280 
some neoprene type material which will
probably<00:00:52.790> protect<00:00:53.450> it<00:00:53.600> against<00:00:53.870> some<00:00:54.080> light

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
probably protect it against some light

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.530 
probably protect it against some light
water<00:00:54.500> sprays<00:00:54.940> there's<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:56.000> nice<00:00:56.150> print<00:00:56.420> up

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
water sprays there's a nice print up

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.630 
water sprays there's a nice print up

let's<00:01:09.920> reveal<00:01:10.580> as<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.060> inside<00:01:11.480> the<00:01:12.110> first

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
let's reveal as the inside the first

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.840 
let's reveal as the inside the first
thing<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.740> will<00:01:12.860> notice<00:01:13.040> when<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:13.490> open<00:01:13.520> the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
case is the foam inserts they stink the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.180 
case is the foam inserts they stink the
smell<00:01:17.270> does<00:01:17.480> eventually<00:01:17.780> were<00:01:18.140> off<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.350> bit<00:01:18.680> but

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
smell does eventually were off a bit but

in this protective case except for the

in this protective case except for the
car<00:02:46.460> mount<00:02:46.700> as<00:02:46.940> mentioned<00:02:47.390> but<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:47.840> much

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
car mount as mentioned but it's much

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.630 
car mount as mentioned but it's much
bigger<00:02:48.200> than<00:02:48.350> this<00:02:48.650> case<00:02:48.890> which<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.310> don't<00:02:49.370> want

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
bigger than this case which I don't want

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.550 
bigger than this case which I don't want
to<00:02:49.700> carry<00:02:49.910> around<00:02:50.090> anyway<00:02:50.630> now<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.170> bought<00:02:51.350> this

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
to carry around anyway now I bought this

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.560 
to carry around anyway now I bought this
case<00:02:51.740> for<00:02:51.920> 24<00:02:52.310> pounds<00:02:52.700> which<00:02:52.880> sounds<00:02:53.300> like

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
case for 24 pounds which sounds like

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.360 
case for 24 pounds which sounds like
quite<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.840> lot<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.530> material<00:02:54.980> seems<00:02:55.160> quite

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
quite a lot but the material seems quite

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.040 
quite a lot but the material seems quite
good<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.850> foam<00:02:56.060> inserts<00:02:56.240> are<00:02:56.600> quite<00:02:56.750> sturdy

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
good the foam inserts are quite sturdy

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.320 
good the foam inserts are quite sturdy
so<00:02:57.560> in<00:02:57.680> theory<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.190> should<00:02:58.370> protect<00:02:58.520> my<00:02:58.910> GoPro

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
so in theory it should protect my GoPro

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.300 
so in theory it should protect my GoPro
quite<00:02:59.540> well<00:02:59.750> the<00:03:00.290> last<00:03:00.470> thing<00:03:00.740> I<00:03:00.830> want<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.100> say

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
quite well the last thing I want to say

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.640 
quite well the last thing I want to say
is<00:03:01.520> that<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.300> GoPro<00:03:02.690> uses<00:03:03.080> up<00:03:03.230> its<00:03:03.470> battery

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
is that the GoPro uses up its battery

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.830 
is that the GoPro uses up its battery
quite<00:03:04.070> quickly<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:05.120> may<00:03:05.360> have<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.720> get

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
quite quickly so I may have to get

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.510 
quite quickly so I may have to get
additional<00:03:06.290> batteries<00:03:06.680> very<00:03:06.890> soon<00:03:07.250> and

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
additional batteries very soon and

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.000 
additional batteries very soon and
another<00:03:08.060> charger<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:09.260> won't<00:03:09.530> fit<00:03:09.770> in<00:03:09.890> this

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
another charger so won't fit in this

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.150 
another charger so won't fit in this
case<00:03:10.330> turns<00:03:11.330> out<00:03:11.540> SP<00:03:11.960> United<00:03:12.380> makes<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.770> larger

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
case turns out SP United makes a larger

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.260 
case turns out SP United makes a larger
version<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.550> this<00:03:13.760> case

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
version of this case

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.610 
version of this case
which<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.750> didn't<00:03:15.020> know<00:03:15.050> at<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.260> time<00:03:15.320> of

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
which I didn't know at the time of
