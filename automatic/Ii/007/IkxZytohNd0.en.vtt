of<00:01:12.420> their<00:01:12.510> time<00:01:13.159> it's<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.220> very<00:01:14.460> safe

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
of their time it's a very safe

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.300 
of their time it's a very safe
environment<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.500> more<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.710> watch<00:01:17.009> them

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
environment and the more I watch them

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.679 
environment and the more I watch them
the<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> realized<00:01:18.000> Christopher<00:01:18.570> can

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the more I realized Christopher can

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.240 
the more I realized Christopher can
actually<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.439> than<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.710> thought

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
actually do more than I thought

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.560 
actually do more than I thought
so<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.640> honestly<00:01:21.119> good<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
so that was honestly good for the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.630 
so that was honestly good for the
parents<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:22.049> see<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.500> well<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.280> think<00:01:23.369> it's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
parents to see as well so I think it's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.039 
parents to see as well so I think it's
maybe<00:01:23.970> taking<00:01:24.270> some<00:01:24.299> challenges<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.930> we

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
maybe taking some challenges that we

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.899 
maybe taking some challenges that we
wouldn't<00:01:25.290> naturally<00:01:25.409> take<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.040> our<00:01:26.159> own<00:01:26.189> might

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
wouldn't naturally take on our own might

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.580 
wouldn't naturally take on our own might
be<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.180> bit<00:01:27.330> afraid<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.380> find

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
be a little bit afraid of but you find

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.940 
be a little bit afraid of but you find
out<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.920> end<00:01:29.100> you're<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.790> glad<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.210> did<00:01:30.360> it

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
out in the end you're so glad you did it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.899 
out in the end you're so glad you did it
certainly<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:32.189> are<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.310> lot<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.460> physical

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
certainly there are a lot of physical

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.060 
certainly there are a lot of physical

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
learned a sign in sign language where he

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.270 
learned a sign in sign language where he
taps<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.689> horn<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.990> saddle<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.560> to

writing<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.360> horses<00:03:00.720> makes<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.110> kind<00:03:01.320> of

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
writing on the horses makes you kind of

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.970 
writing on the horses makes you kind of
happy<00:03:02.360> so<00:03:03.360> even<00:03:03.690> though<00:03:03.810> we're<00:03:04.050> working<00:03:04.890> with

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
happy so even though we're working with

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.670 
happy so even though we're working with
only<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.250> small<00:03:05.550> number<00:03:05.580> of<00:03:06.000> kids<00:03:06.210> right<00:03:06.420> now

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
only a small number of kids right now

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.080 
only a small number of kids right now
our<00:03:07.680> hope<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.130> we<00:03:08.280> could<00:03:08.550> turn<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:08.880> into

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
our hope is that we could turn this into

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.120 
our hope is that we could turn this into
a<00:03:09.209> much<00:03:09.420> larger<00:03:09.810> program<00:03:10.260> perhaps<00:03:10.680> provide

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
a much larger program perhaps provide

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.040 
a much larger program perhaps provide
our<00:03:11.280> own<00:03:11.310> training<00:03:11.850> program<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.450> help<00:03:12.630> others

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
our own training program to help others

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.110 
our own training program to help others
develop<00:03:13.890> programs<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.520> can<00:03:14.670> be<00:03:14.730> used<00:03:14.820> in

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
develop programs that can be used in

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.270 
develop programs that can be used in
other<00:03:15.270> school<00:03:15.540> districts<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:16.380> would<00:03:17.010> encourage

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
other school districts I would encourage

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.699 
other school districts I would encourage
any<00:03:17.520> parents<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.360> look<00:03:18.600> into<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.930> program<00:03:19.320> to

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
any parents to look into the program to

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:20.870 
any parents to look into the program to
try<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.310> out

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
try it out

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.960 
try it out
it's<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.630> ultimate<00:03:22.080> goal<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.830> have<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.640> path

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
it's the ultimate goal to have the path

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.880 
it's the ultimate goal to have the path
program<00:03:24.239> moved<00:03:24.630> on<00:03:24.810> campus<00:03:25.290> which<00:03:25.620> would

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
program moved on campus which would

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.850 
program moved on campus which would
enable<00:03:26.250> us<00:03:26.550> to<00:03:27.080> expand<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.230> program<00:03:28.440> and

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
enable us to expand the program and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.940 
enable us to expand the program and
offer<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.370> more<00:03:29.520> people<00:03:29.550> in<00:03:30.330> spite<00:03:30.750> of

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
offer it to more people in spite of

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.740 
offer it to more people in spite of
increasing<00:03:31.950> our<00:03:32.070> size<00:03:32.310> by<00:03:32.520> 50%<00:03:32.910> we<00:03:33.390> still<00:03:33.600> have

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
increasing our size by 50% we still have

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.479 
increasing our size by 50% we still have
a<00:03:33.780> waiting<00:03:34.140> list<00:03:34.260> with<00:03:34.470> approximately<00:03:35.070> 15<00:03:35.459> to
