the load seen in flight we understood
that<00:04:36.210> from<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.510> second<00:04:38.160> part<00:04:39.160> of<00:04:39.610> 2014<00:04:40.570> so

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
that from the second part of 2014 so

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.640 
that from the second part of 2014 so
they<00:04:42.010> will<00:04:42.310> introduce<00:04:42.729> a<00:04:43.240> new<00:04:43.270> shaft<00:04:43.930> for<00:04:44.470> the
