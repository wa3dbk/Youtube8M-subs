00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
down next to all these plants and got

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
down next to all these plants and got
totally<00:00:55.110> filled<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.039> energy<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.789> the

totally filled up with energy and the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.420 
totally filled up with energy and the
plants<00:00:57.449> said<00:00:57.629> you're<00:00:57.840> home<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.680> you're<00:00:59.340> gonna

live your life with us and I think after

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.009 
live your life with us and I think after
that<00:01:02.100> moment<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.809> wanted<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.930> learn

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
that moment I just wanted to learn

that moment I just wanted to learn
everything<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.530> could<00:01:04.739> about<00:01:04.830> plants<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:07.159> lot<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
everything I could about plants a lot of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.420 
everything I could about plants a lot of

the food that we eat currently are

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.440 
planted like annual crops and a lot of
the<00:01:13.860> seeds<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.549> those<00:01:14.700> crops<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.270> been

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the seeds of those crops have been

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.660 
the seeds of those crops have been
either<00:01:15.799> hybridized<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:17.250> genetically

those things cannot be quite as high

those things cannot be quite as high

foods that we eat are cultured by humans

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.090

annuals don't have time to get down and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.819 
annuals don't have time to get down and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
connected to pull in those minerals so

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.710 
connected to pull in those minerals so
we're<00:02:08.009> getting<00:02:08.250> such<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> higher<00:02:08.819> rich<00:02:09.239> mineral

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
we're getting such a higher rich mineral

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.340 
environment and in the pristine nature
environment<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.910> reason<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.420> chose<00:02:43.660> these<00:02:43.840> 13

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
environment the reason I chose these 13

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.680 
environment the reason I chose these 13
and<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.620> actually<00:02:45.310> feel<00:02:45.640> like<00:02:45.700> they<00:02:46.000> chose<00:02:46.360> me

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
and I actually feel like they chose me

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.740 
and I actually feel like they chose me
because<00:02:47.320> I've<00:02:47.650> as<00:02:48.310> I've<00:02:48.550> traveled<00:02:49.150> around<00:02:49.390> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
because I've as I've traveled around the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.590 
because I've as I've traveled around the
world<00:02:49.810> through<00:02:50.620> different<00:02:50.890> countries<00:02:51.510> from<00:02:52.510> a

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
world through different countries from a

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.440 
world through different countries from a
child<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.110> up<00:02:53.740> I've<00:02:54.310> always<00:02:54.610> noticed<00:02:54.820> these

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
child on up I've always noticed these

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.660 
child on up I've always noticed these
plants<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.320> were<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.920> same<00:02:57.070> plants<00:02:57.550> no

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
plants that were the same plants no

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.520 
plants that were the same plants no
matter<00:02:57.850> which<00:02:58.180> country<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.720> was<00:02:58.959> in<00:02:59.020> whether<00:02:59.440> it

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
matter which country I was in whether it

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.620 
matter which country I was in whether it
was<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.740> Arctic<00:03:00.070> Circle<00:03:00.250> or<00:03:00.610> down<00:03:01.390> in<00:03:01.570> the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
was the Arctic Circle or down in the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.810 
was the Arctic Circle or down in the
Philippines<00:03:02.080> or<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.860> know<00:03:02.950> Japan<00:03:03.310> or<00:03:03.640> all

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
Philippines or you know Japan or all

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.390 
Philippines or you know Japan or all
these<00:03:04.120> different<00:03:04.180> ranges<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.590> the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
these different ranges of the of the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.240 
these different ranges of the of the
world<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:07.030> so<00:03:07.780> these<00:03:07.900> 13<00:03:08.320> plants<00:03:08.680> continue<00:03:09.130> to

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
world and so these 13 plants continue to

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.760 
world and so these 13 plants continue to
keep<00:03:09.370> showing<00:03:09.760> up<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.090> then<00:03:10.540> as<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:11.260> researched

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
keep showing up and then as I researched

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.120 
keep showing up and then as I researched
further<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.730> realized<00:03:13.330> oh<00:03:13.600> they<00:03:13.840> actually<00:03:14.130> do

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
further I realized oh they actually do

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.570 
further I realized oh they actually do
grow<00:03:15.520> in<00:03:15.730> every<00:03:16.270> country<00:03:16.810> on<00:03:16.990> every<00:03:17.890> continent

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
grow in every country on every continent

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.040 
grow in every country on every continent
where<00:03:18.970> humans<00:03:19.420> have<00:03:19.510> permanent

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
where humans have permanent

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.580 
where humans have permanent
civilizations<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.720> that's<00:03:22.720> why<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.019> 13

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
civilizations so that's why the 13

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.500 
civilizations so that's why the 13
emerged<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.220> because<00:03:24.640> they're<00:03:24.790> all<00:03:24.910> food<00:03:25.239> and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
emerged and because they're all food and

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.960 
emerged and because they're all food and
medicine<00:03:25.989> so<00:03:26.620> there's<00:03:26.830> an<00:03:26.950> overlap<00:03:27.459> they're

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
medicine so there's an overlap they're

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.150 
medicine so there's an overlap they're
nutritious<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.780> eat<00:03:28.959> but<00:03:29.500> they<00:03:29.620> also<00:03:29.800> have

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
nutritious to eat but they also have

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.040 
nutritious to eat but they also have
medicinal<00:03:30.459> purposes<00:03:31.150> that's<00:03:31.360> right<00:03:31.600> I

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
medicinal purposes that's right I

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.140 
medicinal purposes that's right I
actually<00:03:32.620> think<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.160> them<00:03:33.340> as<00:03:33.489> food<00:03:33.760> and

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
actually think of them as food and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.660 
actually think of them as food and
medicine<00:03:35.110> actually<00:03:35.620> food<00:03:36.070> first<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:36.519> then

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
medicine actually food first and then

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.009 
medicine actually food first and then
medicine<00:03:37.060> also<00:03:39.269> dandelion<00:03:40.269> is<00:03:40.450> one<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:40.810> them

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
medicine also dandelion is one of them

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.680 
medicine also dandelion is one of them
and<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.160> entire<00:03:42.430> thing<00:03:42.459> is<00:03:42.790> edible<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.480> roots

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
and the entire thing is edible the roots

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.500 
and the entire thing is edible the roots
can<00:03:43.930> be<00:03:43.959> used<00:03:44.260> like<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.440> potato<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.880> just<00:03:45.940> eaten

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
can be used like a potato and just eaten

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.259 
can be used like a potato and just eaten
or<00:03:47.019> put<00:03:47.440> in<00:03:47.560> soups<00:03:47.800> or<00:03:48.100> cooked<00:03:48.370> or<00:03:48.610> eaten<00:03:49.090> raw

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
and the greens of course are just loaded

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.259 
and the greens of course are just loaded
with<00:03:52.390> nutrition<00:03:52.870> and<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:54.220> flower<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.970> stem

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
with nutrition and the flower the stem

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.229 
with nutrition and the flower the stem
even<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.810> seeds<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.530> little<00:03:56.560> puffball<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:58.060> can

even the seeds a little puffball you can

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.479 
even the seeds a little puffball you can
take<00:03:58.510> all<00:03:59.019> those<00:03:59.470> little<00:03:59.739> white<00:03:59.920> puffballs

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
take all those little white puffballs

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.820 
take all those little white puffballs
seeds<00:04:01.030> with<00:04:01.600> a<00:04:01.630> pinch<00:04:01.959> in<00:04:02.110> your<00:04:02.230> hand<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.680> take

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.779 
very much always learning and playing
around<00:06:01.810> with<00:06:02.110> that<00:06:02.259> edge<00:06:02.469> when<00:06:03.219> I<00:06:03.250> gather<00:06:03.550> the

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
around with that edge when I gather the

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.180 
around with that edge when I gather the
seeds<00:06:04.150> of<00:06:04.569> for<00:06:04.870> example<00:06:05.259> amaranth<00:06:05.800> or

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
seeds of for example amaranth or

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.879 
seeds of for example amaranth or
lambsquarters<00:06:06.990> amaranth<00:06:07.990> seeds<00:06:08.379> are<00:06:08.620> packed

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
lambsquarters amaranth seeds are packed

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.830 
lambsquarters amaranth seeds are packed
with<00:06:09.039> proteins<00:06:09.550> have<00:06:10.000> all<00:06:10.210> eight<00:06:10.479> essential

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
with proteins have all eight essential

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.600 
with proteins have all eight essential
amino<00:06:11.080> acids<00:06:11.680> and<00:06:11.860> so<00:06:12.159> do<00:06:12.279> the<00:06:12.400> lamb

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
amino acids and so do the lamb

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.309 
amino acids and so do the lamb
lambsquarters<00:06:13.509> seeds<00:06:13.750> they<00:06:13.960> turn<00:06:14.169> into

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 
lambsquarters seeds they turn into

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.490 
lambsquarters seeds they turn into
quinoa<00:06:14.650> and<00:06:15.129> so<00:06:15.759> both<00:06:16.419> of<00:06:16.449> those<00:06:16.810> seeds<00:06:17.139> I<00:06:17.289> just

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
quinoa and so both of those seeds I just

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.330 
quinoa and so both of those seeds I just
dry<00:06:17.770> in<00:06:17.919> a<00:06:18.039> I<00:06:18.250> just<00:06:18.940> harvest<00:06:19.840> and<00:06:20.279> usually<00:06:21.279> I

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
dry in a I just harvest and usually I

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.890 
dry in a I just harvest and usually I
harvest<00:06:21.669> them<00:06:21.819> when<00:06:21.849> they're<00:06:22.150> dry<00:06:22.449> on<00:06:22.719> the

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
harvest them when they're dry on the

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.749 
harvest them when they're dry on the
stock<00:06:23.199> and<00:06:23.500> then<00:06:23.800> I<00:06:23.860> just<00:06:24.099> store<00:06:24.340> them<00:06:24.520> in<00:06:24.639> a

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 
stock and then I just store them in a

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:28.680 
stock and then I just store them in a
glass<00:06:25.690> jar<00:06:25.719> or<00:06:26.469> a<00:06:26.639> paper<00:06:27.639> bag<00:06:27.909> but<00:06:28.330> usually<00:06:28.659> a

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
glass jar or a paper bag but usually a

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.990 
glass jar or a paper bag but usually a
glass<00:06:28.900> jar<00:06:29.199> and<00:06:29.500> keep<00:06:30.069> it<00:06:30.219> airtight<00:06:30.340> so<00:06:30.879> the

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
glass jar and keep it airtight so the

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.459 
glass jar and keep it airtight so the
moisture<00:06:31.330> doesn't<00:06:31.509> get<00:06:31.719> in<00:06:31.870> and<00:06:32.110> that's<00:06:32.379> a

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:32.469 
moisture doesn't get in and that's a

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:33.749 
moisture doesn't get in and that's a
great<00:06:32.650> way<00:06:32.770> to<00:06:32.800> store<00:06:33.129> those<00:06:33.400> seeds

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 
great way to store those seeds

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.680 
great way to store those seeds
throughout<00:06:34.690> the<00:06:34.870> winter<00:06:35.169> for<00:06:35.560> cereals<00:06:36.219> and

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
throughout the winter for cereals and

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.820 
throughout the winter for cereals and
grain<00:06:37.690> dishes

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
grain dishes

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.380 
grain dishes
you<00:06:39.830> know<00:06:39.920> in<00:06:40.040> college<00:06:40.220> I<00:06:40.670> got<00:06:40.880> a<00:06:41.030> degree<00:06:41.210> in

you know in college I got a degree in

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.450 
you know in college I got a degree in
biology<00:06:41.680> but<00:06:42.680> I<00:06:42.740> was<00:06:42.890> able<00:06:43.010> to<00:06:43.160> do<00:06:43.340> these

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
biology but I was able to do these

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.670 
biology but I was able to do these
independent<00:06:43.970> studies<00:06:44.360> on<00:06:44.720> wild<00:06:45.200> plants<00:06:45.590> and

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
independent studies on wild plants and

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.350 
independent studies on wild plants and
go<00:06:45.920> to<00:06:46.370> the<00:06:46.460> woods<00:06:46.610> for<00:06:46.700> a<00:06:46.820> month<00:06:47.030> and<00:06:47.240> then

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
go to the woods for a month and then

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.330 
go to the woods for a month and then
come<00:06:47.510> back<00:06:47.540> and<00:06:47.750> write<00:06:47.870> a<00:06:47.900> paper<00:06:48.080> and<00:06:48.440> then<00:06:49.160> to

JFK where I got a holistic health

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.320 
JFK where I got a holistic health
education<00:06:51.620> so<00:06:52.340> I<00:06:52.370> mean<00:06:52.640> my<00:06:52.790> journey<00:06:53.180> of

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
education so I mean my journey of

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.750 
education so I mean my journey of
learning<00:06:54.200> about<00:06:54.350> the<00:06:54.530> plants<00:06:54.920> has<00:06:55.040> come<00:06:55.280> from

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
learning about the plants has come from

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.670 
learning about the plants has come from
being<00:06:56.060> in<00:06:56.180> the<00:06:56.270> woods<00:06:56.420> emerged<00:06:56.900> immersed<00:06:57.410> with

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
being in the woods emerged immersed with

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.170 
being in the woods emerged immersed with
him<00:06:57.830> and<00:06:58.100> then<00:06:58.310> I<00:06:58.610> just<00:06:58.940> keep<00:06:59.210> learning<00:07:00.050> and

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180 
him and then I just keep learning and

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:11.350 
him and then I just keep learning and
sharing<00:07:02.180> now<00:07:02.330> too
