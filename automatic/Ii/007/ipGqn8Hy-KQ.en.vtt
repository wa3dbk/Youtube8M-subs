you<00:00:11.840> about<00:00:11.930> our<00:00:12.049> Gemini<00:00:12.500> systems<00:00:13.070> and<00:00:13.309> our

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.369 
you about our Gemini systems and our

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.760 
you about our Gemini systems and our
general<00:00:13.700> operations<00:00:14.209> if<00:00:15.049> you<00:00:15.260> look<00:00:15.469> you<00:00:15.740> see

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
general operations if you look you see

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.460 
general operations if you look you see
the<00:00:16.190> LED<00:00:16.730> keypad<00:00:17.150> on<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:17.330> left<00:00:17.600> and<00:00:17.990> the<00:00:18.080> LCD

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
the LED keypad on the left and the LCD

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.419 
the LED keypad on the left and the LCD
keypad<00:00:19.009> on<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:19.189> right<00:00:19.689> so<00:00:20.830> most<00:00:21.830> things<00:00:22.160> on

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:22.429 
keypad on the right so most things on

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.370 
keypad on the right so most things on
these<00:00:22.580> two<00:00:23.060> keypads<00:00:23.449> are<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:23.750> same<00:00:24.019> as<00:00:24.230> an

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
these two keypads are the same as an

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.929 
these two keypads are the same as an
arming<00:00:25.000> bypassing<00:00:26.000> but<00:00:26.810> there<00:00:26.960> is<00:00:27.080> a<00:00:27.939> couple

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
arming bypassing but there is a couple

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.400 
arming bypassing but there is a couple
different<00:00:28.970> functions<00:00:29.689> that<00:00:29.900> are<00:00:30.050> different

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
different functions that are different

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.929 
different functions that are different
so<00:00:30.679> I'll<00:00:30.800> be<00:00:30.980> showing<00:00:31.189> you<00:00:31.369> that<00:00:31.550> in<00:00:31.820> this

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
so I'll be showing you that in this

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.050 
so I'll be showing you that in this
video<00:00:32.740> so<00:00:33.740> I<00:00:33.770> want<00:00:34.070> to<00:00:34.160> start<00:00:34.340> with<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.790> LCD

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
video so I want to start with the LCD

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:42.210 
video so I want to start with the LCD
keypad<00:00:35.780> on<00:00:35.810> the<00:00:35.960> right<00:00:37.780> so<00:00:40.330> let's<00:00:41.330> start<00:00:41.480> with

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
keypad on the right so let's start with

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.870 
keypad on the right so let's start with
how<00:00:43.220> to<00:00:43.250> on<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.730> system<00:00:44.980> so<00:00:45.980> first<00:00:46.610> thing<00:00:46.850> you

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
how to on the system so first thing you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.200 
how to on the system so first thing you
need<00:00:47.060> to<00:00:47.090> do<00:00:47.740> is<00:00:48.740> figure<00:00:49.550> out<00:00:49.670> if<00:00:50.000> you're

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
need to do is figure out if you're

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.470 
need to do is figure out if you're
arming<00:00:50.540> for<00:00:50.690> stay<00:00:50.930> or<00:00:51.200> way<00:00:52.090> so<00:00:53.090> let's<00:00:53.300> say

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
arming for stay or way so let's say

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.970 
arming for stay or way so let's say
you're<00:00:53.720> staying<00:00:53.990> in<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.230> house<00:00:54.410> and<00:00:54.740> you<00:00:54.830> want

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
you're staying in the house and you want

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.220 
you're staying in the house and you want
to<00:00:55.100> bypass<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.730> motions<00:00:56.180> and<00:00:56.480> you<00:00:56.870> want<00:00:57.050> to

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
to bypass the motions and you want to

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.430 
to bypass the motions and you want to
have<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.830> doors<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.220> windows<00:00:58.340> armed<00:00:59.020> so<00:01:00.020> the

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
have the doors and windows armed so the

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.470 
have the doors and windows armed so the
first<00:01:00.680> thing<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:01.010> need<00:01:01.130> to<00:01:01.190> do<00:01:01.430> is<00:01:01.730> bypass<00:01:02.030> the

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
first thing you need to do is bypass the

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.749 
first thing you need to do is bypass the
motion<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.290> way<00:01:03.440> to<00:01:03.500> do<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:03.920> is<00:01:04.220> hit

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
motion so the way to do that is hit

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.100 
motion so the way to do that is hit
interior<00:01:06.970> so<00:01:07.970> that<00:01:08.120> I'll<00:01:08.270> actually<00:01:08.420> bypasses

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
interior so that I'll actually bypasses

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.560 
interior so that I'll actually bypasses
the<00:01:09.230> motions<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.160> then<00:01:11.120> type<00:01:11.360> in<00:01:11.540> your

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
the motions and then type in your

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.930 
the motions and then type in your
four-digit<00:01:12.410> code<00:01:12.620> and<00:01:13.600> then<00:01:14.600> on<00:01:14.750> off<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.940> now

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
four-digit code and then on off and now

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.810 
four-digit code and then on off and now
you<00:01:16.970> see<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.360> system<00:01:17.780> is<00:01:17.840> armed<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:19.520> let's<00:01:19.700> say

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
you see the system is armed so let's say

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.460 
you see the system is armed so let's say
you're<00:01:19.970> waking<00:01:20.120> up<00:01:20.360> in<00:01:20.510> the<00:01:20.600> morning<00:01:20.990> or

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
you're waking up in the morning or

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.370 
you're waking up in the morning or
you're<00:01:21.890> coming<00:01:22.159> in<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.340> door<00:01:22.870> to<00:01:23.870> disarm<00:01:24.260> the

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
you're coming in the door to disarm the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.240 
you're coming in the door to disarm the
system<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:25.040> need<00:01:25.159> to<00:01:25.340> use<00:01:25.550> your<00:01:25.700> same<00:01:25.880> code

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.190 

and<00:01:28.790> then<00:01:28.940> select<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.600> on/off<00:01:29.870> button<00:01:29.900> again

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
and then select the on/off button again

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.330 
and then select the on/off button again
so<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.350> instant<00:01:33.770> button<00:01:33.980> is<00:01:34.130> another

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
so the instant button is another

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.100 
so the instant button is another
function<00:01:34.850> for<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.240> if<00:01:35.540> you're<00:01:35.780> staying<00:01:35.960> in

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
function for you if you're staying in

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.170 
function for you if you're staying in
the<00:01:36.230> house<00:01:36.410> no<00:01:37.220> one<00:01:37.370> should<00:01:37.520> be<00:01:37.610> going<00:01:37.880> in<00:01:38.030> or

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
the house no one should be going in or

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.010 
the house no one should be going in or
out<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.300> the<00:01:38.420> doors

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
out of the doors

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.710 
out of the doors
if<00:01:39.980> you<00:01:40.160> select<00:01:40.580> instant<00:01:41.090> before<00:01:41.210> you<00:01:41.450> arm<00:01:41.660> the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
if you select instant before you arm the

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.340 
if you select instant before you arm the
system<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:43.130> means<00:01:43.400> that<00:01:43.670> any<00:01:43.820> zone<00:01:44.690> whether

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
system that means that any zone whether

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.920 
system that means that any zone whether
it's<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.680> motion<00:01:45.890> in<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.190> garage<00:01:46.400> or<00:01:46.970> any<00:01:47.570> entry

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
it's a motion in a garage or any entry

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.130 
it's a motion in a garage or any entry
doors<00:01:48.400> will<00:01:49.400> be<00:01:49.430> instant<00:01:50.120> so<00:01:50.540> that<00:01:50.690> means<00:01:50.900> if

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
doors will be instant so that means if

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.470 
doors will be instant so that means if
someone<00:01:51.830> walks<00:01:52.340> in<00:01:52.490> front<00:01:52.670> of<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.820> motion<00:01:53.240> in

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
someone walks in front of the motion in

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.240 
someone walks in front of the motion in
the<00:01:53.510> garage<00:01:53.780> or<00:01:54.200> opens<00:01:54.740> one<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.100> doors

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
the garage or opens one of the doors

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.920 
the garage or opens one of the doors
that<00:01:55.520> are<00:01:55.640> supposed<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:55.880> be<00:01:55.970> entry<00:01:56.390> it

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
that are supposed to be entry it

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.300 
that are supposed to be entry it
automatically<00:01:57.320> sets<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.590> system<00:01:58.010> off<00:01:58.130> if

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
automatically sets the system off if

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.640 
automatically sets the system off if
this<00:01:58.460> isn't<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:59.350> automatically<00:02:00.350> sets<00:02:00.560> the

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
this isn't it automatically sets the

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.520 
this isn't it automatically sets the
system<00:02:00.980> off<00:02:01.130> if<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.460> system<00:02:01.820> is<00:02:01.940> armed<00:02:02.530> so

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
system off if the system is armed so

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.910 
system off if the system is armed so
let's<00:02:03.710> go<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.920> our<00:02:04.300> panic<00:02:05.300> functions<00:02:05.810> if<00:02:06.110> you

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
let's go to our panic functions if you

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.010 
let's go to our panic functions if you
look<00:02:07.070> on<00:02:07.190> your<00:02:07.370> pull-up<00:02:07.670> tab<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.270> have<00:02:08.300> two

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
look on your pull-up tab you have two

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.110 
look on your pull-up tab you have two
stickers<00:02:09.350> once<00:02:09.770> for<00:02:10.040> five<00:02:10.280> months<00:02:10.610> for<00:02:10.760> police

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
stickers once for five months for police

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.660 
stickers once for five months for police
and<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.050> notice<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.440> has<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.800> star<00:02:13.070> plus<00:02:13.430> the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
and you notice it has the star plus the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.090 
and you notice it has the star plus the
F<00:02:13.880> for<00:02:14.210> fire<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.750> star<00:02:14.990> plus<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.590> P<00:02:15.800> for

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
F for fire and the star plus the P for

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.460 
F for fire and the star plus the P for
the<00:02:16.190> police<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:17.570> this<00:02:17.720> is<00:02:17.900> if<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.230> need<00:02:18.350> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
the police so this is if you need the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.230 
the police so this is if you need the
fire<00:02:19.010> department<00:02:19.460> or<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.970> police<00:02:20.210> department

fire department or the police department
real<00:02:20.780> quick<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.170> can<00:02:21.410> hold<00:02:22.070> down<00:02:22.280> star<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.000> P

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
real quick you can hold down star and P

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.590 
real quick you can hold down star and P
for<00:02:23.360> police<00:02:23.690> or<00:02:24.050> start<00:02:24.500> an<00:02:24.620> F<00:02:25.030> for<00:02:26.030> fire<00:02:26.240> it

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
for police or start an F for fire it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.390 
for police or start an F for fire it
sets<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.930> system<00:02:27.290> off<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.710> it<00:02:27.770> sends<00:02:27.980> signals

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
sets the system off and it sends signals

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.270 
sets the system off and it sends signals
to<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:29.450> modern<00:02:29.720> company<00:02:30.110> let<00:02:30.320> them<00:02:30.440> know<00:02:30.650> you

to the modern company let them know you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.300 
to the modern company let them know you
know<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.760> need<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.000> fire<00:02:32.330> or<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:33.310> police

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
know you need the fire or the police

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.110 
know you need the fire or the police
department

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.430 

our<00:02:38.840> next<00:02:39.290> function<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.069> bypass<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:42.230> let's

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
our next function is a bypass so let's

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.740 
our next function is a bypass so let's
say<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:43.069> want<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.310> bypass<00:02:43.459> maybe<00:02:44.030> an

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
say that you want to bypass maybe an

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.949 
say that you want to bypass maybe an
interior<00:02:45.470> door<00:02:45.890> or<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:47.209> know<00:02:47.330> have<00:02:47.569> a<00:02:47.599> window

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
interior door or you know have a window

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.420 
interior door or you know have a window
open<00:02:48.349> or<00:02:48.530> even<00:02:48.560> if<00:02:48.830> you're<00:02:48.950> having<00:02:49.129> a<00:02:49.190> problem

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
open or even if you're having a problem

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.720 
open or even if you're having a problem
with<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:50.030> certain<00:02:50.360> zone<00:02:51.010> what<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.129> can<00:02:52.250> do<00:02:52.459> is

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
with a certain zone what you can do is

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.289 
with a certain zone what you can do is
individually<00:02:53.360> bypass<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:54.170> zone<00:02:54.760> so<00:02:55.760> what

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
individually bypass that zone so what

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.820 
individually bypass that zone so what
you<00:02:56.450> need<00:02:56.599> to<00:02:56.690> do<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:57.170> select<00:02:57.860> bypass<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.940> then

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
you need to do is select bypass and then

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.119 
you need to do is select bypass and then
enter<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:02.019> zone<00:03:03.019> that<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.739> want<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:03.980> bypass

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
enter the zone that you want to bypass

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.490 
enter the zone that you want to bypass
so<00:03:04.849> now<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.120> see<00:03:05.450> when<00:03:05.629> I<00:03:05.660> hit<00:03:05.840> bypass<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.410> I

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
so now you see when I hit bypass and I

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.670 
so now you see when I hit bypass and I
hit<00:03:06.620> 0<00:03:06.890> 1<00:03:07.129> it<00:03:07.400> shows<00:03:08.330> now<00:03:08.840> there<00:03:09.110> is<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.260> bypass

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
hit 0 1 it shows now there is a bypass

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.220 
hit 0 1 it shows now there is a bypass
and<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.040> shows<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.370> on<00:03:10.459> both<00:03:10.610> keypads

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.700 

so<00:03:15.230> now<00:03:15.410> if<00:03:15.650> I<00:03:15.739> on<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.010> system

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.670 

you<00:03:20.250> notice<00:03:20.520> this<00:03:20.670> status<00:03:21.210> line<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:22.110> slowly

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
you notice this status line is slowly

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.140 
you notice this status line is slowly
blinking<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.460> that<00:03:23.610> means<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.000> have

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
blinking so that means that you have

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.770 
blinking so that means that you have
something<00:03:24.360> bypassed<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:27.450> now<00:03:27.570> I'm<00:03:27.630> going<00:03:27.720> to

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
something bypassed so now I'm going to

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.040 
something bypassed so now I'm going to
disarm<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.170> system

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
disarm the system

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.440 
disarm the system
and<00:03:30.350> notice<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.040> bypass<00:03:31.460> is<00:03:31.670> cleared<00:03:32.030> on<00:03:32.270> both

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
and notice the bypass is cleared on both

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.740 
and notice the bypass is cleared on both
keypads<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.950> remember<00:03:34.610> if<00:03:34.850> you<00:03:35.120> bypassed<00:03:35.600> a

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
keypads so remember if you bypassed a

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.970 
keypads so remember if you bypassed a
certain<00:03:36.080> zone<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.530> want<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.740> keep<00:03:36.860> it

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
certain zone and you want to keep it

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.800 
certain zone and you want to keep it
bypassed<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:37.610> have<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.940> bypass<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.570> every

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
bypassed you have to bypass it every

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.000 
bypassed you have to bypass it every
time<00:03:39.050> before<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.560> on<00:03:39.740> the<00:03:39.890> system<00:03:42.010> one

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
time before you on the system one

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
time before you on the system one
important<00:03:43.520> button<00:03:43.760> on<00:03:43.880> your<00:03:44.000> keypad<00:03:44.540> is<00:03:44.750> reset

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
important button on your keypad is reset

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.760 
important button on your keypad is reset
so<00:03:47.030> if<00:03:47.240> there's<00:03:47.420> been<00:03:47.570> an<00:03:47.690> alarm<00:03:48.080> or<00:03:48.500> there's<00:03:48.710> a

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
so if there's been an alarm or there's a

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.490 
so if there's been an alarm or there's a
trouble<00:03:49.130> condition<00:03:49.670> if<00:03:50.390> you<00:03:50.630> fix<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.140> trouble

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
trouble condition if you fix the trouble

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.430 
trouble condition if you fix the trouble
you<00:03:51.770> can<00:03:51.890> hit<00:03:52.040> reset<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.580> clears<00:03:52.850> it<00:03:53.110> or<00:03:54.110> if

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
you can hit reset and clears it or if

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.500 
you can hit reset and clears it or if
there's<00:03:54.620> been<00:03:54.770> a<00:03:54.830> fire<00:03:55.160> alarm<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.850> it<00:03:56.210> shows<00:03:56.480> a

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
there's been a fire alarm and it shows a

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.470 
there's been a fire alarm and it shows a
fire<00:03:57.140> trouble<00:03:57.590> on<00:03:57.760> either<00:03:58.760> keypad<00:03:59.270> you<00:03:59.300> can

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
fire trouble on either keypad you can

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.140 
fire trouble on either keypad you can
hit<00:03:59.690> reset<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.380> it<00:04:00.740> resets<00:04:01.070> it<00:04:01.220> for<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:04.150> so

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
hit reset and it resets it for you so

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.600 
hit reset and it resets it for you so
now<00:04:05.240> let's<00:04:05.480> go<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.840> function<00:04:06.310> so<00:04:07.310> this<00:04:07.490> is

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
now let's go to the function so this is

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.130 
now let's go to the function so this is
what<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:08.000> main<00:04:08.150> difference<00:04:08.570> is<00:04:08.720> between<00:04:08.930> the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
what the main difference is between the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.340 
what the main difference is between the
two<00:04:09.170> keypads<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:11.180> let's<00:04:11.570> start<00:04:11.720> with<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.870> LCD

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
two keypads so let's start with the LCD

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.060 
two keypads so let's start with the LCD
and<00:04:12.670> look<00:04:13.670> at<00:04:13.790> our<00:04:13.880> functions<00:04:14.800> you<00:04:15.800> notice

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
and look at our functions you notice

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
is let's say you want to do a belt test

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.189 
is let's say you want to do a belt test
you<00:04:40.310> function<00:04:40.819> over<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.449> belt<00:04:41.659> test<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.139> you

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
you function over to belt test and you

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.010 
you function over to belt test and you
say<00:04:42.379> this<00:04:42.470> is<00:04:42.680> wire<00:04:43.189> in<00:04:43.490> so<00:04:44.270> that's<00:04:44.449> yes<00:04:44.719> and

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
say this is wire in so that's yes and

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.170 
say this is wire in so that's yes and
now<00:04:45.530> if<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:45.830> look<00:04:45.979> above<00:04:46.219> the<00:04:46.280> two<00:04:46.610> instant

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
now if you look above the two instant

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.939 
now if you look above the two instant
and<00:04:47.389> interior<00:04:47.870> buttons<00:04:48.229> they<00:04:48.379> have<00:04:48.500> yes<00:04:48.710> and

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
and interior buttons they have yes and

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.300 
and interior buttons they have yes and
no<00:04:49.069> so<00:04:49.969> if<00:04:50.120> it's<00:04:50.270> yes<00:04:50.539> you<00:04:50.840> need<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:51.050> hit<00:04:51.310> the

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
no so if it's yes you need to hit the

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.459 
no so if it's yes you need to hit the
top<00:04:52.520> one<00:04:52.930> so<00:04:53.930> what<00:04:54.110> should<00:04:54.229> be<00:04:54.289> happening

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:54.469 
top one so what should be happening

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.980 
top one so what should be happening
right<00:04:54.860> now<00:04:54.919> is<00:04:55.340> a<00:04:55.400> siren<00:04:56.270> should<00:04:56.449> be<00:04:56.539> going<00:04:56.870> off

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
right now is a siren should be going off

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.029 
right now is a siren should be going off
just<00:04:57.259> to<00:04:57.469> test<00:04:58.189> the<00:04:58.539> sirens<00:04:59.539> for<00:04:59.750> you<00:04:59.900> so<00:05:00.860> let's

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
just to test the sirens for you so let's

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.059 
just to test the sirens for you so let's
go<00:05:01.159> to<00:05:01.219> the<00:05:01.430> functions<00:05:01.849> on<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.210> LED<00:05:02.539> keypad<00:05:03.069> so

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
go to the functions on the LED keypad so

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.999 
go to the functions on the LED keypad so
one<00:05:04.250> thing<00:05:04.430> you'll<00:05:04.550> notice<00:05:05.199> the<00:05:06.199> LCD<00:05:06.680> keypad

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
one thing you'll notice the LCD keypad

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.290 
one thing you'll notice the LCD keypad
actually<00:05:07.310> reads<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.580> up<00:05:07.669> to<00:05:07.819> you<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.150> LED

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
actually reads it up to you the LED

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.080 
actually reads it up to you the LED
keypad<00:05:08.870> only<00:05:09.139> has<00:05:09.319> the<00:05:09.530> numbers<00:05:09.979> on<00:05:10.190> it<00:05:10.219> so<00:05:11.030> you

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
keypad only has the numbers on it so you

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.459 
keypad only has the numbers on it so you
have<00:05:11.479> to<00:05:11.509> remember<00:05:11.750> what<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.110> numbers<00:05:12.409> mean

have to remember what the numbers mean

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:15.790 
have to remember what the numbers mean
so<00:05:13.430> there's<00:05:14.330> only<00:05:14.449> a<00:05:14.569> few<00:05:14.840> options<00:05:14.990> on<00:05:15.349> the<00:05:15.469> LED

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
so there's only a few options on the LED

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.209 
so there's only a few options on the LED
keypads<00:05:16.219> so<00:05:17.000> when<00:05:17.210> I<00:05:17.240> hit<00:05:17.419> function<00:05:17.930> 3<00:05:18.860> is<00:05:19.159> a
