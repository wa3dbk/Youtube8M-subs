one off what what do you do I'm gonna
start<00:00:26.070> from<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> core<00:00:26.760> i3<00:00:26.910> then<00:00:27.359> Core<00:00:27.840> i5<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
start from the core i3 then Core i5 and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.970 
start from the core i3 then Core i5 and
then<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.550> core<00:00:29.760> i7<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:31.140> once<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.710> get<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
then the core i7 so once you get the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.970 
then the core i7 so once you get the
core<00:00:32.219> i3<00:00:32.340> version<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> young<00:00:33.239> alpha

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
core i3 version of the young alpha

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.790 
core i3 version of the young alpha
what's<00:00:34.980> next<00:00:35.550> now<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> highly<00:00:36.899> recommend<00:00:37.440> as

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
what's next now I highly recommend as

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.139 
what's next now I highly recommend as
soon<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.280> get<00:00:38.370> drilling<00:00:38.670> where<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.969> thought

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
soon as you get drilling where I thought

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.229 
soon as you get drilling where I thought
you<00:00:39.300> start<00:00:39.540> saving<00:00:39.809> up<00:00:40.079> for<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:41.280> ram<00:00:42.000> upgrade

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you start saving up for a ram upgrade

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.510 
you start saving up for a ram upgrade
because<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.050> core<00:00:43.350> i3<00:00:43.469> version<00:00:44.040> only<00:00:44.160> comes

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
because the core i3 version only comes

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.060 
because the core i3 version only comes
with<00:00:44.640> four<00:00:44.910> gigabytes<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.510> RAM

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
with four gigabytes of RAM

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.910 
with four gigabytes of RAM
now<00:00:47.700> we're<00:00:48.390> really<00:00:48.570> lucky<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.230> because<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
now we're really lucky here because a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.760 
now we're really lucky here because a
nine<00:00:50.100> work<00:00:50.340> has<00:00:50.670> put<00:00:50.969> one<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:52.079> gigabyte<00:00:52.469> stick

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
nine work has put one for gigabyte stick

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.340 
nine work has put one for gigabyte stick
instead<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.399> two<00:00:53.670> two<00:00:54.180> gigabyte<00:00:54.690> sticks<00:00:55.020> into

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
instead of two two gigabyte sticks into

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.000 
instead of two two gigabyte sticks into
the<00:00:55.530> elbow<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.329> means<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.800> you

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
to be like oh dude I'm running out of

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.500 
to be like oh dude I'm running out of
memory<00:04:09.959> about<00:04:10.260> Miami<00:04:10.650> office<00:04:11.129> for<00:04:11.459> so<00:04:11.609> long<00:04:11.790> so

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
memory about Miami office for so long so

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.300 
memory about Miami office for so long so
once<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.840> run<00:04:12.989> out<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:13.170> memory<00:04:13.409> you<00:04:14.010> want<00:04:14.189> to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
once you run out of memory you want to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.120 
once you run out of memory you want to
get<00:04:14.400> something<00:04:14.760> like<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.680> USB<00:04:16.680> hard<00:04:16.859> drive

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
get something like a USB hard drive

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.949 
get something like a USB hard drive
stick<00:04:17.430> that's<00:04:17.609> what<00:04:17.759> I<00:04:17.789> recommend<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:18.600> can

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
stick that's what I recommend you can

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.840 
stick that's what I recommend you can
get<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.169> regular<00:04:19.410> hard<00:04:19.829> drive<00:04:19.859> and<00:04:20.250> just<00:04:20.519> put<00:04:20.729> it

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
get a regular hard drive and just put it

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.710 
get a regular hard drive and just put it
in<00:04:20.940> here<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.120> what's<00:04:21.660> really<00:04:21.900> easy<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.440> do<00:04:23.720> so

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
in here and what's really easy to do so

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.770 
in here and what's really easy to do so
once<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.050> get<00:04:25.199> your<00:04:25.350> little<00:04:25.470> stick<00:04:25.919> things

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
once you get your little stick things

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.710 
once you get your little stick things
they're<00:04:27.780> around<00:04:28.139> like<00:04:28.530> 60<00:04:29.010> bucks<00:04:29.220> for<00:04:29.430> a

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
they're around like 60 bucks for a

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.140 
they're around like 60 bucks for a
terabyte<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:32.370> can<00:04:32.520> just<00:04:32.699> stick<00:04:32.880> them<00:04:33.000> in

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
terabyte and you can just stick them in

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.879 
terabyte and you can just stick them in
the<00:04:33.240> back<00:04:33.419> of<00:04:33.570> your<00:04:33.750> animal<00:04:34.320> or<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.410> look<00:04:34.680> for

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
the back of your animal or I look for

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.100 
the back of your animal or I look for
the<00:04:34.979> USB<00:04:35.220> 4<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:35.729> then<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:35.850> get<00:04:36.000> an<00:04:36.900> extra

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
the USB 4 and then you get an extra

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.040 
the USB 4 and then you get an extra
terabyte<00:04:37.889> plus<00:04:38.490> your<00:04:38.729> 500<00:04:39.389> gigabytes<00:04:39.780> that

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
terabyte plus your 500 gigabytes that

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.379 
terabyte plus your 500 gigabytes that
the<00:04:40.560> core<00:04:40.740> i3<00:04:40.830> version<00:04:41.340> comes<00:04:41.550> with<00:04:41.760> and

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
the core i3 version comes with and

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.390 
the core i3 version comes with and
that's<00:04:42.449> really<00:04:42.720> good<00:04:43.050> so<00:04:43.740> once<00:04:44.130> you<00:04:44.250> do<00:04:44.370> that

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
that's really good so once you do that

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.670 
that's really good so once you do that
you're<00:04:44.820> pretty<00:04:45.000> much<00:04:45.090> good<00:04:45.419> to<00:04:45.449> go<00:04:45.539> and

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
you're pretty much good to go and

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.770 
you're pretty much good to go and
I'm<00:04:48.130> not<00:04:48.370> gonna<00:04:48.490> talk<00:04:48.699> about<00:04:48.759> GPU<00:04:49.479> because

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
I'm not gonna talk about GPU because

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.740 
I'm not gonna talk about GPU because
Alan<00:04:50.110> Ross<00:04:50.350> fuck<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:51.370> alien<00:04:52.030> war<00:04:52.180> did<00:04:52.389> sort<00:04:52.690> of

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
Alan Ross fuck it alien war did sort of

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.330 
Alan Ross fuck it alien war did sort of
solder<00:04:53.050> that<00:04:53.169> in<00:04:53.470> so<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.770> can<00:04:54.009> type<00:04:54.130> great

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
solder that in so you can type great

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.550 
solder that in so you can type great
your<00:04:54.550> your<00:04:54.820> GPU<00:04:55.270> but<00:04:56.020> that's<00:04:56.199> okay<00:04:56.530> because

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
your your GPU but that's okay because

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.370 
your your GPU but that's okay because
they<00:04:57.009> did<00:04:57.160> sort<00:04:57.370> of<00:04:57.720> if<00:04:58.720> anything's<00:04:59.229> the

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
they did sort of if anything's the

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.110 
they did sort of if anything's the
highest<00:04:59.710> quality<00:05:00.009> on<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.280> on<00:05:00.400> Wafaa<00:05:00.639> it<00:05:00.940> is

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
highest quality on the on Wafaa it is

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.270 
highest quality on the on Wafaa it is
the<00:05:01.300> GPU<00:05:01.810> so<00:05:02.080> that<00:05:02.229> will<00:05:02.350> last<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:02.740> a<00:05:03.130> good

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
the GPU so that will last you a good

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.460 
the GPU so that will last you a good
long<00:05:03.759> while<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:05.699> once<00:05:06.699> a<00:05:06.940> once<00:05:07.509> the<00:05:07.690> GP<00:05:08.050> starts

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
long while and once a once the GP starts

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.990 
long while and once a once the GP starts
going<00:05:08.830> down<00:05:09.009> I<00:05:09.039> think<00:05:09.250> it's<00:05:09.520> time<00:05:09.699> to<00:05:09.729> get

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
going down I think it's time to get

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.230 
going down I think it's time to get
either<00:05:10.539> like<00:05:10.870> beyond<00:05:11.139> awful<00:05:11.500> like<00:05:11.910> three<00:05:12.910> or

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
either like beyond awful like three or

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.939 
either like beyond awful like three or
whatever<00:05:13.389> is<00:05:13.870> by<00:05:14.169> that<00:05:14.350> time<00:05:14.560> well<00:05:14.710> it<00:05:14.800> we've
