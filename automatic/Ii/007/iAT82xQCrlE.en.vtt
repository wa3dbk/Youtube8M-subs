you want these are the cars so let's

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.410 
you want these are the cars so let's
start

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.190 

they're<00:00:40.420> very<00:00:40.660> fast<00:00:41.260> I<00:00:42.480> bet<00:00:43.480> you<00:00:43.660> didn't<00:00:44.020> even

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
they're very fast I bet you didn't even

00:00:44.200 --> 00:01:00.360 
they're very fast I bet you didn't even
see<00:00:44.650> that<00:00:44.920> one<00:00:46.170> here's<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.350> blue<00:00:47.590> one

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.210 

probably<00:01:01.370> you<00:01:01.640> don't<00:01:01.820> know<00:01:02.210> but<00:01:02.600> these<00:01:03.410> cars

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
probably you don't know but these cars

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.750 
probably you don't know but these cars
have<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.699> switch<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:06.710> grey<00:01:07.070> switch<00:01:07.400> in<00:01:07.610> the

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
have a switch this grey switch in the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.900 
have a switch this grey switch in the
middle<00:01:08.120> and<00:01:08.390> as<00:01:09.110> you<00:01:09.260> can<00:01:09.380> see<00:01:09.620> now<00:01:09.910> it's

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
middle and as you can see now it's

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.870 
middle and as you can see now it's
forward<00:01:11.570> meaning<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.740> car<00:01:13.570> we<00:01:14.570> do<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.960> drag

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
forward meaning the car we do the drag

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.740 
forward meaning the car we do the drag
race<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.619> if<00:01:18.619> you<00:01:18.770> move<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.610> switch<00:01:19.970> in<00:01:20.690> the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
race and if you move the switch in the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.060 
race and if you move the switch in the
back<00:01:21.200> like<00:01:21.800> this<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:24.020> car<00:01:24.320> will<00:01:24.530> do<00:01:24.740> some

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
back like this the car will do some

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.219 
back like this the car will do some
tricks<00:01:26.290> now<00:01:27.290> as<00:01:27.890> you<00:01:28.100> can<00:01:28.280> see<00:01:28.369> it<00:01:29.000> moves<00:01:29.360> more

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.790 

it<00:01:33.229> moves<00:01:33.560> more<00:01:34.570> so<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:35.750> can<00:01:35.960> do<00:01:36.140> some<00:01:36.380> tricks

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
it moves more so it can do some tricks

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:44.440 
it moves more so it can do some tricks
and<00:01:41.110> if<00:01:42.110> you<00:01:42.320> mount<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.770> forward<00:01:43.340> it's<00:01:44.119> really

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
and if you mount it forward it's really

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.310 
and if you mount it forward it's really
hard<00:01:44.690> with<00:01:44.869> one<00:01:44.899> hand<00:01:45.970> it<00:01:46.970> will<00:01:47.300> do<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.990> drag

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
hard with one hand it will do the drag

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:59.950 
hard with one hand it will do the drag
and<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.950> will<00:01:49.160> not<00:01:49.369> move<00:01:49.610> anymore

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:03:14.970 

ready<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.890> launch

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.940 

for<00:03:15.980> more<00:03:16.310> fun<00:03:16.730> we<00:03:18.099> added<00:03:19.099> a<00:03:19.370> little<00:03:20.239> box<00:03:20.950> at

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
for more fun we added a little box at

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.309 
for more fun we added a little box at
the<00:03:22.310> end<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.849> track<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:24.110> make<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:25.370> high<00:03:26.319> so

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
the end of the track to make it high so

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:38.290 
the end of the track to make it high so
now<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.739> cars<00:03:28.190> will<00:03:28.370> jump<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:33.170> let's<00:03:33.530> see

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:51.699 

the<00:03:39.300> first<00:03:39.630> one<00:03:39.900> it's<00:03:40.170> this<00:03:40.530> blue<00:03:41.220> one

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:04:11.479 

yep<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:54.840> works<00:03:55.879> under<00:03:57.349> too<00:03:58.349> fast<00:04:10.220> you<00:04:11.220> can't

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
yep it works under too fast you can't

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:21.500 
yep it works under too fast you can't
even<00:04:11.670> see<00:04:12.120> them<00:04:14.330> they're<00:04:15.330> way<00:04:15.599> too<00:04:15.630> fast<00:04:20.510> this

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
even see them they're way too fast this

00:04:21.510 --> 00:05:07.230 
even see them they're way too fast this
one<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.930> didn't<00:04:22.260> work

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.080 

so<00:05:08.240> this<00:05:08.510> is<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:08.810> hot<00:05:09.020> wheels<00:05:09.230> top<00:05:10.070> speed<00:05:10.490> set

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
so this is the hot wheels top speed set

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.260 
so this is the hot wheels top speed set
with<00:05:11.360> some<00:05:11.660> added<00:05:11.870> tracks<00:05:12.610> of<00:05:13.610> course<00:05:13.970> you<00:05:14.120> can

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
with some added tracks of course you can
