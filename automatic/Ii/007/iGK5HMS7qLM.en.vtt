00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:10.070
 and I say there must be an out goat to 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:13.160
 way of farewell I do not think that it 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.550
 I wanted the laptop that is full of 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.890
 photos of memories of documents 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.590
 million important that is something that 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.080
 I have with me always I think that 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.000
 fundamental would that be at least 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.150
 to keep preserving I remember it 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.719
 Well, the truth is that Twitter uses it 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.229
 relatively little of my followers are 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.870
 all the majority athletes and then 

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:42.469
 national newspapers to be a little 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.219
 to the day of the news not but but the 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.139
 rest 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.839
 good here when it comes to Seville and 

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:50.420
 several there are several very horny are not 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.209
 lists the opera this is a phenomenon 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.760
 that in fact we sometimes comment on it 

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:57.760
 then for the things that you put 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.019
 I would say no no no I do not think 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.179
 It is a character 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.729
 which is typical of the films of 

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:11.490
 torrent because good I think it has 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.939
 that grace to Cadiz that we all 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.060
 makes you laugh is also a young bloke who 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.549
 good that his jokes are the ass kk but 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.159
 asked for this one that very typical of 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.150
 torrent films and I recorded that 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.180
 would be the character of the ideal character 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.740
 man the one already lived a holy week and 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.970
 A fair 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.750
 I am not very devoted to saints and others 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.159
 but but good the end I share 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.100
 I share my life some sevillanas and 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:47.240
 she is very from the macarena and logically 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.560
 good by proximity to her because I'm 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.990
 I am history is not necessary, not because 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.080
 the fair can enjoy it the little ones 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.939
 things were not going well last year and good 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.780
 at the end the dances for others not 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.810
 let's hope that this year we can 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.929
 enjoy it good my opinion is that 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.620
 that I think they deserve to raise the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.290
 voice have an opinion but always 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.470
 within the legality of what the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.870
 constitution yes yes and from there then 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.370
 they have the right to vote and the majority 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.930
 wants independence then 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.590
 go ahead but I think what is 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.050
 undeniable is that they have the right to 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.870
 opinions already have a vote inside 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.319
 from the center of legality I think that 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.540
 well it 's a match that inside 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.989
 of everything that is happening in the country 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.930
 you're having an opinion in a 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.090
 capture within the plane because 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.390
 good has no past is new people 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.299
 people with an opinion that the citizen 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.620
 he is tired of what there is but 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:04.440
 the good thing is here in 2015 there is time and 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.840
 now the polls are going far ahead 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.210
 but but we really want what it is 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.700
 what the citizen wants for her 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.370
 if you really want new people or what 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.150
 we have but I think that as everything 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.720
 citizen makes us unworthy to see how to see how 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.780
 people that we vote that you are 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.160
 carrying our our money I believe 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.740
 that is undeniable but but good 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.230
 as we always say justice is 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.470
 for that for we are giving 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.980
 realize that the match does not matter 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.560
 that is the color that is if they have to 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.180
 fulfill your sentence in the will conclude and 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.300
 that's the most important thing we can 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.280
 trust in the justice of this country 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.710
 because I could not tell you that I do not 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.990
 like something special not in fact already you 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:58.050
 I say I share my life with a Sevillian 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:02.870
 and that because because I like it in general 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.879
 everything I think that since they arrived 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.980
 phenomenal state because it is a city and 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:11.569
 a good people that way they are like that but 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.200
 good if I had to say something 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.329
 logically, well, that jiji haha ​​that 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.000
 there are in the city ​​with constantly 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.970
 it costs sometimes they can be able to put 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.460
 serious with some of them and be able 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.010
 talk about serious things because because 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.250
 final are always with that one with that jiji 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.870
 haha that 's good that we do not like but 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.440
 that there are times when that with this 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.229
 serious and to the sevilla not in fact answer 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.639
 I think it's a picture online 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:45.969
 mine of the first good program 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:49.330
 they are reality more than the end the problem 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:52.749
 It's not the reality show, it's the people who 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.180
 consumes something we consume and good every day 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:57.870
 steps are taken later towards asia the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.870
 foreign program 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:06.460
 good try to collect the one from the 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.949
 best goalkeepers in the world I do not have 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.710
 I have buffon I have boxes I have 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:15.569
 oliver kahn I have Diego what is 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.569
 a goalkeeper that I think that 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.820
 world-wide level great but I 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.100
 there are many others do not 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.350
 would love to have it at the level of the 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.430
 valley of de gea 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:31.590
 pepe reyna I have the cutters that 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.180
 I admire that I've seen since I was little and 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.020
 that I would love to face them 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.930
 to be able to change it and I believe that no 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.840
 it is logically I am a player of betis 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.760
 I want to be here for many years and I do not 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.500
 it crosses my mind to change 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.180
 change of sidewalk not here yes I am captain 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.580

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.100
 club has given me has given me everything in 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.350
 a complicated moment and I think it is 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.690
 to be grateful to be able to be here 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.190
 can help give back to this team 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.320

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.940

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:11.640
 in that category logically I do not look no 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.960
 I look at the neighborhood in front because because my 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.960
 club is here
