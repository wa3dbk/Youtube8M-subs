up<00:00:26.760> at<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:26.970> top<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.510> ice<00:00:27.689> sheet<00:00:27.930> it's

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
up at the top of the ice sheet it's

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.139 
about 13,000 to 14,000 feet it's
actually<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> very<00:00:31.650> flat<00:00:32.189> plane<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:33.030> it's

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
actually a very flat plane but it's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.940 
actually a very flat plane but it's
slightly<00:00:33.480> higher<00:00:33.870> than<00:00:33.899> all<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> area<00:00:34.860> around

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it that's the area we started looking at

it that's the area we started looking at
there's<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.960> lot<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:41.750> atmospheric<00:00:42.750> science<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
there's a lot of atmospheric science and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.470 
there's a lot of atmospheric science and

gets to a low temperature starts to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.890 
gets to a low temperature starts to
drain<00:01:19.979> away<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.119> need<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> place

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
drain away what you need is a place

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
drain away what you need is a place
where<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.500> air<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.860> actually<00:01:23.549> caught<00:01:23.909> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
where that air is actually caught and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.390 
where that air is actually caught and
held<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.170> while<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.159> cool

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
held for a while so that it can cool

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.780 
held for a while so that it can cool
down<00:01:26.460> still<00:01:27.150> more<00:01:27.560> by<00:01:28.560> radiating<00:01:29.009> away<00:01:29.280> into

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
down still more by radiating away into

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.870 
down still more by radiating away into
space<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.130> those<00:01:32.130> are<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.400> places<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
space and those are the places that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.609 
space and those are the places that
we're<00:01:33.150> finding<00:01:33.420> these<00:01:33.720> very<00:01:34.110> very<00:01:34.380> low

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
we're finding these very very low

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.370 
we're finding these very very low
temperatures<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:36.420> might<00:01:36.630> say<00:01:36.869> let's<00:01:37.140> go

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
temperatures you might say let's go

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.999 
temperatures you might say let's go
there<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:39.030> maybe<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.259> summer<00:01:40.560> that's<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
there and maybe in summer that's a

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.740 
there and maybe in summer that's a
reasonable<00:01:41.340> thing<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.700> try<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.360> that's

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
reasonable thing to try and do that's

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.100 
reasonable thing to try and do that's
it's<00:01:43.530> really<00:01:44.040> cold<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.000> things<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.899> your

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
it's really cold and so things like your

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.749 
it's really cold and so things like your
ordinary<00:01:46.439> thermometers<00:01:47.070> lead<00:01:47.579> mercury

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759

thermometer won't work an alcohol
thermometer<00:01:50.579> will<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> lot<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.119> trouble

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
thermometer will have a lot of trouble

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.600 
thermometer will have a lot of trouble
we're<00:01:52.320> talking<00:01:52.740> about<00:01:52.860> temperatures<00:01:53.310> that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
we're talking about temperatures that
