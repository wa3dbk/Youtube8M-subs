not<00:02:51.860> in<00:02:52.010> 120<00:02:52.430> but<00:02:52.550> right<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:52.790> between<00:02:52.940> in<00:02:53.300> 110

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
not in 120 but right in between in 110

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.890 
not in 120 but right in between in 110
and<00:02:53.870> then<00:02:53.960> one<00:02:54.110> fit<00:02:54.320> in<00:02:54.620> 120<00:02:55.010> um<00:02:55.820> that<00:02:56.540> way<00:02:56.750> it

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
and then one fit in 120 um that way it

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.780 
and then one fit in 120 um that way it
stays<00:02:56.930> under<00:02:57.440> 400<00:02:57.830> FPS<00:02:57.950> but<00:02:58.310> this<00:02:58.460> is<00:02:58.580> going<00:02:58.730> to

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
stays under 400 FPS but this is going to

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.910 
stays under 400 FPS but this is going to
be<00:02:58.880> from<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.180> saw<00:02:59.420> it's<00:03:00.020> right<00:03:00.230> at<00:03:00.350> about<00:03:00.500> 350

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
be from I saw it's right at about 350

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.980 
be from I saw it's right at about 350
right<00:03:01.220> now<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:01.640> I'm<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.820> dish<00:03:02.060> run<00:03:02.330> stock<00:03:02.720> on<00:03:02.960> the

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
right now so I'm a dish run stock on the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.960 
right now so I'm a dish run stock on the
springs<00:03:03.320> that<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.530> got<00:03:03.710> kids<00:03:03.950> originally<00:03:04.940> I

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
springs that I got kids originally I

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.430 
springs that I got kids originally I
thought<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.330> gun<00:03:05.480> was<00:03:05.510> going<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.780> shoot<00:03:05.930> 300

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
thought the gun was going to shoot 300

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.590 
thought the gun was going to shoot 300
