handle<00:05:48.240> it<00:05:48.360> all<00:05:48.510> in<00:05:48.750> stride<00:05:48.930> now<00:05:49.850> it's<00:05:50.850> not<00:05:51.150> the

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
handle it all in stride now it's not the

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.140 
handle it all in stride now it's not the
quickest<00:05:51.900> car<00:05:52.170> at<00:05:52.470> going<00:05:53.310> up<00:05:53.430> mountain<00:05:53.970> passes

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
quickest car at going up mountain passes

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.870 
quickest car at going up mountain passes
which<00:05:54.540> I'm<00:05:55.020> actually<00:05:55.200> doing<00:05:55.500> right<00:05:55.800> now<00:05:56.040> but

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
which I'm actually doing right now but

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.350 
which I'm actually doing right now but
it<00:05:57.300> does<00:05:57.510> have<00:05:57.720> adequate<00:05:58.680> power<00:05:58.920> and<00:05:59.610> as<00:06:00.180> long

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
it does have adequate power and as long

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.050 
it does have adequate power and as long
as<00:06:00.540> you<00:06:00.750> keep<00:06:01.050> the<00:06:01.260> revs<00:06:01.500> up<00:06:01.770> you'll<00:06:02.490> have

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
as you keep the revs up you'll have

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.260 
as you keep the revs up you'll have
enough<00:06:03.720> power<00:06:03.960> to<00:06:04.380> get<00:06:04.680> you<00:06:04.860> by<00:06:05.040> and<00:06:05.730> even<00:06:06.060> pass

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
enough power to get you by and even pass

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.200 
enough power to get you by and even pass
a<00:06:06.300> few<00:06:06.630> cars<00:06:06.870> trucks<00:06:07.680> maybe<00:06:08.010> if<00:06:08.550> you<00:06:08.760> need<00:06:08.970> to

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
a few cars trucks maybe if you need to

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.180 
a few cars trucks maybe if you need to
you're<00:06:10.050> certainly<00:06:10.350> not<00:06:10.470> going<00:06:10.590> to<00:06:10.650> be<00:06:10.740> passing

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
you're certainly not going to be passing

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.900 
you're certainly not going to be passing
any<00:06:11.310> Corvettes<00:06:11.790> but

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
any Corvettes but

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.000 
any Corvettes but
be<00:06:13.970> able<00:06:14.120> to<00:06:14.180> pass<00:06:14.390> slow-moving<00:06:15.380> trucks<00:06:15.830> and

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
be able to pass slow-moving trucks and

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.060 
be able to pass slow-moving trucks and
things<00:06:16.100> like<00:06:16.340> that<00:06:16.400> which<00:06:17.150> is<00:06:17.300> convenient

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
things like that which is convenient

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.930 
things like that which is convenient
also<00:06:19.930> overall<00:06:20.930> you<00:06:21.050> get<00:06:21.200> very<00:06:21.470> nice<00:06:21.940> fuel

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
also overall you get very nice fuel

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.260 
also overall you get very nice fuel
economy<00:06:23.300> and<00:06:23.960> that's<00:06:24.740> a<00:06:24.860> big<00:06:25.040> deal<00:06:25.250> you<00:06:25.880> know<00:06:25.910> a

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
economy and that's a big deal you know a

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.110 
economy and that's a big deal you know a
lot<00:06:27.170> of<00:06:27.290> people<00:06:27.650> for<00:06:28.040> some<00:06:28.070> reason<00:06:28.220> aren't

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
lot of people for some reason aren't

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.720 
lot of people for some reason aren't
ready<00:06:29.390> to<00:06:29.480> buy<00:06:29.720> a<00:06:29.750> hybrid<00:06:30.020> yet<00:06:30.610> Toyota<00:06:31.610> of

ready to buy a hybrid yet Toyota of
course<00:06:31.940> makes<00:06:32.180> great<00:06:32.480> hybrids<00:06:33.080> but<00:06:34.070> the<00:06:34.910> Yaris

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
course makes great hybrids but the Yaris

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.560 
course makes great hybrids but the Yaris
is<00:06:35.570> actually<00:06:36.110> a<00:06:36.350> good<00:06:37.160> alternative<00:06:37.570> because

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
is actually a good alternative because

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.000 
is actually a good alternative because
you<00:06:39.440> know<00:06:39.560> it's<00:06:39.920> a<00:06:40.070> gets<00:06:40.910> credit<00:06:41.300> gas<00:06:41.480> mileage

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
you know it's a gets credit gas mileage

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.060 
you know it's a gets credit gas mileage
actually<00:06:43.010> costs<00:06:43.550> a<00:06:44.000> bit<00:06:44.480> less<00:06:44.780> than<00:06:45.320> even

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
actually costs a bit less than even

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.610 
actually costs a bit less than even
entry-level<00:06:46.610> hybrids<00:06:47.270> I<00:06:47.540> recently<00:06:48.290> tested

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
entry-level hybrids I recently tested

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.800 
entry-level hybrids I recently tested
the<00:06:48.710> Prius<00:06:49.070> C<00:06:49.100> which<00:06:49.460> is<00:06:49.610> really<00:06:50.450> really<00:06:50.600> an

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
the Prius C which is really really an

the Prius C which is really really an
excellent<00:06:51.080> car<00:06:51.410> look<00:06:51.680> for<00:06:51.800> my<00:06:51.890> review<00:06:52.250> of<00:06:52.340> that

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
excellent car look for my review of that

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.870 
excellent car look for my review of that
one<00:06:52.670> but<00:06:53.180> this<00:06:53.360> one<00:06:53.660> starts<00:06:54.050> out<00:06:54.490> roughly<00:06:55.490> 3

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
one but this one starts out roughly 3

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.970 
one but this one starts out roughly 3
grand<00:06:56.180> less<00:06:57.050> so<00:06:57.620> it's<00:06:58.310> also<00:06:58.520> a<00:06:58.730> deal<00:06:59.090> and<00:06:59.980> along

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
grand less so it's also a deal and along

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.420 
grand less so it's also a deal and along
my<00:07:01.010> road<00:07:01.430> trip<00:07:01.700> through<00:07:02.410> Colorado<00:07:03.410> here<00:07:03.800> it's

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
my road trip through Colorado here it's

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.840 
my road trip through Colorado here it's
been<00:07:04.670> a<00:07:04.700> nice<00:07:04.910> travel<00:07:05.390> companion<00:07:06.520> so<00:07:07.520> my<00:07:07.670> last

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.850 
been a nice travel companion so my last

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.640 
been a nice travel companion so my last
experience<00:07:08.330> with<00:07:08.570> the<00:07:08.690> Yaris<00:07:09.080> was<00:07:09.320> with<00:07:09.530> the

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
experience with the Yaris was with the

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.880 
experience with the Yaris was with the
SE<00:07:10.070> another<00:07:10.940> sport<00:07:11.270> very<00:07:11.560> larger<00:07:12.560> alloy

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:12.890 
SE another sport very larger alloy

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.070

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.490 
wheels

different turning radius steering ratio

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.770 
different turning radius steering ratio
so<00:07:17.500> then<00:07:17.770> you<00:07:17.979> get<00:07:18.129> better<00:07:18.430> handling<00:07:19.030> and<00:07:19.689> you

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
so then you get better handling and you

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.839 
so then you get better handling and you
also<00:07:19.960> get<00:07:20.379> 40<00:07:21.039> miles<00:07:21.250> per<00:07:21.400> gallon<00:07:21.639> on<00:07:21.729> the

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:21.849 
also get 40 miles per gallon on the

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:24.360 
also get 40 miles per gallon on the
highway<00:07:21.879> because<00:07:22.569> that<00:07:22.780> is<00:07:23.409> the<00:07:23.949> manual

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
highway because that is the manual

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.740 
highway because that is the manual
transmission<00:07:24.969> 5-speed<00:07:25.539> in<00:07:25.659> fact<00:07:25.900> this

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:26.750 
transmission 5-speed in fact this

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 
get as good fuel economy what you do get

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.750 
get as good fuel economy what you do get
a<00:07:32.240> tighter<00:07:33.170> turning<00:07:33.470> radius<00:07:33.620> and<00:07:34.220> you<00:07:34.580> also

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:34.760 
a tighter turning radius and you also

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.780 
a tighter turning radius and you also
get<00:07:35.150> the<00:07:35.300> same<00:07:35.480> great<00:07:36.100> efficiency<00:07:37.100> and

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:37.790 
get the same great efficiency and

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.060 
get the same great efficiency and
economy<00:07:38.450> and<00:07:38.990> safety<00:07:39.560> so<00:07:40.310> overall<00:07:40.670> we<00:07:41.480> are
