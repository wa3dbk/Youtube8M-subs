00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
folder but it is still there and you can

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
folder but it is still there and you can
still<00:00:53.520> use<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:54.960> we

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
still use it just like that so if we

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.510 
still use it just like that so if we
open<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.440> clock<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
open up clock you can see that the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.430 
open up clock you can see that the
application<00:00:56.910> still<00:00:57.300> works<00:00:57.600> within<00:00:58.170> that

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
application still works within that

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.310 
application still works within that
nested<00:00:58.859> folder<00:00:59.480> so<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:00.719> we're<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> do

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
nested folder so now we're going to do

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.660 
nested folder so now we're going to do
it<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.649> more<00:01:01.710> time<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.309> show<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.550> guys

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
so I'm going to hold double tap swipe

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.320 
so I'm going to hold double tap swipe
over<00:01:07.140> go<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.830> springboard<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:09.090> still

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
over go to the springboard it's still

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.700 
over go to the springboard it's still
highlighted<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.290> we're<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> go<00:01:10.680> into

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
highlighted so we're going to go into

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.109 
highlighted so we're going to go into
this<00:01:10.950> folder<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.490> now<00:01:11.790> we're<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> go

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
this folder and now we're going to go

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.940 
this folder and now we're going to go
into<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.479> folder<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.080> we're<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.710> drop

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
into this folder and we're going to drop

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.120 
into this folder and we're going to drop
it<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.540> can<00:01:15.720> see<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.229> the

it in there so you can see that the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.090 
it in there so you can see that the
folders<00:01:17.549> are<00:01:18.439> nested<00:01:19.439> within<00:01:19.530> each<00:01:19.830> other

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
folders are nested within each other

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.060 
folders are nested within each other
just<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.420> now<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.740> folders

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
just like that now to get the folders

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.280 
just like that now to get the folders
out<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.670> another<00:01:24.240> folder<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:24.869> actually

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
out of another folder it's actually

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.990 
out of another folder it's actually
