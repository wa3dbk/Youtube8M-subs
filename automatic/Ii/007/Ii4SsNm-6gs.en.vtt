truth I do not know what keyed is up to
I<00:03:34.020> would<00:03:34.440> expect<00:03:34.830> Matt<00:03:35.100> pressure<00:03:35.460> by<00:03:35.670> now<00:03:35.850> that

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
I would expect Matt pressure by now that

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.270 
I would expect Matt pressure by now that
looks<00:03:36.180> like<00:03:36.360> they've<00:03:36.540> dropped<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.990> shade<00:03:37.320> very

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
looks like they've dropped a shade very

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.180 
looks like they've dropped a shade very
quickly<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:39.410> they're<00:03:40.410> going<00:03:40.620> for<00:03:40.890> stealth

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
quickly and they're going for stealth

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.250 
quickly and they're going for stealth
but<00:03:41.490> I<00:03:41.670> have<00:03:42.090> no<00:03:42.390> idea<00:03:42.840> what<00:03:42.990> they<00:03:43.110> could

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
but I have no idea what they could

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.800 
but I have no idea what they could
possibly<00:03:43.290> be<00:03:43.830> doing<00:03:43.980> or<00:03:44.250> or<00:03:44.880> going<00:03:45.510> for<00:03:45.690> quick

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
possibly be doing or or going for quick

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.240 
possibly be doing or or going for quick
evolve<00:03:46.110> looks<00:03:46.320> like<00:03:46.500> they're<00:03:46.710> trying<00:03:46.860> for

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
evolve looks like they're trying for

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.240 
evolve looks like they're trying for
some<00:03:47.490> sort<00:03:47.820> of<00:03:47.880> stealth<00:03:48.440> strategy<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.740> I<00:03:50.010> have

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
some sort of stealth strategy and I have

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.680 
some sort of stealth strategy and I have
never<00:03:50.460> seen<00:03:50.700> this<00:03:50.820> before<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.240> I<00:03:51.270> can't<00:03:51.570> give

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
never seen this before so I can't give

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.090 
never seen this before so I can't give
you<00:03:51.810> an<00:03:51.930> insight<00:03:52.230> into<00:03:52.260> what<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:52.860> could

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
you an insight into what this could

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.670 
you an insight into what this could
possibly<00:03:53.400> be<00:03:53.820> but<00:03:54.750> looks<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.350> all<00:03:55.590> these

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
possibly be but looks like all these

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.850 
possibly be but looks like all these
skulls<00:03:56.010> do<00:03:56.280> now<00:03:56.460> now<00:03:56.850> have<00:03:57.180> cloaking<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.170> I

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
skulls do now now have cloaking and I

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.920 
skulls do now now have cloaking and I
cloaking<00:03:59.370> remember<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.090> does<00:04:00.330> allow<00:04:00.600> you<00:04:00.660> to

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
cloaking remember it does allow you to

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.020 
cloaking remember it does allow you to
go<00:04:01.170> invisible<00:04:01.590> when<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.130> are<00:04:02.280> standing<00:04:02.489> still

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
go invisible when you are standing still

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.780 
go invisible when you are standing still
so<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:04.410> have<00:04:04.800> no<00:04:05.010> idea<00:04:05.250> what<00:04:05.340> these<00:04:05.489> skulls

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
so I have no idea what these skulls

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
think it came down to the marine team

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.190 
think it came down to the marine team
not<00:05:44.010> having<00:05:44.280> any<00:05:44.460> detection<00:05:45.000> I<00:05:45.479> mean<00:05:46.020> it<00:05:46.110> would

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
not having any detection I mean it would

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.120 
not having any detection I mean it would
have<00:05:46.289> been<00:05:46.350> very<00:05:46.500> difficult<00:05:46.710> for<00:05:46.950> them<00:05:47.070> to

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
have been very difficult for them to

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.800 
have been very difficult for them to
scout<00:05:47.610> that<00:05:47.930> shade<00:05:48.930> so<00:05:49.620> early<00:05:50.039> on<00:05:50.600> but<00:05:51.600> they

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
scout that shade so early on but they

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.150 
scout that shade so early on but they
had<00:05:51.960> no<00:05:52.110> detection<00:05:52.440> so<00:05:52.620> they<00:05:52.710> couldn't<00:05:52.950> see

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
had no detection so they couldn't see

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.089 
had no detection so they couldn't see
