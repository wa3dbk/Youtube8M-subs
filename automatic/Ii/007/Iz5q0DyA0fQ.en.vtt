00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
layer I'm going to make it a blank layer

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.660 
layer I'm going to make it a blank layer
so<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:45.960> go<00:00:45.989> there<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.469> go<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.309> simple

so here we go there you go it's a simple

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.139 
so here we go there you go it's a simple
brain<00:00:47.879> where<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.329> come<00:00:49.260> over<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.149> select

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
brain where I come over here and select

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.500 
brain where I come over here and select
my<00:00:51.510> spot<00:00:51.840> healing<00:00:52.079> brush<00:00:53.000> I'm<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.390> come

box here is ticked sample all layers

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.349 
box here is ticked sample all layers
this<00:00:58.859> way<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> work<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.670> do<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.300> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
this way all the work I do is going to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.090 
this way all the work I do is going to
come<00:01:00.480> under<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.809> lay<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.530> not

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
come under this lay here and not

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.450 
come under this lay here and not
directly<00:01:02.550> onto<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> original<00:01:03.239> picture<00:01:04.460> so

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
directly onto the original picture so

let's draw around this that's gone son

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.929 
let's draw around this that's gone son
of<00:01:36.840> safeer<00:01:37.439> freaking<00:01:38.070> few<00:01:38.520> little<00:01:38.759> dots

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
of safeer freaking few little dots

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.410 
of safeer freaking few little dots
around<00:01:39.150> there<00:01:43.159> well<00:01:44.159> computers<00:01:44.520> doing

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
around there well computers doing

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.899 
around there well computers doing
something<00:01:46.520> doesn't<00:01:47.520> help<00:01:47.700> when<00:01:47.729> you're

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
something doesn't help when you're

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.550 
something doesn't help when you're
recording<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.720> using<00:01:48.990> Photoshop<00:01:49.380> at<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
recording and using Photoshop at the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.149 
recording and using Photoshop at the
same<00:01:49.740> time<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.360> see<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.890> there<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:52.979> go

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
same time you can see you there you go

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.460 
same time you can see you there you go
it<00:01:53.790> doesn't<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.450> does<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.810> my

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
it doesn't like that does it my

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.039 
it doesn't like that does it my
efficiency<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.399> dropping<00:01:57.049> that's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
efficiency there is dropping that's

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.490 
efficiency there is dropping that's
eighty<00:01:58.320> eight<00:01:58.560> percent<00:01:59.570> so<00:02:00.570> let's<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.290> carry

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
eighty eight percent so let's just carry

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.950 
eighty eight percent so let's just carry
on<00:02:02.810> that's<00:02:03.810> been<00:02:03.990> laggy

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:17.270 

there<00:02:07.960> you<00:02:08.140> go<00:02:09.929> very<00:02:10.929> laggy<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.550> move<00:02:15.760> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
there you go very laggy and move the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:26.640 
there you go very laggy and move the
image<00:02:18.280> around<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:22.480> who's<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:22.810> there<00:02:25.470> now<00:02:26.470> this

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
image around so who's in there now this

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.559 
image around so who's in there now this
a<00:02:26.709> little<00:02:27.130> red<00:02:27.700> dots<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.180> hope<00:02:28.269> that's<00:02:28.450> all

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
a little red dots that I hope that's all

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.240 
a little red dots that I hope that's all
sense<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.900> us<00:02:29.110> because<00:02:29.410> my<00:02:29.590> camera<00:02:29.860> suppose

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
sense of us because my camera suppose

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:38.610 
sense of us because my camera suppose
I've<00:02:31.260> self-cleaning<00:02:36.840> now<00:02:37.840> notice<00:02:38.319> how<00:02:38.470> I'm

I've self-cleaning now notice how I'm
tall<00:02:38.980> dabbing<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.489> around<00:02:39.790> what<00:02:40.299> I<00:02:40.330> don't

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
tall dabbing this around what I don't

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.600 
tall dabbing this around what I don't
want<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.959> do<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.709> spray<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.040> brushes<00:02:42.370> bigger

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
want to do so I spray the brushes bigger

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.819 
want to do so I spray the brushes bigger
do<00:02:43.390> something<00:02:43.599> like<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:43.870> just<00:02:43.900> one<00:02:44.349> circle

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
do something like that just one circle

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.449 
do something like that just one circle
now<00:02:45.310> that's<00:02:45.549> actually<00:02:45.849> worked<00:02:46.090> there<00:02:47.459> too

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
now that's actually worked there too

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.729 
now that's actually worked there too
again<00:02:48.760> here<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.750> social<00:02:50.079> work<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.470> I'm<00:02:50.709> not

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
again here and social work this I'm not

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.280 
again here and social work this I'm not
she<00:02:51.239> showing<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.390> what<00:02:52.569> i<00:02:52.599> wanted<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.049> show

she showing you what i wanted to show
you<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:54.489> let's<00:02:55.590> find<00:02:56.590> another<00:02:57.390> one<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.660> bigger

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
you so let's find another one a bigger

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.880 
you so let's find another one a bigger
here<00:03:00.970> we<00:03:01.090> go<00:03:01.239> let's<00:03:01.450> do<00:03:01.599> it<00:03:01.690> here<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:04.890> this

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
here we go let's do it here just this

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.050 
here we go let's do it here just this
was<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.310> way<00:03:06.430> when<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:06.610> want<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.849> show<00:03:07.000> you

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
was the way when I want to show you

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.420 
was the way when I want to show you
something<00:03:07.769> okay<00:03:08.769> let<00:03:08.860> me<00:03:08.920> just<00:03:08.950> turn<00:03:09.220> off<00:03:09.280> the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
something okay let me just turn off the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.220 
something okay let me just turn off the
bottom<00:03:10.120> layer<00:03:10.239> so<00:03:10.660> you'll<00:03:10.840> see<00:03:11.019> what<00:03:11.139> i'm

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
bottom layer so you'll see what i'm

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.990 
bottom layer so you'll see what i'm
doing<00:03:11.260> i<00:03:11.560> see<00:03:11.709> this<00:03:11.829> circle<00:03:12.250> that's<00:03:12.670> actually

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
doing i see this circle that's actually

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.039 
doing i see this circle that's actually
bad<00:03:13.180> practice<00:03:13.630> what<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.680> want<00:03:14.829> to<00:03:14.889> try<00:03:15.069> and<00:03:15.220> do

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
bad practice what you want to try and do

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.830 
bad practice what you want to try and do
let<00:03:17.049> me<00:03:17.170> just<00:03:17.319> find<00:03:17.470> this<00:03:17.680> do<00:03:18.190> here<00:03:18.690> let's<00:03:19.690> do

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
let me just find this do here let's do

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.370 
let me just find this do here let's do
it<00:03:19.930> one<00:03:20.079> here<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:22.450> cool<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:22.810> then<00:03:22.959> try<00:03:23.139> move

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
it one here so cool and then try move

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.280 
it one here so cool and then try move
you<00:03:24.389> yourself<00:03:25.389> around<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:28.079> helps<00:03:29.079> it<00:03:29.170> blend

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
you yourself around that helps it blend

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.250 
you yourself around that helps it blend
a<00:03:29.590> lot<00:03:29.889> better<00:03:30.569> so<00:03:31.569> I<00:03:31.600> know<00:03:31.720> obviously<00:03:31.900> what

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
a lot better so I know obviously what

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.960 
a lot better so I know obviously what
I've<00:03:32.319> done<00:03:32.470> there<00:03:33.030> yeah<00:03:35.790> there's<00:03:36.790> another

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
I've done there yeah there's another

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.879 
I've done there yeah there's another
black<00:03:37.269> there<00:03:37.720> let's<00:03:38.410> take<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.739> mouse

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
black there let's take the mouse

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.680 
black there let's take the mouse
down<00:03:39.100> touch<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:40.109> brush<00:03:41.109> size<00:03:41.139> I'm<00:03:41.950> sort<00:03:42.280> of

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
down touch the brush size I'm sort of

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.890 
down touch the brush size I'm sort of
blend<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.780> in<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:44.049> nice<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:44.709> smooth<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:46.720> can

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
blend that in a nice and smooth you can

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.140 
blend that in a nice and smooth you can
drag<00:03:47.079> it<00:03:47.139> along<00:03:47.350> as<00:03:47.620> also<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:48.400> these<00:03:48.760> bits<00:03:49.030> of

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
drag it along as also that these bits of

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.039 
drag it along as also that these bits of
difficult<00:03:49.540> it's<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.760> she<00:03:51.849> sampling<00:03:52.840> two

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
difficult it's so she sampling two

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.940 
difficult it's so she sampling two
different<00:03:53.380> shade<00:03:54.220> so<00:03:55.200> let's<00:03:56.200> just<00:03:56.530> try<00:03:56.769> and

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
different shade so let's just try and

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
different shade so let's just try and
blend<00:03:57.099> that<00:04:00.660> there<00:04:01.660> when<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:01.870> w<00:04:02.139> is<00:04:02.200> lagging

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.940 

efficiency<00:04:06.540> efficiencies<00:04:07.380> gone<00:04:07.590> down<00:04:07.800> to

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
efficiency efficiencies gone down to

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.190 
efficiency efficiencies gone down to
sixty<00:04:08.340> nine<00:04:08.490> percent<00:04:08.940> it's<00:04:09.630> probably<00:04:09.780> cuz<00:04:10.080> i'm

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
sixty nine percent it's probably cuz i'm

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.360 
sixty nine percent it's probably cuz i'm
recording<00:04:12.560> just<00:04:13.560> trying<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:13.860> blend<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:14.190> and

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
recording just trying to blend this and

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.229 
recording just trying to blend this and
not<00:04:14.490> bear<00:04:14.730> up<00:04:14.910> here<00:04:16.670> there<00:04:17.670> I<00:04:17.850> could<00:04:18.120> have

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
not bear up here there I could have

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.560 
not bear up here there I could have
zoomed<00:04:18.420> in<00:04:18.600> actually<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:18.930> bit<00:04:19.079> more<00:04:19.260> times<00:04:19.620> and

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
zoomed in actually a bit more times and

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.880 
zoomed in actually a bit more times and
you<00:04:21.570> get<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.840> idea<00:04:21.870> now<00:04:22.290> what<00:04:22.500> I'm<00:04:22.620> doing<00:04:22.860> now

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
you get the idea now what I'm doing now

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.990 
you get the idea now what I'm doing now
is<00:04:23.010> just<00:04:23.190> going<00:04:23.580> around<00:04:23.730> the<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:26.250> water<00:04:26.490> here

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
is just going around the the water here

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.560 
is just going around the the water here
and<00:04:27.530> finding<00:04:28.530> all<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.770> bits<00:04:28.950> of<00:04:29.040> dead<00:04:29.190> bury

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
and finding all the bits of dead bury

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.060 
and finding all the bits of dead bury
their<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:32.460> I'm<00:04:32.580> just<00:04:33.710> getting<00:04:34.710> rid<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:34.890> them

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
their and I'm just getting rid of them

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.950 
their and I'm just getting rid of them
and<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.940> just<00:04:39.060> do<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:39.240> for<00:04:39.390> out<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.810> whole

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
and you just do that for out the whole

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.880 
and you just do that for out the whole
image<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:41.780> now<00:04:42.780> there's<00:04:42.990> lights<00:04:43.290> or<00:04:43.620> a

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
image and now there's lights or a

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.260 
image and now there's lights or a
feather<00:04:44.250> but<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:44.490> don't<00:04:44.700> like<00:04:44.820> it<00:04:45.060> so<00:04:45.210> I'm

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
part of that I think such a ripple bar

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.170 
part of that I think such a ripple bar
didn't<00:05:08.280> like<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:08.870> now<00:05:10.640> there<00:05:11.640> again<00:05:11.940> that<00:05:12.150> I
