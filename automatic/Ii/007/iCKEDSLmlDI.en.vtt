00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
well what I mean by that is there still

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.550 
well what I mean by that is there still
going<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.179> be<00:02:00.240> areas<00:02:00.569> you<00:02:00.929> know<00:02:01.049> touching<00:02:01.259> upon

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
going to be areas you know touching upon

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.080 
going to be areas you know touching upon
fragrances<00:02:02.219> I'm<00:02:02.429> going<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.609> actually<00:02:02.700> keep

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
fragrances I'm going to actually keep

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.690 
fragrances I'm going to actually keep
separate<00:02:03.539> from<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.740> know<00:02:04.829> normal<00:02:05.189> things<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
separate from you know normal things and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.489 
separate from you know normal things and
I'm<00:02:05.759> actually<00:02:05.939> going<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.299> kind<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.539> expand<00:02:07.319> off

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:07.499 
I'm actually going to kind of expand off

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:10.100 
I'm actually going to kind of expand off
so<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:09.060> straightest<00:02:09.390> part<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.690> actually<00:02:09.810> just

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
so the straightest part is actually just

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.930 
so the straightest part is actually just
one<00:02:10.410> thing<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.190> reason<00:02:11.340> being<00:02:11.670> is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
one thing and the reason being is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.670 
one thing and the reason being is
because<00:02:11.970> i'm<00:02:12.240> actually<00:02:12.420> creating<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.290> separate

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
because i'm actually creating a separate

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.980 
because i'm actually creating a separate
channel<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.790> separate<00:02:15.090> channel<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.600> soft

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
channel and the separate channel a soft

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.900 
channel and the separate channel a soft
with<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.500> test<00:02:16.860> nothing<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:17.790> with

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
with this is test nothing to do with

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.710 
with this is test nothing to do with
fragrances<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.629> everything<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.110> do<00:02:19.230> with

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
fragrances and everything to do with

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.900 
fragrances and everything to do with
games<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:23.280> what<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.490> called<00:02:24.700> again

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
games so I what is that called again

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
games so I what is that called again
video<00:02:25.870> casting<00:02:27.330> twitching<00:02:28.330> whatever<00:02:28.870> that

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
video casting twitching whatever that

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.980 
video casting twitching whatever that
which<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.880> believe<00:02:30.880> basically<00:02:31.420> it's<00:02:31.600> showing

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
which I believe basically it's showing

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.760 
which I believe basically it's showing
you<00:02:32.710> as<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.310> play<00:02:33.730> these<00:02:34.720> games<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.320> you<00:02:35.590> kind

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
you as you play these games and you kind

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.080 
you as you play these games and you kind
of<00:02:35.830> go<00:02:35.950> through<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.550> think<00:02:36.910> I'm<00:02:37.000> gonna

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
of go through it and I think I'm gonna

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.580 
of go through it and I think I'm gonna
actually<00:02:37.300> go<00:02:37.570> to<00:02:37.660> go<00:02:37.840> ahead<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.140> do<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.230> just

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
actually go to go ahead and do that just

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.770 
actually go to go ahead and do that just
because<00:02:38.860> I'm<00:02:39.820> just<00:02:40.000> curious<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.480> see<00:02:40.630> how

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
because I'm just curious to see how

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.900 
because I'm just curious to see how
it'll<00:02:41.020> actually<00:02:41.260> go<00:02:41.710> and<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.520> reason<00:02:42.760> why<00:02:42.850> I

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
it'll actually go and the reason why I

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.250 
it'll actually go and the reason why I
want<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.120> keep<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.330> chat<00:02:43.510> separate<00:02:44.050> is
