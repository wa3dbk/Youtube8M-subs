00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
develop a nature arm movement

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.460 
develop a nature arm movement
my<00:00:20.840> main<00:00:21.109> point<00:00:21.380> today<00:00:21.589> is<00:00:22.449> the<00:00:23.449> movement<00:00:23.689> does

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
my main point today is the movement does

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.499 
my main point today is the movement does
not<00:00:24.679> stop<00:00:25.009> with<00:00:25.339> the<00:00:25.460> end<00:00:25.579> of<00:00:25.699> your<00:00:25.880> arm<00:00:26.240> it

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
not stop with the end of your arm it

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.210 
not stop with the end of your arm it
continues<00:00:27.019> into<00:00:27.199> the<00:00:27.289> wrist<00:00:27.589> and<00:00:27.829> into<00:00:28.130> the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
continues into the wrist and into the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.359 
continues into the wrist and into the
fingers<00:00:28.579> and<00:00:29.380> although<00:00:30.380> nobody<00:00:30.650> will

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
fingers and although nobody will

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.190 
fingers and although nobody will
probably<00:00:31.849> consciously<00:00:32.360> notice<00:00:32.810> what<00:00:33.020> you're

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
probably consciously notice what you're

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.600 
probably consciously notice what you're
doing<00:00:33.470> with<00:00:33.710> your<00:00:33.739> wrists<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:34.130> your<00:00:34.190> fingers

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550

should imagine that your wrists and your
fingers<00:01:58.250> are<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.610> continuation<00:01:59.150> of<00:01:59.390> your<00:01:59.450> arm

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
actually it is like that and they are

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.109 
actually it is like that and they are
they<00:02:04.490> are<00:02:04.549> not<00:02:05.110> like<00:02:06.310> completely<00:02:07.310> fixed<00:02:08.030> to

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
they are not like completely fixed to

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.180 
they are not like completely fixed to
your<00:02:08.179> arm<00:02:08.509> so<00:02:08.780> they<00:02:08.869> are<00:02:08.959> not<00:02:09.049> not<00:02:09.769> moving<00:02:10.429> like

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
your arm so they are not not moving like

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
kind of like following the movement with

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.890 
kind of like following the movement with
a<00:02:25.599> little<00:02:25.900> bit<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.489> delay<00:02:27.690> okay

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
a little bit of delay okay

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.380 
a little bit of delay okay
you<00:02:29.230> can<00:02:29.349> also<00:02:29.470> imagine<00:02:29.709> like<00:02:30.120> you're<00:02:31.120> you're

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
doing this in water so like the hands

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.600 
doing this in water so like the hands
are<00:02:34.989> following<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.470> little<00:02:35.650> bit<00:02:35.739> later<00:02:35.950> alright

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
are following a little bit later alright

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.569 
are following a little bit later alright
if<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.780> make<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.019> sudden<00:02:38.319> move<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:39.069> may<00:02:39.280> even

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
if you make a sudden move this may even

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.360 
if you make a sudden move this may even
end<00:02:39.730> up<00:02:39.970> in<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.360> whip<00:02:40.569> effect<00:02:40.799> okay<00:02:41.799> so<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.129> can

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
end up in a whip effect okay so you can

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.610 
end up in a whip effect okay so you can
bring<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.610> hand<00:02:42.879> in<00:02:43.030> put<00:02:43.299> it<00:02:43.390> out<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.930> at<00:02:44.500> the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
bring the hand in put it out and at the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.970 
bring the hand in put it out and at the
end<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:46.030> hand<00:02:46.299> is<00:02:46.629> finishing<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.530> move<00:02:47.739> much

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
end the hand is finishing the move much

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.240 
end the hand is finishing the move much
much<00:02:48.849> sharper<00:02:49.180> then<00:02:49.840> then<00:02:50.260> then<00:02:50.620> your<00:02:50.739> arm<00:02:51.040> is

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
much sharper then then then your arm is

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.920 
much sharper then then then your arm is
doing<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:51.670> this<00:02:51.940> gives<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.569> a<00:02:52.660> little<00:02:52.840> bit

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
doing it so this gives it a little bit

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.460 
doing it so this gives it a little bit
like<00:02:53.109> sharper<00:02:53.530> look<00:02:55.140> well<00:02:56.140> let's<00:02:56.290> try<00:02:56.379> to

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
like sharper look well let's try to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.750 
like sharper look well let's try to
let's<00:02:57.010> try<00:02:57.099> to<00:02:57.160> bring<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.430> all<00:02:57.579> together

is<00:03:34.480> kind<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.780> like<00:03:34.989> my<00:03:35.349> mental<00:03:35.769> image<00:03:35.829> of<00:03:36.040> the

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
is kind of like my mental image of the

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.330 
is kind of like my mental image of the
move<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.579> want<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:36.910> be<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:38.040> wanna<00:03:39.040> be<00:03:39.190> the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340

dominant character in this in this pose

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.900 
dominant character in this in this pose
okay<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:42.760> it's<00:03:42.940> like<00:03:43.150> wait<00:03:44.069> this<00:03:45.069> is<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.430> the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
okay so it's like wait this is the the

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.670 
okay so it's like wait this is the the
idea<00:03:46.239> I<00:03:46.299> have<00:03:46.660> in<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.019> means<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.349> may<00:03:47.530> have

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
idea I have in this means you may have

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.930 
idea I have in this means you may have
you<00:03:47.829> may<00:03:47.889> have<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.220> different<00:03:48.549> idea<00:03:48.730> it's

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
you may have a different idea it's

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.000 
you may have a different idea it's
alright<00:03:49.209> but<00:03:49.510> try<00:03:50.079> to<00:03:50.139> stick<00:03:50.440> on<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.650> something

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
alright but try to stick on to something

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.909 
alright but try to stick on to something
which<00:03:51.699> is<00:03:51.730> natural<00:03:52.180> for<00:03:52.329> you<00:03:52.419> to<00:03:52.540> do<00:03:52.660> five<00:03:53.500> six

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
which is natural for you to do five six

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.920 
which is natural for you to do five six
seven<00:03:54.430> out<00:03:56.040> okay<00:03:57.299> second<00:03:58.299> thing<00:03:58.449> what<00:03:58.840> I'm

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
seven out okay second thing what I'm

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.430 
seven out okay second thing what I'm
doing<00:03:59.260> is<00:03:59.470> I<00:03:59.849> bring<00:04:00.849> my<00:04:01.060> arm<00:04:01.359> in<00:04:01.599> before<00:04:02.199> I<00:04:02.230> take

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
doing is I bring my arm in before I take

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.110 
doing is I bring my arm in before I take
it<00:04:02.590> out<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:03.250> give<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.430> little<00:04:03.579> bit<00:04:03.730> more<00:04:03.940> dynamic

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
it out to give a little bit more dynamic

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.050 
it out to give a little bit more dynamic
so<00:04:04.989> while<00:04:05.620> I'm<00:04:05.829> doing<00:04:06.160> that<00:04:06.190> I'm<00:04:06.579> going<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:06.849> use

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
so while I'm doing that I'm going to use

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.780 
so while I'm doing that I'm going to use
this<00:04:07.299> delayed<00:04:07.660> movement<00:04:08.139> of<00:04:08.379> the<00:04:08.829> wrists<00:04:09.220> so

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
this delayed movement of the wrists so

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.629 
this delayed movement of the wrists so
when<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.030> take<00:04:10.329> it<00:04:10.540> in<00:04:10.750> my<00:04:11.650> palm<00:04:11.949> almost<00:04:12.340> points

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
when I take it in my palm almost points

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.869 
when I take it in my palm almost points
out<00:04:12.879> and<00:04:13.239> then<00:04:14.019> I<00:04:14.079> take<00:04:14.349> it<00:04:14.500> out<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:15.220> at<00:04:15.730> the

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
out and then I take it out and at the

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.849 
out and then I take it out and at the
end<00:04:16.090> there<00:04:16.900> is<00:04:16.930> this<00:04:17.669> would<00:04:18.669> affect<00:04:19.449> so<00:04:20.349> the

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
end there is this would affect so the

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.010 
end there is this would affect so the
move<00:04:21.160> is<00:04:21.280> actually<00:04:21.639> quite<00:04:21.910> sharp<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:22.419> I<00:04:22.750> time

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
move is actually quite sharp and I time

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.170 
move is actually quite sharp and I time
it<00:04:23.199> at<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.740> same<00:04:23.919> time<00:04:24.240> my<00:04:25.240> tap

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
it at the same time my tap

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.770 
it at the same time my tap
on<00:04:26.330> one<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.139> watch<00:04:27.320> 1<00:04:28.070> 2<00:04:28.280> 3<00:04:28.729> 5<00:04:29.360> 6<00:04:29.840> 7<00:04:31.750> you<00:04:32.750> may

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
on one so watch 1 2 3 5 6 7 you may

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.140 
on one so watch 1 2 3 5 6 7 you may
think<00:04:33.110> of<00:04:33.229> it<00:04:33.320> like<00:04:33.560> you<00:04:34.550> have<00:04:34.669> a<00:04:34.729> very<00:04:34.970> very

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
think of it like you have a very very

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.260 
think of it like you have a very very
fancy<00:04:35.509> signature<00:04:36.229> and<00:04:36.610> you're<00:04:37.610> signing<00:04:37.940> it

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
fancy signature and you're signing it

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.140 
fancy signature and you're signing it
like<00:04:38.479> pump<00:04:38.810> and<00:04:39.020> I'm<00:04:39.110> Pan<00:04:39.350> Am

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
like pump and I'm Pan Am

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.159 
like pump and I'm Pan Am
this<00:04:41.150> is<00:04:41.270> your<00:04:41.449> end<00:04:41.600> it's<00:04:41.780> almost<00:04:41.900> like<00:04:42.139> a

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
this is your end it's almost like a

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.960 
this is your end it's almost like a
colleague<00:04:42.949> graphical<00:04:43.509> movement<00:04:45.970> you

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
colleague graphical movement you

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.249 
colleague graphical movement you
remember<00:04:47.240> we<00:04:47.419> were<00:04:47.570> talking<00:04:47.630> about<00:04:48.050> the

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
remember we were talking about the

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.939 
remember we were talking about the
susie-q<00:04:48.740> before<00:04:49.160> I<00:04:50.229> have<00:04:51.229> another<00:04:51.440> mental

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
susie-q before I have another mental

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.010 
susie-q before I have another mental

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.420 
image in the susie-q you remember our
hand<00:04:54.229> movement<00:04:54.530> was<00:04:54.710> 1<00:04:55.190> 2<00:04:55.610> 3<00:04:55.910> 5<00:04:56.570> 6<00:04:57.110> 7<00:04:57.710> 1<00:04:58.130> 2<00:04:58.400> 3<00:04:58.669> 5

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
hand movement was 1 2 3 5 6 7 1 2 3 5

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.010 
hand movement was 1 2 3 5 6 7 1 2 3 5
since<00:05:01.430> I'm<00:05:01.520> living<00:05:01.669> in<00:05:01.849> Germany<00:05:02.300> I<00:05:02.479> always

since I'm living in Germany I always

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.040 
since I'm living in Germany I always

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
imagine I have this big glass of beer

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.279 
imagine I have this big glass of beer
what<00:05:06.620> I'm<00:05:07.099> never<00:05:07.340> drinking<00:05:07.580> anyway<00:05:07.910> but<00:05:08.570> I

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
what I'm never drinking anyway but I

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.439 
what I'm never drinking anyway but I
just<00:05:09.710> put<00:05:09.919> it<00:05:10.009> I<00:05:10.220> just<00:05:10.460> put<00:05:10.759> it<00:05:10.880> on<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.090> counter

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
just put it I just put it on the counter

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.960 
just put it I just put it on the counter
so<00:05:11.660> I<00:05:11.690> take<00:05:11.930> one<00:05:11.960> and<00:05:12.680> I<00:05:13.340> just<00:05:13.550> put<00:05:13.729> it<00:05:13.759> in<00:05:13.880> the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
so I take one and I just put it in the

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.650 
so I take one and I just put it in the
counter<00:05:16.360> so<00:05:17.360> if<00:05:17.570> you<00:05:17.690> actually<00:05:17.930> do<00:05:18.380> imagine<00:05:18.889> a

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
counter so if you actually do imagine a

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.960 
counter so if you actually do imagine a
beer<00:05:20.660> in<00:05:20.960> your<00:05:20.990> hand<00:05:21.169> you<00:05:21.949> wouldn't<00:05:22.280> do<00:05:22.699> this

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
beer in your hand you wouldn't do this

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.240 
beer in your hand you wouldn't do this
movement<00:05:23.240> kind<00:05:23.660> of<00:05:23.810> like<00:05:24.009> floppy<00:05:25.009> or

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
movement kind of like floppy or

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.129 
movement kind of like floppy or
uncontrolled<00:05:26.060> because<00:05:26.240> you<00:05:26.539> really<00:05:26.870> have<00:05:27.020> to
