hey hold position you can watch pretty
good<00:00:03.990> range<00:00:04.259> on<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.620> brood<00:00:04.770> lord<00:00:05.480> 9.5<00:00:06.480> so<00:00:06.779> they

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
good range on the brood lord 9.5 so they

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.410 
good range on the brood lord 9.5 so they
launched<00:00:07.919> out<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.400> then<00:00:08.730> they<00:00:08.910> attack<00:00:09.240> and

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
so it's just great it's a little bit of

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.589 
so it's just great it's a little bit of
bonus<00:00:14.400> damage<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.910> your<00:00:15.030> brood<00:00:15.210> lord<00:00:15.420> gets

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
bonus damage that your brood lord gets

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.439 
bonus damage that your brood lord gets
to<00:00:15.719> do<00:00:15.900> as<00:00:16.109> well<00:00:16.800> as<00:00:17.039> damage<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:17.940> your<00:00:18.090> army

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
won't have to take by the food load

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.410 
won't have to take by the food load
sucking<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.550> up<00:00:20.609> there<00:00:20.789> really<00:00:21.029> screws<00:00:21.300> with

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
sucking it up there really screws with

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.250 
sucking it up there really screws with
the<00:00:21.539> opponent's<00:00:21.930> AI<00:00:22.760> so<00:00:23.760> when<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.539> put<00:00:24.990> all

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the opponent's AI so when I put all

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.679 
the opponent's AI so when I put all
those<00:00:25.439> overlords<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:27.180> here's<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.449> couple

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
those overlords so here's a couple

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.290 
those overlords so here's a couple
overlords<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.429> something<00:00:30.060> that

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
overlords and this is something that

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.830 
overlords and this is something that
players<00:00:31.199> refer<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.740> as<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.250> creep<00:00:32.940> highway<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.809> i

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
players refer to as a creep highway so i

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.500 
players refer to as a creep highway so i
want<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.170> show<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.440> how<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.420> real<00:00:36.420> quick

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
want to show you how to do it real quick

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.510 
want to show you how to do it real quick
so<00:00:37.200> your<00:00:37.320> overloads<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.129> generate

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
so your overloads have this generate

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.069 
so your overloads have this generate
capability<00:00:39.180> right<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.780> we're<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
capability right so we're going to

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.900 
capability right so we're going to
generate<00:00:40.410> some<00:00:40.620> creep<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.430> then<00:00:41.730> we're<00:00:41.820> going

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
generate some creep and then we're going

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.670 
generate some creep and then we're going
to<00:00:42.000> bring<00:00:42.149> them<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.050> i<00:00:43.110> won't<00:00:43.290> want<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> go

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
to bring them here so i won't want to go

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.139 
to bring them here so i won't want to go

here i'm going to shift click another
there<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.750> should<00:00:46.140> click<00:00:46.350> another<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:47.010> shift

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
there I should click another here shift

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.709 
there I should click another here shift

going to see is they're going to all

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.119 
going to see is they're going to all
spawn<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.879> creep<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.680> then<00:00:55.680> if<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:55.949> all

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
spawn that creep and then if they all

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.950 
spawn that creep and then if they all
drop<00:00:56.370> down<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.699> creek<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.539> want<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.809> bring

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
my units to my opponent's base quickly i

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.229 
my units to my opponent's base quickly i
can<00:01:01.170> select<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:01.680> my<00:01:01.800> units<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.340> then<00:01:02.969> i<00:01:03.059> can

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
can select all my units and then i can

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.609 
can select all my units and then i can
bring<00:01:03.359> them<00:01:03.510> down<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.320> takes<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
bring them down here and it takes a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.649 
bring them down here and it takes a
little<00:01:05.010> bit<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.220> time<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.420> i<00:01:06.479> can

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
little bit of time to do it but i can

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.570 
little bit of time to do it but i can
just<00:01:06.810> shoot<00:01:07.049> my<00:01:07.260> units<00:01:07.560> across<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.250> click

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.450 
just shoot my units across really click
on<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.820> creep<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.240> way<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.770> then<00:01:10.770> they<00:01:11.280> all

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
on this creep I way and then they all

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.750 
on this creep I way and then they all
move<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.970> bonus<00:01:12.450> speed<00:01:13.520> until<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.610> get

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
move with that bonus speed until I get

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.749 
move with that bonus speed until I get
to<00:01:14.850> my<00:01:14.939> opponent's<00:01:15.360> base<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.100> then<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.640> know

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
to my opponent's base and then you know

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.789 
to my opponent's base and then you know
it's<00:01:17.970> quick<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:18.200> but<00:01:19.200> they're<00:01:19.350> slower<00:01:19.590> than

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
it's quick but but they're slower than

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.620 
it's quick but but they're slower than
but<00:01:20.009> they<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.729> creep<00:01:21.119> highway<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
but they have that creep highway so you

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.300 
but they have that creep highway so you
can<00:01:21.780> set<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:22.530> overlords<00:01:23.100> or

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
can set that up with your overlords or

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.990 
can set that up with your overlords or
you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.420> continue<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:25.490> use<00:01:26.490> your

crib<00:01:27.240> tumors<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:28.110> spread<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.470> which<00:01:28.619> are<00:01:28.740> great

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
crib tumors to spread it which are great

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.260 
crib tumors to spread it which are great

do<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.880> then<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.270> want<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.570> show<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.750> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
do that and then I want to show you a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.230 
do that and then I want to show you a
couple<00:01:43.229> other<00:01:43.649> things<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.369> investor

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
couple other things with the investor

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.469 
couple other things with the investor
and<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.960> roach<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> roach<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.360> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and the roach so the roach we have to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.440 
and the roach so the roach we have to
get<00:01:48.600> brew<00:01:49.340> I'll<00:01:50.340> research<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.850> row<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.329> that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
get brew I'll research the row and that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.330 
get brew I'll research the row and that
I'll<00:01:51.570> take<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> minute<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.220> your

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
I'll take a minute and so you have your

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.399 
I'll take a minute and so you have your
upgrades<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:53.939> your<00:01:54.060> spire<00:01:54.329> your<00:01:55.049> land

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
upgrades at your spire your land

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.870 
upgrades at your spire your land
upgrades<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.890> your<00:01:56.009> evolution<00:01:56.490> chamber<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
upgrades that your evolution chamber I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.039 
upgrades that your evolution chamber I
would<00:01:57.000> recommend<00:01:57.240> getting<00:01:57.479> multiple

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
would recommend getting multiple

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.499 
would recommend getting multiple
evolution<00:01:58.530> chambers<00:01:58.860> or<00:01:58.979> multiple<00:01:59.369> spires<00:01:59.640> if

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
evolution chambers or multiple spires if

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.060 
evolution chambers or multiple spires if
you're<00:02:00.630> hydrolyse<00:02:01.140> has<00:02:01.290> its<00:02:01.469> groove<00:02:01.710> spines

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
you're hydrolyse has its groove spines

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.889 
you're hydrolyse has its groove spines
which<00:02:02.310> increase<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.880> attack<00:02:03.149> range<00:02:03.420> now

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
which increase the attack range now

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.300 
which increase the attack range now
these<00:02:04.020> are<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.320> important<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.130> lot<00:02:05.280> of

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
these are really important in a lot of

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.300 
these are really important in a lot of
matches<00:02:05.630> because<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.439> marine<00:02:07.710> starts<00:02:08.160> with<00:02:08.250> a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
matches because the marine starts with a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.400 
matches because the marine starts with a
five<00:02:08.520> range<00:02:08.849> but<00:02:09.090> they<00:02:09.239> sent<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.810> stalker<00:02:10.080> and

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
five range but they sent the stalker and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.250 
five range but they sent the stalker and
the<00:02:10.770> Marauder<00:02:10.950> which<00:02:11.280> are<00:02:11.430> common<00:02:12.170> units<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the Marauder which are common units of

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.800 
the Marauder which are common units of
your<00:02:13.379> opponents

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
your opponents

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.900 
your opponents
start<00:02:13.930> with<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.080> six<00:02:14.380> range<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.459> if<00:02:15.760> a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
start with a six range and so if a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.790 
start with a six range and so if a
marauder<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.720> stalker<00:02:17.110> have<00:02:17.319> six<00:02:17.590> range

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
marauder and a stalker have six range

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.949 
marauder and a stalker have six range
and<00:02:18.069> your<00:02:18.580> hydras<00:02:19.030> only<00:02:19.209> out<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.450> five<00:02:19.660> range

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
and your hydras only out of a five range

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.780 
and your hydras only out of a five range
they'll<00:02:20.349> get<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.620> have<00:02:20.739> two<00:02:21.069> lines<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.489> Units

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
they'll get to have two lines of Units

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.180 
they'll get to have two lines of Units
attacking<00:02:22.270> your<00:02:22.390> one<00:02:22.599> line<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.810> unit<00:02:23.200> which<00:02:23.980> it

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
attacking your one line of unit which it

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.160 
attacking your one line of unit which it
can<00:02:24.819> make<00:02:24.940> them<00:02:25.090> do<00:02:25.239> double<00:02:25.630> as<00:02:25.750> much<00:02:25.930> damage

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
can make them do double as much damage

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.930 
can make them do double as much damage
as<00:02:26.380> they<00:02:26.560> should<00:02:26.620> whereas<00:02:27.520> if<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.730> have<00:02:27.819> the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
as they should whereas if you have the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.240 
as they should whereas if you have the
upgrade<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.630> can<00:02:28.660> attack<00:02:29.110> them<00:02:29.349> at<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.069> same

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
upgrade you can attack them at the same

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.890 
upgrade you can attack them at the same
time<00:02:30.489> they<00:02:30.700> can<00:02:30.760> attack<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:31.450> you'll<00:02:31.630> start

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
time they can attack you so you'll start

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.360 
time they can attack you so you'll start
doing<00:02:32.170> damage<00:02:32.380> at<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.620> same<00:02:32.830> time<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.280> you'll

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
doing damage at the same time and you'll

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.670 
doing damage at the same time and you'll
take<00:02:33.640> you'll<00:02:34.510> have<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.810> same<00:02:35.050> size<00:02:35.319> lines

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
take you'll have the same size lines

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.990 
take you'll have the same size lines
fighting<00:02:36.010> each<00:02:36.280> other<00:02:36.400> which<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.790> really

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
fighting each other which is really

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.140 
fighting each other which is really
really<00:02:37.780> important<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.580> think<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.970> boro

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
really important so I think the boro

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.440 
really important so I think the boro
should<00:02:40.690> almost<00:02:41.050> be<00:02:41.680> done<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.519> so<00:02:43.090> burroughs

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
should almost be done and so burroughs

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.180 
should almost be done and so burroughs
an<00:02:43.599> ability<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.989> all<00:02:44.380> yours<00:02:44.680> your<00:02:44.830> units

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
an ability that all yours your units

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.949 
an ability that all yours your units
that<00:02:45.310> are<00:02:45.340> ground<00:02:45.610> units<00:02:45.880> have<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.390> some

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
that are ground units have and some

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.720 
that are ground units have and some
units<00:02:47.290> like<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.590> investor<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.519> roach

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
units like the investor and the roach

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.210 
units like the investor and the roach
have<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.569> ability<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.080> move<00:02:50.440> wall<00:02:50.950> burrowed

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
have the ability to move wall burrowed

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.559 
have the ability to move wall burrowed
and<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.640> don't<00:02:51.790> even<00:02:51.880> have<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.120> research<00:02:52.540> it

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
and you don't even have to research it

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.809 
and you don't even have to research it
for<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.900> investor<00:02:53.380> but<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.310> road<00:02:54.489> you<00:02:54.700> do

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
for the investor but the road you do

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.460 
for the investor but the road you do
have<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.060> research<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.390> for<00:02:55.660> it's<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:55.900> second

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
have to research it for it's that second

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:04.050 
have to research it for it's that second
research<00:02:56.830> item<00:02:59.069> so<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:03.430> here's<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.849> borough

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
research item so so here's the borough

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.390 
research item so so here's the borough
and<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:06.120> says<00:03:07.120> be<00:03:07.950> for<00:03:08.950> both<00:03:09.040> but<00:03:09.280> it's

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
and it's says be for both but it's

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.190 
and it's says be for both but it's
actually<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.730> different<00:03:10.209> key<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.480> bro<00:03:10.750> NM<00:03:11.080> bro

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
actually a different key to bro NM bro

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.740 
actually a different key to bro NM bro
and<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:11.920> right<00:03:12.130> now<00:03:12.190> this<00:03:12.940> unit<00:03:13.269> that's<00:03:13.450> broad

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
and so right now this unit that's broad

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.170 
and so right now this unit that's broad
is<00:03:14.019> invisible<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:15.310> both<00:03:15.519> these<00:03:15.700> units<00:03:16.030> aren't

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
is invisible so both these units aren't

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.400 
is invisible so both these units aren't
visible<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:16.630> can<00:03:16.750> tell<00:03:16.900> they<00:03:17.019> move<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.290> little

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
visible you can tell they move a little

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.080 
visible you can tell they move a little
slower<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.950> investor<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.310> actually<00:03:18.670> rather

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
slower the investor is actually rather

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.949 
slower the investor is actually rather
fast<00:03:19.530> wahlberg<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.940> they're<00:03:22.660> allowed<00:03:22.930> to

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
fast wahlberg and and they're allowed to

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.199

do<00:03:23.170> some<00:03:23.350> sneak<00:03:23.620> attacks<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:24.519> they<00:03:24.670> can't<00:03:24.940> move

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
do some sneak attacks so they can't move

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.729 
do some sneak attacks so they can't move
past<00:03:25.480> enemy<00:03:26.260> structures<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:28.180> they<00:03:28.660> can<00:03:28.989> or<00:03:29.319> or

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739

they can't move around them and so this

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.819 
they can't move around them and so this

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
that mineral line and just wreak havoc

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.410 
that mineral line and just wreak havoc
on<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.250> mineral<00:04:48.520> line<00:04:48.640> your<00:04:48.820> opponent<00:04:49.240> might

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
on that mineral line your opponent might

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.420 
on that mineral line your opponent might
pull<00:04:49.720> his<00:04:49.870> troops<00:04:50.110> back<00:04:50.230> from<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.560> attack<00:04:50.890> he

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
pull his troops back from the attack he

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.920 
pull his troops back from the attack he
might<00:04:51.610> not<00:04:51.760> pull<00:04:52.030> his<00:04:52.150> troops<00:04:52.360> back<00:04:52.540> but<00:04:52.780> then

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
might not pull his troops back but then

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.960 
might not pull his troops back but then
if<00:04:53.590> he<00:04:53.800> does<00:04:53.980> damage<00:04:54.220> your<00:04:54.490> base<00:04:54.640> so<00:04:54.760> you<00:04:54.790> can

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
if he does damage your base so you can

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.850 
if he does damage your base so you can
still<00:04:55.150> fend<00:04:55.360> them<00:04:55.420> off<00:04:55.600> then<00:04:56.260> your<00:04:56.470> zerglings

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
still fend them off then your zerglings

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.990
