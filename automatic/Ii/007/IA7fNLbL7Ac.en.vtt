means to make images like draw a line
and<00:00:13.530> think<00:00:13.740> about<00:00:13.920> why<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.700> drew<00:00:14.879> a<00:00:14.910> line

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
and think about why you just drew a line

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.880 
and think about why you just drew a line
and<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:15.419> are<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.629> consequences<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.290> drawing

your life for two years in a practice
that<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.640> don't<00:00:23.849> really<00:00:24.630> give<00:00:24.930> yourself<00:00:25.050> to

matters and make a difference in the
world<00:00:29.070> there's<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.849> waste<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.150> time

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.830 

the<00:00:36.280> designers<00:00:36.790> are<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.090> most<00:00:37.360> powerful

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
the designers are the most powerful

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.710 
the designers are the most powerful
people<00:00:37.989> in<00:00:38.200> the<00:00:38.260> world<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:40.540> they<00:00:40.690> have

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
people in the world because they have

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.049 
people in the world because they have
you<00:00:41.380> know<00:00:41.440> an<00:00:41.590> ethical<00:00:42.070> duty<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.550> to

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
you know an ethical duty to to

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.270 
you know an ethical duty to to
essentially<00:00:43.600> be<00:00:43.720> aware<00:00:44.050> of<00:00:44.350> that<00:00:44.620> power<00:00:44.890> and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
essentially be aware of that power and

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.340 
essentially be aware of that power and
to<00:00:45.850> make<00:00:46.030> sure<00:00:46.210> it's<00:00:46.360> directed<00:00:46.840> in<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.320> right

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
to make sure it's directed in the right

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.160 
to make sure it's directed in the right
way<00:00:47.680> and<00:00:47.949> in<00:00:48.579> that<00:00:48.760> sense<00:00:49.120> there's<00:00:49.809> this<00:00:49.960> whole

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
way and in that sense there's this whole

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.890 
way and in that sense there's this whole
movement<00:00:50.470> and<00:00:51.040> I<00:00:51.339> think<00:00:51.420> CCA's<00:00:52.420> Graduate

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
movement and I think CCA's Graduate

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.630 
movement and I think CCA's Graduate
design<00:00:53.140> program<00:00:53.470> is<00:00:53.500> at<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.830> forefront<00:00:54.100> of<00:00:54.460> it

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
design program is at the forefront of it

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.840 
design program is at the forefront of it
of<00:00:55.120> emphasizing<00:00:55.870> sustainable<00:00:56.500> design

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
of emphasizing sustainable design

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.280 
of emphasizing sustainable design
designers<00:00:57.850> in<00:00:58.059> a<00:00:58.120> way<00:00:58.269> this<00:00:58.510> are<00:00:58.720> really<00:00:58.989> quick

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
designers in a way this are really quick

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.160 
designers in a way this are really quick
to<00:00:59.470> Pat<00:00:59.890> each<00:01:00.190> other<00:01:00.370> on<00:01:00.519> the<00:01:00.699> back<00:01:00.879> and<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.390> we

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
to Pat each other on the back and and we

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.410 
to Pat each other on the back and and we
go<00:01:02.320> into<00:01:02.559> different<00:01:03.070> communities<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:04.000> shake

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
go into different communities and shake

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.600 
go into different communities and shake
things<00:01:04.629> up<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.080> then<00:01:05.170> take<00:01:05.740> off<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:06.430> then

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
things up and then take off and then

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.090 
things up and then take off and then
design<00:01:07.030> something<00:01:07.420> about<00:01:07.720> what<00:01:08.259> we<00:01:08.380> did<00:01:08.590> I'm

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
design something about what we did I'm

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.010 
design something about what we did I'm
always<00:01:09.369> questioning<00:01:10.000> why<00:01:10.600> should<00:01:10.810> something

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
always questioning why should something

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.510 
always questioning why should something

teaching here and they were people that
I<00:02:58.310> had<00:02:58.700> booked<00:02:58.940> up<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.300> before<00:02:59.690> I<00:02:59.870> even<00:02:59.990> knew

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
I had booked up to before I even knew

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.590 
I had booked up to before I even knew
about<00:03:00.410> CCA<00:03:00.950> so<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.730> didn't<00:03:02.000> know<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.300> was<00:03:02.450> gonna

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
about CCA so I didn't know it was gonna

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.110 
about CCA so I didn't know it was gonna
be<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:03.170> diverse<00:03:03.710> here<00:03:04.160> but<00:03:04.550> it<00:03:04.700> was<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.820> good

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
be this diverse here but it was a good

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.570 
be this diverse here but it was a good
surprise<00:03:05.540> I<00:03:06.020> think<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.320> CCA<00:03:06.650> being<00:03:07.040> situated

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
surprise I think that CCA being situated

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.610 
surprise I think that CCA being situated
in<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.790> Bay<00:03:07.940> Area<00:03:07.970> kind<00:03:08.690> of<00:03:08.750> capitalizes<00:03:09.470> on

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
in the Bay Area kind of capitalizes on

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.830 
in the Bay Area kind of capitalizes on
the<00:03:09.860> this<00:03:10.070> is<00:03:10.130> what's<00:03:10.520> happening<00:03:11.000> it's<00:03:11.330> here

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
the this is what's happening it's here

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.600 
the this is what's happening it's here
and<00:03:12.050> it's<00:03:12.260> now<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.040> train<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.580> moving

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
and it's now and the train is moving

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.610 
and it's now and the train is moving
real<00:03:14.060> fast<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.900> kind<00:03:15.050> of<00:03:15.110> feeds<00:03:15.380> off<00:03:15.590> that

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
real fast and kind of feeds off that

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.310 
real fast and kind of feeds off that
energy<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.370> lets<00:03:16.550> you<00:03:16.700> kind<00:03:17.210> of<00:03:17.510> really<00:03:18.110> be<00:03:18.230> in

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
energy it lets you kind of really be in

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.390 
energy it lets you kind of really be in
touch<00:03:18.470> with<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.650> fact<00:03:18.830> that<00:03:18.920> you<00:03:19.070> can<00:03:19.220> go<00:03:19.310> out

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
touch with the fact that you can go out

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.120 
touch with the fact that you can go out
and<00:03:19.430> change<00:03:19.730> something<00:03:20.890> it's<00:03:21.890> like<00:03:21.950> the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
and change something it's like the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.560 
and change something it's like the
speculative<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.910> practical<00:03:23.420> like

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
speculative and the practical like

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.260 
speculative and the practical like
smashing<00:03:24.500> together<00:03:24.680> and<00:03:25.490> and<00:03:25.850> I<00:03:25.940> think<00:03:26.150> that

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
smashing together and and I think that

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.000 
smashing together and and I think that
that<00:03:26.390> is<00:03:26.630> like<00:03:26.660> a<00:03:27.130> lot<00:03:28.130> of<00:03:28.160> fun
