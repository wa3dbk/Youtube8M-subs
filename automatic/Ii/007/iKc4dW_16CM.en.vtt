00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.670 
little bit darker so I'm hoping that one
works<00:05:51.000> for<00:05:51.240> me<00:05:51.390> because<00:05:51.720> I<00:05:51.900> believe<00:05:52.320> this<00:05:52.470> one

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
works for me because I believe this one

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.850 
works for me because I believe this one
was<00:05:52.800> close<00:05:53.010> to<00:05:53.160> 50<00:05:53.490> bucks<00:05:53.870> 45<00:05:54.870> or<00:05:55.229> 50<00:05:55.560> but<00:05:55.740> I'll

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
was close to 50 bucks 45 or 50 but I'll

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.530 
was close to 50 bucks 45 or 50 but I'll
have<00:05:56.040> that<00:05:56.160> information<00:05:56.490> for<00:05:56.790> you<00:05:57.000> below<00:05:57.300> but

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
have that information for you below but

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.990 
have that information for you below but
yeah<00:05:58.080> I<00:05:58.110> would<00:05:58.470> probably<00:05:59.220> just<00:05:59.430> shove<00:05:59.669> off<00:05:59.790> the

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
yeah I would probably just shove off the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.630 
yeah I would probably just shove off the
money<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.450> buy<00:06:00.600> this<00:06:00.660> again<00:06:01.440> but<00:06:02.070> I<00:06:02.100> do<00:06:02.250> plan

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
money and buy this again but I do plan

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.390 
money and buy this again but I do plan
to<00:06:02.790> try<00:06:03.000> other<00:06:03.270> high-end<00:06:04.050> powders<00:06:04.710> because<00:06:04.979> I

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
to try other high-end powders because I

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.840 
to try other high-end powders because I
can<00:06:05.790> deal<00:06:06.000> with<00:06:06.650> you<00:06:07.650> know<00:06:07.850> drugstore

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
can deal with you know drugstore

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.460 
can deal with you know drugstore
foundations<00:06:09.479> but<00:06:09.630> I<00:06:09.690> cannot<00:06:10.140> deal<00:06:10.440> with

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
foundations but I cannot deal with

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.870 
foundations but I cannot deal with
drugstore<00:06:11.330> powders<00:06:12.330> but<00:06:13.110> if<00:06:13.290> I<00:06:13.470> get<00:06:13.710> a

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
drugstore powders but if I get a

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.270 
drugstore powders but if I get a
drugstore<00:06:14.880> foundation<00:06:15.690> that's<00:06:16.500> good<00:06:16.800> that's

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
drugstore foundation that's good that's

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.219 
drugstore foundation that's good that's
pretty<00:06:17.640> good<00:06:17.760> or<00:06:18.000> close<00:06:18.270> are<00:06:18.510> dead-on<00:06:18.750> and

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
pretty good or close are dead-on and

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.080 
pretty good or close are dead-on and
then<00:06:19.350> have<00:06:19.530> a<00:06:19.560> good<00:06:19.830> powder<00:06:20.100> that<00:06:20.640> just<00:06:20.880> makes

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
then have a good powder that just makes

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.520 
then have a good powder that just makes
a<00:06:21.210> world<00:06:21.240> of<00:06:21.540> difference<00:06:21.900> that's<00:06:22.020> me<00:06:22.290> that's

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
a world of difference that's me that's

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.190 
a world of difference that's me that's
in<00:06:22.680> my<00:06:22.830> opinion<00:06:23.220> I<00:06:23.310> have<00:06:23.550> other<00:06:24.510> powders<00:06:25.020> in

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:14.659 
and that's great and but this is just

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:16.689 
and that's great and but this is just
based<00:07:14.870> on<00:07:15.169> me<00:07:15.529> being<00:07:15.560> an<00:07:15.860> average<00:07:16.069> consumer

based on me being an average consumer

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:19.990 
based on me being an average consumer
someone<00:07:17.150> who<00:07:17.419> does<00:07:18.409> collect<00:07:19.129> makeup<00:07:19.610> over<00:07:19.969> a

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 
someone who does collect makeup over a

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.760 
someone who does collect makeup over a
period<00:07:20.270> of<00:07:20.419> time<00:07:20.599> to<00:07:20.870> test<00:07:21.110> a<00:07:21.229> news<00:07:21.349> out<00:07:21.529> see

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.770 
period of time to test a news out see

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.219 
period of time to test a news out see
what<00:07:21.919> works<00:07:22.189> for<00:07:22.310> me<00:07:22.460> that<00:07:23.150> even<00:07:23.870> though<00:07:23.960> it<00:07:24.110> is

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:24.229 
what works for me that even though it is

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:26.350 
what works for me that even though it is
high-end<00:07:24.740> doesn't<00:07:25.189> mean<00:07:25.340> that<00:07:25.520> it's<00:07:25.789> going<00:07:26.120> to

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360 
high-end doesn't mean that it's going to

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.209 
high-end doesn't mean that it's going to
work<00:07:26.659> every<00:07:27.080> single<00:07:27.229> time<00:07:27.409> some<00:07:27.830> things<00:07:28.039> will

00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:28.219 
work every single time some things will

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:29.980 
work every single time some things will
be<00:07:28.340> hid<00:07:28.550> some<00:07:28.969> things<00:07:29.150> will<00:07:29.300> be<00:07:29.389> misses<00:07:29.810> just

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:29.990 
be hid some things will be misses just

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.689 
be hid some things will be misses just
like<00:07:30.469> the<00:07:30.620> drugstore<00:07:31.099> products<00:07:31.490> so<00:07:31.550> it's

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:31.699 
like the drugstore products so it's
