00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
I that's when do stuff for my computer

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.110 
I that's when do stuff for my computer
it'll<00:00:13.049> be<00:00:13.139> put<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.530> hopefully<00:00:14.519> tonight<00:00:14.670> and

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
it'll be put in hopefully tonight and

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.430 
it'll be put in hopefully tonight and
then<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.540> will<00:00:15.690> be<00:00:15.809> online<00:00:15.990> live<00:00:16.410> streaming

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440

like<00:00:17.070> normal<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.180> uh<00:00:18.210> let's<00:00:18.960> see<00:00:19.550> basically<00:00:20.550> I

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
like normal so uh let's see basically I

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.300 
like normal so uh let's see basically I
had<00:00:21.119> an<00:00:21.449> HP<00:00:21.810> pavilion<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> AMD<00:00:23.880> phenom<00:00:24.390> 28

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
had an HP pavilion with a AMD phenom 28

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.710 
had an HP pavilion with a AMD phenom 28
42.9<00:00:26.310> gigahertz<00:00:26.699> processor<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.539> was

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
42.9 gigahertz processor and I was

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.880 
42.9 gigahertz processor and I was
trying<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> figure<00:00:28.260> out<00:00:28.410> how<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.590> render

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
trying to figure out how to render

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.859 
trying to figure out how to render
videos<00:00:29.279> faster<00:00:29.699> cool<00:00:30.000> shit<00:00:30.539> my<00:00:30.689> hair's

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
videos faster cool shit my hair's

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.260 
videos faster cool shit my hair's
fucking<00:00:31.410> matted<00:00:31.859> down<00:00:31.890> from<00:00:32.309> sleeping<00:00:32.669> but<00:00:33.149> up

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
fucking matted down from sleeping but up

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.569 
fucking matted down from sleeping but up
can't<00:00:34.079> figure<00:00:34.230> out<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> render<00:00:34.860> videos<00:00:35.130> faster

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
can't figure out a render videos faster

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.630 
can't figure out a render videos faster
so<00:00:35.820> i<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.329> computer<00:00:36.480> place<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.640> find

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
so i go to the computer place and find

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.220 
so i go to the computer place and find
out<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.059> my<00:00:39.090> mother<00:00:39.390> board<00:00:39.780> will<00:00:40.020> only

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
out that my mother board will only

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.250 
out that my mother board will only
handle<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.700> very<00:00:41.969> much<00:00:42.180> better<00:00:42.510> like<00:00:42.780> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
handle not very much better like you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.600 
handle not very much better like you
know<00:00:43.379> something<00:00:43.800> that's<00:00:44.129> not<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.460> do

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
know something that's not going to do

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.430 
know something that's not going to do
much<00:00:44.820> more<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> didn't<00:00:46.050> want<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.200> spend<00:00:46.350> a

is what I ended up picking up it's a the
i7<00:01:02.219> 2700<00:01:03.890> um<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.640> since<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.090> picked<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.450> up

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
i7 2700 um but since I picked that up

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.539 
i7 2700 um but since I picked that up
that's<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.500> three<00:01:07.770> point<00:01:07.979> five<00:01:08.159> gigahertz

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that's a three point five gigahertz

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.570 
that's a three point five gigahertz
processor<00:01:08.790> quad<00:01:09.570> cord<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.170> had<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> pick<00:01:11.400> up

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
processor quad cord I had to pick up

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.929 
processor quad cord I had to pick up
this<00:01:12.200> which<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:14.600> a<00:01:15.979> gigabyte<00:01:16.979> motherboard<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
this which is a gigabyte motherboard and

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.280 
this which is a gigabyte motherboard and
it<00:01:18.630> has<00:01:18.840> onboard<00:01:19.909> SATA<00:01:20.909> hard<00:01:21.360> drive<00:01:21.689> spot<00:01:22.020> now

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
it has onboard SATA hard drive spot now

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.719 
it has onboard SATA hard drive spot now
let<00:01:22.590> me<00:01:22.619> pull<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.950> out<00:01:23.070> show<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.580> real

you guys are looking to upgrade stuff

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.790 
you guys are looking to upgrade stuff
see<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.689> um

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800

yeah<00:01:42.160> see<00:01:42.670> this<00:01:42.850> little<00:01:43.410> spot<00:01:44.410> right<00:01:44.470> there

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
yeah see this little spot right there

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.880 
yeah see this little spot right there
that<00:01:46.300> is<00:01:46.510> a<00:01:46.540> spot<00:01:46.900> for<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.230> hard<00:01:47.590> drive<00:01:47.680> that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
that is a spot for a hard drive that

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.830 
that is a spot for a hard drive that
goes<00:01:48.280> directly<00:01:48.520> on<00:01:48.940> your<00:01:49.030> motherboard<00:01:49.330> so

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
goes directly on your motherboard so

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.060 
goes directly on your motherboard so
when<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.200> load<00:01:50.470> windows<00:01:52.740> I'm<00:01:53.740> gonna<00:01:53.920> load

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
when I load windows I'm gonna load

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.550 
when I load windows I'm gonna load
windows<00:01:54.400> in<00:01:54.730> vegas<00:01:55.150> and<00:01:55.360> any<00:01:56.110> other<00:01:56.290> program

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
windows in vegas and any other program

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.770 
windows in vegas and any other program
that<00:01:56.860> i<00:01:56.890> want<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.340> go<00:01:57.460> super<00:01:57.790> fast<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.450> they

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
that i want to go super fast and they

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.450 
that i want to go super fast and they
said<00:01:58.990> that<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.200> will<00:01:59.320> load<00:01:59.560> quicker<00:01:59.920> than<00:02:00.160> off

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
said that it will load quicker than off

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.630 
said that it will load quicker than off
of<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.120> normal<00:02:01.330> hard<00:02:01.630> drive<00:02:02.220> so<00:02:03.220> then<00:02:03.370> i<00:02:03.400> had<00:02:03.610> to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
of a normal hard drive so then i had to

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.730 
of a normal hard drive so then i had to
