right into my hand and so you can see
it's<00:01:15.530> an<00:01:15.679> error<00:01:15.860> in<00:01:16.130> line<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.630> then<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.660> blunt

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
it's an error in line and then the blunt

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.730 
it's an error in line and then the blunt
one<00:01:18.500> is<00:01:19.009> going<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.399> give<00:01:19.610> you<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:19.850> thicker<00:01:20.539> line

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
one is going to give you a thicker line

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.590

squeeze the tip and then I give it a
twist<00:02:03.700> alright<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:04.910> what<00:02:05.030> that's<00:02:05.890> what's

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
twist alright and what that's what's

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.410 
twist alright and what that's what's
going<00:02:07.069> to<00:02:07.250> do<00:02:07.429> is<00:02:07.610> that<00:02:07.789> it's<00:02:07.910> going<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.149> give

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
going to do is that it's going to give

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.100 
going to do is that it's going to give
you<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:08.989> nice<00:02:09.590> point<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.429> it<00:02:10.640> see<00:02:12.129> okay<00:02:14.110> all

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
you a nice point to it see okay all

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.470 
you a nice point to it see okay all
right<00:02:15.349> so<00:02:15.709> dem<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.190> training<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.730> right<00:02:17.209> into

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
right so dem is training that right into

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.600 
right so dem is training that right into
the<00:02:18.410> eye<00:02:18.440> area<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.069> you<00:02:19.099> can<00:02:19.220> see<00:02:19.550> the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
the eye area so you can see the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.270 
the eye area so you can see the
difference<00:02:20.150> between<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.959> nicely<00:02:21.800> sharpened

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
difference between a nicely sharpened

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.790 
difference between a nicely sharpened
pencil<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:23.209> blunt<00:02:23.420> pencil<00:02:23.900> we're<00:02:24.560> going<00:02:24.709> to

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
pencil and a blunt pencil we're going to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:35.199 
pencil and a blunt pencil we're going to
get<00:02:24.980> up<00:02:25.160> close<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.430> personal

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.390 

okay<00:02:36.209> so<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.989> first<00:02:37.019> pencil<00:02:37.980> i'm<00:02:38.099> going<00:02:38.310> to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
okay so the first pencil i'm going to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.399 
okay so the first pencil i'm going to
demonstrate<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.180> blunt<00:02:39.420> pencil<00:02:39.900> all

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
demonstrate is the blunt pencil all

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.679 
demonstrate is the blunt pencil all
right<00:02:40.590> just<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.129> this<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.670> i'm<00:02:42.239> just<00:02:42.480> going

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
right just like this and i'm just going

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.940 
right just like this and i'm just going
to<00:02:42.780> apply<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.590> right<00:02:44.250> into<00:02:44.549> my<00:02:44.700> eye<00:02:45.950> and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
to apply this right into my eye and

to apply this right into my eye and
immediately<00:02:47.670> you're<00:02:47.939> going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.239> notice<00:02:48.450> it's

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
immediately you're going to notice it's

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.550 
immediately you're going to notice it's
a<00:02:49.019> really<00:02:49.379> thick<00:02:49.829> line<00:02:50.340> okay<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:52.019> you're<00:02:52.439> not

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
a really thick line okay so you're not

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.460 
a really thick line okay so you're not
going<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.769> be<00:02:52.859> able<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.220> achieve<00:02:54.470> finelining

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
going to be able to achieve finelining

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.039 
going to be able to achieve finelining
if<00:02:55.829> you<00:02:56.129> use<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:57.079> blunt<00:02:58.079> pencil<00:02:58.799> all<00:02:59.760> right<00:03:00.049> okay

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
if you use a blunt pencil all right okay

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.599 
if you use a blunt pencil all right okay
now<00:03:01.200> moving<00:03:01.409> on<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.799> other<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.099> we're<00:03:02.400> going

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
now moving on to the other I we're going

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:14.509 
now moving on to the other I we're going
to<00:03:02.790> apply<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:04.260> sharpened<00:03:04.769> pencil<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:14.250> as<00:03:14.370> you

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
to apply the sharpened pencil so as you

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:25.530 
to apply the sharpened pencil so as you
can<00:03:14.639> see<00:03:14.939> it's<00:03:15.209> finer<00:03:15.689> of<00:03:16.079> a<00:03:16.409> line<00:03:16.680> snare<00:03:17.280> ower

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.119 

just<00:03:26.439> like<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:27.069> so<00:03:27.610> if<00:03:27.790> i<00:03:27.969> zoom<00:03:28.980> out<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.040> little

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
just like so so if i zoom out a little

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.670 
just like so so if i zoom out a little
bit<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.609> can<00:03:30.730> see<00:03:30.909> the<00:03:31.060> difference<00:03:31.450> between

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
bit you can see the difference between

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.410 
bit you can see the difference between
the<00:03:32.680> blunt<00:03:32.950> pencil<00:03:33.430> which<00:03:33.640> is<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.819> wider<00:03:34.090> line

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
the blunt pencil which is a wider line

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.729 
the blunt pencil which is a wider line
and<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:36.420> sharpened<00:03:37.420> pencil<00:03:37.810> which<00:03:38.319> will<00:03:38.560> give

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
and the sharpened pencil which will give

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.250 
and the sharpened pencil which will give
you<00:03:38.829> a<00:03:38.890> narrower<00:03:39.370> line<00:03:39.689> okay<00:03:40.689> if<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:40.989> need<00:03:41.140> to

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
you a narrower line okay if you need to

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.339 
you a narrower line okay if you need to
achieve<00:03:41.379> a<00:03:41.890> much<00:03:42.400> narrower<00:03:43.000> line<00:03:43.569> or<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.870> finer

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
achieve a much narrower line or a finer
