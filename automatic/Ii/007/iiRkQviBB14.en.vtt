00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
8 millimeter allen wrench and get it

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.390 
8 millimeter allen wrench and get it
nice<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.090> snug<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.950> all<00:01:11.100> four

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.700 

now<00:01:26.000> that<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:26.240> get<00:01:26.390> your<00:01:26.540> top<00:01:26.720> completed<00:01:27.320> flip

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
now that you get your top completed flip

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.340 
now that you get your top completed flip
it<00:01:27.830> over<00:01:27.950> on<00:01:28.100> its<00:01:28.250> side<00:01:28.720> it's<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:29.810> same<00:01:30.080> thing

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
it over on its side it's the same thing

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.410 
it over on its side it's the same thing
right<00:01:30.920> here<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:33.759> that's<00:01:34.759> what<00:01:34.939> our<00:01:35.060> corner

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
right here and that's what our corner

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.930 
right here and that's what our corner
looks<00:01:35.630> like<00:01:36.190> all<00:01:37.190> right<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:37.580> why<00:01:37.729> did<00:01:37.850> they

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
looks like all right so why did they

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.880 
looks like all right so why did they
call<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.270> universal<00:01:38.930> junction<00:01:39.380> box<00:01:39.590> well

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
call the universal junction box well

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.310 
call the universal junction box well
obviously<00:01:40.280> they've<00:01:40.759> just<00:01:40.970> made<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.539> corner<00:01:42.170> so

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
obviously they've just made a corner so

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.070 
obviously they've just made a corner so
we<00:01:42.380> can<00:01:42.409> do<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.920> 90<00:01:43.340> degree<00:01:43.549> angle<00:01:43.580> but<00:01:44.330> you've

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
we can do a 90 degree angle but you've

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.070 
we can do a 90 degree angle but you've
got<00:01:45.380> holes<00:01:45.830> on<00:01:46.250> all<00:01:46.310> six<00:01:46.970> sides<00:01:47.210> with<00:01:47.930> this

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
got holes on all six sides with this
