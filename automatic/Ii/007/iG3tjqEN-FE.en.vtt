00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
address that and he was probably happy

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.560 
address that and he was probably happy
to<00:01:14.189> address<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.700> because<00:01:14.790> he<00:01:15.090> said<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.450> know

what as much as you know it's their last
game<00:01:18.740> it's<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.950> just<00:01:20.250> about<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.640> seniors

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
game it's not just about the seniors

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.580 
game it's not just about the seniors
it's<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.930> know<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> whole<00:01:22.320> team

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it's about this you know the whole team

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.230 
it's about this you know the whole team
and<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> whole<00:01:22.979> family<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.790> coaches

and the whole family of you know coaches
and<00:01:24.360> everybody<00:01:24.390> else<00:01:24.930> involved<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:26.250> he's

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
and everybody else involved I think he's

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.330 
and everybody else involved I think he's
already<00:01:26.759> kind<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.210> playing<00:01:27.750> down<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.560> you

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
already kind of playing down that you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.670 
already kind of playing down that you
know<00:01:29.460> let's<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.420> fired<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.290> get<00:01:31.439> real

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
know let's all get fired up and get real

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.620 
know let's all get fired up and get real
emotional<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.579> think<00:01:32.939> that's<00:01:33.119> probably<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
emotional and I think that's probably a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.140 
emotional and I think that's probably a
very<00:01:33.689> smart<00:01:34.320> way<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.860> approach<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> coach

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
very smart way to approach it as a coach

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.149 
very smart way to approach it as a coach
that<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.500> know<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> whole<00:01:37.860> team
