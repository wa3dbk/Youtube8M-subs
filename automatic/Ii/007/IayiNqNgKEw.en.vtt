00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:22.320

 african soil den i redo 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:15.970
 this is the beginning the remake again one 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:20.580

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:27.150

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:29.830
 and 152 6 15th on the ground rope I 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:35.410

 thirteenth corps domi 16th strings of 6 ha 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.280
 Well, that is to say 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:59.840
 she goes back down I tell the 13th 15th 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:12.470
 13th floor body strings of his 15th body 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:32.239
 golden I redo I link the two 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:36.109
 parts then I always break down 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.799
 13th box dropped on the agreement of the 15th 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.799
 on the rope of the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.510
 I'm on the 17th ground rope that 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:59.120
 abound the two little bars and on the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.120
 15th rope us when half when also 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.389
 I link everything we just saw 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.099
 so after a little passage a little 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.500
 technique that I really invite you to 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:43.169
 work slowly so we are in 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:48.810
 position on the 12th case this time and one 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:50.220
 will go on the rope of I'm going on the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:59.090
 gently do the whole thing to take 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:59.090
 breaks down so I'm doing 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:11.680
 as for is 13th 14th 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:14.680
 12th string 13th string 6/15 string 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:21.150
 14th soil that they always have the 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:23.470
 ground rope goes back on the golden chord 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.260
 13th 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.950
 14th 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.870
 we 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:42.580
 sixth body of this 15th body of the 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:51.960
 heat gently agrees 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:58.510
 the result so on the rope there we hold 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:06:00.350
 12th 10th when you would have twelfth body 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:06.320
 golden 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:09.470
 10th floor rope there also work the 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:20.290
 gently and when you chained 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:20.290
 two do you do the following 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:33.260
 so here I am on the ground rope trez 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:36.770
 hir 14th go m 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:49.700
 as for the 6 15th Corps above summarizes 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:52.390
 when half so I link all and the 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.390
 end of this chorus 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:11.020
 in fact completed them 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.330
