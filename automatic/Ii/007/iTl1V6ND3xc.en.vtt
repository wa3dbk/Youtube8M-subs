Xperia Z now there are a bunch of us

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720 
Xperia Z now there are a bunch of us
similarities<00:00:19.230> between<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.800> two<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:20.609> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
similarities between the two but the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.400 
similarities between the two but the
most<00:00:20.910> notable<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.630> even<00:00:22.050> though<00:00:22.260> they

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
most notable is that even though they

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.109 
most notable is that even though they
both<00:00:22.650> are<00:00:22.859> 5<00:00:23.039> inch<00:00:23.250> screens<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> t-mobile

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
both are 5 inch screens for the t-mobile

both are 5 inch screens for the t-mobile
xperia<00:00:24.930> z1s<00:00:25.470> it's<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> little<00:00:26.730> bit<00:00:26.880> bigger<00:00:27.119> and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
xperia z1s it's a little bit bigger and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.970 
xperia z1s it's a little bit bigger and
that's<00:00:27.630> because<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.199> has<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> bigger<00:00:28.710> battery

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
that's because it has a bigger battery

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.519 
that's because it has a bigger battery
this<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.580> 3,000<00:00:30.300> milliamp<00:00:30.900> hour<00:00:31.019> battery<00:00:31.140> in

this with 3,000 milliamp hour battery in

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.889 
this with 3,000 milliamp hour battery in
here<00:00:31.560> that's<00:00:31.890> comparable<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> Z<00:00:33.570> ultra

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
here that's comparable to the Z ultra

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.299 
here that's comparable to the Z ultra
which<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.350> Sony's<00:00:35.000> 6.44<00:00:36.000> inch<00:00:36.239> device<00:00:37.309> aside

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
which is Sony's 6.44 inch device aside

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
which is Sony's 6.44 inch device aside
from<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:39.000> still<00:00:39.270> has<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.600> Omni

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
from that it still has that Omni

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
so on top of making it waterproof

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.880 
so on top of making it waterproof
they've<00:01:30.689> also<00:01:30.869> moved<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.290> more<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> center
