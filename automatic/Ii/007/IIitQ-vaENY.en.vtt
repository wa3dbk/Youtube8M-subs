00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.470
 and eyes people here this flyer I hope 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.730
 that you are well and today we 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.789
 let's find ourselves for a new 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.279
 video that will happen on nba touquet 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.900
 15 so down yet the mode 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.960
 domination and there we will open the pack 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.610
 special 2 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.579
 2 what is it called clippers 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.980
 So here's why not touch a 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.260
 blake griffin a chris paul a train of 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.250
 andrÃ© jordan like that at the same time I 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.410
 can complete a little bit my 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.820
 team because there currently built in 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.329
 same time I unlocked the team of 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.430
 spurs 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.000
 so here I am completing a 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.810
 little bit different teams because 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.780
 we can get 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.660
 dm ti so I'll show you no 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.790
 there we can not for example with that's where 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.020
 I miss him only down I miss him 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.980
 only us cousin brands because 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.660
 that ray mc collum 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.700
 by the way look what I'm going to do 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.700
 we are going to get it right away 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.670
 here's up added to the collection 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.210
 so here I miss him more than 1,1 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.240
 player and I will finally have the collection 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.560
 kings of fact 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.880
 so that's really it's really not 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.869
 badly you see it's 25000 m6 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.400
 quietly because it's a 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.550
 team that is really simple to have 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.650
 so the utah jazz to ok no they they 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.400
 not give so I looked a little 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.729
 little different teams with 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.110
 players that would not cost too much 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.470
 because the goal is not us 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.960
 ruin 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.820
 so suddenly after maybe I'm going 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.430
 do the spurs is a duncan type and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.690
 listen anyway pretty dear have 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.479
 maybe the team out of hers 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.670
 why not we'll see we'll see 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.050
 anyway that's pretty blablater we're going 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.320
 directly went into the rewards 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.310
 and open the three packs so the three 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.390
 packs that are given to us following the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.970
 victory simply 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.280
 so we can see there we can open 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.670
 directly it's no problem is so 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.950
 the rupa logo puts it on sale fast that 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.140
 we do not need now it's the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.220
 pack of jerseys is what the pack of 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:25.180
 jerseys it's going to be good too that's it 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.870
 has the basic trick is now the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.490
 best packs the players pack so 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.850
 will we have this time 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.770
 luck 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.530
 will we finally be lucky? 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.530
 because at last we had already had to act 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.319
 and who does have 3 gold you know what 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.069
 I will do like last time 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.660
 here at 3 to 3 I suddenly go back 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.560
 and I close my eyes finally there I already 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.630
 eyes closed so one two three here 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.640
 so there is only you who know is 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.980
 what did I have a diver or not ben 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.970
 alaya that you so she is three 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:06.950
 games I open my eyes 1 2 3 or 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:10.610
 yes chris paul or ouch ouch ouch of christ 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.230
 pole but that's good hop hop hop 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.980
 expectations as much I believe I'm going 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.410
 I just watched his stats on time 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.600
 how many is how chris paul ivo it 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.520
 would not be bad to know I'm talking resale 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.550
 b because anyway what I 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.890
 to do is to keep the maximum of 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.130
 players so if I could have each 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.640
 player that would not be bad good waiting 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.600
 cottage directly in hip dance 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.040
 hicheri no it's not it's not pau 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.590
 gasol that I want to see me it's 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.320
 of chris paul 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.700
 so we 'll answer them here 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.780
 how much are you worthy chris paul 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:57.230
 is worthy yeah not bad anyway 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.700
 he sees a good a good little price that makes 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.230
 it's good fun and more of it 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.850
 very good stats away excellent pure and 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.769
 so suddenly I think yes I 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.560
 will replace it with tony parker I 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.500
 let's leave I left amelie 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.560
 lardy so wait for management 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.120
 teams and who by default damien dillard 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.040
 I am watching a little 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.390
 trick because the island heard what is 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:29.450
 well it is he can dunked he is 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:32.419
 pretty much your auras your just do it 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.160
 this perfect attack interception 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.490
 company to ok no wait i'm going 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.640
 switch 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:43.960
 I think I'm here we'll put 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:45.229
 sooner so what are we going to do here is 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.990
 up 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.990
 so damon knock hard hill no I 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.570
 not finished yet I have not finished 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.760
 and then here is chris paul 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.669
 so we had a very good player chris 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.400
 Paul, I 'm really happy to have him 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:04.340
 really very very happy there nothing to 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.669
 to say for the moment finally we had some 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.590
 luck 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.270
 finally so I hope that with the spurs 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.930
 with the same thing why not so 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.550
 to get heavy so we have three 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:20.479
 24 was rather out four elements already 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.400
 ok okay okay okay so that's okay 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.340
 my team then we still see from 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.590
 the mouth but good after the small flat 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.750
 for now it's online 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.610
 I will not be very long after 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.370
 it depends on which team I play 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.680
 but before playing the online mode is going 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.210
 quite simply 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.770
 I expect them to have a workforce 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.270
 a little better but in any case 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.460
 here we had christ paul I am 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.349
 so really happy about this people 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.030
 I hope the little video will have you 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.440
 I'll tell you next time 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.440
 you well and greet people
