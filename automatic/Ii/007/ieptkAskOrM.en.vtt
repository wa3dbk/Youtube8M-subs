00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.939
 Chinese consul? 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.220
 Have you so many people who have not told me that you have so many things? 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.430
 This is a sophisticated espionage 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.100
 The bitch is raised! 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.019
 They don't have a record of this dead man 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.440
 Desavogan 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.100
 Bring him over and let go 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.500
 you call me? 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.240
 Europe, yes, Desavo 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.659
 You have left a series of unsolved mysteries in Madagascar, right? 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.079
 A dead man and a scheming woman, Luli Mei Tang Tang 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.640
 do you know. Maybe one day she can be a good wife, 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.120
 And not so much 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.160
 The headache made me feel very bad. 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.520
 You better be careful 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.360
 Now, now, Li Xiong 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.400
 Didn't you see the logo on my suitcase? 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.380
 Handle with care 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.960
 I am not shopping at the window, Li Xiong 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.400
 You make me wait very impatient 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.160
 I have worked for Tang family for several months. 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.720
 I have nothing! 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.380
 For this, you need to believe me, child 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.900
 The police are getting more and more vicious 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.000
 I know what I'm doing 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.580
 Let me solve this problem in my own way. 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.440
 Nick, itâ€™s great to see you. 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.000
 You are a big liar, my friend. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 You taught me everything 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.200
 Imagine it. You are a detective 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.440
 Surprised everyone will have a secret, right? 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.160
 Don't talk anymore, Gentello is not the time to drink tea. 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.000
 What did you bring to us? 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.820
 I brought some tables and Chinese women stayed in her house. 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.800
 Speaking of secrets, right? 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.600
 You guys use money to buy news, right? 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.640
 I have no energy, you know... 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.080
 I used to work in a casino in Cairo. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.220
 But why don't you do it? 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.850
 I broke the rules of all casinos. 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.055
 Then you may be able to work for us. 

00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:21.300
 Let us talk about it in detail 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.500
 Talk about the plan, De Savoy 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.169
 I hope I have not kept you waiting. 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.739
 This is my boat 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.370
 Is a beauty 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.190
 What do you think of me, Mr. Police? 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.640
 Don't insult me, Mr. Police! 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.760
 you need me! 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.820
 I am Johnny Dragon. 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.580
 You understand wrong, Johnny 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.360
 sorry for disturbance 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.920
 Oh, this is your hat. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.320
 It seems that you have opinions about your informants.
