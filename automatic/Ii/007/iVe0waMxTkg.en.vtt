00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.830
 this video is presented by 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.490
 Obi year 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.030
 injured the city center 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.259
 Once a year offers you like Ovi want Fidelity is Klinkrad 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:12.589
 and much more 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.510
 therefore once a year 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.510
 the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.130
 welcome to the music maybe even if the point EU 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.320
 As he already noticed, we changed the format a bit 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.239
 Back then, the Games com was taken as an opportunity 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.159
 to accommodate all our beloved Alamos in an Olic Flash 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.960
 and he also sees Bernd accordingly decoupling the studio 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.270
 finally in cuddly 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.830
 and via will continue to get started with Vio Web 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.700
 so that more body is not interested he just switch off 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.860
 ABB can offer some misses because who in the end again treats 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.880
 have prepared 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.390
 the topic on the games com what sir Ian was of course was the announcement of 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.120
 Patch 4 points 3 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.700
 it was announced that it holds the Death Star their world 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.250
 and so at least Lotte I will not graduate for Qatar Klesen 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.390
 Of course it was also so that Renoir connects against the ICE could del 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.999
 should graduate 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.909
 but you can lose even so we can be sure 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.430
 It does not matter if it's the last bet instance hungover 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.499
 Nevertheless, we are looking forward to it 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.829
 One should be in the fight with Deathwing on his back 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.040
 fight 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.160
 We are very curious about what that will look like and we are still coming 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.990
 3 5 times instances 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.099
 one of which will be in the caves of the time so HDZ 5 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.099
 and it's supposed to be in the style of war 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.859
 the puzzle surrounding the screenshot with the three astral ones some time ago 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.030
 By the way, it has been solved 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.580
 this is a new feature that goes well with four points 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.940
 The Wreath Moppel celebration will change the look of your business 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.639
 parts 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.779
 and you can give your current time to look like an older animal 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:32.539
 September 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:36.439
 only the optics are changing this and the ladder is not wearing it 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.979
 of course unchanged 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:42.100
 for the whole accumulation of the nine objects there is also more storage space 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.240
 at the Astra with the name Voigt Storage you can say said items 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.240
 However, this will cost you a bit of money 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.239
 And in PvP, the look is the way changed because there are some questions 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.449
 whether you can distinguish who is a good kindergarten or 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.119
 not on the office pc 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:04.329
 Percent yes the appearance remains in PvP also changed the developer my opinion 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.809
 you're more likely to handkes percent of health-so you work 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.239
 is how good someone Active Plus 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.780
 another feature 4 4 ​​points 3 is the red prevent he finds for you 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:19.689
 Similar to the clubs next to it then guys a red everything they have to 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.900
 it's easy to log on, it works like a server 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.300
 even then the seemed to be falling 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.860
 and probably he will also have a function which the ALD lease 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.700
 to coordinate with each other so that you start playing all this to an end 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.139
 can 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.709
 Of course, all of us in Windows can also get our supplements, like Owen 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.230
 Take page there is also the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.209
 Link to the official press conference of Blizzard 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.630
 Finally, congratulations to the chiefs from the server 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.000
 as the second German, the slatted frame will be defeated 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.560
 Of course there was also a press conference on Diablo 3 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.280
 where, inter alia, shot on goal Mosquera was present that is the consul lies 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.219
 designer 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.309
 and that this is also open to speculation and and the developers left us 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:05.129
 knowledge 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.110
 that they want to implement the app only three in any case for the console 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.360
 however, they are currently still in search of programmers and designers 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.190
 for Diablo 3 was also announced a new plays Katz Grad with the 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:19.849
 Name Inferno 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:20.930
 this holds the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.500
 The pro team soon each bag the pieces ready and is just higher than 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.949
 the difficulty levels normal nightmare and hell 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.729
 the items available there are just available in the mode and 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.659
 also visually differ from others as serious 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:40.179
 Inferno is available for Level 60 characters and is the maximum 

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.379
 Strengthen opponents 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.389
 depending on the level of difficulty can also do 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.469
 MRE of different quality levels can be found 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.419
 that the beta to Diablo 3 started no later than the end of September 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.570
 was also announced 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.380
 and that a constant online access is required while playing 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.490
 IEEE already invited to the press conference on Wednesday 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.730
 we assumed that priest from Georg Republic 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.610
 could burst a bomb 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.110
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, it was disappointed there were no big ones 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.229
 Announcements Försterhaus Biotyper lied, however, got a look 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.879
 in one in Regensburg the live was played 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.879
 and there was a lot to a PvP Euro from like that 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:25.870
 In our care Rieks from the Old Republic but you always learn the 

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:27.220
 News about the game 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.610
 There you will also find an interview with the Games 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.569
 with Immanuel Lösing Key Daimler so much loves this revenue 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.210
 And yes you to the beta, there are no new - except for that in Europe 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.439
 not started yet 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:45.049
 and in general, the worshipers should be expanded at the moment to know more 

00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:47.799
 we do not yet and if we know it, of course, even if in the 

00:05:47.799 --> 00:05:49.029
 EU points 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:53.279
 Although Guild Wars 2 had a very live stream 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.460
 which is very viewer friendly and where you look at other developers an example 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.580
 However, it should be noted that not much info for Guild Wars 2 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.560
 only a new battlefield that is called Lauf Kilo came 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.369
 and percent that seems to be very interesting that an angled reaching 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:15.809
 with narrow streets many height differences tunnels and buildings 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:19.599
 and it can also be objects and entire buildings on the battlefield 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:21.159
 to destroy 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:25.739
 yes but the content of what then again to Guild Wars 2 it 

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:30.050
 Only the Lotto's Beautiful Number has a third Guild Wars 2 book 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.120
 announced that the goal Ziels dissuades 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.930
 Year to Terra was announced a new feature the whole surrounding area itself 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.300
 self invasion 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.250
 Basically it is a continent or an island where multiple servers at once 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.110
 can fight each other 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.900
 and yes that was it again to TERA 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.550
 the surprise of the games came naturally because testers 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.319
 just take VEO VEO and put it in a bowl with Disney 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:58.960
 comes out because sda 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.900
 one way or the other you can remove the new micro from the house so often 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.050
 imagine 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.189
 The whole thing is being developed by Carbine Studios 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:11.330
 it gives up the conventional in the ear and is refreshingly different and fuller 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.219
 sarcasm 

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:15.300
 The GAL sill definitely makes you want more 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:18.330
 and there were more at Games com 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.770
 although the game is still in a very early stage of development 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.680
 you could already set foot in the worlds Nexus is now first 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.069
 Make gaming experiences 

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:30.380
 Be sure to watch the trailer for it's really funny 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.870
 and if you like it then check out the gameplay video 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.110
 Of course, you can find all links to this video below 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.930
 that was the way Flash we say goodbye to a new week 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.279
 Until next time
