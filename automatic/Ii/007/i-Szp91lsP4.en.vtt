00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:09.900
 I hope they are very good especially 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:13.999
 better than him but here in halo 4 the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.999
 game here 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.030
 x 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.710
 as you can see there is a red objective 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.240
 on the radar the brand that is the last 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.730
 enemy 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.230
 but if you look closely you should make a 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.530
 little more 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.280
 there you can see it better 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:41.320
 what but it is a green ball 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.320
 bright an energy ball 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.690
 so they can see better 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.019
 and well, if you mark what enemies there are 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.400
 that killing him shot him as they see does not happen 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.640
 nothing 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.030
 we send to others not 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.329
 nothing is happening either 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.659
 and I'm playing here in Spartans 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.700
 is episode 4 of chapter 8 good 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.220
 episode 8 of chapter 4 the fourth 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.830
 mission is acting with other types 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.600
 here in life but because it does not leave us 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.940
 advance the mission they have already abandoned 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.970
 the baker's chest 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.050
 Well, let's try to see with 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.050
 I'll see what happens 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.060
 how beautiful the grid is marking me 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.580
 who is an enemy 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.550
 but nothing happens 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.870
 and you can see it 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:40.120
 it is very very strange the truth 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.120
 I could not learn my video capture 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.460
 when with hdmi and if you change components 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.290
 the console reboots 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.040
 but here as you can see there are more 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.040
 close up 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.170
 it is very very strange the truth 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.549
 I have not seen anyone who has happened to 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.460
 past 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.220
 leave it in the comments please 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.390
 also share this video that then 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.850
 wall street 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.350
 blige 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:15.400
 however you want to fire but not 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.400
 I have seen anyone 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.580
 Well that was all for today but if 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.670
 know what to see but to see if also 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.470
 it is step also if to see we will see more 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.470
 closely the point because once 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.410
 here and let me focus my webcam 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.050
 I do not have to do 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.050
 there is also with enemy brand with 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.640
 the gun 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.640
 this is very weird 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.860
 the online video of comments on what 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.430
 they think it 's this energy being 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.230
 I do not have the chance, take care 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.230
 take jorge change and it was 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.610
