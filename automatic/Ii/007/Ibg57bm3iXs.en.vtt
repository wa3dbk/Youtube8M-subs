00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.790
 hello many times when we have 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.379
 pets we find ourselves with the dilemma 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.570
 If we do not want to use products 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.280
 toxic chemicals with them that they do not 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.189
 we know what to do to help them 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.529
 prevent and protect them from these 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.059
 insects like fleas ticks 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.329
 mosquitoes today we are going to learn how to make 

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:26.579
 a natural spray repellent of these 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.619
 insects a spray made with oils 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.649
 essential it is very important that you have 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.940
 in mind that this spray is not going to be 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.129
 useful for another pet other than the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.050
 dog of course cats or others 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.840
 animals are very sensitive to oils 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.060
 essential and could be harmful to 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.860
 they worry a lot of people too 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.280
 when your animals carry these 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.690
 toxic products insect repellents 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.850
 the effect it may have on children 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.620
 of house that they play with them that they touch 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.510
 the hair constantly touching in the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.820
 neck which are the areas where they are 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.530
 applied these toxics and that in the long run 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.890
 they are not good for animals and 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.680
 much less for 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.809
 first of all we would need 35 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.540
 milliliters of denatured alcohol the 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.600
 normal alcohol that they sell in 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.610
 the pharmacies for our medicine cabinet if 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.530
 someone does not want to use alcohol can 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.810
 use water instead what happens 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.700
 which is that the water does not mix with the 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.830
 essential oils as well as alcohol 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.570
 yes that water does not so 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.119
 you will have to shake very well the 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.240
 container before applying it to your 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.409
 dog 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.439
 once we have the 35 ml of alcohol in 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.830
 We will add an opaque glass container 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.460
 40 drops of essential oil from the tree 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.680
 of tea 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:48.980
 30 drops of citronella essential oil 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.980
 30 drops of lavender essential oil 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:58.399
 ten drops of cedar essential oil 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.350
 and another ten drops of essential oil of 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.490
 lemon grass 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.750
 and another 10 drops of essential oil of 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.210
 geranium 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.369
 we put all this mixture and shake 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.380
 well in an opaque glass container that 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.420
 is going to be where we will keep it in a 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.790
 dark room that does not give light 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.800
 directly once we have this 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.180
 put in the package you see that I do not 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.770
 I'm doing here live with 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.020
 you to save time because if 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.240
 it would not take us too long 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.310
 video once we have mixed the alcohol 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.470
 and the essential oils in the container 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.730
 where we will save it, we will add it 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.040
 15 milliliters of water of lavender water 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.800
 of the band is an aromatic water which 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.470
 you get when you extract the oils 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.020
 essentials by steam distillation 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.390
 extra in this water that is a water with a 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.830
 Very mild aroma that also has many 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.239
 of the medicinal properties of the 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.580
 plant but that is a type of water 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.860
 distilled that holds enough time 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.570
 then we can take 15 milliliters of 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.700
 we find this water in many 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.350
 herbalists but if you do not find the 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.330
 water of the band because 15 milliliters 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.209
 you can add it simply from a 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.780
 lavender infusion that would serve equal 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.490
 although it is not the same as the similar ones 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.020
 once we have the product already 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.120
 definitive in our bottle of 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.980
 Dark glass will be advisable to leave it 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.510
 rest for a few hours for example 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.300
 all night so that the aromas are 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.280
 agree in my case I like to spend it and 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.550
 passing it little by little to a little bottle 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.050
 of dark glass that I recycle to go 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.580
 adapting the amount that I'm going 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.440
 needing and so this little bottle 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.540
 I can take on the street and take the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.760
 spray on the street to my dog ​​and so not 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.830
 it's so strong because applying it in 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.170
 a closed environment the animals have 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.709
 the smell very sensitive and nothing else 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.090
 apply it can be a bit strong 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.580
 tell you that you can also use it 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.380
 by way of prevention with a collar if 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.440
 you have a cotton necklace you can get wet 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.380
 the cotton dog collar in this 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.420
 in this solution and once it is dry it 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.940
 you put it on your neck and for several 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.580
 days as soon as you see that you are losing the 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.500
 smell then go back to proceed the same 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.380
 to wet it again and let it dry and 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.120
 you put it on the other hand important not 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.430
 You must use this if your dog 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.140
 have some kind of problem of 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.090
 epilepsy 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.100
 and also comment that if you did not have 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.160
 some of these essential oils 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.680
 you can compensate for example if not 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.780
 you have lemon grass but yes you have 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.760
 cedar then instead of 10 drops of cedar 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.760
 for example you can take 20 drops of 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.350
 Cedar can be complementing the form 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.919
 to apply it is very simple several 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.000
 counter-grain sprays 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.100
 preferably do it in one place 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.810
 ventilated or better if it is before leaving to 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.290
 the street once a day during the 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.060
 times when there is danger of 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.800
 parasites and you can do several 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.210
 sprays for example one behind 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.810
 of the neck in the area of ​​the shoulder blades 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.970
 a couple over the back and you can 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.190
 wet your hands with a little bit of 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.400
 liquid and passes jce against the grain 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.950
 by the legs it is very very important that 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.570
 protect jce the eyes the nose the mouth and 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.700
 the inside of your ears 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.180
 dog of this product because you could 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.180
 hurt 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.180
 In addition to this spray there are many things 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.009
 what can we do and some of the 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.840
 tricks that are simple one of them 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.210
 the simplest of all is to add 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.120
 Brewer's yeast to feed 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.740
 of the animal the brewer's yeast is the 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.169
 dietary supplement that they sell in 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.330
 many herbalists we will only have 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.919
 to add between half a teaspoon and one 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.590
 tablespoon a day more or less 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.780
 depending on the size of the animal in its 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.539
 feeder and then we will use or 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.860
 we can use an oil that comes from 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.449
 the india that is the neem oil 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.509
 traditionally used in the 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.849
 ayurveda to help cleanse that hair 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.520
 before bathing him we will give him a massage 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.770
 for all the hair of the animal throughout the 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.530
 animal skin before the bath this 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.210
 oil as well as insect repellent and 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.759
 to help you eliminate any insect 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.849
 that has helps you also to treat if 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:03.279
 have a skin problem for 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.870
 bites and etcetera once we have 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.669
 given the massage with oil we have to 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.680
 simply proceed to wash the animal 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.420
 as we usually do with a 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.640
 neutral soap and in the last rinse 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.830
 When we are going to dry it, we will do it 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.380
 with water to which we will add a trickle 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.300
 of apple cider vinegar the proportion more 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.340
 or less can be for a liter and 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.850
 half of water half a cup of vinegar 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.790
 Other good I present my dog ​​candy
