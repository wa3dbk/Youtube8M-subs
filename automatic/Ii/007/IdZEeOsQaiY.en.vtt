00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
you can see so I'm not sure the game

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.190 
you can see so I'm not sure the game
play<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.180> doesn't<00:01:12.479> give<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.720> an<00:01:12.810> indication

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.289 
play it doesn't give you an indication
of<00:01:13.500> how<00:01:13.950> many<00:01:14.010> levels<00:01:14.400> there<00:01:14.729> are<00:01:14.790> I'm<00:01:15.150> going

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
of how many levels there are I'm going

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.530 
of how many levels there are I'm going
to<00:01:15.390> assume<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.840> endless<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.619> my<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.180> idea

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
to assume it's endless is my is the idea

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.210 
to assume it's endless is my is the idea
I<00:01:18.659> think

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.490 

as<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:25.880> can<00:01:26.030> see<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.420> takes<00:01:26.900> a<00:01:27.020> little<00:01:27.200> bit<00:01:27.409> of

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
as you can see you takes a little bit of

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.289 
as you can see you takes a little bit of
skill<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:28.040> make<00:01:28.159> sure<00:01:28.430> you<00:01:28.549> launch<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:29.090> pie

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
skill to make sure you launch that pie

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.600 
skill to make sure you launch that pie
at<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.509> right<00:01:29.780> time<00:01:30.080> once<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:31.250> get<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.580> a

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
at the right time once you get to a

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.580 
at the right time once you get to a
certain<00:01:31.850> point<00:01:32.240> another<00:01:32.689> level<00:01:32.990> will<00:01:33.259> occur

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
certain point another level will occur

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.700 
certain point another level will occur
and<00:01:33.860> you<00:01:34.159> will<00:01:34.280> get<00:01:34.369> a<00:01:34.430> different<00:01:34.640> powerup<00:01:35.330> but
