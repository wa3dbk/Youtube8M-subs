00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
parallel lines you know a parallel line

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.599 
parallel lines you know a parallel line
from<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:42.960> side<00:00:43.199> to<00:00:43.229> the<00:00:43.379> other<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.429> many

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
from one side to the other and so many

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.129 
from one side to the other and so many
rumors<00:00:44.909> tend<00:00:45.299> to<00:00:45.359> leave<00:00:45.479> it<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:45.899> heavy

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:46.139 
rumors tend to leave it really heavy

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:50.090 
rumors tend to leave it really heavy
over<00:00:46.889> the<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:48.600> back<00:00:48.809> skull<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:49.889> it<00:00:50.010> gets

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
over the the back skull and then it gets

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.770 
over the the back skull and then it gets
really<00:00:50.399> narrow<00:00:50.639> towards<00:00:51.089> the<00:00:51.179> front<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.659> if

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
really narrow towards the front and if

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.119 
really narrow towards the front and if
you<00:00:51.870> look<00:00:52.049> at<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.199> right<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:52.469> from<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.949> back

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
you look at it right now from the back

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.799 
you look at it right now from the back
you<00:00:53.339> can<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.519> that<00:00:53.850> she's<00:00:54.089> she's<00:00:54.510> really

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
you can see that she's she's really

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.509 
you can see that she's she's really
narrow<00:00:55.019> here<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.499> then<00:00:55.589> she<00:00:55.739> gets<00:00:55.889> wide<00:00:56.129> here

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
narrow here and then she gets wide here

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:57.799 
narrow here and then she gets wide here
so<00:00:56.639> that's<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:56.999> thing<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.299> want<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> correct

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
