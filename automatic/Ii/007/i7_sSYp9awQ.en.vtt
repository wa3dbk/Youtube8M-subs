for<00:00:50.550> animals<00:01:00.379> let's<00:01:01.379> try<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:01.920> more<00:01:02.010> time

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
for animals let's try it one more time

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:14.149 
for animals let's try it one more time
let's<00:01:04.650> try<00:01:04.979> three<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:13.439> what<00:01:13.619> would<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.920> push

we're not gonna keep going we're going
to<00:01:31.939> go<00:01:32.939> define<00:01:33.420> mode<00:01:34.369> find<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> analyst<00:01:35.880> says

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
to go define mode find the analyst says

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.940 
to go define mode find the analyst says
ribbit<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.290> would<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> little
