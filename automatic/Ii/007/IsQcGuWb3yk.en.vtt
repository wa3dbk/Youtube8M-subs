 tell us what is happening here good 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.260
 that we are going to do the review of this 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.859
 figure that I thought of a magnitude 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.050
 colosal aja as was felipe with 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.090
 us he is a great collector and 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.880
 quite very very fan of batman al 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.880
 just like me haha that this figure me 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.190
 it seemed like an amazing thing we are 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.529
 talking about the batman michael keaton not 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.050
 There cortitos 18in the mica 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.670
 batman of leafy lips this 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.670
 figure was announced already makes some 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.300
 time how great this size and the 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.910
 so large scale 12 inches 18 18 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.220
 inches 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.590
 there are many figures previously in this 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.350
 scale but never with such good detail 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.540
 like what you are doing now nec has 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.760
 aimed at taking the licenses of several 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.220
 franchises like marvel as you wish 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.739
 predator movies of aller is 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.690
 opportunist is a sample of what 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.339
 are doing lately for the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.380
 fans of those great 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.290
 franchises to detail is amazing 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:17.850
 really when bringing the camera closer a 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.950
 a little bit seems to have been in 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.990
 the face sculpted with the mask on 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.350
 stuck above the back that 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.350
 that 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.609
 ask a little bit our dear friend 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.990
 how do I say what is the story of 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:36.620
 is figured how it reaches your arm when 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.520
 wait for the figure 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.250
 he said first after a picture comes 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.539
 well it came out I really did not know the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.539
 magnitude of the size I had 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.970
 by the size is the largest figure 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.030
 let's say it would be the central figure in 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.750
 all the show the figure that you 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.500
 I say in the jewel of Microsoft 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:09.260
 in the detail of the armor the detail 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.260
 from the head of the cloth layer 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.180
 we are talking about an average figure 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.010
 of 4 inches is pretty much this good 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.780
 and true 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.440
 of 5 inches 7 inches 19 inches already 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.970
 12 inches is more or less up to 5 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.100
 12 - predator action a predator 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.020
 it gets to be the size so until the 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.300
 shoulder of this figure because its size 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.110
 of scale creates version and does not come with 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.080
 interchangeable human accessories has 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.209
 has on the rope has looks but up 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.370
 of the army here is deployable 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.040
 will raise is deployable and this weapon is 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.570
 removable as in the movie one of 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.810
 the most impressive things in this 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.550
 issue of the the bati belt as well 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.709
 that the movie places the 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.220
 artifacts there is great 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.490
 then place him here and this 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.320
 here just as in the movie is what 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.610
 maximum and it is also impressive the 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.050
 amount of squats you should do 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.540
 batman 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.540
 well , the two parts are removed 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.580
 they arm themselves like in the movie also the 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.510
 Batarang can be folded and deployed 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.510
 like in the movie 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.130
 I mean, I 've seen other figures 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.860
 You can make your jo toys sectors in 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.440
 question of costs this figure already has 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.710
 a big difference such a figure can 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.410
 cost more or less between 300 to 500 soles 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.470
 more or less on average while a 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.990
 factor can cost then from 800 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.460
 friends being cost 1500 soles and 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.590
 really the global votes but 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.280
 if we take a look at what would come to 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:59.420
 be the detail of the making of the 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.820
 figure the realism has not reached up 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.030
 comes with these bars to put you in 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:09.070
 hands that lift like wings 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.070
 if it is the most authentic 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:16.160
 this figure can can be like to 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.989
 those who can not afford it because it is a 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.940
 Spending really hard rotors this is 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.639
 a very good option because they do not have 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.060
 nothing to envy those figures as 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.490
 those of those between 20 or those of 6 sow is 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.620
 of doctors who are very, very good 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.169
 but that these are also very limited 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.570
 they are a little more massive but it has a 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:39.979
 detail so but as serious as I leave 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.440
 toys I think it's worth the 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.750
 people pay attention to these figures 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.009
 the amount of things that are taking out 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.810
 now nk to expand the universe as 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.639
 so that you can have a universe in 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.440
 the same scale or for not being 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.389
 very similar proportions woman already what 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.669
 maximum to have a michelle pfeiffer like that 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.639
 the ideal size of lordship and the 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:05.690
 presentation is well the packaging is well 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:09.289
 dark with the character's sample the 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:13.069
 detail of the texture of the suit 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:14.689
 the hands I really did not have a singer 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.960
 by this figure when they were announced 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.430
 until I'm waiting for my michael 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.360
 keaton in three three quarters 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.360
 I hope soon 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.449
 just in case you have to promote your 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:31.610
 movie is not great data are passed 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.279

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.189
