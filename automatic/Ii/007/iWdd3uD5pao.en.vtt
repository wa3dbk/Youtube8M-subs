00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
caster what I have here is I have a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.890 
caster what I have here is I have a
Duquette<00:00:19.619> medium<00:00:20.580> action<00:00:20.760> rod<00:00:21.210> it's<00:00:21.600> their

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
Duquette medium action rod it's their

Duquette medium action rod it's their
casting<00:00:22.350> rod<00:00:23.029> got<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> fairly<00:00:24.330> good<00:00:24.449> tip<00:00:24.840> I

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
casting rod got a fairly good tip I

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.160 
casting rod got a fairly good tip I
think<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> guess<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:26.070> probably<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.430> faster

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
think I guess that's probably a faster

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.480 
think I guess that's probably a faster
it's<00:00:28.170> about<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.380> fast<00:00:28.650> tip<00:00:28.920> maybe<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.250> little<00:00:29.400> bit

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
it's about a fast tip maybe a little bit

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.770 
it's about a fast tip maybe a little bit
a<00:00:29.519> little<00:00:29.789> bit<00:00:29.970> lighter<00:00:30.630> than<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.070> but<00:00:32.070> um

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
a little bit lighter than that but um

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.950 
a little bit lighter than that but um
it's<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:35.280> choice<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:36.000> v<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.540> fishing

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
it's a it's my choice for v for fishing

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.869 
it's a it's my choice for v for fishing
either<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.260> fluke<00:00:37.620> or<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> trick<00:00:38.070> worm<00:00:38.309> one

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
either a fluke or a trick worm one

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.190 
either a fluke or a trick worm one
because<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.300> got<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> backbone<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.050> needs

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
because it's got the backbone it needs

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.510 
because it's got the backbone it needs
to<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.350> able<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> set<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> hook<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
to be able to set the hook and it is and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.770 
to be able to set the hook and it is and
it's<00:00:44.520> got<00:00:44.700> enough<00:00:44.940> whip<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.600> able<00:00:45.690> to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
it's got enough whip in it to be able to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.720 
it's got enough whip in it to be able to
cast<00:00:46.020> these<00:00:46.200> light<00:00:46.469> baits<00:00:46.710> now<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> tricky<00:00:47.489> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
cast these light baits now the tricky is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.910 
cast these light baits now the tricky is
or<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> trick<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.750> developed<00:00:49.260> over<00:00:49.379> over

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
or the trick that I developed over over

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.500 
or the trick that I developed over over
trial<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.430> error<00:00:50.579> believe<00:00:51.059> me<00:00:51.180> there's<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> lot

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
trial and error believe me there's a lot

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.470 
trial and error believe me there's a lot
more<00:00:51.660> error<00:00:51.870> than<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.350> trial<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.399> um<00:00:53.579> was

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
more error than it was trial but um was

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.170 
more error than it was trial but um was
instead<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:56.340> see<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:56.520> I'm<00:00:56.640> back<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:57.059> and

show you guys just I'll just step over
here<00:00:59.300> you<00:01:00.300> know<00:01:00.390> when<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.750> normally<00:01:01.109> cast

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
here you know when you normally cast

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.369 
here you know when you normally cast
something<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.430> fishing<00:01:03.090> rod<00:01:03.899> usually

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
something out of a fishing rod usually

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.760 
something out of a fishing rod usually
have<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.650> know<00:01:04.769> 10<00:01:05.129> 12<00:01:05.689> 15<00:01:06.689> inches<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.290> line

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
have you know 10 12 15 inches of line

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.859 
have you know 10 12 15 inches of line
hanging<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> end<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:08.820> rod<00:01:09.030> okay

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
hanging out of the end of your rod okay

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.830 
hanging out of the end of your rod okay
well<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.610> found<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.720> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
well what I found out that is if you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.260 
well what I found out that is if you
lengthen<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.590> distance<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.549> about<00:01:14.850> 30

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
lengthen that distance to about 30

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.990 
lengthen that distance to about 30
inches<00:01:15.540> about<00:01:15.990> like<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:17.400> makes<00:01:17.700> this

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
inches about like that it makes this

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.600 
inches about like that it makes this
technique<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.840> casting<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.409> lot<00:01:19.650> easier<00:01:20.159> okay

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
technique of casting a lot easier okay

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.230 
technique of casting a lot easier okay
so<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:23.400> second<00:01:23.820> part<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
so and then the second part of this

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.719 
so and then the second part of this
technique<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:25.100> you're<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> want<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
technique is you're going to want to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.240 
technique is you're going to want to
instead<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> whipping<00:01:28.500> cast<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.070> do

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
instead of the whipping cast that you do

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.490 
instead of the whipping cast that you do
with<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> jig<00:01:30.600> or<00:01:30.780> anything<00:01:31.020> else<00:01:31.290> or

with a with a jig or anything else or
the<00:01:31.619> two-handed<00:01:32.100> cast<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:33.000> want<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.450> be

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the two-handed cast you want this to be

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.609 
the two-handed cast you want this to be
a<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.930> handed<00:01:34.549> cut<00:01:35.549> my<00:01:35.759> trolling<00:01:36.150> motor<00:01:36.390> on
