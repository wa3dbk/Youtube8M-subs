00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.140 
moments i would say probably the most
memorable<00:01:55.750> was<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:59.380> first<00:01:59.620> episode<00:02:00.150> just

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
memorable was the first episode just

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.920 
memorable was the first episode just
seeing<00:02:01.450> them<00:02:01.690> in<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.290> very<00:02:02.590> first<00:02:03.840> when<00:02:04.840> they

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
seeing them in that very first when they

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.980 
seeing them in that very first when they
do<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.229> unripe<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:06.340> unravel<00:02:06.940> with<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.750> hood

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
do the unripe the unravel with the hood

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.919 
do the unripe the unravel with the hood
it<00:02:08.320> was<00:02:08.560> just<00:02:08.770> that<00:02:09.280> was<00:02:09.520> so<00:02:09.850> like<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.479> essence

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
it was just that was so like the essence

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.140 
it was just that was so like the essence
of<00:02:11.080> who<00:02:11.530> they<00:02:11.680> are<00:02:11.709> kind<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.790> sense

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
of who they are kind of in the sense

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.790 
of who they are kind of in the sense
where<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.810> was<00:02:13.990> that<00:02:14.170> strong<00:02:15.120> determined

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
where it was that strong determined

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.940 
where it was that strong determined
underdog<00:02:17.800> but<00:02:18.700> very<00:02:19.420> confident<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.410> know<00:02:20.530> and

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
underdog but very confident you know and

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.600 
underdog but very confident you know and
and<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:22.770> unraveling<00:02:23.770> of<00:02:23.860> just<00:02:24.160> their<00:02:24.310> beauty

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
and the unraveling of just their beauty

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.890 
and the unraveling of just their beauty
and<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:25.120> think<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.570> in<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:26.320> small<00:02:26.739> little

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
and I think that in a small little

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.080 
and I think that in a small little
moment<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:28.959> time<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.440> kind<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.770> captured<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
moment of time that kind of captured the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.210 
moment of time that kind of captured the
