store this stuff in my club ok I've come

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.030 
store this stuff in my club ok I've come
up<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.360> theory<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:30.930> EA<00:01:31.259> must<00:01:31.680> just

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
up with a theory I think EA must just

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.679 
up with a theory I think EA must just
reduce<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.670> quality<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.150> packs<00:01:33.390> because

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
reduce the quality of packs because

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.210 
reduce the quality of packs because
there's<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.140> many<00:01:34.259> opened<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.100> think

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
there's so many opened if you think

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.340 
there's so many opened if you think
about<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.670> every<00:01:36.420> pack<00:01:36.659> like<00:01:37.079> that's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
about it like every pack like that's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.620 
about it like every pack like that's
opened<00:01:37.799> if<00:01:38.729> there's<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.060> same<00:01:39.210> chance<00:01:39.540> of

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
opened if there's the same chance of

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.850 
opened if there's the same chance of
getting<00:01:39.869> players<00:01:40.049> as<00:01:40.200> normally<00:01:40.590> then<00:01:40.710> there's

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
getting players as normally then there's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039 
getting players as normally then there's
gonna<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.310> many<00:01:41.700> rare<00:01:42.090> players<00:01:42.420> released

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
gonna be so many rare players released

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.289 
gonna be so many rare players released
so<00:01:43.590> I'm<00:01:43.680> guessing<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.640> really<00:01:44.880> like

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
so I'm guessing they do just really like

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.700 
so I'm guessing they do just really like
reduce<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.899> chance<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.290> getting<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.560> good

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
reduce the chance of getting a good

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.160 
reduce the chance of getting a good
player<00:01:47.329> during<00:01:48.329> team<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> year<00:01:48.960> which<00:01:49.140> is
