here and if you're unfamiliar with
Golding<00:01:08.310> trucks<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:09.210> kind<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.509> got<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:10.710> two

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
Golding trucks it's kind of got like two

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
Golding trucks it's kind of got like two
hanger<00:01:11.880> or<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.270> two<00:01:12.420> hanger<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
hanger or not two hanger like a to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.380 
hanger or not two hanger like a to
kingpin<00:01:13.619> setup<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.520> you've<00:01:14.640> got<00:01:14.759> one<00:01:14.939> kingpin

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
kingpin setup so you've got one kingpin

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.570 
kingpin setup so you've got one kingpin
here<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:16.229> kingpin<00:01:16.619> stacked<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.130> top<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.340> that

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
here one kingpin stacked on top of that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.149 
here one kingpin stacked on top of that
and<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.299> allows<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.860> one

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and so it allows it to do is one one

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.069 
and so it allows it to do is one one
kingpin<00:01:20.610> kind<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.970> stops<00:01:21.210> engaging<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.869> other

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
kingpin kind of stops engaging the other

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.230 
kingpin kind of stops engaging the other
one<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.470> engage<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:23.040> they<00:01:23.400> work<00:01:23.579> together<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
one can engage or they work together and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.749 
one can engage or they work together and
it<00:01:24.329> just<00:01:24.360> creates<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:24.869> unique<00:01:25.829> turning

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it just creates a really unique turning

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.429 
it just creates a really unique turning
experience<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.720> make<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.140> tight

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
experience so you can make really tight

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.950 
experience so you can make really tight
turns<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.040> carve<00:01:29.610> super<00:01:30.000> hard<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
turns and carve super hard and then the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.950 
turns and carve super hard and then the
wheels<00:01:31.140> you've<00:01:31.590> got<00:01:31.770> 72<00:01:32.369> millimeter<00:01:32.820> 78<00:01:33.720> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
wheels you've got 72 millimeter 78 a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.539 
wheels you've got 72 millimeter 78 a
arbor<00:01:34.759> bio<00:01:35.759> dura<00:01:36.299> Thane<00:01:36.600> wheels<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.549> inside

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
arbor bio dura Thane wheels and inside

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.910 
arbor bio dura Thane wheels and inside
of<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.700> some<00:01:39.329> ABEC<00:01:39.659> 5<00:01:39.689> bearings<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
of that some ABEC 5 bearings so the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.679 
of that some ABEC 5 bearings so the
wheels<00:01:41.070> are<00:01:41.220> gonna<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.640> super<00:01:41.970> grippy<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.540> when

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
wheels are gonna be super grippy so when

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.969 
wheels are gonna be super grippy so when
you<00:01:42.750> are<00:01:42.840> making<00:01:42.990> those<00:01:43.229> really<00:01:43.470> hard<00:01:43.770> turns

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
you are making those really hard turns

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.709 
you are making those really hard turns
your<00:01:44.520> board's<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:45.030> slipping<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
your board's not slipping out and

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.590 
your board's not slipping out and
sliding<00:01:46.140> all<00:01:46.229> over<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.530> place<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:48.090> yeah
