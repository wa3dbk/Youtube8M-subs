00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.770
 my family comes then this video 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.840
 today to teach you how to 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.539
 realize the different stages of time 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.460
 so be beautiful with us once 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:23.230
 we applied the moisturizer 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:26.560
 we will come and apply the base so there 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.540
 basmaji boxing and the photo finish it's this 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.760
 which allows makeup to adhere more 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.800
 easily to the skin that's what allows 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.309
 also make-up not to sink and 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.649
 to really hold all day 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.170
 so I do not apply audois in small 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.510
 hazelnut 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.030
 you can also apply it with 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.980
 the foundation brush I 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.930
 prefer to call it what do I prefer the 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.180
 the sensation is much more 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.730
 natural like it is very good on 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.440
 the whole face and we insist 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.840
 on this area though since in general 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.340
 this is the area where we tend to 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.110
 to have small redness of small 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.479
 imperfections 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.219
 once we add the base 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.639
 I'm going to camouflage a little bit 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:15.100
 my imperfections the dark circles that I have there 

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:17.259
 with my anti dark circles my anti dark circles 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.030
 has left the smell of a malware 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.850
 it's the two mediums so what I like 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.670
 Well, it's a little foam tip 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.130
 like this one so that's easy to 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:36.329
 so apply there I have a little 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.329
 imperfection up in camouflage 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:49.350
 always tapping to get dressed 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.380
 the material we are going to camouflage the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.380
 dark circles 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:59.640
 I'm going to tap also you can 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.399
 same and with the anti-dark circles on the fingers or 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.090
 with the brush 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:08.670
 be careful not to put too much 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.509
 otherwise it can make streaks as well 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.509
 to spread it well 1 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.590
 so when you really have to do it 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.459
 notice you can also mounted 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.980
 to the top in this area there we go 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.319
 switch to applying thyme so the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.030
 up foundation 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.280
 so my background including his announcement and 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.310
 flax like visionary thyme number 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.650
 What I'm applying with my brush is 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.870
 safe dish based not I will come 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.450
 place a small hazelnut on the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:49.049
 punch could also apply it 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:51.569
 either on the hand these are the brush and 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.780
 there you will come to drop the material 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.109
 in the middle and you will pull towards the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.109
 Outside 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.610
 it's always faces when we 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.520
 makeup it's true that it's not 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.940
 always easy to choose its hue 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.980
 function of his complexion and to yield 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.290
 you really have to look at the level of 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.570
 the color of his skin sonates the plateau 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.540
 we to have rather pink skin is 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.750
 rather golden you really have to follow the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.830
 same color as his skin so we spread 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.070
 well you also have brushes 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.620
 which are really round and heavyweight 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.120
 flat which allows to spread to make 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.300
 rounding is sometimes easier 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.280
 also for some people 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:55.140
 I prefer this brush here the brush 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:55.140
 dish is well push the wick 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.159
 you are careful not Mathieu's 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.840
 eyebrows other than I would like them to me 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.840
 wizard scholar game 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.569
 it's over for not doing it now 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.190
 must then powdered and powder why 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.220
 because that's what makes it possible 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.259
 adhere the liquid material from the bottom of 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.479
 complexion since if you stop at these 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.340
 tables and tape the bar whose bottom 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.259
 complexion does not hold all day 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.000
 if you have involved your base that 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.090
 it's a pretty liquid material 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.210
 if you can not go over it 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.710
 will not fix my powder to me this is the 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.139
 terracotta light number three this is the 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.990
 mist is seeing there a few small 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.180
 leagues - light and I'm fine 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.720

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.450
