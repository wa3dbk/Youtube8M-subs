and<00:00:52.790> I<00:00:53.239> believe<00:00:53.480> that<00:00:53.510> lift<00:00:53.930> right<00:00:54.140> there<00:00:54.350> was

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
and I believe that lift right there was

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.299 
and I believe that lift right there was
402<00:00:55.280> pounds<00:00:55.540> good<00:00:56.540> clean<00:00:56.809> pressed<00:00:57.140> by<00:00:57.379> him<00:00:57.650> we

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
402 pounds good clean pressed by him we

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.030 
402 pounds good clean pressed by him we
expect<00:00:59.150> for<00:00:59.269> him<00:00:59.449> to<00:00:59.720> get<00:01:00.140> fired<00:01:00.379> up<00:01:00.620> on<00:01:00.829> meat

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
expect for him to get fired up on meat

day<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.519> press<00:01:02.210> even<00:01:02.540> a<00:01:02.600> little<00:01:02.720> bit<00:01:02.900> more

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
day and press even a little bit more

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.990 
day and press even a little bit more
than<00:01:03.230> that<00:01:03.350> here's<00:01:04.040> Mike<00:01:04.309> Mike<00:01:04.580> was<00:01:04.699> working

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
than that here's Mike Mike was working

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.270 
than that here's Mike Mike was working
on<00:01:05.119> some<00:01:05.360> some<00:01:06.290> doubles<00:01:06.680> for<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:06.950> day<00:01:07.100> and

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
on some some doubles for the day and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.710 
on some some doubles for the day and
then<00:01:07.369> he<00:01:07.430> moved<00:01:07.640> into<00:01:07.850> some<00:01:08.030> singles<00:01:08.509> I

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
then he moved into some singles I

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
then he moved into some singles I
believe<00:01:08.930> that<00:01:09.140> was<00:01:09.289> around<00:01:10.240> 3:45<00:01:11.240> or<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:11.899> Mike

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
believe that was around 3:45 or so Mike

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.590 
believe that was around 3:45 or so Mike
switched<00:01:13.039> benches<00:01:13.610> midway<00:01:14.000> through<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:14.509> that
