think<00:02:33.640> what<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.209> question<00:02:34.540> really<00:02:34.660> should<00:02:34.930> be

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
think what the question really should be

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.570 
think what the question really should be
is<00:02:36.360> hepatitis<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.870> aids<00:02:38.319> are<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.040> two<00:02:39.220> scary

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
is hepatitis and aids are the two scary

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.509 
is hepatitis and aids are the two scary
ones<00:02:39.910> in<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.690> tattoo<00:02:41.019> world<00:02:41.200> mainly<00:02:41.920> hepatitis

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
ones in a tattoo world mainly hepatitis

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.000 
ones in a tattoo world mainly hepatitis
because<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.780> someone<00:02:44.050> has<00:02:44.140> AIDS<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:47.650> someone

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
because if someone has AIDS if someone

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.970 
because if someone has AIDS if someone
has<00:02:48.130> full-blown<00:02:48.720> AIDS<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:50.080> wouldn't<00:02:50.709> tattoo

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
has full-blown AIDS I wouldn't tattoo

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.210 
has full-blown AIDS I wouldn't tattoo
them<00:02:51.160> because<00:02:51.670> they're<00:02:52.049> healing<00:02:53.049> time<00:02:53.440> is

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
them because they're healing time is

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.100 
them because they're healing time is
going<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.430> be<00:02:54.489> ridiculous<00:02:55.120> they<00:02:55.720> could<00:02:55.870> get<00:02:55.989> an

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
going to be ridiculous they could get an

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.289 
going to be ridiculous they could get an
infection<00:02:56.459> because<00:02:57.459> they're<00:02:57.910> not<00:02:58.000> able<00:02:58.150> to

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
infection because they're not able to

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.660 
infection because they're not able to
heal<00:02:58.510> as<00:02:58.660> well<00:02:59.040> you<00:03:00.040> could<00:03:00.160> literally<00:03:00.549> kill

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
heal as well you could literally kill

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.550 
heal as well you could literally kill
them<00:03:01.090> by<00:03:01.690> tattooing<00:03:02.170> them<00:03:03.600> HIV<00:03:04.600> doesn't<00:03:05.290> scare

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
them by tattooing them HIV doesn't scare

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.160 
them by tattooing them HIV doesn't scare

bloodstream yeah for me to get AIDS that

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.930 
bloodstream yeah for me to get AIDS that
is<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.430> lot<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.000> blood<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.070> we<00:03:33.070> just<00:03:33.609> don't<00:03:33.760> deal

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
is a lot of blood and we just don't deal

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
with that much blood folks and when aids

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.819 
with that much blood folks and when aids
hits<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.790> air<00:03:36.940> when<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.049> virus<00:03:38.230> hits<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.739> air

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
hits the air when the virus hits the air

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.590 
hits the air when the virus hits the air
like<00:03:39.040> if<00:03:39.130> they're<00:03:39.280> bleeding<00:03:39.579> and<00:03:40.299> hits<00:03:40.480> the

like if they're bleeding and hits the
air<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:41.620> does<00:03:41.799> almost<00:03:42.010> immediately<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:42.760> mean<00:03:43.239> it

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
air it does almost immediately I mean it

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.240 
air it does almost immediately I mean it
it's<00:03:43.660> ridiculous<00:03:44.200> so<00:03:44.530> age<00:03:44.709> doesn't<00:03:44.739> scare<00:03:45.190> me

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
it's ridiculous so age doesn't scare me

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.530 
it's ridiculous so age doesn't scare me
at<00:03:45.370> all<00:03:45.489> don't<00:03:45.820> even<00:03:46.000> be<00:03:46.060> worried<00:03:46.269> about<00:03:46.390> that

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
at all don't even be worried about that

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.580 
at all don't even be worried about that
if<00:03:46.660> your<00:03:46.750> tattoo<00:03:47.019> of<00:03:47.109> people<00:03:47.320> with<00:03:47.440> HIV<00:03:47.829> I<00:03:48.070> mean

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
if your tattoo of people with HIV I mean

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.979 
if your tattoo of people with HIV I mean
hiv/aids<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.950> would<00:03:51.549> definitely<00:03:51.970> have<00:03:52.750> them

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
hiv/aids I would definitely have them

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.370 
hiv/aids I would definitely have them
talk<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.230> their<00:03:53.470> doctor<00:03:54.269> I<00:03:55.269> would<00:03:55.959> want<00:03:56.230> some

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
talk to their doctor I would want some

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.140 
talk to their doctor I would want some
kind<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.620> written<00:03:56.829> thing<00:03:57.670> from<00:03:57.850> their<00:03:58.030> doctor

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
kind of written thing from their doctor

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.340 
kind of written thing from their doctor
saying<00:03:58.510> that<00:03:58.630> they're<00:03:58.750> not<00:03:58.840> having<00:03:59.019> healing

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
saying that they're not having healing

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.080 
saying that they're not having healing
problems<00:03:59.680> or<00:04:00.310> that<00:04:00.609> they're<00:04:00.730> going<00:04:00.819> to<00:04:00.910> start

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
problems or that they're going to start

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.330 
problems or that they're going to start
them<00:04:01.299> on<00:04:01.390> an<00:04:01.450> antibiotic<00:04:01.690> because<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.680> would

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
them on an antibiotic because I would

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.580 
them on an antibiotic because I would
really<00:04:03.670> be<00:04:03.880> careful<00:04:04.269> that<00:04:04.750> that's<00:04:05.230> what<00:04:05.380> you

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
really be careful that that's what you

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.710 
really be careful that that's what you
could<00:04:05.739> literally<00:04:06.010> kill<00:04:06.100> someone<00:04:06.549> because<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
could literally kill someone because the

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.000 
could literally kill someone because the
risk<00:04:07.900> of<00:04:08.019> infection<00:04:08.500> on<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.709> is<00:04:08.769> going<00:04:08.889> to<00:04:08.950> be

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
risk of infection on that is going to be

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.830 
risk of infection on that is going to be
way<00:04:09.220> higher<00:04:09.430> something<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.299> would<00:04:10.389> wouldn't

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
way higher something that would wouldn't

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.870 
way higher something that would wouldn't
affect<00:04:11.170> a<00:04:11.350> normal<00:04:11.889> person's<00:04:12.250> immune<00:04:12.430> system

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
affect a normal person's immune system

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.680 
affect a normal person's immune system
when<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:13.870> have<00:04:14.079> an<00:04:14.470> autoimmune<00:04:14.650> deficiency

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
when you have an autoimmune deficiency

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.240 
when you have an autoimmune deficiency
your<00:04:16.690> immune<00:04:16.870> system<00:04:17.019> is<00:04:17.260> fucked<00:04:17.530> so<00:04:17.739> they

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
your immune system is fucked so they

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.219 
your immune system is fucked so they
could<00:04:18.400> get<00:04:18.459> an<00:04:18.580> infection<00:04:18.640> from<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.539> air<00:04:19.930> you

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
could get an infection from the air you

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.039 
could get an infection from the air you
know<00:04:20.470> what<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.590> mean

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
know what I mean

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.119 
know what I mean
I'd<00:04:21.799> be<00:04:21.949> real<00:04:22.099> careful<00:04:22.129> now<00:04:22.720> hepatitis<00:04:23.720> C<00:04:24.139> that

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:25.129 
I'd be real careful now hepatitis C that
