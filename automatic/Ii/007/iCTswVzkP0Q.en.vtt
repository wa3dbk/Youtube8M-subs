00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:16.369
 speech and heavy hard good is good 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.930
 coming to another video and heavy on the video 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.390
 I'm here today bringing a gameplay 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.220
 with one of the new weapons that came 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.109
 third part of the Christmas update 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.810
 which is nothing more or less than the 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.079
 royal bar bring that gun that makes 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.149
 part of the 2nd kit went to the dragon that is 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.430
 our own father and how everyone should 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.250
 to know we already had a kit with m 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.350
 quadram apure and amazonas went to the dragon 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.380
 So now it has come to our prosperity. 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.200
 to him the kit with the belly of an ax 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.540
 that is desert I bring abarth it does not have 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.880
 a lot to comment on her besides her 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.160
 be an excellent weapon since it is a 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.230
 then hand bar is that weapon that 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.690
 you shoot the guy's little finger and 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.210
 You kill him quietly because she 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.900
 takes damage anywhere in the 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.850
 body 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.699
 Then you ask me, it's worth the vote. 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.560
 in her for sure as she says a weapon 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.900
 excellent even she being a little 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.700
 heavy and it continues to be very 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.409
 good because it more at the time so no 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.540
 There are so many reasons why you should stay 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.370
 moving with it is only you find the 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.479
 Your corner and bullet enemies 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.460
 that appear 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.440
 already wants to analyze human joÃ£o vitor by 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.970
 I borrowed the bill thank you very much. 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.610
 by force but it was not worth it together 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.290
 I 'm always playing there the new map 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.170
 which came in the update that is a 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.880
 rock if I remember correctly I was going to do 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.790
 A bad joke is going there. 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.130
 I better then the map found cool 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.470
 but it's not that map I'm going to 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.729
 play as often as you have marked 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.590
 huh 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.380
 so it's definitely going to be a map 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.000
 forgotten in the game unfortunately and heavy 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.690
 to the subject of today that is a little 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.420
 I enjoy 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.130
 there people complain the buzz word 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.110
 three years to post the video when 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.350
 move from parents short video 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.000
 My goodness, to draw out, I do not 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.820
 I will disagree a lot about this because 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.650
 It's really true, I usually bring 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.240
 videos too short for the channel 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.269
 I do not like to bring seen much 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.840
 Long smas relax soon enough 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.630
 will change 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.680
 wait but although today comes 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.359
 good finally we are in 2015 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.939
 joe bob dylan am I had not 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:22.129
 Perceived this is good a few days ago 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:24.379
 the process twins and post a video 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.629
 talking about some news that 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.489
 could roll in the game this year they spoke 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.439
 on a tool to combat 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.230
 hackers did not give many details about 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:35.180
 this is still in the testing phase 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.459
 and they then decided not to speak 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.769
 much about this just speculated 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.409
 not to bring so many expectations if 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.299
 that something wrong but then may be 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.560
 this year our best game in the situation 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.269
 two hackers 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.519
 I hope they better have said a 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.680
 little about the black market of gt that 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.169
 honestly for me it's not so bad 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.659
 in the game since most of the weapons that 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.970
 are black market in other countries 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.889
 I usually get on our crossfire and 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.689
 stay in the store for you simply 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.060
 to buy 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.430
 I know they are not all but some are 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.409
 This happens but yes then I 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.379
 talked about it so it could be that 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.139
 This year we finally have a 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.590
 gblt black market that everyone is 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.599
 dreaming that it arrives in our tracery more 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.590
 so in today's video I wanted to know 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.989
 yours 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.540
 What do you expect from cross fire this? 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.239
 year you imagine hearing new areas 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.430
 vips new maps who knows this year no 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.709
 arrive the desert gray map that everyone 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.099
 know how to demand it would be very 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.930
 hour 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.239
 maybe it will not roll an update to 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.689
 the 2.0 itself 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.220
 Let's not exaggerate, too, maybe 2020 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.769
 Maybe sheik moves to the 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.780
 2015 more people in this branch 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.519
 so I'd like you to leave the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.919
 comments your opinion of what 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.949
 You expect from our crossfire to 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:56.419
 helix year 2015 so that 's it 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.699
