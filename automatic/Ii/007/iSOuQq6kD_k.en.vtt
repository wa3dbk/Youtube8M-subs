00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.019
 a very quick presentation of 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.059
 ontario has utility to show party design 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.440
 me that often times in the citizen 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.559
 catalog then look at a few times 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.839
 videos seen here on youtube 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.729
 I always liked it very much 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.100
 a couple of times about to order the 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.560
 now it has reached me that time 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.350
 I am very happy about that is real 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.850
 nice cnet is technical data and 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.039
 You can find accommodation in the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.630
 Video description is from the design man 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:23.069
 nothing ordinary begins with 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.319
 handles on the back tapering 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.970
 He also has the sword here 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.250
 the widest point and then 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.630
 also very clear to the tip 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.220
 that's somewhat unusual to be 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.799
 I think it's not bad times something 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:45.759
 other small hole lock and as 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.390
 steel we have the as8 the knife is 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.390
 made in Taiwan 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.899
 The clip can be implemented many times 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.580
 As a grip we have again how much that 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.110
 stuff is really really really 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.640
 very stable as well as gc impact resistant 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.489
 abrasion resistant that's just good stuff 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.020
 I find excellent choice for knives 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.489
 with whom he really work much much 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.940
 without wanting to think about it 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.590
 do 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.720
 that is with wood then yes but one 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.000
 other thing that's why I like that 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.810
 really good 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.980
 this page the knife really came 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:33.450
 miraculous wonderful work in the no 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.450
 War game and the blade in the field 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.680
 really drops to live on their own 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.810
 to add oil 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.900
 Great action with the room Prince has me 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.130
 already very much so that's 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.430
 already top if knife comes from the factory 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:57.140
 beautiful cuttings came decently 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.140
 sharp there is still something but is okay 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.550
 The leash makes sure it's tight 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.640
 Here are a few greetings in it can be 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.650
 unlock easily and had quite whole 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.760
 soft really quite desperate sounded 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.760
 and a great sound 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.990
 real real part is also great 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:30.490
 Hands quite wonderful hand there you have 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:32.770
 no problems it's not even something 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.330

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.420

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.670
 not so many folders now that the red 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.460
 one 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.750
 and that's a nice change 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:49.930
 think of the unit porridge a cool blade 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.110
 It works very well with it 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.250
 very decent workmanship all in 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.730

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.370
