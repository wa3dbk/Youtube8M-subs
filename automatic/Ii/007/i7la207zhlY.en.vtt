engine now I've been looking on the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.700 
engine now I've been looking on the
internet<00:00:25.070> for<00:00:25.250> a<00:00:25.310> while<00:00:25.340> and<00:00:26.320> you<00:00:27.320> know<00:00:27.470> I've

the sounds everything else however it
was<00:00:32.119> a<00:00:32.150> little<00:00:32.360> bit<00:00:32.509> of<00:00:32.599> a<00:00:32.660> shock<00:00:32.900> as<00:00:33.050> I'm<00:00:33.200> sure

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
was a little bit of a shock as I'm sure

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.319 
was a little bit of a shock as I'm sure
many<00:00:33.680> people<00:00:33.800> have<00:00:34.130> found<00:00:34.340> to<00:00:35.000> actually

these things anyway with that in mind we
picked<00:00:42.050> ourselves<00:00:42.260> up<00:00:42.800> a<00:00:44.560> Lima<00:00:45.560> engine<00:00:46.100> will

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970

to<00:00:57.260> get<00:00:57.879> ourself<00:00:58.879> an<00:00:59.269> engine<00:01:00.219> which<00:01:01.219> I<00:01:01.609> believe

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
to get ourself an engine which I believe

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.310 
to get ourself an engine which I believe
will<00:01:02.809> be<00:01:02.960> quite<00:01:03.199> suitable<00:01:03.440> for<00:01:03.829> fitting<00:01:04.430> with

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
will be quite suitable for fitting with

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.620 
will be quite suitable for fitting with
DCC<00:01:06.340> decoder<00:01:07.340> equipment<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:08.300> give<00:01:08.420> us<00:01:08.510> a

sound as everything else having having
bought<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.650> engine<00:01:14.680> we<00:01:15.790> had<00:01:16.790> a<00:01:16.820> word<00:01:17.090> for

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
bought the engine we had a word for

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
bought the engine we had a word for
those<00:01:17.510> nice<00:01:17.690> people<00:01:17.720> at<00:01:18.380> digit<00:01:18.890> reins<00:01:19.160> and<00:01:20.350> we

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
those nice people at digit reins and we

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.340 
those nice people at digit reins and we
got<00:01:22.100> for<00:01:22.250> ourselves<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:23.270> equipment<00:01:23.900> that<00:01:24.020> we

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
got for ourselves the equipment that we

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.440 
got for ourselves the equipment that we
will<00:01:24.530> need<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.980> bring<00:01:25.250> this<00:01:25.460> into<00:01:25.700> starting

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
will need to bring this into starting

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.760 
will need to bring this into starting
with<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.840> system<00:01:27.200> itself

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
with the system itself

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.370 
with the system itself
we<00:01:28.700> bought<00:01:29.480> the<00:01:29.870> Dynamis<00:01:30.740> system<00:01:31.220> which

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
we bought the Dynamis system which

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.490 
we bought the Dynamis system which
essentially<00:01:33.380> comes<00:01:34.130> in<00:01:34.430> two<00:01:34.940> components<00:01:35.720> the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
essentially comes in two components the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.120 
essentially comes in two components the
first<00:01:36.770> being<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.750> command<00:01:38.750> station<00:01:39.140> which<00:01:39.890> is

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
first being the command station which is

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.010 
first being the command station which is
this<00:01:40.250> thing<00:01:40.310> here<00:01:40.760> which<00:01:41.060> simply<00:01:41.480> plugs<00:01:41.870> into

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
this thing here which simply plugs into

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.470 
this thing here which simply plugs into
the<00:01:42.260> mains<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.770> in<00:01:43.490> order<00:01:43.760> to<00:01:43.910> make<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.240> work

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
the mains and in order to make it work

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.980 
the mains and in order to make it work
just<00:01:45.340> switch<00:01:46.340> thing<00:01:46.670> on<00:01:49.150> you<00:01:50.150> will<00:01:50.330> notice<00:01:50.840> a

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
just switch thing on you will notice a

control lighting as well so what we've
done<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:54.250> we've<00:02:54.490> popped<00:02:54.820> some<00:02:55.120> LEDs<00:02:56.880> into<00:02:57.880> the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
done is we've popped some LEDs into the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.170 
done is we've popped some LEDs into the
body<00:02:59.050> fill<00:02:59.320> of<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.590> train<00:02:59.860> in<00:03:00.550> order<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.060> we

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
body fill of the train in order that we

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.589 
body fill of the train in order that we
can<00:03:01.300> have<00:03:01.570> some<00:03:01.930> running<00:03:02.320> lights<00:03:04.440> okay

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
can have some running lights okay

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:14.380 
can have some running lights okay
I<00:03:07.549> just<00:03:08.549> brought<00:03:08.909> it<00:03:09.060> back<00:03:09.180> on

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.870 

now<00:03:15.680> controlling<00:03:16.680> controlling<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.610> the

now controlling controlling the the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.420 
now controlling controlling the the
train<00:03:18.720> with<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:18.930> unit<00:03:19.320> is<00:03:19.470> actually<00:03:20.040> very

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
train with this unit is actually very

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.350 
train with this unit is actually very
very<00:03:20.670> simple<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:23.040> first<00:03:23.850> thing<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.210> like

very simple and the first thing I like

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.110 
very simple and the first thing I like
to<00:03:24.480> show<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.720> are<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.140> lights

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
to show you are the lights

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.660 
to show you are the lights
simply<00:03:27.120> pressing<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.960> lights<00:03:28.200> button<00:03:28.680> will

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
simply pressing the lights button will

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
the train the lighting unit is actually

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.090 
the train the lighting unit is actually
directionally<00:03:45.570> dependent<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:46.440> by<00:03:46.680> changing

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
directionally dependent so by changing

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.270 
directionally dependent so by changing
the<00:03:47.190> direction<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.640> train<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:49.920> will

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
the direction of the train that will

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.880 
the direction of the train that will
turn<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.910> red<00:03:51.360> lights<00:03:51.630> on<00:03:51.900> at<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.290> back<00:03:52.470> and

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
turn the red lights on at the back and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.220 
turn the red lights on at the back and
the<00:03:53.010> white<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.460> front<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.480> simply<00:03:55.020> to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
the white of the front and simply to

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.230 
the white of the front and simply to
reverse<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:56.370> change<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.760> direction<00:03:56.910> the

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
reverse you change the direction the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.540 
reverse you change the direction the
train<00:03:57.450> too<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:58.380> by<00:03:58.710> looking<00:03:59.070> at<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.190> light<00:03:59.340> do

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
train too so by looking at the light do

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.220 
train too so by looking at the light do
you<00:03:59.580> always<00:04:00.120> know<00:04:00.420> which<00:04:00.600> way<00:04:00.780> it's<00:04:00.930> going<00:04:01.080> to

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
you always know which way it's going to

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.630 
you always know which way it's going to
go<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:03.060> decoder<00:04:04.130> which<00:04:05.130> is<00:04:05.340> what<00:04:05.490> I've

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
go the decoder which is what I've

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.790 
go the decoder which is what I've
installed<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.300> into<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:06.870> into<00:04:07.380> this<00:04:07.410> train

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
installed and into this into this train

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.760 
installed and into this into this train
controls<00:04:08.340> everything<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.200> through<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.230> series

you<00:04:15.060> can<00:04:15.300> you<00:04:15.540> can<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:16.049> can<00:04:16.260> tell<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.560> train

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
you can you can you can tell the train

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.340 
you can you can you can tell the train
what<00:04:16.920> to<00:04:17.070> do<00:04:17.330> the<00:04:18.330> sounds<00:04:18.780> are<00:04:18.900> probably<00:04:19.170> the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
what to do the sounds are probably the

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.540 
what to do the sounds are probably the
most<00:04:19.500> fun<00:04:19.830> part<00:04:20.100> all<00:04:20.340> of<00:04:20.549> this<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:21.530> I<00:04:22.530> shall<00:04:23.370> go

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
most fun part all of this and I shall go

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.830 
most fun part all of this and I shall go
through<00:04:23.760> all<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.210> them<00:04:24.390> in<00:04:24.510> detail<00:04:25.020> but<00:04:26.330> in<00:04:27.330> the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
through all of them in detail but in the

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.200 
through all of them in detail but in the
in<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.140> instructions<00:04:28.680> they<00:04:29.100> suggest<00:04:30.060> that

in the instructions they suggest that

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.700 
in the instructions they suggest that
you<00:04:30.330> start<00:04:30.660> by<00:04:30.780> turning<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.290> think<00:04:31.440> it's<00:04:31.560> the

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
you start by turning I think it's the

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.810 
you start by turning I think it's the
triple<00:04:31.980> pump<00:04:32.280> on<00:04:32.490> which<00:04:32.760> is<00:04:32.940> this<00:04:33.270> button<00:04:33.540> here

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
triple pump on which is this button here

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.090 
triple pump on which is this button here
and<00:04:36.330> you'll<00:04:36.570> hear<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:37.290> train<00:04:37.530> starting<00:04:37.980> to

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
and you'll hear the train starting to

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.740 
and you'll hear the train starting to
make<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.250> noise<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:40.050> next<00:04:40.320> thing<00:04:40.440> to<00:04:40.560> do<00:04:40.710> is<00:04:40.980> to

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
make a noise the next thing to do is to

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:51.400 
make a noise the next thing to do is to
turn<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:43.140> motor<00:04:43.590> on<00:04:43.890> and<00:04:45.230> your<00:04:46.230> heard<00:04:46.410> startup
