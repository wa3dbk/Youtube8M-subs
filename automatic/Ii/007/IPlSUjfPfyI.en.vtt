red<00:00:45.690> dot<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.050> stock<00:00:46.320> but<00:00:46.559> i<00:00:46.590> also<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:46.860> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
red dot in the stock but i also like to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.040

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
like the the attachment greed or

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.930 
like the the attachment greed or
something<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.280> where<00:00:53.579> i<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.789> have

actually goes insanely off in this game
ply<00:01:20.820> believe<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.450> actually<00:01:21.600> gets<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.049> quad

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
ply believe it it actually gets a quad

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.410 
ply believe it it actually gets a quad
feed<00:01:22.619> obviously<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:23.820> really<00:01:24.030> well<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.210> this

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
feed obviously we do really well on this

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.030 
feed obviously we do really well on this
map<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.869> because<00:01:25.200> its<00:01:25.350> carrier<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
map just because its carrier it's a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.429 
map just because its carrier it's a
really<00:01:26.220> open<00:01:26.460> map<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.270> wide<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
really open map it's really wide and you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.260 
really open map it's really wide and you
can't<00:01:28.829> really<00:01:29.070> take<00:01:29.400> too<00:01:29.579> much<00:01:29.700> cover<00:01:30.030> you

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
can't really take too much cover you

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.670 
can't really take too much cover you
know<00:01:30.360> there's<00:01:30.540> places<00:01:30.869> where<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.380> kind

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
know there's places where you can kind

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.560 
know there's places where you can kind
of<00:01:31.799> go<00:01:31.950> inside<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.970> there's<00:01:33.180> definitely<00:01:33.240> not

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
of go inside but there's definitely not

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.080

well<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.869> Warthog<00:01:46.290> would<00:01:46.560> not<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:47.159> well<00:01:47.369> if<00:01:47.700> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
well the Warthog would not do well if it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.490 
well the Warthog would not do well if it

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
introduced into call of duty but it's a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.809 
introduced into call of duty but it's a
one<00:02:09.479> burst<00:02:09.840> if<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.890> hit<00:02:11.069> them<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> chest

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
one burst if you hit them to the chest

don't being the head of course but I

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.330 
don't being the head of course but I

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
believe if you hit them in the leg only

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.070 
believe if you hit them in the leg only
a<00:02:16.370> few<00:02:16.610> times<00:02:16.849> than<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.239> has<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.360> be<00:02:17.480> tuberous<00:02:17.900> I

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
a few times than it has to be tuberous I

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.170 
a few times than it has to be tuberous I
usually<00:02:18.500> typically<00:02:18.920> end<00:02:19.069> up<00:02:19.190> firing<00:02:19.370> two<00:02:20.030> to

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
in-depth break down to this gun just try

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.759 
in-depth break down to this gun just try
to<00:02:32.239> show<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.480> guys<00:02:32.599> that<00:02:32.660> it's<00:02:32.900> decent<00:02:33.349> so<00:02:33.739> I

to show you guys that it's decent so I

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.589 
to show you guys that it's decent so I
chose<00:02:33.980> this<00:02:34.040> one<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.610> course<00:02:34.640> in<00:02:35.090> black<00:02:35.269> ops<00:02:35.480> 2

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
chose this one of course in black ops 2

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.410 
chose this one of course in black ops 2
I<00:02:35.989> was<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.440> really<00:02:37.010> really<00:02:37.190> really<00:02:37.610> big<00:02:37.790> trihard

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
I was a really really really big trihard

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.640 
I was a really really really big trihard
pub<00:02:38.599> stomper<00:02:39.019> in<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.140> beginning<00:02:39.440> I<00:02:39.470> never

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
pub stomper in the beginning I never

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.500 
pub stomper in the beginning I never
really<00:02:39.830> got<00:02:39.950> super<00:02:40.370> hardcore<00:02:40.610> into<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.000> MLG

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
really got super hardcore into the MLG

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.330 
really got super hardcore into the MLG
game<00:02:42.080> battle<00:02:42.440> scene<00:02:42.650> I'm<00:02:42.800> pretty<00:02:42.980> good<00:02:43.130> at<00:02:43.190> it

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
game battle scene I'm pretty good at it

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.100 
game battle scene I'm pretty good at it
but<00:02:43.819> I<00:02:44.090> don't<00:02:44.390> really<00:02:44.540> want<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.870> do<00:02:44.989> that

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
but I don't really want to do that

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.199 
but I don't really want to do that
probably<00:02:45.319> never<00:02:45.560> going<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.860> do<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.180> but<00:02:47.180> I

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
probably never going to do that but I

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.880 
probably never going to do that but I
would<00:02:47.450> say<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:50.090> this<00:02:50.600> gun<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:50.959> really<00:02:51.709> good

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
would say that this gun is really good

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.860 
would say that this gun is really good
if<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.519> would<00:02:52.730> have<00:02:52.819> been<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.299> know<00:02:53.450> just<00:02:53.750> a

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
if it would have been you know just a

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.420 
if it would have been you know just a
little<00:02:54.110> bit<00:02:54.200> stronger<00:02:54.410> probably<00:02:54.980> gonna<00:02:55.100> ruin

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
little bit stronger probably gonna ruin

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.180 
little bit stronger probably gonna ruin
the<00:02:55.670> black<00:02:55.880> ops<00:02:56.150> 2<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:57.440> that's<00:02:57.620> why<00:02:57.799> I'm<00:02:57.890> happy

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
the black ops 2 so that's why I'm happy

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.860 
the black ops 2 so that's why I'm happy
I<00:02:58.250> feel<00:02:58.400> like<00:02:58.519> this<00:02:58.700> gun<00:02:58.880> fits<00:02:59.150> perfectly<00:02:59.690> with

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
I feel like this gun fits perfectly with
