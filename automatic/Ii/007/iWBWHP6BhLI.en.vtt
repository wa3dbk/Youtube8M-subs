00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.030 
think that was total incidental contact
with<00:05:36.479> Grant<00:05:36.750> Langston<00:05:36.960> there<00:05:37.440> but<00:05:37.650> with<00:05:37.800> Chad

with Grant Langston there but with Chad
Reed<00:05:38.070> and<00:05:38.820> as<00:05:39.240> you<00:05:39.389> sure<00:05:39.660> that<00:05:39.990> was<00:05:40.200> the

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
Reed and as you sure that was the

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.530 
Reed and as you sure that was the
aggressive<00:05:40.710> pass<00:05:41.040> I<00:05:41.250> was<00:05:41.310> talking<00:05:41.760> about<00:05:41.850> but

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540
