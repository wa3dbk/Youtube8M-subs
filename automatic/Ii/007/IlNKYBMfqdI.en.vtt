hi I'm Amanda Prerna from a Hakam and

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:04.670 
hi I'm Amanda Prerna from a Hakam and
today<00:00:03.480> I'm<00:00:03.570> going<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.840> show<00:00:03.990> you<00:00:04.020> how<00:00:04.620> to

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.130 
today I'm going to show you how to
measure<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.250> waist<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.730> dress<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.899> thing

measure the waist of a dress the thing
that's<00:00:07.350> most<00:00:07.529> important<00:00:08.099> when<00:00:08.639> measuring<00:00:09.059> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
that's most important when measuring the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.700 
that's most important when measuring the
waist<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.630> dress<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.260> figure<00:00:10.440> out

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
waist of the dress is to figure out

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.280 
waist of the dress is to figure out
where<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.610> waist<00:00:11.820> actually<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.929> dress

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
where the waist actually is on the dress

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.180 
where the waist actually is on the dress
there<00:00:14.130> are<00:00:14.370> two<00:00:14.809> main<00:00:15.809> places<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.010> will

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
there are two main places that you will

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.950 
there are two main places that you will
find<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.640> waist<00:00:17.820> on<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.240> dress<00:00:18.480> there's

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
find the waist on the dress there's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.630 
find the waist on the dress there's
either<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.470> actual<00:00:20.070> waist

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
either the actual waist

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.730 
either the actual waist
which<00:00:21.060> means<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.630> pretty<00:00:21.869> much<00:00:22.109> gonna<00:00:22.380> hate

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
which means it's pretty much gonna hate

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.160 
which means it's pretty much gonna hate
where<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.369> hits<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> waist<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.840> your

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
where it hits on you the waist of your

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.040 
where it hits on you the waist of your
body<00:00:25.439> or<00:00:25.920> there's<00:00:26.580> an<00:00:26.699> unpierced<00:00:27.180> seam<00:00:27.510> which

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
body or there's an unpierced seam which

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.130 
body or there's an unpierced seam which
is<00:00:28.230> higher<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.550> below<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.300> bustline

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
is higher and just below the bustline

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.370 
is higher and just below the bustline
so<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.850> measuring<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.360> dress<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.020> thing<00:00:34.260> that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
so when measuring a dress the thing that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.569 
so when measuring a dress the thing that
you're<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.680> need<00:00:34.829> obviously<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
you're going to need obviously is a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.729 
you're going to need obviously is a
measuring<00:00:36.059> tape<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.840> best<00:00:37.140> if<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.530> lay

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
measuring tape and it's best if you lay

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.250 
measuring tape and it's best if you lay
your<00:00:37.950> dress<00:00:38.219> out<00:00:38.430> flat<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.719> way<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:39.960> know

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
your dress out flat so this way you know

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.900 
your dress out flat so this way you know
that<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.800> are<00:00:40.829> getting<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.520> most<00:00:41.670> accurate

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
that you are getting the most accurate

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.180 
that you are getting the most accurate
measurement<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:43.680> you're<00:00:43.800> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> do

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
measurement so what you're going to do

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.430 
measurement so what you're going to do
it's<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.879> as<00:00:45.059> easy<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.750> sounds<00:00:46.260> you're

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
it's just as easy as it sounds you're

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560 
it's just as easy as it sounds you're
gonna<00:00:46.530> place<00:00:46.890> your<00:00:46.920> measuring<00:00:47.670> tape<00:00:47.789> at<00:00:48.180> one

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
gonna place your measuring tape at one

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.819 
gonna place your measuring tape at one
end<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.140> place<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.370> at<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:51.149> other<00:00:51.360> end<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.469> for

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
end and place it at the other end so for

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.869 
end and place it at the other end so for
this<00:00:53.039> our<00:00:53.370> measurement<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.090> 13<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.899> half

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
this our measurement is 13 and a half

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.450 
this our measurement is 13 and a half
typically<00:00:56.879> when<00:00:57.410> measuring<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.800> waist<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.370> a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
typically when measuring the waist of a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.970 
typically when measuring the waist of a
dress<00:00:59.820> you're<00:01:00.270> gonna<00:01:00.449> assume<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.350> it's

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
dress you're gonna assume that it's

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.759 
dress you're gonna assume that it's
going<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.579> doubled<00:01:03.000> because<00:01:03.439> the<00:01:04.439> front

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
going to be doubled because the front

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.280 
going to be doubled because the front
and<00:01:04.949> back<00:01:05.280> will<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.909> same<00:01:06.240> measurement<00:01:06.810> so

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and back will be the same measurement so

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.250 
and back will be the same measurement so
if<00:01:07.409> your<00:01:07.560> measurement<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.330> 13

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
if your measurement on this one is 13

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440 
if your measurement on this one is 13
and<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.500> half<00:01:10.770> you're<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> double

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and a half you're just going to double

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.039 
and a half you're just going to double
it<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.250> 27<00:01:15.090> inches<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it so it's going to be 27 inches is the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.520 
it so it's going to be 27 inches is the
waist<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.920> dress<00:01:17.689> then<00:01:18.689> when<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.290> have

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
waist of this dress then when you have

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.330 
waist of this dress then when you have
something<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.610> mentioned<00:01:20.939> before<00:01:21.270> that's

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
something like I mentioned before that's

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.550 
something like I mentioned before that's
either<00:01:23.340> called<00:01:23.880> an<00:01:24.180> empire<00:01:24.689> seam<00:01:25.200> or<00:01:25.409> I'm

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
either called an empire seam or I'm

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.140 
either called an empire seam or I'm
Pierce<00:01:25.950> team<00:01:26.220> depending<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.850> who<00:01:27.000> you're

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
Pierce team depending on who you're

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.630 
Pierce team depending on who you're
talking<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.799> this<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> little

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
talking to this is going to be a little

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.350 
talking to this is going to be a little
bit<00:01:29.880> higher<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.890> typically<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.360> actual

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
bit higher up so typically your actual

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.350 
bit higher up so typically your actual
waist<00:01:33.600> will<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.960> about<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:35.000> but<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> waist

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
waist will be about here but the waist

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.420 
waist will be about here but the waist
of<00:01:36.570> your<00:01:36.720> dress<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.040> it's<00:01:38.220> very

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
of your dress is here so it's very

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.800 
of your dress is here so it's very
important<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.090> you're<00:01:39.329> measuring<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
important that you're measuring the

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.260 
important that you're measuring the
waist<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> dress<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.890> not<00:01:41.430> your<00:01:41.790> actual

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
waist of the dress and not your actual

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.620 
waist of the dress and not your actual
waist<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:44.009> once<00:01:44.280> again<00:01:44.610> I'm<00:01:45.600> just

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
waist so on this one once again I'm just

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.450 
waist so on this one once again I'm just
going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.110> measure<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:47.070> want<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.310> make<00:01:47.430> sure

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
going to measure just want to make sure

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.920 
going to measure just want to make sure
it's<00:01:47.700> flat<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:49.640> here<00:01:50.640> our<00:01:50.670> measurement<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.509> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it's flat so here our measurement at the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.469 
it's flat so here our measurement at the
waist<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.439> 13<00:01:53.189> which<00:01:53.790> means<00:01:54.119> you're<00:01:54.299> going<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
waist is 13 which means you're going to
