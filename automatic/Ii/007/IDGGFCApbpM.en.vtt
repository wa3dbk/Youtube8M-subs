00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
hi this is yellow 13 ace giving you the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.990 
hi this is yellow 13 ace giving you the
GAF<00:00:07.890> one<00:00:08.570> bark<00:00:09.570> like<00:00:10.010> from<00:00:11.010> Ace<00:00:11.219> Combat<00:00:11.490> join

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
GAF one bark like from Ace Combat join

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.310 
GAF one bark like from Ace Combat join
us<00:00:12.150> all<00:00:13.340> all<00:00:14.340> right<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:14.910> last<00:00:15.509> time<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.960> said

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
us all all right so last time I said

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.970 
us all all right so last time I said
this<00:00:16.529> plane<00:00:16.830> doesn't<00:00:17.039> fly<00:00:17.190> really<00:00:17.940> well<00:00:18.300> I

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
this plane doesn't fly really well I

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
this plane doesn't fly really well I
guess<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.130> was<00:00:20.279> wrong<00:00:20.750> partially<00:00:21.750> because<00:00:22.289> I

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
guess I was wrong partially because I

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.060 
guess I was wrong partially because I
threw<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.119> afterwards<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.350> flew<00:00:25.769> really

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
threw it afterwards and it flew really

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.609 
threw it afterwards and it flew really
well<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:27.240> really<00:00:27.779> really<00:00:28.080> really<00:00:28.500> really

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
well you really really really really

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.979 
well you really really really really
throw<00:00:29.449> so<00:00:30.449> um<00:00:31.189> I'm<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> try<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.630> that

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
throw so um I'm going to try to do that

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.810 
throw so um I'm going to try to do that
again<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.620> don't<00:00:34.829> think<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.219> will<00:00:35.309> fly<00:00:35.640> like

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
again I don't think it will fly like

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:44.510 
again I don't think it will fly like
that<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:41.780> she<00:00:42.780> flew<00:00:43.170> straighter<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:44.219> didn't

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
that but she flew straighter it didn't

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.119 
that but she flew straighter it didn't
go<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.879> park<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:49.670> yeah<00:00:50.670> after<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.949> first

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
go in a park and yeah after the first

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.279 
go in a park and yeah after the first
video<00:00:54.079> this<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.920> plane<00:00:56.280> really<00:00:57.239> performed<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
video this this plane really performed a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.219 
video this this plane really performed a
lot<00:00:58.559> better<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.609> on<00:01:00.559> that<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:02.120> it<00:01:03.229> usually

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
lot better and on that one it usually

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.670 
lot better and on that one it usually
goes<00:01:05.189> into<00:01:05.519> our<00:01:05.729> tenant<00:01:06.240> dives<00:01:06.540> down<00:01:07.260> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
goes into our tenant dives down and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.179 
goes into our tenant dives down and
crashes<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:08.689> now<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.080> figured<00:01:10.619> out<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.799> if

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
crashes but now I figured out that if

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.370 
crashes but now I figured out that if
you<00:01:11.250> throw<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.670> hard<00:01:12.060> enough<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:13.350> can

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you throw it hard enough you can

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:28.010 
you throw it hard enough you can
actually<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:14.100> straight<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:15.030> this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.029 

but<00:01:29.020> if<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.619> throw<00:01:29.859> it<00:01:30.070> softly<00:01:30.880> it'll<00:01:31.750> just

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
but if you throw it softly it'll just

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:46.460 
but if you throw it softly it'll just
stall<00:01:33.039> dive<00:01:33.759> in<00:01:34.060> crash

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.370 

so<00:01:47.010> it's<00:01:47.250> all<00:01:47.430> really<00:01:47.730> hard<00:01:48.440> flies<00:01:49.440> better<00:01:51.380> no

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
so it's all really hard flies better no

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.310 
so it's all really hard flies better no
not<00:01:53.010> that<00:01:53.130> time<00:01:53.370> though<00:01:53.870> one<00:01:54.870> behind<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
not that time though one behind the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.320 
not that time though one behind the
piano<00:01:58.610> am<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.940> going<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.390> get<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:01.130> right<00:02:02.330> I'll

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
piano am I going to get this right I'll

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:16.100 
piano am I going to get this right I'll
sort<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:04.850> not<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:10.850> they<00:02:11.850> prefer<00:02:12.090> collect<00:02:15.110> see

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
sort it not it they prefer collect see

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.600 
sort it not it they prefer collect see
that<00:02:16.290> one<00:02:16.440> was<00:02:16.620> one<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.980> bad<00:02:17.220> fights

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
that one was one of the bad fights

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.550 
that one was one of the bad fights
because<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.540> flipped<00:02:18.840> upside<00:02:19.230> down<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.560> midair

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
because it flipped upside down in midair

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.100 
because it flipped upside down in midair
it<00:02:22.560> flies<00:02:22.860> good<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.550> didn't<00:02:23.820> actually<00:02:24.110> just

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
it flies good it didn't actually just

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.360 
it flies good it didn't actually just
glide<00:02:25.530> down<00:02:25.920> with<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:29.420> didn't<00:02:30.420> do<00:02:30.570> that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
glide down with this but didn't do that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:41.570 
glide down with this but didn't do that
and<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.430> can't<00:02:32.700> really<00:02:32.790> make<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.240> do<00:02:33.390> that

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.240 

so<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:43.420> make<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.630> quite<00:02:43.960> good<00:02:44.230> have<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.130> go

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
so to make it quite good have to go

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.940 
so to make it quite good have to go
really<00:02:45.550> high<00:02:45.670> speeds<00:02:46.060> which<00:02:47.020> is<00:02:47.200> what<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.800> bar

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
really high speeds which is what the bar

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.140 
really high speeds which is what the bar
clock<00:02:48.190> was<00:02:48.460> designed<00:02:48.940> for<00:02:49.440> basically<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.940> the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
clock was designed for basically in the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.120 
clock was designed for basically in the
game<00:02:52.360> it<00:02:52.600> goes<00:02:52.720> really<00:02:52.960> fast<00:02:53.320> if<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.740> tune<00:02:53.980> it

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
game it goes really fast if you tune it

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.860 
game it goes really fast if you tune it
correctly<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.980> real<00:02:57.640> life<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:58.360> doesn't<00:02:58.780> really

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
correctly in real life it doesn't really

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:19.610 
correctly in real life it doesn't really
fly<00:02:59.200> well

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.220 

see<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.709> did<00:03:20.860> a<00:03:20.890> loop<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.459> time<00:03:21.760> oh<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.959> I

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
see it did a loop that time oh and I

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.550 
see it did a loop that time oh and I
forgot<00:03:23.379> to<00:03:23.560> show<00:03:23.860> you<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:27.430> plane<00:03:27.849> actually

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
forgot to show you this plane actually

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.180 
forgot to show you this plane actually
does<00:03:29.560> not<00:03:29.799> fly<00:03:30.069> while<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:30.640> I<00:03:31.260> folded<00:03:32.260> now<00:03:32.739> I<00:03:32.769> cut

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
does not fly while so I folded now I cut

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.000 
does not fly while so I folded now I cut
first<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.730> then<00:03:33.879> folded<00:03:35.010> here<00:03:36.010> and<00:03:36.420> here<00:03:38.010> you

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
first and then folded here and here you

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.250 
first and then folded here and here you
can<00:03:39.099> see<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.400> right<00:03:40.299> there<00:03:42.599> to<00:03:43.599> make<00:03:43.629> the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
can see that right there to make the

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.330 
can see that right there to make the
plane<00:03:44.910> rotate<00:03:45.910> there<00:03:46.180> because<00:03:47.129> during<00:03:48.129> its

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
plane rotate there because during its

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.009 
plane rotate there because during its
first<00:03:48.610> flight<00:03:48.879> it<00:03:49.180> just<00:03:49.540> did<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.720> loop<00:03:49.989> like

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
first flight it just did a loop like

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.190 
first flight it just did a loop like
that<00:03:50.230> and<00:03:50.620> crashed<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:52.510> I<00:03:52.540> made<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:52.959> more

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
that and crashed so I made it more

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.839 
that and crashed so I made it more
stable<00:03:54.190> by<00:03:54.579> doing<00:03:54.849> that<00:03:55.709> but<00:03:56.709> it<00:03:57.459> doesn't<00:03:57.579> have

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
stable by doing that but it doesn't have

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.970 
stable by doing that but it doesn't have
a<00:03:57.910> lot<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.120> wing<00:03:58.420> area<00:03:58.690> so<00:03:59.109> it<00:03:59.260> really<00:03:59.500> cannot

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
a lot of wing area so it really cannot

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.500
