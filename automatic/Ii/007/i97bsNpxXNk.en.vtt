00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.580
 hello hello to all my friends we are in 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.280
 minecraft 2 barrel rolls and good today 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.920
 I bring a map of adventure especially 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.590
 thought of the pokemon and two textures 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.220
 the two textures is the giotto texture 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.470
 pack that is for the adventure map and 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.540
 the poker craft we will see the difference 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.270
 that poker craft as you can see 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.720
 has a background there blah blah but the map 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.140
 I think more father is this the me 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.879
 u2 texture pack he is from the same league 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.949
 the map the theme for that special to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.220
 the texture and this kraft poker is 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.220
 special to play normal adventures 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:04.940
 so I was trying to show you the map a 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.940
 player said adventure maps and we played 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.000
 I put this here so you can see the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.659
 mostly the texture on the map 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.270
 adventure begins this as a closed end 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.230
 and well here we are 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.480
 what's happening here 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.810
 so here good here is how you can see 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.820
 a spider 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.190
 it's a pokémon you have to die this pokemon 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.190
 good but see the chests 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.180
 gold ingots to thousands good here 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.040
 can you see how a good sword is this 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.720
 I was this I have it because there was no 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.220
 that investigating 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.770
 is the wooden door a little house does not 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.270
 I'm going to show both the map because 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.670
 I tell them it 's an adventure map for 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.480
 that you discover it then here 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.620
 if we get in because there is practically no 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.540
 they love it well in a bottle of 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.900
 enchantments the bed 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.119
 here in method because there is no problem 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.000
 even the sad thing about this map is that 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.070
 is made on a flat map look like 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.570
 you can see there is nothing and then 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.080
 because the sad thing because once you 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.410
 you finish you can not play survival or 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.250
 use this map then for as a 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.250
 village 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.320
 I'm not going to show you many new ones to 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.460
 that see the texture look here to this 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.010
 second entry because you can 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.290
 enter from the beginning easily 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.120
 has its some little games here that's 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.890
 a pokémon here I do not know why this happens 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.980
 I do not know why I do not have in the last 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.590
 version of love the fine but good are 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.430
 the chests now see if they believe to 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.730
 truth check my text I say my skin is 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.370
 of the ketchup almost almost but I do not know why 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.670
 what has that in your head because it is a 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.920
 ryder cup but if I get the equipment if I 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.380
 I have been the same if it is what I do not 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.300
 I understand if I wear a helmet 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.180
 it's the traditional helmet but look at my 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.250
 face then you have to check that 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.200
 error is this I do not know why but good 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.959
 so I look and see the other texture 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.030
 that are in the poker craft is a 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.670
 simpler texture 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.690
 to 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.130
 but for example here the client changes 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.599
 this is like for an adventure map 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.040
 new experiences appear and normal that no 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.500
 you want to make so many changes 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.610
 and this is a bug that seems to me with 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.270
 that texture look 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.460
 now see if I leave 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.940
 to me from this one player background image 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.990
 I what 21 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.990
 it looks good 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.620
 The error is corrected. 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.370
 because I do not know 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.370
 but that's how it goes 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.599
 and for example these pumpkins good 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.340
 they're here 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.400
 those pumpkins are being simón is 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.579
 that changes changes some things or changes 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.160
 everything so I leave it at will to what 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.310
 want you to do that is the village 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.190
 from alicante 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.700
 here I will not show you anything 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.169
 but there are things to do here especially 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.370
 at the time of leaving because you start in 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.850
 Saturday and they give you like a little 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.860
 pity training that is in English 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.570
 but hey, it's a molinito 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.110
 see now has not yet changed 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.110
 texture 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.860
 to me the why because today is father 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.580
 let's see in the textures I do not 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.580
 agreement how is 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.850
 I said 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.150
 this city is just as simple and good 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:03.550
 This mill has already seen what happens 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.390
 do not know myself why why why then 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.170
 you know, I have to get out 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.170
 a player 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.460
 and it's already corrected 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:21.839
 good as you can see those who played the 

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:24.329
 game boy or something like that you can see here the 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.889
 little leaves of always the trees that you do not 

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:28.559
 they let other ties pass that this is 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.110
 great because that's how it always was 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:31.940
 been the game 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.110
 and well I can break it because this 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.220
 destination is the one that I will pass on to 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.460
 you the one that I'm going to pass on to 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:41.699
 you who is the original so 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.710
 look a nice if you already saw this 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.360
 texture is special for this map as well 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.130
 that if you play it the survival and maybe 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.770
 in things that do not match happy good in 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:53.210
 want to understand you look here is 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.180
 A challenge 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.699
 pauner 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.900
 good causes and I will not show 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.160
 a lot because I'm already showing 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.930
 too 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.610
 so 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.100
 Well, here we are going to leave, let's see 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.810

 weapons for example to see them 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:25.909
 quickly we go to the traditional 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:25.909
 and let's go with this nice 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.599
