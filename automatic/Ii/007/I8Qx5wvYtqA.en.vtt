00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
glass and some other stuff that I have

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.920 
glass and some other stuff that I have
over<00:00:25.340> here<00:00:25.490> on<00:00:25.610> my<00:00:25.699> right<00:00:25.910> side<00:00:25.970> but<00:00:26.630> I<00:00:26.660> was

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
over here on my right side but I was

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.359 
over here on my right side but I was
originally<00:00:27.260> going<00:00:27.619> to<00:00:27.710> do<00:00:27.860> all<00:00:28.100> of<00:00:28.130> the

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
originally going to do all of the

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.000 
originally going to do all of the
features<00:00:28.580> in<00:00:28.910> one<00:00:29.300> just<00:00:29.630> one<00:00:29.810> big<00:00:30.020> video<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:30.619> I

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
features in one just one big video and I

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.470 
features in one just one big video and I
thought<00:00:31.250> well<00:00:31.490> there's<00:00:31.699> just<00:00:31.910> so<00:00:32.300> many

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
thought well there's just so many

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.700 
thought well there's just so many
different<00:00:32.780> features<00:00:33.170> and<00:00:33.199> there's<00:00:33.470> so

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
different features and there's so

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.590 
different features and there's so
complex<00:00:34.280> in<00:00:34.520> their<00:00:34.640> own<00:00:34.820> right<00:00:35.090> all<00:00:35.330> of<00:00:35.510> them

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
complex in their own right all of them

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.119 
complex in their own right all of them
all<00:00:35.809> of<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:35.989> different<00:00:36.260> features<00:00:36.350> that<00:00:37.070> I

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
all of the different features that I

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:38.320 
all of the different features that I
thought<00:00:37.430> it<00:00:37.580> would<00:00:37.699> just<00:00:37.940> do<00:00:38.059> them<00:00:38.090> an

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
thought it would just do them an

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.880 
thought it would just do them an
injustice<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:38.720> do<00:00:39.080> all<00:00:39.260> of<00:00:39.290> them<00:00:39.530> into<00:00:39.739> one

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
injustice to do all of them into one

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.740 
injustice to do all of them into one
video<00:00:40.070> without<00:00:40.670> really<00:00:40.970> taking<00:00:41.150> the<00:00:41.360> time<00:00:41.540> to

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
video without really taking the time to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.940 
video without really taking the time to
explain<00:00:42.110> all<00:00:42.170> of<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.620> cool<00:00:42.770> different

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
explain all of the cool different

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.430 
explain all of the cool different
features<00:00:43.370> in<00:00:43.520> depth<00:00:43.850> by<00:00:44.149> themselves<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:44.840> so

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
features in depth by themselves and so

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.690 
features in depth by themselves and so
that's<00:00:45.620> what<00:00:45.800> I'm<00:00:45.860> doing<00:00:45.890> over<00:00:46.399> about<00:00:46.579> the

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
that's what I'm doing over about the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.889

next week i'm just going to be taking a
look<00:00:48.050> at<00:00:48.200> all<00:00:48.260> of<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.649> features<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:48.950> we<00:00:49.130> will

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.700 
look at all of the features that we will
be<00:00:49.399> seeing<00:00:49.610> in<00:00:49.730> 1.7<00:00:50.450> point<00:00:50.660> to<00:00:50.870> which<00:00:51.350> will<00:00:51.590> be

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
be seeing in 1.7 point to which will be

the next update for Minecraft on the

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.690 
the next update for Minecraft on the
console<00:00:53.649> or<00:00:54.649> rather<00:00:54.860> what<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.190> next<00:00:55.340> features

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
console or rather what the next features

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.830 
console or rather what the next features
update<00:00:56.000> on<00:00:56.090> minecraft<00:00:56.420> console<00:00:56.690> will<00:00:56.780> be

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
update on minecraft console will be

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.869 
update on minecraft console will be
based<00:00:57.050> on<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.100> today<00:00:58.160> we're<00:00:58.610> going<00:00:58.760> to

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
based on and so today we're going to

00:00:58.879 --> 00:00:59.979 
based on and so today we're going to
actually<00:00:58.969> be<00:00:59.120> taking<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.480> look<00:00:59.629> at<00:00:59.809> the

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
actually be taking a look at the

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.020 
actually be taking a look at the
obsidian<00:01:00.559> portals<00:01:00.950> now<00:01:01.399> I<00:01:01.430> think<00:01:01.579> that<00:01:01.879> this

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
obsidian portals now I think that this

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.119 
obsidian portals now I think that this
is<00:01:02.090> probably<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.750> least<00:01:03.200> known<00:01:03.620> feature<00:01:03.950> that

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
is probably the least known feature that

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.650 
is probably the least known feature that
we<00:01:04.220> will<00:01:04.339> be<00:01:04.489> seeing<00:01:04.699> in<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:04.940> next<00:01:05.210> update<00:01:05.330> and

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
we will be seeing in the next update and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.580 
we will be seeing in the next update and
so<00:01:05.720> I<00:01:05.780> really<00:01:05.990> want<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.200> spend<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.380> little<00:01:06.470> bit

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
so I really want to spend a little bit

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.260 
so I really want to spend a little bit
of<00:01:06.740> time<00:01:06.860> on<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:07.100> take<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.610> look<00:01:07.850> at<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.030> maybe

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
of time on it take a look at it maybe

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.639 
of time on it take a look at it maybe
show<00:01:08.509> you<00:01:08.570> guys<00:01:08.750> some<00:01:08.990> ways<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:09.350> can<00:01:09.470> use<00:01:09.619> it

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
show you guys some ways you can use it

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.590 
show you guys some ways you can use it
in<00:01:09.860> your<00:01:09.920> world<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:10.850> starting<00:01:11.240> off<00:01:11.300> here<00:01:11.360> you

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
in your world so starting off here you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.850 
in your world so starting off here you
can<00:01:11.720> obviously<00:01:11.840> see<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:12.440> obsidian

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
can obviously see that this obsidian

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.800 
can obviously see that this obsidian
portal<00:01:13.369> or<00:01:13.550> nether<00:01:13.910> portal<00:01:14.330> as<00:01:14.390> most<00:01:14.569> people

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
portal or nether portal as most people

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.330 
portal or nether portal as most people
call<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:15.110> I<00:01:15.319> just<00:01:15.860> call<00:01:16.009> it<00:01:16.100> an<00:01:16.160> obsidian

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
call it I just call it an obsidian

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.770 
call it I just call it an obsidian
portal<00:01:16.700> is<00:01:16.910> made<00:01:17.060> of<00:01:17.149> obsidian<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.600> that's

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
portal is made of obsidian and that's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.910 
portal is made of obsidian and that's
just<00:01:17.959> what<00:01:18.170> I<00:01:18.200> always<00:01:18.259> think<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:18.709> when<00:01:18.830> I<00:01:18.860> see

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
just what I always think of when I see

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.889 
just what I always think of when I see
it<00:01:19.160> but<00:01:19.310> obviously<00:01:19.940> this<00:01:20.090> nether<00:01:20.330> portal<00:01:20.660> here

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
it but obviously this nether portal here

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.930 
it but obviously this nether portal here
is<00:01:21.020> not<00:01:21.410> obviously<00:01:22.039> what<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.340> normal<00:01:22.610> nether

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
is not obviously what a normal nether

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.389 
is not obviously what a normal nether
portal<00:01:23.270> like<00:01:23.630> right<00:01:24.140> there<00:01:24.259> typically<00:01:24.619> 4<00:01:24.950> by<00:01:25.099> 5

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
portal like right there typically 4 by 5

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.760 
portal like right there typically 4 by 5
and<00:01:25.459> just<00:01:26.270> kind<00:01:26.599> and<00:01:26.780> not<00:01:27.080> like<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.410> rectangle

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
and just kind and not like a rectangle

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.370 
and just kind and not like a rectangle
like<00:01:28.220> that<00:01:28.399> one<00:01:28.550> is<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.599> this<00:01:30.140> one's

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
like that one is and so this one's

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.749 
like that one is and so this one's
really<00:01:30.560> kind<00:01:30.860> of<00:01:30.950> different<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:31.429> there's<00:01:31.580> all

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
really kind of different so there's all

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.190 
really kind of different so there's all
kinds<00:01:32.119> of<00:01:32.149> different<00:01:32.240> things<00:01:32.569> you<00:01:32.750> can<00:01:32.869> do<00:01:33.020> in

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
kinds of different things you can do in

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.540 
kinds of different things you can do in
the<00:01:33.229> next<00:01:33.470> update<00:01:33.619> with<00:01:33.890> nether<00:01:34.069> portals<00:01:34.459> and

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
the next update with nether portals and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.790 
the next update with nether portals and
that<00:01:35.119> is<00:01:35.300> make<00:01:35.599> them<00:01:35.780> into<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.170> whole<00:01:36.500> bunch<00:01:36.709> of

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
that is make them into a whole bunch of

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.100 
that is make them into a whole bunch of
different<00:01:37.130> shapes<00:01:37.310> sizes<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.090> in<00:01:38.929> different

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
different shapes sizes and in different

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.270 
different shapes sizes and in different
ways<00:01:39.319> you<00:01:39.380> can<00:01:39.560> just<00:01:39.770> use<00:01:39.890> them<00:01:40.039> all<00:01:40.130> together

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
ways you can just use them all together

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.010 
ways you can just use them all together
so<00:01:40.670> obviously<00:01:40.849> here<00:01:41.569> you<00:01:41.660> can<00:01:41.780> see<00:01:41.899> I<00:01:41.929> just

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
so obviously here you can see I just

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.830 
so obviously here you can see I just
have<00:01:42.289> normal<00:01:42.530> nether<00:01:42.920> portals<00:01:43.310> here<00:01:43.630> this<00:01:44.630> one

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
have normal nether portals here this one

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.480 
have normal nether portals here this one
is<00:01:44.959> a<00:01:45.080> normal<00:01:45.380> nether<00:01:45.560> portal<00:01:45.950> where<00:01:46.399> I've

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.380 
around the mountain side we can see that
this<00:02:45.409> is<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:46.189> believe<00:02:46.549> if<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.879> counted<00:02:47.060> correctly

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
this is I believe if I counted correctly

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.569 
this is I believe if I counted correctly
the<00:02:47.989> biggest<00:02:48.349> nether<00:02:48.799> portal<00:02:49.159> that<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.370> can

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
the biggest nether portal that you can

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.670 
the biggest nether portal that you can
possibly<00:02:49.790> make<00:02:50.239> in<00:02:50.389> Minecraft<00:02:50.569> this<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.079> 23

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
possibly make in Minecraft this is a 23

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.539 
possibly make in Minecraft this is a 23
by<00:02:52.189> 23<00:02:53.000> nether<00:02:53.269> portal<00:02:53.659> and<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.400> can

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
by 23 nether portal and and you can

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:56.559 
by 23 nether portal and and you can
obviously<00:02:55.760> just<00:02:56.000> build<00:02:56.150> this<00:02:56.239> in<00:02:56.359> your<00:02:56.450> world

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
obviously just build this in your world

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.699 
obviously just build this in your world
I<00:02:56.659> don't<00:02:56.810> know<00:02:56.870> how<00:02:57.079> you<00:02:57.109> would<00:02:57.290> use<00:02:57.409> this

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
I don't know how you would use this

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.470 
I don't know how you would use this
maybe<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.370> wanted<00:02:58.549> to<00:02:58.670> make<00:02:58.790> like<00:02:58.909> a<00:02:58.939> huge

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
maybe you wanted to make like a huge

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.759 
maybe you wanted to make like a huge
face<00:02:59.750> in<00:02:59.930> the<00:02:59.989> side<00:03:00.019> of<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.319> mountain<00:03:00.439> that's

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
face in the side of the mountain that's

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.190 
face in the side of the mountain that's
23<00:03:01.189> blocks<00:03:01.310> by<00:03:01.519> 23<00:03:01.879> blocks<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.419> purple

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
23 blocks by 23 blocks of of purple

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.559 
23 blocks by 23 blocks of of purple
eyeball<00:03:03.620> goodness<00:03:04.040> i<00:03:04.189> really<00:03:04.430> don't<00:03:04.639> know<00:03:04.730> but

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
eyeball goodness i really don't know but

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.300 
eyeball goodness i really don't know but
this<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.470> biggest<00:03:06.769> one<00:03:06.799> that<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.129> can

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
this is the biggest one that you can

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.280 
this is the biggest one that you can
make<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:07.819> it's<00:03:07.970> really<00:03:08.120> kind<00:03:08.419> of<00:03:08.480> nifty<00:03:08.629> so

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
make and so it's really kind of nifty so

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.539 
make and so it's really kind of nifty so
obviously<00:03:09.709> like<00:03:09.889> I<00:03:09.980> said<00:03:10.129> this<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.280> probably

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
obviously like I said this is probably

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.039 
obviously like I said this is probably
the<00:03:10.760> least<00:03:11.090> known<00:03:11.329> feature<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.780> think

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
the least known feature that I think

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.330 
the least known feature that I think
most<00:03:12.230> people<00:03:12.500> don't<00:03:12.739> know<00:03:12.889> about<00:03:12.919> that<00:03:13.129> we

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
most people don't know about that we

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.740 
most people don't know about that we
will<00:03:13.489> be<00:03:13.609> seeing<00:03:13.819> in<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.150> next<00:03:14.359> update<00:03:14.450> for

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
Minecraft on the console which will be

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.210 
Minecraft on the console which will be
based<00:03:16.609> on<00:03:16.819> Minecraft<00:03:17.359> version<00:03:17.680> 1.7<00:03:18.680> point<00:03:19.010> to

based on Minecraft version 1.7 point to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.179 
based on Minecraft version 1.7 point to
and<00:03:19.430> will<00:03:19.879> be<00:03:20.090> tu<00:03:20.560> 23<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.739> I<00:03:21.859> believe<00:03:22.099> the

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
and will be tu 23 is I believe the

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.979 
and will be tu 23 is I believe the
number<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.489> we<00:03:22.579> are<00:03:22.700> now<00:03:22.939> and<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:23.720> that

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
number that we are now and so that

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.869 
number that we are now and so that
really<00:03:24.019> about<00:03:24.709> does<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.069> for<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.609> nether
