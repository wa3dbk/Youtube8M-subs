00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.120 

this<00:04:51.310> once<00:04:51.520> you<00:04:51.610> take<00:04:51.820> it<00:04:51.940> out<00:04:52.060> hopefully<00:04:53.130> yeah

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
this once you take it out hopefully yeah

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.850 
this once you take it out hopefully yeah
okay<00:04:54.460> cool<00:04:54.780> well<00:04:55.860> that's<00:04:56.860> pretty<00:04:57.250> easy<00:04:57.370> so<00:04:57.880> far

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
okay cool well that's pretty easy so far

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.670 
okay cool well that's pretty easy so far
but<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.460> only<00:05:00.580> thing<00:05:00.699> I'm<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.710> onyx<00:05:02.710> and<00:05:03.040> onyx

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
but the only thing I'm is onyx and onyx

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.320 
but the only thing I'm is onyx and onyx
actually<00:05:05.680> I<00:05:05.710> think<00:05:05.860> you<00:05:06.250> should<00:05:06.430> use<00:05:06.580> growl<00:05:06.940> at

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
actually I think you should use growl at

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.170 
actually I think you should use growl at
least<00:05:07.630> twice<00:05:08.070> first<00:05:09.070> if<00:05:09.370> you<00:05:09.490> have<00:05:09.580> Charmander

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
least twice first if you have Charmander

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.439 
least twice first if you have Charmander
just<00:05:10.510> because<00:05:11.490> it<00:05:12.490> will<00:05:12.970> lower<00:05:13.180> its<00:05:13.389> attack

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
just because it will lower its attack

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:15.570 
just because it will lower its attack
enough<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.139> I'm<00:05:14.199> glad<00:05:14.350> at<00:05:14.590> mr.<00:05:14.889> octane<00:05:15.370> that

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
enough and I'm glad at mr. octane that

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.730 
enough and I'm glad at mr. octane that
probably<00:05:15.940> helps<00:05:16.240> me<00:05:16.360> a<00:05:16.389> lot<00:05:16.479> because<00:05:17.320> we're

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
probably helps me a lot because we're

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.250 
probably helps me a lot because we're
optimal<00:05:18.130> so<00:05:18.310> lower<00:05:18.490> speed<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.240> does<00:05:19.630> decent

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
optimal so lower speed and does decent

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.980 
optimal so lower speed and does decent
damage<00:05:20.410> especially<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.669> Charmander<00:05:22.240> if<00:05:22.450> you

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
damage especially the Charmander if you
