00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.000 
soaked and bamboo leaf will have sort of
you<00:00:15.599> know<00:00:15.719> two<00:00:15.780> textures<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.500> them<00:00:16.650> on<00:00:16.830> one

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
you know two textures to them on one

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.250 
you know two textures to them on one
side<00:00:17.039> it'll<00:00:17.490> be<00:00:17.640> really<00:00:17.820> smooth<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.449> shiny<00:00:18.750> on

the other side it's sort of going to be
rough<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.189> dull<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.630> you're<00:00:24.630> going<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.779> take

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
rough and dull and you're going to take

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.300 
rough and dull and you're going to take
two<00:00:25.650> pretty<00:00:25.949> big<00:00:26.220> leaves<00:00:27.769> put<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> ends

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
two pretty big leaves put the ends

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.569 
two pretty big leaves put the ends
together<00:00:29.490> put<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> shiny<00:00:30.539> side<00:00:30.779> up<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.579> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
together put the shiny side up and the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.020 
together put the shiny side up and the
dull<00:00:32.730> side<00:00:32.940> down<00:00:34.219> and<00:00:35.219> then<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.850> way<00:00:35.969> you

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
dull side down and then that way you

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.139 
dull side down and then that way you
sort<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.420> create<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:37.410> large<00:00:38.149> bamboo

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
sort of create this one large bamboo

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.869 
sort of create this one large bamboo
piece<00:00:40.040> now<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.100> next<00:00:41.399> step<00:00:41.579> we're<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
piece now the next step we're going to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.869 
piece now the next step we're going to
create<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.719> cone<00:00:43.290> out<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.890> by<00:00:44.219> folding<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
create a cone out of this by folding the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.510 
create a cone out of this by folding the
two<00:00:45.030> ends<00:00:45.420> together<00:00:45.890> like<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:49.520> bringing

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
two ends together like so and bringing

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.369 
two ends together like so and bringing
the<00:00:50.610> tops<00:00:50.850> together<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.899> they<00:00:52.020> run<00:00:52.170> parallel

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the tops together so they run parallel

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.680 
the tops together so they run parallel
to<00:00:52.770> each<00:00:52.890> other<00:00:53.070> when<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> sort<00:00:54.570> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
to each other when you have this sort of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.619 
to each other when you have this sort of
cone<00:00:54.899> shape<00:00:55.940> now<00:00:56.940> we're<00:00:57.090> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> fill<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
cone shape now we're going to fill the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.200 
cone shape now we're going to fill the
bottom<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.260> with<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.890> nice<00:00:59.609> spoonful<00:01:00.149> of

can assist you in that process so
basically<00:01:37.380> put<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.679> that<00:01:39.859> fold<00:01:40.859> it<00:01:41.009> around

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.609 

now<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.789> have<00:01:44.969> some<00:01:45.149> extra<00:01:45.420> bamboo<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.500> know

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
now you have some extra bamboo you know

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.469 
now you have some extra bamboo you know
up<00:01:46.829> top<00:01:47.039> and<00:01:47.459> you<00:01:47.520> basically<00:01:47.939> could<00:01:48.359> either

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
up top and you basically could either

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.730 
up top and you basically could either
fall<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.959> left<00:01:49.079> or<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.349> right<00:01:49.380> doesn't

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
fall to the left or the right doesn't

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.959 
fall to the left or the right doesn't
really<00:01:49.950> matter<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:52.219> now<00:01:53.219> we<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.729> sort

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
really matter so now we have this sort

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.469 
really matter so now we have this sort
of<00:01:54.090> triangular<00:01:54.569> shaped<00:01:55.700> package<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.000> now

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
of triangular shaped package and now

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.459 
of triangular shaped package and now
we're<00:01:57.629> going<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.780> wrap<00:01:57.959> it<00:01:57.989> up<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> what<00:02:01.409> I

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
we're going to wrap it up so what I

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.529 
we're going to wrap it up so what I
suggest<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:02.219> first<00:02:02.489> cutting<00:02:02.939> up<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> tying

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
suggest is first cutting up and tying

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.749 
suggest is first cutting up and tying
the<00:02:03.810> strings<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.379> a<00:02:04.409> place<00:02:04.679> where<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.549> can

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the strings to a place where you can

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.550 
the strings to a place where you can
wrap<00:02:06.209> them<00:02:06.390> really<00:02:06.629> easily<00:02:06.989> and<00:02:07.259> have<00:02:07.379> them

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
wrap them really easily and have them

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.440 
wrap them really easily and have them
just<00:02:07.739> dangling<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.579> then<00:02:09.000> you'll<00:02:09.119> cut<00:02:09.299> them

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
just dangling and then you'll cut them

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.279 
just dangling and then you'll cut them
all<00:02:09.569> down

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
all down

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.839 
all down
once<00:02:10.709> you're<00:02:10.829> finished<00:02:10.859> and<00:02:11.519> when<00:02:11.730> they're

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
once you're finished and when they're

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.610 
once you're finished and when they're
ready<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.120> boil<00:02:12.299> but<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.290> just<00:02:13.470> basically

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
ready to boil but you just basically

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.220 
ready to boil but you just basically
take<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.069> string<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:15.629> in<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.840> center<00:02:16.109> of

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
take a string and just in the center of

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.039 
take a string and just in the center of
it<00:02:16.940> you're<00:02:17.940> going<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> wrap<00:02:19.730> your<00:02:20.730> thumbs<00:02:21.090> as

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
it you're going to wrap your thumbs as

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.559 
it you're going to wrap your thumbs as
tightly<00:02:22.890> as<00:02:23.069> possible<00:02:23.639> because<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.299> don't

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
tightly as possible because you don't

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.879 
tightly as possible because you don't
want<00:02:24.720> anything<00:02:24.959> falling<00:02:25.290> out<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.769> when

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:25.889 
want anything falling out of it when

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:34.400 
want anything falling out of it when
you're<00:02:26.329> boiling<00:02:27.329> this<00:02:30.859> tie<00:02:31.859> it<00:02:31.920> once<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:34.260> you

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
you're boiling this tie it once and you

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.949 
you're boiling this tie it once and you
can<00:02:34.650> either<00:02:35.069> knot<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.639> or<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:36.239> can<00:02:36.450> just<00:02:36.720> loop

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
can either knot it or you can just loop

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.319 
can either knot it or you can just loop
it<00:02:37.079> around<00:02:37.200> like<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:39.030> way<00:02:39.180> it's

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
it around like this and that way it's

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.509 
it around like this and that way it's
easy<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:40.440> know<00:02:40.560> open<00:02:41.069> up<00:02:41.160> when<00:02:41.400> you're

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
easy to you know open up when you're

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.390 
easy to you know open up when you're
done<00:02:42.230> cooking<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.349> but<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:44.130> doesn't<00:02:44.280> matter

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
done cooking it but it doesn't matter

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.569 
done cooking it but it doesn't matter
either<00:02:44.730> way<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.769> that's<00:02:46.769> how<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.069> wrap<00:02:47.340> it

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
either way and that's how you wrap it

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.760 
either way and that's how you wrap it
