00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 jensen van tt welcome to another new playboy today a sly whiting fell 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.090
 on the site lazy 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.960
 what wonderful cards I had to go for the ride over card goes a lot 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.140
 say you wanted to see play that was affordable for everyone on it 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.029
 the market was new and new cd player this is really common of the best 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.800
 players this year was more played m 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.750
 It is a very cheap is about a hundred cabaret and he sells with 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.170
 happiness just by I have to say with happiness because doing it is a bit 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.740
 always doubtful with 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.439
 that at the moment but good when selling after a while to the 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.570
 positive points of this player gives so first may have between in between 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.400
 thinks it played a third child with 10 made 9 goals and 68 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.880
 of the 21 dems in which nine times they already think chris after seeing my ten 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.210
 that I used to see the team with June or almost a head start 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.730
 actually a demo had 16 and the man behind the finches or nine goals 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.950
 and 68 is actually very good so that is just fine that we are there 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.130
 actually not so many complaints with it because I naturally use it 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.670
 is not like I was forced to play on him and therefore more to a basic place 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.950
 could make more dribbling actions with one and make them even more loop action joker 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.060
 takes must score no kempo used like me 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.010
 would normally use a team if I had squad images or something in for example 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.910
 that direction goal 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.990
 let's look at the strongest layman some things that stand out and that 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.010
 are centimeters ps 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.690
 card that 84 reason between people or 50 drive 92 a dribble one 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 and 89 fish comes that such a combination has 3fm deadly good dribble 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.020
 very good pace and very good fish head for it and that is very content 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.960
 In addition, he also has another 82 bells but who really get over it 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.730
 is strong and about peacock the public transportation has long passed by all defense 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.870
 without falling to the ground, he even knows how to defend Saab 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.260
 because it has more fish kohl than some defenders and therefore has 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.630
 he 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.539
 it is actually very good for the like striker 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.920
 garden in the rush kum we put you can of course not british is a chase like 

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:54.819
 Welcome you with his second informed card to extend two Tuesday keep in shape 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.749
 card times used pocket striker with which I really had an 8 denys 21 goals 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:01.920
 are here to play who needs to map is better 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.509
 dance in shape if you want one I would definitely go for the team 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:06.470
 civic card 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.070
 by your why go shoot he is not the most consistent tune the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.640
 differences yuting is 80 and I have to say that you sometimes notice that at 80 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.640
 hoesen did not call with both legs on zarren fake card it is not so fast 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.279
 and expect 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:24.869
 he actually shoots not very nice finesse us things like that when you're with 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:28.509
 really do a shoot before they powershot they are he wanted a light one 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.549
 shock powers made good use of, of course there is also a lot going on 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.079
 wings and that means that he must be able to cost well but yes that they are finished 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.199
 card does cost a good life and with that really has a number 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.119
 very nice races given that they also see of course in the clips that are here 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.809
 So 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:46.949
 all in all it is really gigantic gigantic good to play against 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:48.449
 these benefits 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.069
 those are actually a number of points that are 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.179
 who actually superfast once that he grow fisherman college really really good 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.279
 that she is good crossend and that she is three although good in addition has two 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.859
 cons the socialite people exactly occupies the decision was the occasional one 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.709
 little povel in misses that it is not quite true that he is just not right 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.169
 continued and of course to do this with such a majority of people being involved in this pilot 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:11.109
 hope you and seems to leave behind more hope that he wants to prove namely 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.789
 through the water again
