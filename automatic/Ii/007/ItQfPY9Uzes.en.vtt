00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
they've changed it with half slabs as

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.710 
they've changed it with half slabs as
well<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:11.129> now<00:02:11.340> if<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.580> put<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:12.030> half<00:02:12.209> slab<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
well so now if we put a half slab on the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.390 
well so now if we put a half slab on the
top

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
top

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.580 
top
part<00:02:13.819> you<00:02:14.540> put<00:02:14.750> redstone<00:02:14.959> on<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.409> but<00:02:15.530> it

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
part you put redstone on it but it

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.039 
part you put redstone on it but it
doesn't<00:02:15.860> work<00:02:15.890> with<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.189> bottom<00:02:16.579> part

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
doesn't work with the bottom part

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.149 
doesn't work with the bottom part
because<00:02:18.049> it's<00:02:18.470> kind<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:18.799> just<00:02:19.069> the

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
because it's kind of like just the

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.520 
because it's kind of like just the
bottom<00:02:19.459> half<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.879> block<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.930> also<00:02:21.260> i<00:02:21.290> just

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
bottom half of the block and also i just

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.660 
bottom half of the block and also i just

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
noticed that huh sandstone is kind of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.610 
noticed that huh sandstone is kind of
different<00:02:25.819> textures<00:02:26.299> but<00:02:27.049> yeah<00:02:27.470> that's

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620

week's I didn't do last week's because

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.399 
week's I didn't do last week's because
there<00:02:44.120> wasn't<00:02:44.239> that<00:02:44.390> much<00:02:44.569> stuff<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.019> cover

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
there wasn't that much stuff to cover

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.890 
there wasn't that much stuff to cover
but<00:02:46.069> it<00:02:46.129> can<00:02:46.220> now<00:02:46.340> put<00:02:46.549> levers<00:02:46.879> on<00:02:47.150> ceilings

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
but it can now put levers on ceilings

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.080 
but it can now put levers on ceilings
it's<00:02:48.799> pretty<00:02:49.040> much<00:02:49.129> the<00:02:49.190> big<00:02:49.609> thing<00:02:49.819> that<00:02:50.000> was

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
it's pretty much the big thing that was

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.740 
it's pretty much the big thing that was
in<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.269> but<00:02:51.109> um<00:02:51.319> oh<00:02:51.879> one<00:02:52.879> more<00:02:53.060> thing<00:02:53.120> I'm<00:02:53.510> just

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
in it but um oh one more thing I'm just

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.860 
in it but um oh one more thing I'm just
so<00:02:53.870> forgetful<00:02:54.819> it's<00:02:55.819> listed<00:02:56.239> here<00:02:56.389> villagers

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
so forgetful it's listed here villagers

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.839 
so forgetful it's listed here villagers
will<00:02:57.049> remove<00:02:57.379> trade<00:02:57.799> options<00:02:58.040> after<00:02:58.549> the

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
will remove trade options after the

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.690 
will remove trade options after the
option<00:02:59.269> has<00:02:59.389> been<00:02:59.569> used<00:02:59.750> 32<00:03:00.109> 15<00:03:00.650> times<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:01.670> I

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
option has been used 32 15 times so I

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.399 
option has been used 32 15 times so I
guess<00:03:01.849> it's<00:03:01.909> kind<00:03:02.239> of<00:03:02.269> random<00:03:02.450> if<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.870> use<00:03:03.139> if

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:03.409 
guess it's kind of random if you use if

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.379 
guess it's kind of random if you use if
you<00:03:03.500> trade<00:03:03.709> with<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.889> villager<00:03:04.340> between<00:03:05.060> 3<00:03:05.269> and

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
you trade with a villager between 3 and

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.470 
you trade with a villager between 3 and
15<00:03:05.510> times<00:03:06.049> any<00:03:06.409> one<00:03:06.950> of<00:03:06.980> those<00:03:07.220> times<00:03:07.579> they<00:03:08.329> can

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
15 times any one of those times they can

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.580 
15 times any one of those times they can
just<00:03:08.510> stop<00:03:08.780> trade<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.290> you<00:03:09.379> won't<00:03:09.530> be

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
just stop trade and that you won't be

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.679 
just stop trade and that you won't be
