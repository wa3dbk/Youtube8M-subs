augmentation non-surgical chin
augmentation<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.809> great<00:00:55.289> option<00:00:55.530> when

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
augmentation is a great option when

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.849 
augmentation is a great option when
we're<00:00:56.520> non<00:00:57.000> surgically<00:00:57.539> enhancing<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.620> chin

we're non surgically enhancing a chin

we're non surgically enhancing a chin
the<00:00:59.190> filler<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.640> placed<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.570> same<00:01:00.750> area

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the filler is placed in the same area

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.349 
the filler is placed in the same area
but<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.530> placed<00:01:01.800> using<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> needle<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.760> stand

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
but it's placed using a needle and stand

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.679 
but it's placed using a needle and stand
in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> office<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.210> three<00:01:09.479> options

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
in the office so we have three options

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.469 
in the office so we have three options
for<00:01:10.049> chin<00:01:10.590> augmentation<00:01:10.740> my<00:01:11.640> favorite<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
for chin augmentation my favorite is the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.200 
for chin augmentation my favorite is the
radius<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.500> tends<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.830> last<00:01:14.130> longer<00:01:14.670> last

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
radius as it tends to last longer last

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.390 
radius as it tends to last longer last
year<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:16.080> thicker<00:01:16.409> than<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> pearline<00:01:17.159> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
year it's thicker than the pearline is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.030 
year it's thicker than the pearline is
which<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.150> over<00:01:18.930> gel-like<00:01:19.470> substance

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
which is over gel-like substance

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.710 
which is over gel-like substance
if<00:01:21.220> you're<00:01:21.400> not<00:01:21.520> sure<00:01:21.580> about<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.300> nonce

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
if you're not sure about the nonce

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.360 
if you're not sure about the nonce
resolution<00:01:23.200> occupation<00:01:23.800> it's<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:23.980> good<00:01:24.190> option

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
resolution occupation it's a good option

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.000 
resolution occupation it's a good option
because<00:01:24.640> it's<00:01:24.970> reversible<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.990> not<00:01:26.770> as<00:01:26.890> much

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
because it's reversible and not as much

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.310 
because it's reversible and not as much
of<00:01:27.160> a<00:01:27.220> commitment<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:27.850> process<00:01:31.320> first

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
of a commitment to the process first

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.780 
of a commitment to the process first
thing<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:32.620> do<00:01:32.680> is<00:01:32.950> draw<00:01:33.160> where<00:01:33.430> we're<00:01:33.580> going<00:01:33.730> to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
thing I do is draw where we're going to

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.250 
thing I do is draw where we're going to
do<00:01:33.910> some<00:01:34.120> of<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.300> augmentation<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.110> we're

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
do some of the augmentation so we're

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.140 
do some of the augmentation so we're
going<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.470> enhance<00:01:36.040> this<00:01:36.370> part<00:01:36.670> of<00:01:36.790> your<00:01:36.880> chin

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
going to enhance this part of your chin

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.090 
going to enhance this part of your chin
and<00:01:37.810> I'm<00:01:37.900> also<00:01:38.080> going<00:01:38.260> to<00:01:38.320> do<00:01:38.410> a<00:01:38.440> little<00:01:38.800> bit

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
and I'm also going to do a little bit

00:01:39.100 --> 00:02:02.970 
and I'm also going to do a little bit
along<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:40.000> jawline<00:02:01.200> when<00:02:02.200> doing<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.620> surgical

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
along the jawline when doing a surgical

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.850 
along the jawline when doing a surgical
chin<00:02:03.400> augmentation<00:02:03.960> silastic<00:02:04.960> chin<00:02:05.500> implant

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
chin augmentation silastic chin implant

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.190 
chin augmentation silastic chin implant
is<00:02:06.100> used<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:07.180> goes<00:02:07.390> along<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.870> board<00:02:08.080> of

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
is used and this goes along the board of

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.530 
is used and this goes along the board of
the<00:02:08.290> mandible<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.950> can<00:02:09.550> improve<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.090> profile

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
the mandible and can improve the profile

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.020 
the mandible and can improve the profile
and<00:02:10.780> here's<00:02:11.440> an<00:02:11.560> example<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:12.430> this

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and here's an example of that in this

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.690 
and here's an example of that in this
gentleman<00:02:13.630> with<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.930> very<00:02:14.320> small<00:02:14.620> chin<00:02:14.950> we<00:02:15.610> were

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
gentleman with a very small chin we were

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.600 
gentleman with a very small chin we were
able<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.180> greatly<00:02:16.930> enhance<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.710> profile<00:02:18.340> by

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
able to greatly enhance this profile by

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.370 
able to greatly enhance this profile by
adding<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.090> large<00:02:19.330> chin<00:02:19.840> implant

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
adding a large chin implant

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.340 
adding a large chin implant
and<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:21.670> is<00:02:21.790> an<00:02:21.910> example<00:02:22.240> where<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.990> chin

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
and this is an example where a chin

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.320 
and this is an example where a chin
augmentation<00:02:23.880> combined<00:02:24.880> with<00:02:25.090> liposuction

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
augmentation combined with liposuction

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.020 
augmentation combined with liposuction
can<00:02:26.290> improve<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.800> proportion<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.550> someone's

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
can improve the proportion of someone's

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.480 
can improve the proportion of someone's
face<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.650> what<00:02:29.830> I<00:02:29.860> like<00:02:30.040> about<00:02:30.220> the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
face this is what I like about the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.670 
face this is what I like about the
