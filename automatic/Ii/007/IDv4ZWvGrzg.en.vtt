yellow championship yeah yeah I wonder

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.830 
yellow championship yeah yeah I wonder
whether<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.910> was<00:02:31.060> just<00:02:31.240> because<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.540> didn't

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
whether it was just because we didn't

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.500 
whether it was just because we didn't
know<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.110> much<00:02:32.620> then<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.880> know<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.030> think<00:02:34.180> I

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
know so much then you know I think I

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.920 
know so much then you know I think I
think<00:02:34.540> with<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.650> with<00:02:36.070> modern<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:37.120> know<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
think with the with modern you know the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.900 
think with the with modern you know the
world<00:02:38.230> being<00:02:38.620> such<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.860> small<00:02:39.190> place<00:02:39.340> in<00:02:39.460> terms

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
world being such a small place in terms

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.430 
world being such a small place in terms
of<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> internet<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:40.840> then<00:02:40.990> obviously

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
of the internet and then obviously

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.270 
of the internet and then obviously
travel<00:02:42.270> texting<00:02:43.500> we<00:02:44.500> also<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.920> know<00:02:45.160> about

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
travel texting we also to know about

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.100 
travel texting we also to know about
everything<00:02:45.640> all<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.450> time

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
everything all the time

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.210 
everything all the time
and<00:02:47.590> so<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:47.920> just<00:02:48.370> think<00:02:48.580> there<00:02:49.150> isn't<00:02:49.450> that

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
and so I just think there isn't that

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.790 
and so I just think there isn't that
there<00:02:51.220> isn't<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.640> sort<00:02:51.940> of<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.500> mystery<00:02:53.500> that

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
there isn't that sort of a mystery that

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.900 
there isn't that sort of a mystery that
they<00:02:53.920> use<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.220> be<00:02:54.310> out<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.400> know<00:02:54.550> it's<00:02:54.790> that

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
they use to be out you know it's that

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.330 
they use to be out you know it's that
sort<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.270> thing<00:02:55.330> where<00:02:55.890> almost<00:02:56.890> what<00:02:57.250> you

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
sort of thing where almost what you

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.930 
sort of thing where almost what you
don't<00:02:57.580> know<00:02:58.290> it's<00:02:59.290> more<00:02:59.530> special<00:02:59.739> salad<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.910> I
