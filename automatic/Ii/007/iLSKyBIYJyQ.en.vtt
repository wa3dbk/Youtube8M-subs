00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.770
 Hello dear friends with you not 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.630
 tried and welcome to make up new 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.350
 board 1 4 2 which came out on October 25 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.119
 but not yet today 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.119
 and leaving and yesterday or the day before 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.769
 I will tell them in this video how little 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.189
 a little man about subjects 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.430
 a little bit about the items that 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.560
 For the first time, I added a carpet edge 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.170
 let's start with the fact that this one is beautiful 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.960
 a pillar that is visible from afar 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.960
 it's called beacon this new update 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.350
 and strange 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.460
 but then the official 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.040
 here 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.380
 in general, no need to invent tricks 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.150
 light stumbling 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.260
 now you can put build 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.640
 here is such a beacon 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.280
 but of course the lighthouse is expensive 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340
 because we need 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.189
 move at least three of them native 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.480
 more precisely not a third but 3 by 3 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.590
 that is, theorist at least 9 blocks of emeralds 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.330
 and each 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.610
 km and now let's say much easier 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.000
 documents at home cutesy effects we 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.830
 we get the effect let's say it now 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.150
 soul mark and got 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.270
 AIDS 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.390
 i.e. print speeds are very fast 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.390
 funny eyes on pretty 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.680
 I walk quickly 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.719
 Well, that's the same 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.800
 for the sake of criticism of the republic 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.280
 then hotels 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.890
 that is, you can now make this 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.049
 workshop 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.770
 he added Kokoits 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.420
 cool item 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.140
 that is now possible 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.300
 what hatch dyes what 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.370
 that is, the ears become more 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.210
 realistic nko all adds and adds 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.530
 here 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.400
 in the very need of such things 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.159
 head motors 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.159
 well, god for scenery 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.860
 can heads 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.119
 Russian tons for example 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.099
 percent 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.510
 n here is a fireplace for old age tactics like 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.949
 the scenery here 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:18.080
 something else 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.299
 there are new types of species 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.169
 but this is certainly not for us 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:24.679
 theme of warp 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:26.819
 in year 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.780
 but what else is there 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.639
 multi percent accounts 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:32.530
 upper arm 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.940
 and not all over the world 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.120
 top it now we can see the flying 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.870
 mouse yes yes we only need to find a cave 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.850
 mobs and we can see the real 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.219
 bats tract year 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.319
 I remembered them here in this world 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.429
 individuals will share the call 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:52.239
 only some viewers will not understand the score 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.809
 where 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:58.069
 they got me a cover 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.399
 as far as I know it is not for spam yet 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.399
 can't 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.189
 he is a big panda what edge i mean 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.009
 have a listening 2 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:10.020
 Osaka 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.739
 interest by law 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.889
 otherworldly rooms 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.819
 fund endowment measures nothing 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.999
 has changed 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.949
 also boru it puts blocks 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.939
 nudists lack this site from 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.769
 competitor through the text 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.860
 what up to the institute im they really like me 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:29.439
 here 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.770
 concerning 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.689
 of hope 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.180
 but not clothing protection has changed she 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.849
 changed texture kavod 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.099
 and here itself have a new subject like him 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.329
 falls arcade 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.379
 Yes 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.200
 at dawn, start nazvi passing the prize raised 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.719
 star need 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.599
 if this is known we can already do 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.780
 lighthouse 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.360
 but since it is impossible to remember him 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.660
 I think so and go myself 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.029
 the Spaniard 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.849
 and therefore you cannot remember him therefore 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.039
 the lighthouse can only be read when 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:05.460
 Recreational Yerkir Teaching Aid 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.650
 and here is any program 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.139
 for example Russia 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.659
 units 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:14.409
 opening of the river 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.459
 as for bad 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.139
 to us the fruit of the ship 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.210
 so here it is 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.240
 materials media materials media what 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.050
 except vodka 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.690
 remember when we clicked on the map to us 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.409
 I had to attack cast 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.409
 touches or walk to 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.080
 opening with the kid 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.559
 Smoths to the diet Samaria are generated 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.559
 that is, we can already see 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.710
 where and what 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.710
 but of course if esata to this card is that 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:54.539
 she doesn't follow us that is 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:55.639
 I wish she would 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.580
 comedy now that mobile phone is gone 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.809
 little thing 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:03.809
 Well, in general, that's gone from the map 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:07.240
 and better panarin citroen generated 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.860
 still 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.330
 more experience 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.300
 or you could understand the scale know how 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.250
 from there, the state 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.779
 percent this is the closest let's say 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:21.779
 I am the smallest and here is the smallest 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.979
 we could defeat almost all the land 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.659
 but which we need 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:32.539
 well, to whom is god 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.889
 but a new picture 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.210
 here 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.210
 just do not remember what we do in general 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.949
 and I didnâ€™t even say something I forgot to say in 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.009
 Generally there are a lot of things changed 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.650
 here 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.139
 so 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.139
 I can say something wrong 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.800
 need to think about the future 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.680
 little tweet-like mocha 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:10.770
 also changed the paper 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.199
 Well, I think you have someone who smokes experience 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.199
 I think the game will not list 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.610
 and I remembered here 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.490
 in my opinion that kashin is secondary 

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:35.059
 in Poland so that successfully that again 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:39.650
 balance 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.650
 then flank mustafa al 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.180
 thanks to all rumors 

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:53.939
 but next year 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:06:58.759
 will be 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:01.379
 or rather leg newsweek magazine shocked 

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.159
 or otherwise and as edinichki children 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:05.490
 if he was of course 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.749
 I do not know 

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:10.749
 why 5 ml right 

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:15.599
 more precisely 1 4 2 

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:18.599
 budget habits say 1 3 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.830
 and planted his house 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:27.159
 also when we click on the yacht to 

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:29.539
 politician slick function 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:32.539
 project language and from the place of his kartakayev 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.099
 one thing is clear then I think 

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:40.099
 let's finish it 

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:43.909
 In general, here is this video you can say 

00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:46.179
 useless 

00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:48.729
 but I still had to take off at all. 

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:50.529
 congratulations lover we like that with this 

00:07:50.529 --> 00:07:52.729
 way out 

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:55.389
 his was the Nation 

00:07:55.389 --> 00:07:57.399
 thank you all for watching 

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:58.379
 bye everyone
