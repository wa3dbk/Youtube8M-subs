wanted to be able to run come
to<00:01:58.760> have<00:01:58.940> a<00:01:58.970> reasonable<00:01:59.630> downhill<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.950> lot

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
to have a reasonable downhill so a lot

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.340 
to have a reasonable downhill so a lot
of<00:02:01.850> things<00:02:02.120> going<00:02:02.390> in<00:02:02.540> my<00:02:02.660> head<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:02.870> wanted<00:02:03.230> to

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
of things going in my head I wanted to

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.440 
of things going in my head I wanted to
tie<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:03.830> wanted<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.160> get<00:02:04.280> that's<00:02:04.460> record

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
tie that I wanted to get that's record

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.310

now<00:02:07.220> I<00:02:07.250> guess<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.270> technically<00:02:08.810> it's<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.170> tie

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
now I guess and technically it's a tie
