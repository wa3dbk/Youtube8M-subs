00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hey guitars friend is beautiful friday 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.549
 and nice that you're here again because 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.720
 this video is about which one 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.790
 Attitude is actually the right one 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.790
 this or diesel 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.219
 a lot of guitar players are playing along 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.290
 the guitar here on the right 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.180
 thighs and some play too 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.830
 here on the left thigh in 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.240
 this form and there wanted one 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.710
 certain years know what is then 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.640
 right is this attitude is the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.600
 better or or is it this here or 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.340
 how should I proceed 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.800
 and here is the answer if you 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.660
 so you have learned the guitar and with 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.660
 always play this attitude and 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.360
 then get along and play with it 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.580
 this attitude is the attitude that continues 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.129
 as good or as bad as 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.440
 which indeed it is both but is 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.330
 so if you one you will rise from scratch 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.550
 Will you start recommending this attitude? 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.470
 and not this one is because of it 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.720
 that they are easier to imitate at home 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.979
 can and the errors are less if 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.940
 you have been here this your life long 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.120
 and maybe with one 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.979
 play football then it is optimal with 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.479
 the attitude to continue like this 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.979
 besides, it also applies to the way for 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.930
 the electric guitar if you like that 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.490
 electric guitar game for technical stuff 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.520
 very well suited this attitude 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.180
 then keep learning so it's not a problem 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.320
 if you start only then it works 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.210
 of course on the right 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.460
 thigh is going on for you otherwise 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.050
 neither it nor that is neither good 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.270
 still bad it is easy with this 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.520
 attitude is much more comfortable and it is 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.110
 You can do a lot for hours 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.060
 play easier without you 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.730
 it is cramped and with this attitude it is 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.760
 so the neck jana is much denser 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.920
 my body is tuned and I am here too 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.810
 again a little easier to see 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.040
 what I can play and that is for 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.260
 of course not bad either 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.610
 but above all, what I'm doing here completely 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.900
 great find his ducks from the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.300
 technical possibilities are not 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.400
 Technique exercises then I do the 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.050
 mostly with this attitude and me 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.460
 It's great, you see me 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.320
 constantly with this attitude 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.360
 here but I think it's great too 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.670
 durchzuwechseln times between and 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.340
 when i play the guitars then play 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.159
 I think the guitar is more like that 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.750
 a little bit weird like this one 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.790
 Of course, always mind that here 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.010
 also with my and with my right 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.690
 poor always 90 degree angle pictures so 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.780
 Here, too, the elbow remains loose 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.639
 get out or purely a wrist 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.770
 here with the ball of your hand also not 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.900
 against pressures or even 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.910
 but in the thumb just beautiful 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.200
 go on the back of the neck and so on 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.970
 So the rules of one 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200
 correct attitude I blind the video 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.150
 also here again that you then still 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.860
 can click on it if you if you 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.390
 because still have questions on the topic how will 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.370
 The attitude is done right now 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.440
 questioned Friday blow but as I said 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.570
 neither good nor bad is both 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.250
 possible really great is even if you 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.110
 in between times can change 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.850
 if you play for several hours then 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.890
 Do you want to take this attitude? 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.320
 change a bit and so on 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.150
 therefore a great alternative and still 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.370
 sometimes if you have been playing for a while and the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.800
 attitude has always been so with you 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.020
 get right then let the attitude so 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.390
 as she is wonderful there is no 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.150
 something to learn just because of it 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.890
 somehow one should do it 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.740
 so if you always do what 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.670
 works well please stay with it 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.860
 Incidentally, mistakes can be made 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.810
 recognize it super if something somewhere 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.260
 but it is almost too bad 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.210
 late 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.100
 so if you have pain in somewhere 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.400
 the fingers in the shoulders in the neck 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.530
 and in the back then it is usually already 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.270
 too late but you know okay since you did 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.190
 did something wrong with the attitude 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.209
 there you should the attitude video 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.250
 and really look 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.810
 check if everything fits okay that's it 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.250
 Even on the question Friday I wish 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.050
 have a nice weekend 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.650
 take care of yourself your georgenberg to 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.650
 next time bye
