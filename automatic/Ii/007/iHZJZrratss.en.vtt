00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
problems the problem has been always

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.490 
problems the problem has been always
trying<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.210> connect<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.689> Julian<00:01:34.320> said

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
when people call us I'm always like call

when people call us I'm always like call
the<00:01:36.630> local<00:01:36.810> gym<00:01:37.200> find<00:01:37.829> out<00:01:37.979> who<00:01:38.130> they're<00:01:38.280> using

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
the local gym find out who they're using

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.039 
the local gym find out who they're using
well<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:39.030> think<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.420> that's<00:01:39.600> grossly

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
well we think that that's grossly

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.780 
well we think that that's grossly
inefficient<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.890> finally<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.759> a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
inefficient and finally we have a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.690 
inefficient and finally we have a
solution<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.659> my<00:01:42.750> most<00:01:43.549> we're<00:01:44.549> going

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
solution and that is my most we're going

seven<00:02:09.420> days<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:10.709> idea<00:02:11.039> here<00:02:11.280> though<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.870> we

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
seven days the idea here though is we

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.600 
seven days the idea here though is we
think<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.260> there's<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.500> lot<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.680> slack<00:02:14.099> in<00:02:14.129> the

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
think that there's a lot of slack in the

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.339 
think that there's a lot of slack in the
communication<00:02:15.420> between<00:02:15.510> finding<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.140> right

Kairos<00:02:21.569> we're<00:02:21.780> working<00:02:22.019> next<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.290> physical

therapist or working next to physicians

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.030 
therapist or working next to physicians
and<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:24.959> know<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.319> that's<00:02:25.560> not<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.769> case

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
and we know is that that's not the case

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.740 
and we know is that that's not the case
and<00:02:26.370> finally<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.060> feel<00:02:27.239> like<00:02:27.330> we<00:02:27.510> have<00:02:27.540> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
and finally we feel like we have a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.270 
and finally we feel like we have a
platform<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.410> start<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.769> connect<00:02:29.129> that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
platform to start to connect that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.309 
platform to start to connect that
multidisciplinary<00:02:29.580> approach<00:02:30.390> we<00:02:30.930> know<00:02:31.079> works

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
multidisciplinary approach we know works

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.199 
multidisciplinary approach we know works
the<00:02:31.829> other<00:02:31.980> idea<00:02:32.310> though<00:02:32.489> is<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:33.090> know

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
the other idea though is that you know

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.690 
the other idea though is that you know
as<00:02:33.450> people<00:02:33.690> can<00:02:33.989> attest<00:02:34.290> not<00:02:34.890> every<00:02:35.310> provider

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
as people can attest not every provider

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.789 
as people can attest not every provider
is<00:02:35.879> necessarily<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.569> good<00:02:36.989> match<00:02:37.319> in<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
is necessarily a good match in the

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.800 
is necessarily a good match in the
performance<00:02:38.220> realm<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:39.030> one<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.360> our<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
performance realm and one of our the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.569 
performance realm and one of our the
jokes<00:02:40.140> has<00:02:40.319> always<00:02:40.560> been<00:02:40.680> our<00:02:40.890> memes<00:02:41.129> has<00:02:41.430> been

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
jokes has always been our memes has been

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.160 
jokes has always been our memes has been
hey<00:02:41.849> how<00:02:42.450> do<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.599> find<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.900> good<00:02:43.019> physical

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
hey how do I find a good physical

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.600 
hey how do I find a good physical
therapist<00:02:43.620> well<00:02:43.799> she's<00:02:44.040> probably<00:02:44.280> dead

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
lifting right next to them right so we

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.130 
lifting right next to them right so we
finally<00:02:46.890> figured<00:02:47.400> out<00:02:47.579> is<00:02:47.849> that<00:02:48.030> it's<00:02:48.510> time<00:02:48.810> to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
finally figured out is that it's time to

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.410 
finally figured out is that it's time to
connect<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.849> athlete<00:02:50.849> with<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.090> provider

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
connect the athlete with the provider

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
and just get rid of the middleman that

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.789 
and just get rid of the middleman that
middleman<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.090> space<00:02:54.900> between<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.560> and
