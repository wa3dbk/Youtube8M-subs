00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
I'm like kind of struggling to do that

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.509 
I'm like kind of struggling to do that
once<00:00:50.679> you've<00:00:50.769> done<00:00:50.890> that<00:00:50.949> then<00:00:51.249> you<00:00:51.370> basically

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
once you've done that then you basically

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.479 
once you've done that then you basically
just<00:00:51.730> take<00:00:51.940> this<00:00:52.239> off<00:00:52.480> and<00:00:52.809> then<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:53.440> put

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
just take this off and then you put

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.000 
just take this off and then you put
these<00:00:54.489> you<00:00:54.850> put<00:00:55.030> two<00:00:55.210> more<00:00:55.449> Birds<00:00:56.319> birch

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
these you put two more Birds birch

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.910 
these you put two more Birds birch
stairs<00:00:57.339> like<00:00:57.579> so<00:00:58.229> then<00:00:59.229> in<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.499> middle<00:00:59.769> you

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
stairs like so then in the middle you

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.799 
stairs like so then in the middle you
want<00:01:00.069> to<00:01:00.190> want<00:01:00.339> to<00:01:00.429> put<00:01:00.670> another<00:01:01.210> dirt<00:01:01.600> block

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
want to want to put another dirt block

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.530 
want to want to put another dirt block
like<00:01:02.019> here<00:01:02.379> I<00:01:02.409> guess<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:04.239> you're<00:01:04.390> going

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
like here I guess and then you're going

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.889 
like here I guess and then you're going
to<00:01:04.629> want<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:04.930> just<00:01:05.430> put<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.640> next<00:01:07.600> set<00:01:07.869> of

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
to want to just put the next set of

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.109 
to want to just put the next set of
stairs<00:01:08.259> like<00:01:08.409> so<00:01:08.710> so<00:01:09.490> this<00:01:09.640> is<00:01:09.729> going<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:09.939> give

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
stairs like so so this is going to give

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.480 
stairs like so so this is going to give
it<00:01:10.270> kind<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.750> effect<00:01:11.530> like<00:01:11.770> this<00:01:12.009> where<00:01:12.310> it

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
it kind of the effect like this where it

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.980 
it kind of the effect like this where it
makes<00:01:12.729> it<00:01:12.880> look<00:01:13.119> a<00:01:13.149> lot<00:01:13.479> like<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.659> pool<00:01:13.840> table

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
makes it look a lot like a pool table

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.109 
makes it look a lot like a pool table
but<00:01:14.740> doesn't<00:01:15.070> really<00:01:15.219> look<00:01:15.369> whether<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.909> pool

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
but doesn't really look whether the pool

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.359 
but doesn't really look whether the pool
table<00:01:16.450> unless<00:01:16.630> you<00:01:16.960> put<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.439> carpet<00:01:17.860> on<00:01:17.979> it<00:01:18.009> so

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
table unless you put the carpet on it so

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.490 
table unless you put the carpet on it so
then<00:01:18.549> you<00:01:18.579> put<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.060> green<00:01:19.420> carpet<00:01:19.719> on<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.020> top

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
then you put the green carpet on the top

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.830 
then you put the green carpet on the top
layer<00:01:20.710> like<00:01:20.920> so<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.520> then<00:01:22.240> you<00:01:22.360> have<00:01:22.539> this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
layer like so and then you have this

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.690 
layer like so and then you have this
kind<00:01:23.170> of<00:01:23.229> look<00:01:23.469> so<00:01:23.619> now<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:23.860> really<00:01:24.250> does<00:01:24.670> look

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
kind of look so now it really does look

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.819 
kind of look so now it really does look
like<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:25.090> pool<00:01:25.299> table<00:01:25.450> but<00:01:25.780> it's<00:01:25.990> missing<00:01:26.259> some

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
like a pool table but it's missing some

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.609 
like a pool table but it's missing some
of<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.969> you<00:01:28.840> know<00:01:28.869> sticks<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:29.409> you're<00:01:29.530> gonna

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
of the you know sticks that you're gonna

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.069 
of the you know sticks that you're gonna
use<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.950> actually<00:01:30.039> play<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.460> game<00:01:30.640> so<00:01:31.450> it

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
use to actually play the game so it

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.690 
use to actually play the game so it
doesn't<00:01:32.140> really<00:01:32.740> matter<00:01:33.039> where<00:01:33.399> you<00:01:33.460> put<00:01:33.609> the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
doesn't really matter where you put the

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.539 
doesn't really matter where you put the
sticks<00:01:33.969> I<00:01:34.210> recommend<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:34.689> you<00:01:34.750> put<00:01:35.020> them

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
sticks I recommend that you put them

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.639 
sticks I recommend that you put them
kind<00:01:36.549> of<00:01:36.609> somewhere<00:01:36.969> and<00:01:37.210> they<00:01:38.170> should<00:01:38.409> be<00:01:38.530> at

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
kind of somewhere and they should be at

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.170 
kind of somewhere and they should be at
least<00:01:38.680> three<00:01:39.219> blocks<00:01:39.490> high<00:01:39.670> just<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.969> make<00:01:40.060> it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
least three blocks high just to make it

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.480 
least three blocks high just to make it
look<00:01:40.299> a<00:01:40.390> little<00:01:40.479> bit<00:01:40.659> nicer<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.200> so<00:01:42.130> you<00:01:42.189> just

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
look a little bit nicer and so you just

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.029 
look a little bit nicer and so you just
put<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.820> fences<00:01:43.329> up<00:01:43.479> like<00:01:43.719> so<00:01:44.049> and<00:01:44.259> there<00:01:44.950> you

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
put the fences up like so and there you

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.700 
put the fences up like so and there you
