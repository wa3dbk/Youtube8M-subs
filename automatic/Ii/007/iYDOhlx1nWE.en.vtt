the sound and to do that you need this

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.069 
the sound and to do that you need this
extra<00:00:41.840> $30<00:00:42.739> cable<00:00:43.280> from<00:00:43.610> kV<00:00:44.120> connection<00:00:44.690> this

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
extra $30 cable from kV connection this

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.690 
extra $30 cable from kV connection this
allows<00:00:45.350> you<00:00:45.620> to<00:00:45.649> plug<00:00:46.280> in<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:47.239> lavalier<00:00:48.140> mic

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
you can also get a wireless mic but

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.370 
you can also get a wireless mic but
they're<00:00:52.220> more<00:00:52.370> expensive<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:53.510> I<00:00:54.079> don't<00:00:54.230> think

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
they're more expensive and I don't think

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.549 
they're more expensive and I don't think
this<00:00:54.590> sounds<00:00:54.770> quite<00:00:55.250> as<00:00:55.399> good<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.480> as<00:00:57.350> long<00:00:57.500> as

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
this sounds quite as good so as long as

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.920 
this sounds quite as good so as long as
you<00:00:57.739> can<00:00:57.890> shoot<00:00:58.130> within<00:00:58.460> 12<00:00:58.850> feet<00:00:59.149> or<00:00:59.360> so<00:00:59.690> of

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
you can shoot within 12 feet or so of

little<00:01:10.850> clamp<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.569> have<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.229> link<00:01:12.859> to<00:01:13.039> this<00:01:13.189> I

00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:13.819 
little clamp I have a link to this I

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:16.330 
little clamp I have a link to this I
think<00:01:14.149> I<00:01:14.240> bought<00:01:14.420> it<00:01:14.539> on<00:01:14.630> Amazon<00:01:15.109> and<00:01:15.350> then

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
think I bought it on Amazon and then

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.279 
think I bought it on Amazon and then
comes<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.299> question<00:01:17.539> of<00:01:17.929> what<00:01:18.079> kind<00:01:18.229> of

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
comes the question of what kind of

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.019 
comes the question of what kind of
tripod<00:01:18.770> do<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:19.009> want<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.219> use<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.579> lightest

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:20.029 
tripod do you want to use the lightest

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:22.300 
tripod do you want to use the lightest
weight<00:01:20.240> least<00:01:20.600> expensive<00:01:21.109> one<00:01:21.319> is<00:01:21.529> this<00:01:21.740> Joby

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
weight least expensive one is this Joby

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.959 
weight least expensive one is this Joby
one<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:23.299> I<00:01:24.100> think<00:01:25.100> is<00:01:25.189> only<00:01:25.279> about<00:01:25.459> ten<00:01:25.759> dollars

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
one it I think is only about ten dollars

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.149 
one it I think is only about ten dollars
the<00:01:26.749> imitation<00:01:27.229> ones<00:01:27.560> aren't<00:01:27.859> as<00:01:27.979> good

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
the imitation ones aren't as good

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.419 
the imitation ones aren't as good
because<00:01:28.520> this<00:01:28.700> head<00:01:28.999> here<00:01:29.479> will<00:01:29.959> get<00:01:30.429> super

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
because this head here will get super

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.169 
because this head here will get super
loose<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.389> not<00:01:32.689> work<00:01:33.049> that<00:01:33.289> well<00:01:33.499> so<00:01:34.279> I<00:01:34.759> really

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
loose and not work that well so I really

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.849 
loose and not work that well so I really
recommend<00:01:35.450> getting<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:36.079> Joey<00:01:36.259> one<00:01:36.529> paying

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
recommend getting the Joey one paying

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.269 
recommend getting the Joey one paying
extra<00:01:37.099> five<00:01:37.340> bucks<00:01:37.369> or<00:01:38.889> another<00:01:39.889> good<00:01:40.099> option

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:40.279 
extra five bucks or another good option

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:42.480 
extra five bucks or another good option
is<00:01:40.579> just<00:01:40.759> a<00:01:40.849> super<00:01:41.209> lightweight<00:01:41.479> inexpensive

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
is just a super lightweight inexpensive

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.389 
is just a super lightweight inexpensive
regular<00:01:43.490> tripod<00:01:44.060> I<00:01:44.499> think<00:01:45.499> I<00:01:45.560> paid<00:01:45.709> twenty

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
regular tripod I think I paid twenty

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.190 
regular tripod I think I paid twenty
thirty<00:01:46.729> bucks<00:01:46.939> for<00:01:47.149> that<00:01:47.209> one<00:01:47.359> and<00:01:47.599> then

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
thirty bucks for that one and then

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.620 
thirty bucks for that one and then
lastly<00:01:48.590> there's<00:01:49.219> the<00:01:49.310> ultra<00:01:49.880> ultra<00:01:50.209> light<00:01:50.389> way

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
lastly there's the ultra ultra light way

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.469 
lastly there's the ultra ultra light way
which<00:01:51.229> is<00:01:51.349> you<00:01:51.469> take<00:01:51.499> some<00:01:51.889> ski<00:01:52.249> poles<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:52.939> you

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
which is you take some ski poles and you

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.319 
which is you take some ski poles and you
attach<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.619> Joby<00:01:55.099> tripod<00:01:55.549> to<00:01:55.759> it<00:01:55.880> with<00:01:56.299> a

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
attach the Joby tripod to it with a

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.409 
attach the Joby tripod to it with a
string<00:01:56.779> I<00:01:57.139> have<00:01:57.889> a<00:01:57.979> photo<00:01:58.219> that<00:01:58.429> shows<00:01:58.999> how<00:01:59.359> to

00:01:59.409 --> 00:01:59.419 
string I have a photo that shows how to

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:03.129 
string I have a photo that shows how to
do<00:01:59.630> this<00:02:00.639> it's<00:02:01.639> a<00:02:01.759> little<00:02:02.029> tricky<00:02:02.359> to<00:02:02.479> do<00:02:02.689> but

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:03.139 
do this it's a little tricky to do but

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:04.359 
do this it's a little tricky to do but
it's<00:02:03.229> insanely<00:02:03.619> lightweight<00:02:04.130> especially

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
it's insanely lightweight especially

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.209 
it's insanely lightweight especially
considering<00:02:05.239> if<00:02:05.389> you're<00:02:06.169> out<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:06.919> place

external<00:02:29.360> battery<00:02:29.660> source<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:30.980> one<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.250> think

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
external battery source this one I think

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.490 
external battery source this one I think
cost<00:02:31.700> 20<00:02:32.090> bucks<00:02:32.270> or<00:02:34.570> get<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.600> tiny<00:02:36.080> portable

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
cost 20 bucks or get a tiny portable

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.740 
cost 20 bucks or get a tiny portable
solar<00:02:36.860> panel<00:02:37.250> like<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.430> one<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.750> no

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
solar panel like this one so that no

on juice you can save the day and here's

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.360 
on juice you can save the day and here's
how<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.200> setup<00:02:54.980> looks<00:02:55.340> when<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.650> all<00:02:57.650> put

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
how the setup looks when it is all put

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.080 
how the setup looks when it is all put
together<00:02:59.260> we<00:03:00.260> have<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.650> kV<00:03:01.220> connection<00:03:01.670> cable

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
together we have the kV connection cable

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.900 
together we have the kV connection cable
coming<00:03:02.540> out<00:03:02.660> here<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.470> give<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.280> good<00:03:04.459> audio

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910
