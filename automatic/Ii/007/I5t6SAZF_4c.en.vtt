00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.840 
that are shorter and more
and<00:02:16.690> then<00:02:17.170> there's<00:02:17.380> some<00:02:17.590> longer<00:02:18.220> almost<00:02:18.700> like

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
and then there's some longer almost like

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.790 
and then there's some longer almost like
feathery<00:02:19.270> kind<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.660> bristles<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.530> then<00:02:20.710> they

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
feathery kind of bristles and then they

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.400 
feathery kind of bristles and then they
say<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.310> really<00:02:21.610> good<00:02:22.050> for<00:02:23.050> mineral

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
say that this is really good for mineral

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.110 
say that this is really good for mineral
makeup<00:02:23.710> but<00:02:23.860> it's<00:02:24.010> also<00:02:24.160> just<00:02:24.340> very<00:02:24.760> good<00:02:24.940> for

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
makeup but it's also just very good for

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.560 
makeup but it's also just very good for
blending<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.810> kind<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:26.230> really<00:02:26.410> grabs<00:02:27.040> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
blending it kind of it really grabs the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.870 
blending it kind of it really grabs the
pigments<00:02:28.570> well<00:02:28.920> with<00:02:29.920> being<00:02:30.160> two<00:02:30.850> different

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
pigments well with being two different

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.050 
pigments well with being two different
types<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.600> bristles<00:02:32.020> right<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:33.880> have

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
types of bristles right and so we have

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.990 
types of bristles right and so we have
the<00:02:34.420> my<00:02:34.990> first<00:02:35.200> brush<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.580> bigger<00:02:36.880> one
