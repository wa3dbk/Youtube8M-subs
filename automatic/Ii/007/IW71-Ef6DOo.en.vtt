00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.549 
set up this is a very first shot here
really<00:00:43.010> kind<00:00:43.190> of<00:00:43.309> drew<00:00:43.549> my<00:00:43.729> eye<00:00:43.760> because

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
really kind of drew my eye because

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.259 
really kind of drew my eye because
interestingly<00:00:45.559> it's<00:00:46.339> got<00:00:46.729> kind<00:00:47.059> of<00:00:47.180> a

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
interestingly it's got kind of a

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.450 
interestingly it's got kind of a
timeless<00:00:47.600> feel<00:00:47.780> I<00:00:47.989> don't<00:00:48.170> know<00:00:48.229> I<00:00:48.530> would

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
timeless feel I don't know I would

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.600 
timeless feel I don't know I would
almost<00:00:49.820> guess<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:50.390> was<00:00:50.540> a<00:00:50.570> mistake<00:00:51.610> maybe

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
almost guess this was a mistake maybe

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.750 
almost guess this was a mistake maybe
judging<00:00:53.059> from<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:54.559> angle<00:00:54.589> that<00:00:55.220> it<00:00:55.369> was<00:00:55.489> shot

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
judging from the angle that it was shot

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.560 
judging from the angle that it was shot
low<00:00:56.629> angle<00:00:57.170> kind<00:00:57.589> of<00:00:57.680> blurry<00:00:57.890> out-of-focus

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
low angle kind of blurry out-of-focus

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.630 
low angle kind of blurry out-of-focus
the<00:00:59.570> camera<00:00:59.960> locked<00:01:00.229> in<00:01:00.470> on<00:01:00.710> forty-second

the camera locked in on forty-second

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.800 
the camera locked in on forty-second
Street<00:01:02.320> probably<00:01:03.320> a<00:01:03.350> slow<00:01:03.619> shutter<00:01:03.650> speed<00:01:04.810> so

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
Street probably a slow shutter speed so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.380 
Street probably a slow shutter speed so
whatever<00:01:06.799> sometimes<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:07.790> know<00:01:07.850> those<00:01:08.060> happy

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
whatever sometimes you know those happy

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.420

accidents<00:01:08.960> work<00:01:09.170> because<00:01:09.619> what<00:01:09.860> happens<00:01:10.310> is

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
accidents work because what happens is

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.070 
accidents work because what happens is
because<00:01:10.610> you've<00:01:10.939> got<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.270> subject<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:11.900> what

because you've got the subject and what
appears<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:12.710> have<00:01:12.890> maybe<00:01:13.760> a<00:01:13.880> hat<00:01:14.180> on<00:01:14.479> in<00:01:14.960> a

appears to have maybe a hat on in a
trench<00:01:15.380> coat<00:01:15.679> there's<00:01:16.490> kind<00:01:16.729> of<00:01:16.789> that

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
trench coat there's kind of that

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.760 
trench coat there's kind of that
timeless<00:01:17.359> feel<00:01:18.020> about<00:01:18.289> it<00:01:18.500> you<00:01:18.679> know

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
timeless feel about it you know

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.340 
timeless feel about it you know
particularly<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.369> fact<00:01:19.609> that<00:01:19.729> it's<00:01:19.969> in<00:01:20.350> black

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
particularly the fact that it's in black

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.149 
particularly the fact that it's in black
and<00:01:21.469> white<00:01:21.829> I<00:01:22.789> like<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.750> intense<00:01:24.170> shadows

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159

light and dark I think there's something

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.109 
light and dark I think there's something
really<00:01:27.799> kind<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.159> cool<00:01:28.340> mysterious<00:01:28.909> about

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
really kind of cool mysterious about

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.999 
really kind of cool mysterious about
it's<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.479> little<00:01:29.749> bit<00:01:29.869> you<00:01:30.170> know<00:01:30.200> justified

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
leading to the back you know maybe

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.090 
leading to the back you know maybe
straighten<00:01:33.289> it<00:01:33.350> up<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.560> little<00:01:33.679> bit<00:01:33.799> but

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100
