00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.180

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.400

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.220

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.099
 we went to make this cupcake the material 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.390
 that we are going to work with are these mechanics 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:30.210
 that look like an oasis sphere 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.210
 and this we are going to assemble in this cup 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.660
 we are also going to use green tape 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.640
 Water resistant and mini carnations 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.140
 that I already cut here with my scissors 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.059
 we are also going to use cupcakes 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.910
 some bags already filled with a little 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.309
 of sweets and some hearts that we made 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.640
 with a paper tape is to assemble the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.949
 cupcake special gift of 14 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.620
 February we put the sweet milestones 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.270
 here you can put your sweet you can 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.360
 put a candle whatever you want 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.920
 and now with the tape we're going to 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.650
 intercalate to stick it to the cup 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.070
 today alessio I do not find this foam 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.939
 floral that I make very easy is a little ball 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.939
 salty 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.350
 of plastic so that they do not wet sweets 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.960
 but if you can not find it you can do 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.380
 your little ball a little square 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.049
 and now what we give and now hands to the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.240
 work we are going to hit the flowers 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.850
 here we have previously cut them 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.850
 I recommend you start from the top 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.140
 as well as 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.090
 in hemispheres 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.740
 and you start with the flowers more 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.850
 big so you can 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.850
 fill in better 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.990
 you can do it with fabric flowers 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.440
 you can do it with paper flowers 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.630
 filling in like this now we have our 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.330
 special paper for cupcakes this is the 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.650
 simpler than in the red market and 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.860
 how beautiful it looks and we will decorate it 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.709
