00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.650
 and that as we are, the day arrived 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.750
 commenting on a new video welcome to 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.189
 a new map sky as you are seeing in 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.259
 the title and on screen today we're going to 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.789
 analyze the map of yemen a map in the 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.950
 that where we have to be with a thousand 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.439
 eyes as we will find in the area 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.969
 several buildings and with enough 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.779
 inputs and outputs so nothing 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.779
 we start with the guide 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.020
 tell me 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.820
 we started the guide with the placement 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.649
 strategic of our inventive bones 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.600
 do not look there in that box we would have 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.399
 hide our our first point for 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.660
 place our betis you see that no 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.550
 There are no problems for the 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.890
 enemy die and finally our 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.320
 second place as we saw on the map of 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.699
 turbine is to notice that again 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.649
 we found these bags in which 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.059
 can we put our betis and 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.600
 again the enemy dies without any 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.600
 type of problem 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.580
 and we continue with the placement of our 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.530
 climates here in this corner 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.270
 behind those barrels we would have 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.740
 a little bit camouflaged in our first 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.479
 position for the play more you see that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.430
 good in mind the friend happens he detects 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.410
 and this one dies and finally in this 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.729
 corner and bending well this zone 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.869
 that you already know that usually several 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.030
 enemies throughout the game 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.979
 we would get our second point to 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.150
 place the clamor since as long as they enter 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.150
 or leave because it is activated and die 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.350
 calls 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.259
 and we went through the placement of our 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.429
 good sentries set here over 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.229
 this car we would have our 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.270
 first strategic point since good 20 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.740
 we take all that respawn area and not 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.329
 there would be no problem for him to die 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.880
 the enemy when it comes down to the 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.319
 central area and finally to protect 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.479
 precisely this central area then 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.490
 there would have placed it 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.049
 precisely on the right side so that 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.909
 they can destroy it from the window 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.770
 you see that it covers both sides 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.060
 both the right and the left and not 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.780
 there is no problem for the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.780
 enemy die 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.440
 call 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.120
 and we finished the strategic placement 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.920
 of our teams with the guardians 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.750
 good to see you here in this central area 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.280
 of the map on top of these woods 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.380
 we would have our first point for 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.910
 place our guardian fix us 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.290
 covers the entire central area and will be very 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.450
 easy for the enemy to fall or 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.070
 die directly and finally that 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.020
 we will also cover these stairs and 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.120
 We will try to kill the enemy in 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.950
 how much and to access those stairs 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.320
 towards the central area of ​​the map since 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.630
 well you know that in yemen is an area 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.520
 quite visited in this middle area of 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.000
 map so nothing happened with some tips 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.000
 for domain 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.350
 well then I'll give you some 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.790
 small tips so that you capture well the 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.100
 domain flags there you are seeing the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.470
 position of the first flag the 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.000
 flag of to look behind that of 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.920
 that kind of cubes not protected with 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.750
 separate then you would have your first 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.610
 point since good that you see that you 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.040
 cover almost whole and is very 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.590
 difficult for the enemy to give you the area 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.780
 central to the flag of good os 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.310
 I recommend apart from very good luck 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.840
 because you already know that as in almost all 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.430
 the maps is a very difficult flag of 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.920
 capture is especially if you do it from 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.270
 It is during the game but good 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.440
 I recommend that you put on this site 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.350
 since good that you give a little more 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.760
 camouflaged and more hidden from the enemy and 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.190
 it may be a little easier for you 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.020
 capture it and finally for the flag 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.430
 of efe no doubt I think it's a 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.020
 pretty easy to capture already 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.420
 how good is the top of the 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.120
 map and fix you can camouflage good 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.000
 protect better said behind those two 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.890
 zones and notice that you can lift and 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.720
 point a retiree to those two areas 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.000
 also so we determine with the gal 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.160
 and tips 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.660
 the content 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.090
 no longer 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.100
 and we finish this skate map with a couple 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.740
 of advice good to see many people do not 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.060
 know but jumping from that area of ​​the 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.410
 stairs that you have seen we can 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.060
 access and good to surprise the enemy 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.010
 entering that building by the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.020
 window and also get on that street lamp 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.450
 and well then try to get us some 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.610
 low thus shooting at that window and for 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.230
 last a small spot and good is 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.269
 Curiously enough being playing 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.190
 search and destroy because you can hear it can be 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.170
 one hesitant in nothing you simply have 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.990
 to make a ship and I think it is 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.150
 Flame is simply jumping with the X 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.010
 and press the circle quickly for 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.900
 duck or not and that you can get into that 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.340
 zone I also tell you that if good is if 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.740
 you encourage yourself a lot towards the right 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.000
 it would end up falling so nothing until 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.610
 here today's guide I hope you have 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.980
 liked in the next map we will review 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.630
 charge so nothing if you can leave a 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.800
 like and favorites on the other hand and we 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.800
 we see in the next video chao
