00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
distract from that so we're kind of

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.210 
distract from that so we're kind of
getting<00:00:30.189> rid<00:00:30.519> of<00:00:30.550> all<00:00:30.789> the<00:00:30.939> hair<00:00:31.410> same<00:00:32.410> smokey

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
eye why they talked about the

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.990 
eye why they talked about the
black-and-white<00:00:35.710> within<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.699> collection

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
black-and-white within the collection

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.299 
black-and-white within the collection
and<00:00:37.720> so<00:00:38.350> they<00:00:38.649> were<00:00:38.710> interested<00:00:39.160> in<00:00:39.190> that
