00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.210
 the second dish of the san menu 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.670
 valentino is a salmon tartare with 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.920
 crispy purple potatoes then a 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.030
 another dish a lot if they are not old and 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.030
 by profession I share 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.300
 this is the new recipe recipe between me 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.000
 and you 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.500
 I chose the salmon also because it is 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.050
 that a little more common a little more 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.430
 used by everyone then what he gives 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.989
 less bother to eat that raw 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.030
 that we are all used a little more to 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.399
 eat start preparing the waffle 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.150
 then bread box the bread cassettes 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.190
 opinion in a sandwich cut a strip 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.079
 with this formula strip in the san 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.000
 valentino the league is not wanted in 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.250
 decorations takes a bit of paprika for 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.329
 give a little color but above all a 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.949
 bit of cancer a little oil than anyway 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.780
 in bread it takes a little oil per 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.699
 make it more more crumbly cockade 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.750
 then with the help of a small brush 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:07.490
 I spread the paprika on the ring and bread 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.860
 then put it in the oven it will cook 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.660
 approximately for 45 minutes at 180 degrees sum 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.460
 must become crunchy to optimize 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.289
 the times while here is the steady preparation 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.179
 tartare also because it is very fast and 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.770
 really very simple then fillet 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.539
 of salmon to make it sing is better 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.270
 always use the central part of the 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.979
 salmon ok so not the belly because 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.720
 too fat every day to cut it 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.349
 do not chop but cut more beds 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.209
 very small must be sliced ​​in this 

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:34.160
 so he says that here follows a little 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:36.200
 grain that I will then cut out in this 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.509
 sense and I'll make cubes if you follow the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.030
 fish veins the tartare will remain a 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.530
 much nicer cube to see a lot 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.450
 however, even the use does not appear 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.950
 crushed but seems cut into cubes 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.070
 very small and the visual effect is 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.510
 fundamental 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.610
 the most important salmon of course 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.380
 the most valuable one is the Norwegian one 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.820
 in addition to the red salmon there is another 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.290
 variety still though because of that 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.150
 most important, however, the 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.890
 the origin of the fish is fundamental 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.050
 because in those seas the fish swims 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.810
 a lot and therefore the most solid powder 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.030
 it is more tasty than other important thing 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.070
 you have to make sure that the salmon is 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.230
 was shot down allow you to ask 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.850
 at the fish shop where he buys he understands if it is 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.150
 already been broken down health freeze it 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.400
 you 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.500
 This avoids the risk of inconvenience 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.610
 unfortunately it creates serious problems so a 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.220
 sharp knife and finally the 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.690
 tartare those cubes this is 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.590
 the effect of having a treat is 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.270
 of meat than of fish 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.800
 also because pulping the pulp 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.350
 completely like why just do it 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.390
 in many different results because 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.209
 however, the taste changes too 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.040
 then put in a bowl to treat 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.900
 and start with the condiment of the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.269
 Salmon tartare is very simple 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.540
 then a little salt just barely 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.519
 also because to use the soy sauce la 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.380
 soy sauce however stability 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.049
 less healthy vision than just a point 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.140
 so a bit of live peel and some 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.180
 drop chives we cut the dough 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.480
 at the bottom also the chives goes 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.160
 very fine cut in this way ok 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.530
 here how to forming lambs a lot 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.530
 a little olive oil 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.620
 Also tartare convinced faithful 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.540
 was very fast and now I have to do the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.950
 decoration with violet potatoes la 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.360
 potato dialogue at 20 is found everywhere 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.040
 now in the council the supermarket 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.600
 maybe not all but it is found 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.000
 quite easily 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.470
 what did I do to make it 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.910
 a bit crunchy as if they had to do 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.860
 just those fries in the 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.990
 bag short chips with chips 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.640
 touch the very thin cuts and 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.800
 nine hundred in water and salt alone 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.990
 an hour and a half hour in short allows 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.610
 to take out enough starch then go 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.980
 then rinse under the water then 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.110
 to remove the last remaining garment e 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.660
 then I'm ready to be cold talk 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.420
 dry first, but then it costs 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.200
 on a sheet of absorbent paper e 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.580
 buff up ok 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.580
 and at this point I have to fry 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.780
 is high 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.609
 all the ingredients are ready and 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.000
 now a dish I take the warm of 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.000
 oven 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.160
 then with the help of a shoulder strap 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.750
 the same to make ice cream 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.820
 you can do it even with your hands 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.240
 in short, or with the spoon do 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.240
 rooms 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.179
 at this point I put a decoration 

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:35.550
 over a sphere with purple potatoes from 

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:37.020
 waffle over the other and finally a thread 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.669
 d arda chive and this is the tartare of 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.229
 salmon and you see yourself deciding 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.849
 in short, implanting it as you wish this is 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.989
 the presentation I really like for 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.849
 valentine see you next time 

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:47.869
