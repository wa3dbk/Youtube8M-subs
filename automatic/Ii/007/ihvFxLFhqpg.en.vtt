00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:17.770
 hi factor well did well to lead 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.770
 this strange parcel let's see his 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:40.520
 Already a beautiful immersion tunes 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:48.080
 it's ok immersion pushed the doorix 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:51.250
 yes long-awaited here is finally see see 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.250
 what's in this box 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:11.159
 ok 285 m tall what what two hundred 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.159
 fifty usual 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:38.050
 vortex flight test by jérôme jérôme so 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.970
 did the test on this vortex hoping 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:48.040
 they're not too spit annakin 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:55.260
 thank you japan the stickers again a 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.260
 map the person facebook immersion 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.270
 rcd and spare list 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:10.600
 it's 50 30 I thought it was 50 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:14.190
 40 but not more than 50 30 pieces of 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.580
 Spare had two hours without at 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:23.130
 fastening lugs for engines 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.130
 we 'll have pucks thanks to later 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:35.130
 to the rc immersion antenna but here is the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.130
 baby 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.370
 on two frames 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.859
 this is good to serve such 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.790
 tidying up 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:59.489
 it's still damn good packaging 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:04.760
 here is the beast so he is in mode 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:08.489
 arf he misses more than so 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:14.400
 the radio transmitter and he's ready to fly 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:20.760
 so here are the tent arms with a 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:23.250
 fixing system that makes it clean 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.180
 it's very very clean it's very 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:31.379
 very pro very very well the machined the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.939
 small camera here orientable so that's 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.939
 of the 600t vesle we see it here 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.569
 this is good go top line up it's rather 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:50.329
 not bad it is fixed directly on 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:52.689
 the hockey bumper the scratch for the 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.689
 battery 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:11.090
 here is the rather light beast 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:11.090
 so that's the room that has been stuck 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:21.350
 we have small engines engines 2806 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.150
 from 1300 kg 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:29.450
 the famous little led with a port 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.450
 usb to settle on clm fight 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.020
 here we are going to listen to apply to the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.020
 start 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:44.700
 So here we are again with the fr sky 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:49.020
 the radio transmitter plugged bind and at the 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:51.780
 radio so a taranis plus you have to 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.440
 reset the vortex before 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.840
 start the programming procedure 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:03.870
 on the insight so for that it takes 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.940
 plug the gear is pressed while 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.650
 the LEDs light up on this button during 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.940
 5 seconds 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.290
 by pressing the button for 5 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.470
 seconds while the led lights up 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.900
 you will reset the device 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.910
 to go on good bases 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.060
 so again so we have to do 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:26.390
 well a reset of ufr sky on the late to 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.390
 nice and then so you can you 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:38.780
 you can throw that insight for himself 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.820
 to connect with flight it is necessary that the 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.310
 plugs this vortex battery 3 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.100
 branches and that's very important if not 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.140
 you will have nothing so you have a 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.590
 little usb port right there it's very 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.430
 convenient 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.430
 apply these victims in the right direction 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.600
 so we automatically recognize the 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.470
 vortex or to do so a little 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:10.580
 calibration once the vortex and 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.680
 well flat we know breite is for 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.220
 a little test 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.220
 let's see what it gives 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.510
 or 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.919
 Yes 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:26.500
 everything seems to work there's more 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:29.520
 than to test in full size 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.520
 business to follow
