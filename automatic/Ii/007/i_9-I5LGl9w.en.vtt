 Ok, stay tuned. 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.710
 You will need a brush for 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.570
 the color that you want when you 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.480

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.539
 so come on, we want to make people. 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.950
 the container holds a container which 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.739
 We chose to put the cream 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.570
 moisturizing 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.920
 so that is more convenient for you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.590
 use 30 and I'll put it here for people 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.770
 do our shows and here I go 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.660
 choose now the color i will put sells 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.660
 Let's see how it goes. 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.720
 put some green and stir until 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.020
 be very homogeneous 1 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.800
 to paint what is already done to our 30 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.950
 homemade 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.220
 It's a home-made thing that we can 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.950
 apply in four possible ways 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.390
 ways of how to apply the skin 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.540
 first way is applied directly 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.690
 you take a brush and apply it directly 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.600
 in the skin are you going to see that there will be one 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.910
 green and a bit transparent in the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.870
 skin 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.610
 Okay, see how you're right, this is one of the 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.550
 Ways to make the application ok let's 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.280
 delete here clean up for us to do 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.050
 other possible applications for 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.119
 Can you check how you are going to stay with 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.680
 how it changes or how it will look different 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.430
 application of which according to what 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.619
 you will do 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.750
 okay the second embodiment is based on the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.350
 we will learn how to make the basis for 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.210
 skin 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.220
 You're going to need a rogue crime. 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.750
 of any brand preference 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.590
 which does not have a strong smell 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.619
 a liquid foundation for skin 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.450
 ok you buy new medical schools one 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.180
 container for you to mix the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.800
 ingredients and an object for you to stir 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.200
 the ingredients were there 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.200
 put the baby roasting cream 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:32.320
 Okay, move here so we can put it now. 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.320
 o the liquid base 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.620
 the show moves here now 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.290
 Makes you all right, homogenous, who? 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.609
 Our base is right, it's one of the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.760
 ways to build the foundation that can be 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:51.319
 applied for various purposes within 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.109
 of scenic painting 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.930
 ok from the special effect painting of 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:03:00.680
 body paint what you can 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.810
 sprinkle talcum powder on the base so that 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.579
 she is shorter may have a 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.530
 application improves ink you can also 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.299
 apply directly without paulo vamos 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.859
 do here with this so you can see how it goes 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.689
 stay on the ground and you can 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.950
 make the application directly on some 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.220
 cases you will need to do this 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.739
 and everyone else will go 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.889
 explain it right ok let's see how 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.269
 is sprinkled on top of the base with 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:31.669
 talc see that there is no more transparency 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.139
 and it's clear that I'm going to paint my fingers 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:37.569
 here without base without anything to see the 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:40.879
 difference who we have up here 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.290
 painting with base and fingers painting 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.299
 without base paint directly 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.780
 applied as we had already done 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.079
 years 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.109
 Okay now let's prepare another base form 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.489
 with talcum the base prepared provided that the 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:57.340
 people prepared the band now puts 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.340
 talc mixes the base assembly 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.049
 and you will see that it will be different 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.470
 application is another way of 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.950
 make the basis for applying the paint to the 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.530
 skin 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.530
 Okay, if I post it here. 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:18.310
 see here the base is already better applied 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.170
 on the skin that is cool mankind you 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.630
 can be used for other foot effects 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.880
 Who are we going to apply the paint to now? 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.860
 will see that it will look different from the ink 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.180
 when applying here is different from 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.450
 other two applications that we already 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.450
 We did 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:44.909
 ok the application made you see there 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.259
 which was a very homogeneous color well fixed 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.370
 pretty on the skin 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:54.210
 so we have there in our fingers application 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:58.819
 here above application with base made 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:02.699
 with the back of the hand made with 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:06.870
 care in fingers without any foundation 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:09.689
 ok these are the three possible ways of 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.330
 apply another possible way is to apply 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.819
 directly the farm on top of the fingers 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.919
 You 'll see it's going to get very dark. 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.229
 really this is not the fifth is the 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.379
 korando pure fuel on top of the finger 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.120
 without preparing with the moisturizer will stay 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.460
 very strong I do not advise you to do this 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.830
 why are you going to have a damn job? 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.750

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.610
 possible shades that we 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.939
 we get these are the four ways 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.710
