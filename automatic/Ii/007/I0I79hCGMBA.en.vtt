pigs<00:00:35.750> which<00:00:36.500> makes<00:00:36.829> them<00:00:37.040> easier<00:00:37.430> to<00:00:37.460> clean

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
pigs which makes them easier to clean

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.670 
pigs which makes them easier to clean
and<00:00:38.270> for<00:00:38.960> extra<00:00:39.320> strength

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
and for extra strength

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.160 
and for extra strength
we<00:00:40.010> use<00:00:40.219> weaving<00:00:41.000> pig<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:41.390> points<00:00:41.690> on<00:00:41.809> all<00:00:42.050> the

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
we use weaving pig and points on all the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.160 
we use weaving pig and points on all the
stress<00:00:42.410> areas<00:00:43.059> your<00:00:44.059> tent<00:00:44.300> needs<00:00:44.510> some<00:00:44.809> given

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
stress areas your tent needs some given

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.680 
stress areas your tent needs some given
windy<00:00:45.469> conditions<00:00:45.949> so<00:00:46.579> we<00:00:46.730> use<00:00:46.910> shock<00:00:47.390> cord

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
windy conditions so we use shock cord

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.619 
windy conditions so we use shock cord
and<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.079> mid<00:00:48.260> peak<00:00:48.530> areas<00:00:49.039> in<00:00:49.280> on<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:49.550> fly<00:00:49.789> to

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
and the mid peak areas in on the fly to

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.340 
and the mid peak areas in on the fly to
ensure<00:00:50.989> maximum<00:00:51.440> flexibility<00:00:53.260> remember<00:00:54.260> to

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
ensure maximum flexibility remember to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.770 
ensure maximum flexibility remember to
put<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.559> pigs<00:00:54.890> in<00:00:55.100> on<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.399> 45<00:00:55.969> degree<00:00:56.120> angle<00:00:56.329> so

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
put the pigs in on a 45 degree angle so

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.189 
put the pigs in on a 45 degree angle so
they<00:00:57.050> grow<00:00:57.260> better<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.910> Kia<00:00:59.149> is<00:00:59.359> a<00:00:59.420> high<00:00:59.839> spec

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
they grow better the Kia is a high spec

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.529 
they grow better the Kia is a high spec
mid-range<00:01:00.649> series<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:01.820> we<00:01:01.940> use<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.149> combination

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
mid-range series so we use a combination

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.720 
mid-range series so we use a combination
of<00:01:02.929> power<00:01:03.289> miss<00:01:03.500> pole<00:01:03.769> sleeves<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:04.370> speed

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
of power miss pole sleeves and speed

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.240 
of power miss pole sleeves and speed
clips<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.930> power<00:01:06.170> mesh<00:01:06.410> supports<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.010> curve

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
clips the power mesh supports the curve

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.610 
clips the power mesh supports the curve
of<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.550> pole<00:01:07.760> and<00:01:08.030> is<00:01:08.540> stronger<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.140> softer

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
of the pole and is stronger and softer

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.190 
of the pole and is stronger and softer
than<00:01:09.950> other<00:01:10.160> fabrics<00:01:10.659> meaning<00:01:11.659> it<00:01:11.780> lasts

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
than other fabrics meaning it lasts

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.429 
than other fabrics meaning it lasts
longer<00:01:12.409> withstands<00:01:13.310> windy<00:01:13.579> conditions<00:01:14.119> and

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
longer withstands windy conditions and

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.219 
longer withstands windy conditions and
is<00:01:15.439> easier<00:01:15.860> to<00:01:16.070> slide<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.579> pulse<00:01:16.850> room<00:01:17.229> having

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
is easier to slide the pulse room having

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.810 
is easier to slide the pulse room having
speed<00:01:18.590> clips<00:01:18.829> linking<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.310> lower<00:01:19.490> part<00:01:19.729> of

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
speed clips linking the lower part of

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.490 
speed clips linking the lower part of
the<00:01:19.970> tent<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.420> poles<00:01:20.659> is<00:01:20.900> a<00:01:21.110> huge

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
the tent to the poles is a huge

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.240 
the tent to the poles is a huge
time-saver

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
time-saver

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.160 
time-saver
so<00:01:22.790> speed<00:01:23.090> clips<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.540> power<00:01:23.780> mesh<00:01:23.990> together

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
so speed clips and power mesh together

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.999 
so speed clips and power mesh together
helps<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.100> speed<00:01:25.399> up<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.700> sitting<00:01:26.000> up<00:01:26.090> process
