 leonardo boix like these again this time yes thank you very much for the 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.279
 invitation when I tell you that leonardo the commercial manager of the 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.019
 vehicles by the vehicle manager of the commercial vehicles division 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.009
 then they would do it they just presented very recently and outside 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.199
 camera we wish 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.119
 if this photo is amarok is weird 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.720
 think how many times we expect the years of the cars to come from europe 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.470
 and now they are waiting in Europe to dictate if we really turned the 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.259
 story in a way 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.699
 Rosinha pride of our ethics factory 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.440
 our plant the general pacheco to be exported to the five continents 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.060
 I think it's excellent news 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.900
 beautiful of napo course images of latina that on the floor as scoop 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.960
 exclusive of automotores latina camaro that here 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.960
 6 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.340
 here in the studies of everything all that this new product of 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.590
 football in argentina is moored 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.920
 tell me I know that the technical characteristics that have 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.430
 below it has the two most powerful engines together with the Nissan Frontier 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.620
 of the category that is with a varied 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.620
 it's a god's gift the smallest engine when it's sold 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.890
 the turolense slightly but biturbo 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.630
 this and in the preliminary handling other doing I can overtake you 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.220
 the consumption is extremely low 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.750
 eta put inside the one that have an aesthetic quite looked like type model 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.770
 yes, yes 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.210
 i unpublished things as it said the stability control or for example the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.590
 system that has 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.460
 audi a4 for achieving self-determination that also 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.460
 you should be circulating to make management more efficient 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.970
 this theory change sides 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.590
 but this is a sweeping system the ctc 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.510
 through the next door 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.429
 to design cup develop state policies 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.750
 she gets you in her day the competition 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.010
 but how do you stop studying the competition everybody because this is going 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.250
 to compete in europe to compete in china africa for example hopeful 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.740
 as the others are known the rage that was exhibited the whole truth 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.320
 but we also resorted to arrese taj that we know have worked for 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.970
 example the system and all its system víctor hugo 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.050
 that derives from heavy trucks that heavy trucks have less and the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.519
 input that before 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.299
 and the influenza systems and what they do is that the engine always treasure 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.399
 fed without needing greater consumptions 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:21.989
 and in the meantime cubic centimeters 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.340
 what was done was to study 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.189
 of course mainly the tic aps market 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.959
 but he also put additional ingredients 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.519
 how will be a reference in security and also provided pleasant handling 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.809
 each of the 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:36.759
 future occupants ask 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.370
 then it will be a short response soon 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.909
 because many people when they take out in this case the amarok or any vehicle 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.979
 new that goes on the market 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:46.909
 that Argentine thing byc 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:52.189
 do not wait a little bit now say let it go let's wait a little bit how many 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.959
 kilometers runs a test tocumbo vehicle 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.489
 three days to decide 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.769
 this train feel up to dtc inside arlt the cover of the vat source 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.920
 Mileage cells 8 million kilometers over 300 units 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:05.779
 world 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:10.039
 and 3 million kilometers on it more than 100 units in Argentina 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.599
 traveling he walked from the north to the Argentine south 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.829
 Leonard should should be a question 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.159
 the camaro 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.739
 is putting as a step up everything I have tempts icap 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.370
 toyota was like too much behind regarding eta in regards to the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.549
 technology that you have because you were targeted today but do 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:34.819
 to compete on the other hand with the pressure with a good vehicle 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.369
 sells less value 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:40.109
 the reality is that we in the foxá group always aim to be 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.939
 leaders with each of the desired fruits masters 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.040
 this still does not escape this reality the product really is amazing 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.649
 incorporates elements 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:51.649
 that are unique at that time 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:54.939
 and that's why we say that already evolution of the 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.689
 we must leave everything behind what I did not know to understand amaro 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:03.059
 and we're really seeing it in the first obvious customer deliveries 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:06.339
 when you go down and you know this is different these other 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.519
 I want to tell him and we usually do the talk function of the 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.369
 results and he participated in a talk or in the latter 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:18.359
 that there are 15 years that there are vehicles that have technology is all Antarctic 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.559
 and there is another vehicle that have this stability control that as a species 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:26.009
 guardian angel who will protect him in conditions 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.879
 extreme as tesse to the shoulder and among many things makes the mistake of pasting a 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.520
 swerving for example not 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.449
 put between those things the camaro is the only one that has control of stability 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.069
 the others 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.120
 we still see that it is an option to relax more equipment network 

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:44.729
 unprecedented pérez of segmentar africa 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.729
 6 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.970
 the violence 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.670
 sherry in the segment what is that merits the premium line tomorrow or is it 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.560
 it calls settlement site to complete the range of amaro conversions 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.610
 four for two cabins empire all the rest of the offer exactly from the 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.630
 moment of the launch that was the month of March only offers a version 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.529
 They will pull four by four 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:11.259
 but with the passing of the months in fact this messiah boys will be delivering 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.319
 our dealers phelan 4 versions 2 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.279
 and as the next months pass we will deliver the 3d versions in 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.099
 what are the 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.419
 of half the range 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.900
 in versions 4 by 4 4 by 2 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.229
 in the second semester the versions with input format 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.370
 i in the first quarter of 2011 the simple cabin 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.719
 what studies are done 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.849
 to choose the range of colors of the shelter by efe 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.889
 Fiol amaro like any other vehicle per Peru that studied from 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.499
 that is, it does not seem good to you and I think this can be black with white 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.750
 who although the study that they do is observe the market and observe 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.499
 new trends 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:50.580
 that consumers are asking 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.229
 in the colors they are and I always love them throughout 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:02.009
 p disguise about the original color 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.710
 the reality is that the pse is specifically following the taste of the consumer 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.469
 and what is best for each vehicle of course 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.839
 that we had an oral question 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:16.289
 is the rare percent this image or that surely the top of range has lost 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.089
 they made a van for the owner of the field or it's also a van 

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:22.779
 of work for daily use 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.740
 it's going to be a very complete range of offers 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.880
 p only that the release even the top-end versions like this 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.000
 jay lane version for an image theme exactly and for a beginning theme of 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.650
 production too 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.220
 this year this van is going to be given to me 4 for the foreman and for the 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.370
 country worker also 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.490
 like the police 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.809
 that action 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:48.169
 it is much more sold than it was imagined that the parameters that 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:51.860
 you imagine at the beginning we luckily surpassed everything that is going to 

00:06:51.859 --> 00:06:55.509
 produce what is going to be delivered to the network an arid session is had 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.639
 someone waiting so it's great news for kids 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.740
 now leonardo is not going to throw the key and we are going to prove how he is the 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.569
 gauchito 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.050
 and of course in the next program we are going to give our opinion of 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.710
 tamarón what I say is any vehicle that is going to be bought by 

00:07:11.709 --> 00:07:12.999
 please try it
