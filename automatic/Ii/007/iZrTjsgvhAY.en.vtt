00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.670
 hello everyone I'm marcela I hope that 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.410
 be well today I bring you a new idea 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.650
 let's see how we can make a 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.660
 very cute mannequin in an easy way what 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.610
 we can do at home without needing 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.590
 use a number of tools or 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.600
 complicated things but with what 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.370
 we have the same scope will have a 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.910
 spectacular result I hope that you 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:35.690
 like what we're going to need is first 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.540
 a base for nails two enamels of 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.489
 different colors can be those that 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.400
 you want in this case I chose 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.790
 one pink and one that is like a wine 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.790
 red 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:54.310
 and a silver that is bright for the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.160
 decoration and a shine for the nails 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.410
 also and tools to do the 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.270
 decoration we're going to need something that 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.300
 serve to make dots 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.600
 I have this orange stick with this 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.720
 we're going to do the little dots and something 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.400
 that serves to make some petals of 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.250
 flowers me in this case I have this this 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.710
 stick that has this little tip or can 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.630
 also be a brush that is from CÃ¡diz 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.409
 hey with that they can do it 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.530
 some flower petals 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.729
 perfect to start then we go to 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.729
 apply the base 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.909
 already when we have applied the base the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.150
 let it dry a bit and let's start 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.390
 applying the base color we can 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.870
 apply one or two layers as more us 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.870
 like 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.039
 we have already applied the base color if it is a 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.890
 little complicated sometimes when when is 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.020
 dark the color because we can 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.210
 leave a little of the nail 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.010
 but then if this happens it does not 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.740
 worry leave it so in the end what 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.710
 we can fix now let's continue 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.230
 with the lighter color let's start 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.280
 making the flowers I will use this 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.990
 tool 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.209
 then let's start doing them 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.560
 as follows we will do 5 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.560
 petals for each flower 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.610
 We are going to leave this finger without that flower 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.530
 because we are going to make a decoration 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.530
 different and we continue with the subway 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.030
 good already having the other flowers 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.250
 made this finger we are going to do it 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.709
 following way with the tool 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.440
 make the points we are going to make 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.610
 small dotted flowers of four 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.610
 petals each 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.920
 we take the enamel 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.830
 which is silver and we start 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.550
 make points in the middle of each 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.550
 little flower 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.719
 now let's put the bright 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.700
 perfect this is how it is then 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:18.940
 it is very nice 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.730
 let's let it dry for a while and 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.790
 I show you how we can fix the 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.860
 little imperfects that we had left 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.680
 good to fix them let's take 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.220
 then a little cotton and in 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.040
 this case I took the orange stick 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.040
 and we are going to wrap the cotton 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.940
 when we already have this 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.530
 let's put a little bit into it 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.530
 Polish remover 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.529
 and when it's 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:05:00.539
 the wet tip then we proceed to 

00:04:56.739 --> 00:05:00.539
 remove the excess glaze 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.770
 we have already done it we have removed the 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.680
 imperfections and look how is it 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.990
 It looks very nice, I hope you have them
