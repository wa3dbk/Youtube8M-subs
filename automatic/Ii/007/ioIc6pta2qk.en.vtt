00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:21.360
 possibility the track is top 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.130

 down the street looking for them 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.530
 but everything has its limits above all else 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.180
 if you pick up the missile pistol 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.530

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.300

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.430
 passionate search for something 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.590
 precious not to be another 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.340
 robbing beloved pokémon while doing so 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.010
 those and at the same time the intimate bonds 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:00.540

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.870
 peaceful way becomes the 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.709
 to get one's own hands or work 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.660

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.750

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.150
 pleasure boss and there they disappear 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.380
 beautiful 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.120
 yes that was it 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.380
 we'll look at the anti quite fast 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.480
 on 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:10.490
 the num level 50, it comes to us because ot 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.850
 is not something Japanese why? 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.130
 essence was ok +14 pretty bad 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.040
 initiative type capable stone is something quite 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.040
 new thought is the type is yes 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.510
 Huge there is a very nice life of the 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.910
 pokémon score for the most beautiful 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.980
 and to have a second to move 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.360
 us what the diamond storm and the 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.820
 attack we will not look at each other 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.910
 now 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.790
 so people there silva again and who attracts 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.260
 will be sent to the fight and he will 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.240
 50 pretty stable in my view 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.340
 and I would say we'll hit right away 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.229
 the diamonds storm row one-hour 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.570
 stein attacke a special gifts 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.479
 There is not much jewel of it 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.140
 his and just diamonds storm very much 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.410
 beautiful day 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.020
 one would naturally the book level 10 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.970
 so nothing great to expect 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.620
 People like you thought that was it 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.700
 whole event if you have more such events 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.290
 want to have because I have a few more 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.180
 then you push the thumb upwards 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.330
 to show me because I still have so 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.680
 a few event pokémon where it still is 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.930
 events are so short and I have mine 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.760
 thought the spot we can all these 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.080
 events popping out and it is 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.410
 again in my opinion 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.870
 have to see what a pokémon xy because 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.210
 the games are already over a year 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.770
 now soon old and my last to it 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.570
 That's why I had it again 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.220
 really bock again the old console 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.050
 we'll see each other 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.330
 next time again, skin in until the 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.330
 next time under zero
