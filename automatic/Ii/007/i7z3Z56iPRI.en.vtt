watching these and everything I thought
it<00:02:58.480> was<00:02:58.599> a<00:02:58.629> simple<00:02:58.870> concept<00:02:59.409> and<00:02:59.620> something

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
it was a simple concept and something

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:00.959 
it was a simple concept and something
that<00:02:59.949> hasn't<00:03:00.129> been<00:03:00.340> done<00:03:00.549> before<00:03:00.939> so

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
that hasn't been done before so

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.379 
that hasn't been done before so
