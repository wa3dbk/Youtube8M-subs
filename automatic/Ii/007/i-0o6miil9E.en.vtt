the actual Zeppelin is a shock mount
which<00:01:54.320> is<00:01:54.890> where<00:01:55.159> we've<00:01:55.399> attached<00:01:55.820> this

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
which is where we've attached this

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.359 
which is where we've attached this
particular<00:01:56.930> microphone<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:57.979> as<00:01:58.130> far<00:01:58.310> as

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
particular microphone so as far as

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.120

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
to use a boom pole is to get as close as

to use a boom pole is to get as close as
you<00:02:50.090> possibly<00:02:50.540> can<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:51.079> your<00:02:51.200> subject<00:02:51.709> without

you possibly can to your subject without
actually<00:02:52.400> getting<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:53.360> part<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.900> boom

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
actually getting the part of the boom

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.460 
actually getting the part of the boom
into<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.980> scene<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:56.600> best<00:02:57.290> way<00:02:57.440> to

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
into the scene the best way to

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.740 
into the scene the best way to
accomplish<00:02:57.799> this<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.400> over<00:02:58.820> head<00:02:59.030> but<00:02:59.600> then

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
accomplish this is over head but then

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.360 
accomplish this is over head but then
sometimes<00:03:00.200> depending<00:03:00.530> upon<00:03:00.650> how<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:00.980> shot<00:03:01.220> is

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
sometimes depending upon how the shot is

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.400 
sometimes depending upon how the shot is
composed<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:02.180> might<00:03:02.390> have<00:03:02.660> better<00:03:03.290> luck

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
composed you might have better luck

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.699 
composed you might have better luck
going<00:03:04.220> from<00:03:04.579> underneath<00:03:05.350> but<00:03:06.350> then<00:03:06.560> you

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
going from underneath but then you

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.440 
going from underneath but then you
probably<00:03:06.920> want<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.489> crouch<00:03:07.910> down<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.239> little

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
probably want to crouch down a little

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.319 
probably want to crouch down a little
bit<00:03:08.690> so<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.019> your<00:03:09.980> body<00:03:10.940> weight<00:03:11.209> is

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
bit so that your body weight is

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.509 
bit so that your body weight is
supported<00:03:11.359> better<00:03:12.049> another<00:03:12.709> important<00:03:13.280> point

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
supported better another important point

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.690 
supported better another important point
is<00:03:13.760> that<00:03:13.820> like<00:03:14.090> any<00:03:14.510> object<00:03:14.930> that's<00:03:15.829> subjected

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
is that like any object that's subjected

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.390 
is that like any object that's subjected
to<00:03:16.790> light<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.269> boom<00:03:17.900> will<00:03:18.200> cast<00:03:18.500> shadows<00:03:18.620> so

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
to light a boom will cast shadows so

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.890 
to light a boom will cast shadows so
it's<00:03:19.549> really<00:03:19.790> important<00:03:20.329> to<00:03:20.359> keep<00:03:20.600> in<00:03:20.750> touch

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
it's really important to keep in touch

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.569 
it's really important to keep in touch
with<00:03:21.109> your<00:03:21.230> camera<00:03:21.560> operator<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.220> make<00:03:22.400> sure

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
with your camera operator to make sure

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.729 
with your camera operator to make sure
that<00:03:22.850> no<00:03:23.359> fetters<00:03:23.750> are<00:03:23.900> being<00:03:24.109> cast<00:03:24.350> that<00:03:24.620> will

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
that no fetters are being cast that will

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:46.390 
that no fetters are being cast that will
show<00:03:24.920> up<00:03:25.070> on<00:03:25.220> your<00:03:25.280> video

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.100 

so<00:03:47.400> proper<00:03:47.760> use<00:03:47.910> of<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.150> boom<00:03:48.390> pole<00:03:48.630> will<00:03:48.930> give

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
so proper use of a boom pole will give

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.450 
so proper use of a boom pole will give
you<00:03:49.200> some<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.560> best<00:03:49.800> sound<00:03:50.100> that<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.430> can

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
you some of the best sound that you can

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.610 
you some of the best sound that you can
acquire<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.660> does<00:03:51.840> require<00:03:52.080> some<00:03:52.170> upper<00:03:52.590> body

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
acquire it does require some upper body

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.070 
acquire it does require some upper body
strength<00:03:53.000> but<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.210> results<00:03:54.690> are<00:03:54.840> well<00:03:55.050> worth

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
strength but the results are well worth

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.560 
strength but the results are well worth
it
