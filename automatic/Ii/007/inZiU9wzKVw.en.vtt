 we have counted before and that term does not 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.320
 has absolutely no salt 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.210
 to start cooking I'm going to make a 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.060
 proposal for everyone who is 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.180

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.460

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.370
 special is spectacular to buy with 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.010
 pepper tree that has oxygen inside 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:13.479
 children's rooms and we will fill it with 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:17.500
 for a mixture of black pepper and garlic 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:22.420
 garlic and red pepper flakes will 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.410
 leave everything to mix 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.840
 amazing to your meals and you're going to 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.180
 replace salt 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.800
 says that sometimes it happens that they tell you 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.900
 you have to do this at once and you 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.930
 It seems very rough, you took out the devoured 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.880
 as an inducement absolutely no 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.880
 flavor of the food or if you can go 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.550
 graduating and put this mixture that already 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.820
 it's a little bit of salt thing to have it not 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.770
 They forgive us all but what but 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.869
 obviously have other things at random 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.000
 exactly below you can do as 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.000
 I said that as we said before, grab your 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.960
 teaspoon of salt put in the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.670
 pepper and you know that the 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.410
 daily recommendation of salt this garment 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.330
 is not that then the game glasses and 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.250
 chopping is teaspoon along the 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.800
 day but without more volume with this is 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.530
 adding up with exactly 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.819
 it's me so that the books along 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.900
 from the field 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.549
 gradually, sometimes sometimes not 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.249
 you have the possibility of that gradualism 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.230
 and you have to do abruptly and 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:23.030
 get a good way to do it 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.829
 Gradually you are going to make this mixture and it's going 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.450
 to save because I really rich 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.599
 I have it in my house and I do it with a lot 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.689
 I speedster taste exactly like one 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.069
 spoonful black peppercorns can 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.739
 be about two tablespoons for the 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.900
 Spicy is not so strong we help you 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.659
 create the garlic in this more than new ribbon 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.760
 where I was forced to pass the agitated 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.050
 in flakes can be garlic powder 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.230
 now with this way this one 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:54.540
 well in half and the good comes in 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.400
 the half that you come to everything more crushed 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.590
 but that is not garlic powder and from you 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.470
 you put with weapons you are three spoonfuls the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.940
 Judge really rich and they really give him a lot 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.370
 flavor to all your community 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.710
 then mix that and we're going to 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.690
 put in the grinder then in 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.090
 time to bring the alan saltcellar is going to 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.400
 bring this as a salt replacement 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.350
 oil grinder that has something that 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.960
 has pepper that you have and ground you 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.780
 it costs a lot to abandon the salt you're going to 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.740
 put on this half teaspoon of salt and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.570
 You will be graduating but it is much better 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.970
 then we are going putting putting in with 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.970
 a patience a lot 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.860
 339 hand in hand with what one consumes 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.750
 food level can heredity not 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.549
 as one of the causes of the 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.189
 hypertension is seized by 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.840
 the hand of everyday daily stress that 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.980
 increases the amount of cortisol that 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.470
 it's a hormone and that makes one have 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.599
 higher blood pressure and that's why 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.950
 good logically if you are hypertensive 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.329
 you do not know where your pressure comes from 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.609
 also a psychological consultation 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.470
 Emotions been working there 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.030
 breathing exercises exercise 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.250
 where one went down a little decibels 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.230
 now eye because a lot of people feel 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.810
 that relationship to the headache with the 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.459
 pressure is not always an ailment that 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.690
 except the cost immediately increases the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.590
 pressure because it's a mechanism of 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.590
 defense that is logical is going to have 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.590
 depression 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.560
 to December 2001 they remember ran 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.520
 we take the pressure from my dad 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.110
 18 had depression nerves 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.290
 he suffered a lot of people and obviously 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.830
 suffered many injuries but total very 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.260

 black pepper so ground garlic and villar 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:53.270
 we are going to throw him here instead of putting him
