00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.350
 I think they are giving me so much 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.650
 will notice the car when when they are 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.650
 giving us 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.430
 [Music] 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.850
 Y 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.030
 all kids teach the situation of the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.110
 This car that is shielded on the play 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.390
 4 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.000
 and the truth is that I went to look for a 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.500
 but I did not find it and I passed 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.160
 some missions of the campaign of the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.690
 main ones and I guess it will already be 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.480
 to be 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.550
 so good go to the place that I 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.110
 I have marked on the map and we are going to visit 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.290
 because like this I do not know what I'm going to have 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.600
 what to do to make the truth appear 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.850
 [Music] 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.710
 I should be in this parking lot 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:01.079
 here and there is a black car 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:04.710
 but destiny is not no it is not why 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.479
 because it must be 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.479
 90 is that I 'm going to blow it 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.909
 to chase the cop but nothing happens 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.120
 because we do the trick 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.760
 to lose the cop and that's it 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.610
 lost 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.250
 Well, I do not know what I have to do 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.470
 so that the bridge appears here I go 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.090
 to go away because it exists from spanair 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.219
 since it charges me to the other so it seems 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.219
 [Music] 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.190
 iberia the point appears 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.190
 blue Point 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.649
 either here we have it done worth less 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.149
 bad that it was appeared good because what 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.290
 what you have to do is move on to some 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.600
 of the first missions of the campaign 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.399
 if you want to get them I would come to the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.280
 map situation that taught you and 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.350
 here you will have if you do not appear to us 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.149
 the first thing to burst car 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.520
 that there is something remote and edges like 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.229
 heavily and the truth that is 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.880
 pretty handsome so now we're going to 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.100
 let's try to see inside and we 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.640
 to see how this one 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.170
 It is a car very similar to the load of 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.900
 the movie of the race of death 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.070
 the truth that this movie is pretty 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.460
 it consisted of a mind that is pretty 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.630
 web is with the windows and beautiful 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.050
 but the seals do 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.400
 we are resistant we will have to prove it 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.360
 Well, as I was saying this 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.310
 car of 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.100
 as you see from the movie of the race of 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.780
 the death was in a prison and in that 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.820
 makes careers and the one that is born from that 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.130
 race was to die wins the race and I left 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.140
 from jail 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.460
 that basically and I now because I 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.740
 they are chasing both the truck and what 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.740
 is happening here what is happening here 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.610
 what's happening, good, I'm going to 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.440
 try cars and I hope you liked it 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.570
 this video that you are giving me also 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.270
 will endow the car when when they are 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.950
 giving us donations through the windows but 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.630
 good in general I guess it will be fine 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.560
 come to try on 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.560
 I leave you with the video 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.480
 now my mission is to take the car to my 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.550
 garage that is perfect forever 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.790
 to be able to see them when you want it is a 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.670
