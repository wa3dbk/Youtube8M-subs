with the trucks when you start the trick
people<00:01:08.250> often<00:01:08.610> have<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> tendency<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.360> face<00:01:09.720> the

people often have a tendency to face the
nose<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> board<00:01:10.680> when<00:01:10.950> they<00:01:11.040> start<00:01:11.280> the

nose of the board when they start the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.250 
nose of the board when they start the
trick<00:01:11.610> which<00:01:12.299> makes<00:01:12.600> them<00:01:12.780> more<00:01:12.930> prone<00:01:13.200> to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
trick which makes them more prone to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.960 

you<00:01:37.670> should<00:01:37.909> bend<00:01:38.119> your<00:01:38.330> knees<00:01:38.510> as<00:01:38.720> well

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.580 

once<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.150> curl<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.510> board<00:01:44.750> over<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.140> get

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
once you curl the board over and get

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.250 

to<00:01:59.580> land<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> trick<00:01:59.940> just<00:02:00.720> give<00:02:00.900> it<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.049> simple

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
to land the trick just give it a simple

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.290 
to land the trick just give it a simple
nudge<00:02:01.560> forward<00:02:01.979> backward<00:02:02.490> paper<00:02:05.119> once<00:02:06.119> you

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
nudge forward backward paper once you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.940 
nudge forward backward paper once you
gain<00:02:06.450> confidence<00:02:06.690> with<00:02:07.080> these<00:02:07.320> rails<00:02:07.530> ends

gain confidence with these rails ends
you<00:02:08.130> can<00:02:08.280> start<00:02:08.520> doing<00:02:08.700> variations<00:02:09.090> both<00:02:09.569> in

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you can start doing variations both in

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.530 
you can start doing variations both in
and<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.590> it
