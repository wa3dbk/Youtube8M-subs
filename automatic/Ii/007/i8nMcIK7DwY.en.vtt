00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 good guys youtube girls we are 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.410
 in another video tutorial thanks to a 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.000
 friend that I had a video of how 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.130
 describe none for him and he's super 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.410
 well explained if you have doubts you can 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.970
 leave in the comments of this case 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.690
 that childish bark left I think that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.690
 the first game 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.039
 then the three links that are not mine 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.530
 are from 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:38.899
 the suns x 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.610
 xy 599 s your name then what 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.199
 let's make it has been the three links 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.620
 and we have to download the three parts 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.140
 that are the winrar file 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.579
 because already the truth after having 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.010
 had some winrar witnesses what are we going 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.380
 to do and downloaded all 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.010
 passed to the desk 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.829
 [Music] 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.839
 they went to the desk and it was fine 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.439
 well I wish the files on the desktop 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:07.320
 and when the salts are going to come out these 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.119
 three files because these three the ones that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.220
 you have to do is give it matter 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.250
 which of these are you going to click 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.110
 right to any of these did 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.659
 because the party's party or not is 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.030
 well and you're going to give it where it says extract 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.100
 here or that after having given extract 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.149
 here you have to wait at most 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.030
 the 10-15 minutes and then it's going to 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.610
 to go out is the goat that I had measure for 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.380
 the following we will have the emulator 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.090
 of the playstation or what I'm going to leave 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.759
 delete description here I do not 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.759
 because I have to look for it in the afternoon 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.670
 the emulator now this 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.010
 [Music] 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.010
 you give the file and cps x 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.290
 and we hope that this will be the folder 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.280
 we started this already count slow 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.410
 because when you record you try to record 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.710
 sing with a game goes slower with 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.819
 games 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.819
 [Applause] 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.330
 d 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.330
 and they will say 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.910

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.510
 folder and here put the files and the 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.270

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.650
 extract those three parts to give 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.439

 according to to save the game very 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.830
 important you can be playing with a 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:22.470

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.339
 No problem 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.339
 [Music]

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.430
