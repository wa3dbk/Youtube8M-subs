that is filled it has four missiles on

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.340 
that is filled it has four missiles on
the<00:00:48.070> top<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:48.670> some<00:00:49.600> of<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:49.839> things<00:00:50.049> that<00:00:50.140> you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
better engine and quite a much better

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.430 
better engine and quite a much better
shield<00:01:00.729> generator<00:01:01.299> in<00:01:01.479> fact<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.170> shield

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
shield generator in fact the shield

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.439 
shield generator in fact the shield
generator<00:01:02.799> is<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.070> same<00:01:03.489> shield<00:01:03.939> generator

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
generator is the same shield generator

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.860 
generator is the same shield generator
that<00:01:04.659> you<00:01:04.780> get<00:01:05.019> on<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:06.990> origin<00:01:08.130> 325<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.600> it's

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
that you get on the origin 325 a so it's

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.560 
that you get on the origin 325 a so it's
quite<00:01:11.380> good<00:01:11.620> indeed<00:01:12.030> we'll<00:01:13.030> just<00:01:13.240> take<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.420> look

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
quite good indeed we'll just take a look

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.410 
quite good indeed we'll just take a look
inside<00:01:15.150> come<00:01:16.150> on

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
inside come on

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.660 
inside come on
there<00:01:16.750> we<00:01:17.020> go<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:22.390> as<00:01:22.540> always<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:22.990> have<00:01:23.230> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
there we go just as always you have the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.500 
there we go just as always you have the
standard<00:01:26.070> interior<00:01:27.070> I<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.930> believe<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.530> get<00:01:29.710> a

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
standard interior I do believe you get a

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.140 
standard interior I do believe you get a
leather<00:01:31.510> seat<00:01:31.930> but<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:33.490> not<00:01:33.670> quite<00:01:33.820> as<00:01:33.910> nice

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
leather seat but it's not quite as nice

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.980 
leather seat but it's not quite as nice
as<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.360> no<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:36.159> not<00:01:36.400> quite<00:01:36.820> as<00:01:37.000> nice<00:01:37.540> of<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.810> seat

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
as a no it's not quite as nice of a seat

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.930 
as a no it's not quite as nice of a seat
as<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.200> get<00:01:38.409> in<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.650> Aurora<00:01:39.010> LN

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
as you get in the Aurora LN

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.649 
as you get in the Aurora LN
but<00:01:41.550> yeah<00:01:42.550> who<00:01:42.730> really<00:01:42.970> cares<00:01:43.150> about<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.480> seat

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
but yeah who really cares about the seat

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.300 
but yeah who really cares about the seat
anyways<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:47.200> still<00:01:47.409> have<00:01:47.590> great<00:01:47.980> visibility

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
anyways you still have great visibility

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.100 
anyways you still have great visibility
as<00:01:48.790> always<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:52.540> one<00:01:52.720> good<00:01:52.930> thing<00:01:52.960> about

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
as always that's one good thing about

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.290 
as always that's one good thing about
pretty<00:01:53.830> much<00:01:53.920> all<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.370> RSI<00:01:54.820> ships<00:01:55.120> that

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
pretty much all of the RSI ships that

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.030 
pretty much all of the RSI ships that
I've<00:01:55.420> seen<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:55.840> far<00:01:55.870> while<00:01:56.620> this<00:01:56.830> in<00:01:56.950> the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
I've seen so far while this in the

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.780 
I've seen so far while this in the
constellation<00:01:57.700> they<00:01:58.270> have<00:01:58.510> quite<00:01:59.050> a<00:01:59.080> good

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
constellation they have quite a good

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.289 
constellation they have quite a good
visibility<00:02:00.790> from<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.690> cockpit<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:03.299> here

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
visibility from the cockpit and here

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.580 
visibility from the cockpit and here
we'll<00:02:04.450> look<00:02:04.510> at<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.810> controls

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
we'll look at the controls

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.050 
we'll look at the controls
we<00:02:05.890> have<00:02:06.570> ws<00:02:07.570> for<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:07.990> pitch<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.500> D<00:02:09.459> for<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.849> roll

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
we have ws for a pitch a D for a roll

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.059 
we have ws for a pitch a D for a roll
cue<00:02:10.629> and

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
cue and

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:20.369 
cue and
for<00:02:12.819> our<00:02:12.939> yaw<00:02:18.719> also<00:02:19.719> one<00:02:19.900> thing<00:02:20.109> to<00:02:20.230> take<00:02:20.319> note

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
for our yaw also one thing to take note

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.110 
for our yaw also one thing to take note
of<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:21.069> Aurora<00:02:21.879> LX<00:02:22.450> also<00:02:22.900> comes<00:02:23.170> with<00:02:23.290> a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
of is the Aurora LX also comes with a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.860 
of is the Aurora LX also comes with a
standard<00:02:25.120> jump<00:02:26.109> or<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.189> jump<00:02:27.459> engine<00:02:27.879> so<00:02:28.150> you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
standard jump or a jump engine so you

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.979 
standard jump or a jump engine so you
can<00:02:29.049> jump<00:02:29.319> from<00:02:29.530> system<00:02:29.889> to<00:02:29.920> system<00:02:30.069> with<00:02:30.549> this

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
can jump from system to system with this

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.199 
can jump from system to system with this
or<00:02:31.989> as<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.590> standard<00:02:33.040> Aurora<00:02:33.370> does<00:02:33.670> not<00:02:33.909> come

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
or as the standard Aurora does not come

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.259 
or as the standard Aurora does not come
stock<00:02:34.510> with<00:02:34.689> a<00:02:34.719> jump<00:02:35.019> engine<00:02:35.909> and<00:02:36.909> we<00:02:37.120> also

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
stock with a jump engine and we also

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.429 
stock with a jump engine and we also
have<00:02:38.819> five<00:02:39.819> tons<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.599> storage<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.290> can

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
have five tons of storage that you can

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.039 
have five tons of storage that you can
stick<00:02:41.859> on<00:02:42.010> underneath<00:02:42.280> here<00:02:42.609> just<00:02:42.849> as<00:02:43.180> with

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
stick on underneath here just as with

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.720 
stick on underneath here just as with
all<00:02:44.409> the<00:02:44.799> other<00:02:45.209> Aurora's<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:47.290> if<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.400> look

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
all the other Aurora's and if you look

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.159 
all the other Aurora's and if you look
you<00:02:48.969> can<00:02:49.209> actually<00:02:49.329> tell<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.870> difference

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:50.169 
you can actually tell the difference

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.119 
you can actually tell the difference
between<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.590> engines

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
between the engines

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.220 
between the engines
this<00:02:51.609> actually<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:52.090> supposedly<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.930> same

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
this actually is supposedly the same

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.189 
this actually is supposedly the same
engine<00:02:53.650> as<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.829> Aurora<00:02:54.430> LN<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.510> doesn't<00:02:56.079> look

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:56.199 
engine as the Aurora LN but doesn't look

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.050 
engine as the Aurora LN but doesn't look
like<00:02:56.379> it<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.650> if<00:02:57.099> you<00:02:57.250> go<00:02:57.370> back<00:02:57.549> in<00:02:57.699> my<00:02:57.790> video

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
like it is if you go back in my video

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.000 
like it is if you go back in my video
you'll<00:02:58.299> see<00:02:58.359> the<00:02:58.480> Aurora<00:02:58.870> Ln<00:02:59.230> looks<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.739> little

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
you'll see the Aurora Ln looks a little

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.909 
you'll see the Aurora Ln looks a little
bit<00:03:00.219> different<00:03:01.319> but<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:02.469> can't<00:03:02.680> tell<00:03:02.829> the

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
bit different but you can't tell the

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.170 
bit different but you can't tell the
difference<00:03:02.949> between<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.609> engine<00:03:03.909> between

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
difference between the engine between

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.800 
difference between the engine between
the<00:03:04.449> marque<00:03:05.079> and<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:06.010> luxury<00:03:06.549> edition<00:03:06.879> and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
the marque and the luxury edition and

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.319 
the marque and the luxury edition and
yeah<00:03:07.989> as<00:03:08.829> you<00:03:09.069> see<00:03:09.219> the<00:03:09.459> twitching<00:03:09.879> screen

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
yeah as you see the twitching screen

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.699 
yeah as you see the twitching screen
still<00:03:10.599> hasn't<00:03:10.870> gone<00:03:10.959> away<00:03:11.169> but<00:03:11.230> they<00:03:11.469> haven't

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
still hasn't gone away but they haven't

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.589 
still hasn't gone away but they haven't
updated<00:03:11.829> it<00:03:12.250> since<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.730> last<00:03:12.909> time<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.269> made<00:03:13.540> a

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
updated it since the last time I made a

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.089 
updated it since the last time I made a
video<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.870> still<00:03:17.229> comes<00:03:17.439> standard<00:03:17.709> with<00:03:17.889> the

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
video it still comes standard with the

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.670 
video it still comes standard with the
same<00:03:18.759> two<00:03:19.030> guns<00:03:19.299> that<00:03:19.449> come<00:03:19.900> on<00:03:20.109> most<00:03:20.379> of<00:03:20.560> the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
same two guns that come on most of the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.449 
same two guns that come on most of the
Aurora's<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:22.470> think<00:03:23.470> they're<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.769> behringer

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
Aurora's I think they're the behringer

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.080 
Aurora's I think they're the behringer
guns<00:03:24.790> or<00:03:25.090> something<00:03:25.359> like<00:03:25.479> that<00:03:25.799> they're<00:03:26.799> just

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
guns or something like that they're just

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.199 
guns or something like that they're just
low<00:03:28.090> powered<00:03:28.449> laser<00:03:28.989> rifles<00:03:29.470> they're<00:03:30.209> not

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
low powered laser rifles they're not

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.030 
low powered laser rifles they're not
really<00:03:31.479> meant<00:03:31.750> for<00:03:31.840> offensive<00:03:32.439> combat<00:03:32.889> oh

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
really meant for offensive combat oh

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.369 
really meant for offensive combat oh
also<00:03:33.699> I<00:03:34.090> forgot<00:03:34.419> to<00:03:34.569> mention<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.829> Aurora<00:03:36.340> LX

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
also I forgot to mention the Aurora LX

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.679 
also I forgot to mention the Aurora LX
comes<00:03:38.379> with<00:03:38.769> eight<00:03:39.280> maneuver<00:03:40.209> thrusters

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
comes with eight maneuver thrusters

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.710 
comes with eight maneuver thrusters
whereas<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.290> Marquis<00:03:41.769> comes<00:03:42.069> with<00:03:42.280> six<00:03:42.720> so

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
whereas the Marquis comes with six so

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.780 
whereas the Marquis comes with six so
this<00:03:43.989> is<00:03:44.169> potentially<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:45.099> much<00:03:45.370> more

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
this is potentially a much more

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.699 
this is potentially a much more
maneuverable<00:03:46.030> craft<00:03:46.720> than<00:03:47.229> the<00:03:47.409> other

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
maneuverable craft than the other

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.289 
maneuverable craft than the other
Aurora's<00:03:49.560> so<00:03:50.560> despite<00:03:51.519> them<00:03:51.879> looking

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
Aurora's so despite them looking

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.959 
Aurora's so despite them looking
incredibly<00:03:53.049> similar<00:03:53.370> they<00:03:54.370> are<00:03:54.400> actually

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:54.969 
incredibly similar they are actually

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.240 
incredibly similar they are actually
quite<00:03:55.449> different<00:03:55.719> in<00:03:55.930> almost<00:03:56.139> every<00:03:56.530> every

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
quite different in almost every every

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.369 
quite different in almost every every
respect<00:03:57.849> I<00:03:58.120> think<00:03:58.719> the<00:03:58.959> only<00:03:59.199> way<00:03:59.349> that

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
respect I think the only way that

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.559 
respect I think the only way that
they're<00:03:59.650> similar<00:04:00.009> is<00:04:00.189> they're<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:01.000> same<00:04:01.239> hall

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
they're similar is they're the same hall

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.770 
they're similar is they're the same hall
they<00:04:01.840> have<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.139> same<00:04:02.409> two<00:04:02.739> guns<00:04:03.159> and<00:04:03.780> that's

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
they have the same two guns and that's

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.879 
they have the same two guns and that's
about<00:04:05.169> it<00:04:07.199> well<00:04:08.199> I<00:04:08.259> am<00:04:08.409> they<00:04:08.530> had<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.709> same

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
about it well I am they had the same

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.199 
about it well I am they had the same
amount<00:04:09.069> of<00:04:09.250> mounting<00:04:09.549> points<00:04:09.819> but<00:04:09.879> everything

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
amount of mounting points but everything

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.999 
amount of mounting points but everything
everything<00:04:10.959> else<00:04:11.109> is<00:04:11.289> different<00:04:11.439> different

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:12.009 
everything else is different different

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.459 
everything else is different different
engine<00:04:12.840> different<00:04:13.840> power<00:04:13.989> plant<00:04:14.259> different

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:14.469 
engine different power plant different

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.990 
engine different power plant different
shields<00:04:15.129> and<00:04:16.139> has<00:04:17.139> a<00:04:17.169> jump<00:04:18.009> engine<00:04:18.340> as<00:04:18.459> well<00:04:18.609> so

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
shields and has a jump engine as well so

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.610 
shields and has a jump engine as well so
there<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:19.930> go<00:04:20.019> that's<00:04:20.199> just<00:04:20.409> a<00:04:20.500> quick

there you go that's just a quick

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.610 
there you go that's just a quick
