00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
worked great but from that point forward

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.020 
worked great but from that point forward
I<00:01:21.630> was<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.960> it'd<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.920> nice<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.159> hear<00:01:23.490> him<00:01:23.640> sing

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030

it<00:01:24.270> or<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> sing<00:01:24.900> part<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it or a sing part of it I think in the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.440 
it or a sing part of it I think in the
beginning<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.610> were<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.880> thinking<00:01:26.939> maybe

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
beginning we were just thinking maybe

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.330 
beginning we were just thinking maybe
have<00:01:27.689> him<00:01:27.810> sing<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> verse<00:01:28.200> or<00:01:28.650> something<00:01:29.159> you

know<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:30.689> similar<00:01:30.960> thing<00:01:31.290> happened<00:01:31.710> with

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
know and a similar thing happened with

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.130 
know and a similar thing happened with
dr.<00:01:32.220> John<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.000> toots<00:01:33.329> from<00:01:33.659> toots<00:01:33.930> and

dr. John and with toots from toots and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200 
dr. John and with toots from toots and
the<00:01:34.170> maytals<00:01:34.650> where<00:01:35.040> there<00:01:35.310> were<00:01:35.430> two<00:01:36.180> other

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the maytals where there were two other

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.600 
the maytals where there were two other
songs<00:01:36.780> one<00:01:37.229> called<00:01:37.530> scared<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> live<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.520> we

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
songs one called scared to live that we

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.179 
songs one called scared to live that we
thought<00:01:38.850> about<00:01:38.970> toots<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.829> called

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
thought about toots for and one called

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.249 
thought about toots for and one called
stoop<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.790> low<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.299> thought<00:01:42.509> about<00:01:42.630> dr.

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
stoop so low that we thought about dr.

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.219 
stoop so low that we thought about dr.
John<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:44.090> but<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.450> still<00:01:45.750> hadn't<00:01:46.110> made<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
John for but we still hadn't made the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.100 
John for but we still hadn't made the
decision<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.829> bring<00:01:47.100> any<00:01:47.340> guest<00:01:47.899> onto<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
decision to bring any guest onto the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
decision to bring any guest onto the
playing<00:01:49.500> field<00:01:49.890> once<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.460> started<00:01:50.790> thinking

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
playing field once we started thinking

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.060 
playing field once we started thinking
that<00:01:51.180> way<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.869> kind<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.350> made<00:01:52.530> sense<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> have

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
that way it kind of made sense to have

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.990 
that way it kind of made sense to have
them<00:01:53.250> sing<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> entire<00:01:53.759> song<00:01:54.420> instead<00:01:55.350> of

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
them sing the entire song instead of

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.569 
them sing the entire song instead of
