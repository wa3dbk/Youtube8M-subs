I'm<00:00:00.329> wearing<00:00:00.750> at<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:00.840> counter<00:00:01.199> attack<00:00:01.319> right

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
I'm wearing at the counter attack right

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.430 
I'm wearing at the counter attack right
now<00:00:01.890> and<00:00:02.190> that<00:00:02.389> you<00:00:03.389> guys<00:00:03.540> see<00:00:03.750> coming<00:00:04.080> up<00:00:04.200> is

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
now and that you guys see coming up is

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.789 
now and that you guys see coming up is
the<00:00:04.680> nidus<00:00:05.160> network<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:06.720> new<00:00:07.109> night<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.500> canal

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
the nidus network the new night is canal

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.560 
the nidus network the new night is canal
for<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.069> Zerg<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:09.030> haven't<00:00:09.300> really<00:00:09.420> been

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
for the Zerg and I haven't really been

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.209 
for the Zerg and I haven't really been
able<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.870> use<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.080> building<00:00:10.769> all<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.040> much

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
able to use that building all that much

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.879 
able to use that building all that much
either<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.049> nidus<00:00:13.380> network<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
either and the the nidus network is a

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.630 
either and the the nidus network is a
very<00:00:14.309> very<00:00:14.549> cool<00:00:14.759> addition<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.949> to<00:00:16.949> desert<00:00:17.369> and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
very very cool addition to to desert and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.359 
very very cool addition to to desert and
starcraft<00:00:18.090> 2<00:00:18.920> and<00:00:19.920> i<00:00:19.949> guess<00:00:20.100> i'll<00:00:20.220> go<00:00:20.340> ahead

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
starcraft 2 and i guess i'll go ahead

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.099 
starcraft 2 and i guess i'll go ahead
and<00:00:20.580> explain<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> nidus<00:00:21.449> network<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.869> little

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
and explain the nidus network a little

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.590 
and explain the nidus network a little
bit<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.920> basically<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.850> nine<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.269> canal

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
bit it's basically like a nine is canal

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.560 
bit it's basically like a nine is canal
except<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.160> spawn<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> nydus<00:00:27.090> worm<00:00:27.300> in

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
except you have to spawn a nydus worm in

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.470 
except you have to spawn a nydus worm in
order<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.439> make<00:00:28.560> an<00:00:28.710> exit<00:00:29.130> point<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
order to make an exit point and the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.269 
order to make an exit point and the
nydus<00:00:30.750> worm<00:00:30.929> costs<00:00:31.140> 100<00:00:31.500> minnows<00:00:31.740> 100<00:00:32.099> gasps

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
nydus worm costs 100 minnows 100 gasps

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.370 
nydus worm costs 100 minnows 100 gasps
but<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.820> make<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.090> anywhere<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.480> see<00:00:33.840> it

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
but you can make it anywhere you see it

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.040 
but you can make it anywhere you see it
doesn't<00:00:34.620> require<00:00:34.860> creep<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.780> once<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.899> make

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
doesn't require creep and once you make

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.470 
doesn't require creep and once you make
the<00:00:37.079> nydus<00:00:37.469> worm<00:00:37.710> then<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.820> bring<00:00:39.239> all

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the nydus worm then you can bring all

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.180 
the nydus worm then you can bring all
your<00:00:39.660> units<00:00:39.899> out<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> night<00:00:40.410> its<00:00:40.559> network

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
your units out of the night its network

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.400 
your units out of the night its network
where<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> nydus<00:00:42.270> worm<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.930> works<00:00:43.079> two

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
where the nydus worm is and it works two

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.560 
where the nydus worm is and it works two
ways<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.129> bring<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.489> back<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> forth

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
ways so you can bring it back and forth

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.479 
ways so you can bring it back and forth
between<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.289> worm<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.680> net<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
between the worm in the net and the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.310 
between the worm in the net and the
network<00:00:50.059> and<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.329> does<00:00:51.480> hold<00:00:51.719> an<00:00:51.899> unlimited

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
network and it does hold an unlimited

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
network and it does hold an unlimited
number<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.800> units<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> very<00:00:55.829> very<00:00:55.890> cool<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
number of units so very very cool a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.119 
number of units so very very cool a
modification<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.960> old<00:00:58.170> nidus<00:00:58.649> canal<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
modification to the old nidus canal and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.250 
modification to the old nidus canal and
is<00:00:59.430> easily<00:00:59.699> accessible<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.510> layer<00:01:00.719> tech<00:01:01.020> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
is easily accessible at layer tech and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.590 
is easily accessible at layer tech and
here<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.920> summoning<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> nydus<00:01:03.120> worm<00:01:03.359> for

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
here we go summoning the nydus worm for

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.990 
here we go summoning the nydus worm for
100<00:01:03.960> minnows<00:01:04.199> 100<00:01:04.559> gold<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.949> I'm<00:01:05.519> loading<00:01:05.880> up

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
100 minnows 100 gold and I'm loading up

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.789 
100 minnows 100 gold and I'm loading up
the<00:01:06.090> nidus<00:01:06.360> network<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.680> my

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the nidus network now with all of my

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
the nidus network now with all of my

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
units and as soon as this worm pops out

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.469 
units and as soon as this worm pops out
makes<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.740> roarings<00:01:11.220> down<00:01:11.460> its<00:01:11.880> able<00:01:12.450> to

makes that roarings down its able to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.270 
makes that roarings down its able to
unload<00:01:13.049> all<00:01:13.320> those<00:01:13.500> units<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.250> go

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
unload all those units and here we go

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.340 
unload all those units and here we go

this<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.640> quite<00:01:49.640> interesting<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.360> take<00:01:50.540> down

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
this is a quite interesting I take down

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.240 
this is a quite interesting I take down
the<00:01:50.840> engineering<00:01:51.350> base<00:01:51.530> which<00:01:51.830> is<00:01:51.860> almost

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
the engineering base which is almost

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.820 
the engineering base which is almost
dead<00:01:52.490> anyways<00:01:52.850> but<00:01:53.060> I've<00:01:53.660> discovered<00:01:54.440> that<00:01:54.650> my

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
dead anyways but I've discovered that my

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.070 
dead anyways but I've discovered that my
opponent<00:01:55.100> has<00:01:55.280> forced<00:01:56.120> our<00:01:56.390> ports<00:01:56.750> which<00:01:56.900> is

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
opponent has forced our ports which is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.130 
opponent has forced our ports which is
almost<00:01:57.860> like<00:01:58.040> an<00:01:58.220> all<00:01:58.460> in<00:01:58.760> air<00:01:59.210> cheese<00:01:59.780> build

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
almost like an all in air cheese build

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.560 
almost like an all in air cheese build
and<00:02:00.380> there's<00:02:00.800> actually<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:01.130> random<00:02:01.640> creeper

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
and there's actually a random creeper

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.700 
and there's actually a random creeper
coming<00:02:02.840> in<00:02:02.930> there<00:02:03.050> I'm<00:02:03.140> gonna<00:02:03.260> take<00:02:03.440> care<00:02:03.650> of

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
coming in there I'm gonna take care of

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.790 
coming in there I'm gonna take care of
that<00:02:03.860> but<00:02:04.070> for<00:02:05.060> starport<00:02:05.720> that's<00:02:06.500> going<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:06.740> be

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
that but for starport that's going to be

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.469 
that but for starport that's going to be
a<00:02:06.830> lot<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.130> banshees<00:02:07.610> so<00:02:07.760> I've<00:02:07.940> got<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.390> be

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
a lot of banshees so I've got to be

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.969 
a lot of banshees so I've got to be
careful<00:02:08.630> about<00:02:08.899> these<00:02:09.080> banshees<00:02:09.530> they<00:02:09.680> can<00:02:09.860> be

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
careful about these banshees they can be

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.090 
careful about these banshees they can be
very<00:02:10.010> deadly<00:02:10.610> worker<00:02:11.570> Raiders<00:02:12.050> so<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:12.860> do<00:02:12.950> have

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
very deadly worker Raiders so I do have

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.980 
very deadly worker Raiders so I do have
an<00:02:13.310> overseer<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:13.850> case<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.180> Banshees<00:02:14.600> having

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
an overseer in case the Banshees having

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.130 
an overseer in case the Banshees having
visibility<00:02:15.460> research<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.970> I've<00:02:20.780> got<00:02:20.960> to<00:02:21.050> be

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
visibility research and I've got to be

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.330 
visibility research and I've got to be
really<00:02:21.350> careful<00:02:21.500> that's<00:02:21.830> why<00:02:21.980> I'm<00:02:22.040> getting

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
really careful that's why I'm getting

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.170 
really careful that's why I'm getting
these<00:02:22.820> hydraulics<00:02:23.720> now<00:02:23.870> which<00:02:24.700> are<00:02:25.700> able<00:02:26.090> to

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
these hydraulics now which are able to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.090 
these hydraulics now which are able to
attack<00:02:26.480> air<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.020> hopefully<00:02:27.770> we'll<00:02:27.950> be<00:02:28.070> able

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
attack air and hopefully we'll be able

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.770 
attack air and hopefully we'll be able
to<00:02:28.310> keep<00:02:28.490> those<00:02:28.640> banshees<00:02:29.120> away<00:02:29.480> from<00:02:29.690> my

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
to keep those banshees away from my

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.380 
to keep those banshees away from my
workers<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:33.350> in<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.430> last<00:02:34.640> attack<00:02:34.820> i'm<00:02:35.150> not

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
workers and in that last attack i'm not

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.670 
workers and in that last attack i'm not
sure<00:02:35.570> if<00:02:35.630> i<00:02:35.720> was<00:02:35.840> able<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.110> kill<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:36.530> many

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
sure if i was able to kill that many

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.400 
sure if i was able to kill that many
suvs<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.250> actually<00:02:37.760> my<00:02:37.910> opponent<00:02:38.360> is<00:02:38.540> coming

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
suvs and actually my opponent is coming

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.670 
suvs and actually my opponent is coming
in<00:02:39.530> with<00:02:39.560> those<00:02:39.860> banshees<00:02:40.340> right<00:02:40.580> now<00:02:44.680> and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
in with those banshees right now and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.300 
in with those banshees right now and
unfortunately<00:02:46.030> my<00:02:47.030> gold<00:02:47.870> expo<00:02:48.830> of<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.130> third

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
unfortunately my gold expo of the third

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.010 
unfortunately my gold expo of the third
Expo<00:02:49.610> has<00:02:49.790> been<00:02:50.000> discovered<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.510> canceled<00:02:50.990> that

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
Expo has been discovered I canceled that

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.790 
Expo has been discovered I canceled that
hatchery<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.810> only<00:02:54.020> ntr<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:54.500> have<00:02:54.650> right

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
hatchery and the only ntr I have right

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.320 
hatchery and the only ntr I have right
now<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.040> really<00:02:55.220> these<00:02:55.430> hydrolysed<00:02:56.060> which<00:02:56.180> are

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
now is really these hydrolysed which are

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.330 
now is really these hydrolysed which are
really<00:02:56.780> really<00:02:56.989> slow<00:02:57.380> now<00:02:57.620> they<00:02:57.800> don't<00:02:58.040> have<00:02:58.310> a

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
really really slow now they don't have a

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.240 
really really slow now they don't have a
speed<00:02:58.850> upgrade<00:02:59.209> anymore<00:02:59.739> and<00:03:00.739> they<00:03:00.890> move<00:03:01.100> even

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
speed upgrade anymore and they move even

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.190 
speed upgrade anymore and they move even
slower<00:03:01.760> off<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.180> creep<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.720> they're<00:03:02.959> not

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
slower off the creep so they're not

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.290 
slower off the creep so they're not
actually<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.950> best<00:03:04.130> anti<00:03:04.580> air<00:03:04.790> anymore<00:03:05.000> it's

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
actually the best anti air anymore it's

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.720 
actually the best anti air anymore it's
very<00:03:05.600> hard<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.870> use<00:03:06.020> them<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.470> move<00:03:07.430> around

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
very hard to use them to move around

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.600 
very hard to use them to move around
from<00:03:07.910> X<00:03:08.180> go-to<00:03:08.420> expert<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:09.020> defend<00:03:09.440> against<00:03:10.400> an

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
from X go-to expert to defend against an

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.420 
from X go-to expert to defend against an
air<00:03:10.970> attack<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:12.170> these<00:03:12.320> fancies<00:03:12.860> are<00:03:13.010> keeping

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
air attack so these fancies are keeping

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.540 
air attack so these fancies are keeping
me<00:03:13.550> inside<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.940> base<00:03:14.830> and<00:03:15.830> there's<00:03:16.310> really

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
me inside the base and there's really

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.890 
me inside the base and there's really
not<00:03:16.730> much<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.060> can<00:03:17.120> do<00:03:17.330> right<00:03:17.360> now<00:03:17.480> until<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:17.870> can

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
not much I can do right now until I can

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.740 
not much I can do right now until I can
get<00:03:18.110> a<00:03:18.170> spire<00:03:18.560> up<00:03:18.800> and<00:03:19.070> get<00:03:19.700> some<00:03:19.880> anti<00:03:20.300> air<00:03:20.450> of

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
get a spire up and get some anti air of

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.900 
get a spire up and get some anti air of
my<00:03:21.200> own<00:03:21.350> such<00:03:21.650> as<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:21.860> corruptor<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.820> I'm

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
my own such as the corruptor and I'm

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.210 
my own such as the corruptor and I'm
hoping<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.300> corruptor<00:03:23.860> will<00:03:24.860> be<00:03:24.950> able<00:03:25.040> to

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
hoping the corruptor will be able to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:34.699 
hoping the corruptor will be able to
deal<00:03:25.430> with<00:03:25.459> these<00:03:25.610> be<00:03:25.790> n<00:03:25.850> cheese

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.009 

and<00:03:35.709> as<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:36.519> guys<00:03:36.579> can<00:03:36.790> see<00:03:36.849> one<00:03:37.269> queen<00:03:37.569> is<00:03:37.810> all

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
and as you guys can see one queen is all

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.780 
and as you guys can see one queen is all
you<00:03:38.200> need<00:03:38.230> for<00:03:38.620> two<00:03:38.799> hatcheries<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.430> can<00:03:39.579> just

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
you need for two hatcheries you can just

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.940 
you need for two hatcheries you can just
use<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:40.150> Queen<00:03:40.500> moving<00:03:41.500> back<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:41.859> forth

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
use the Queen moving back and forth

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.770 
use the Queen moving back and forth
continuing<00:03:42.849> to<00:03:42.939> spawn<00:03:43.180> larvae<00:03:43.569> on<00:03:43.659> each

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
continuing to spawn larvae on each

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.800 
continuing to spawn larvae on each
hatchery<00:03:44.879> but<00:03:45.879> eventually<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.450> do<00:03:46.599> want<00:03:46.780> to

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
hatchery but eventually you do want to

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:57.750 
hatchery but eventually you do want to
get<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.650> as<00:03:56.799> you<00:03:56.950> guys<00:03:57.069> can<00:03:57.250> see<00:03:57.310> moving

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
get to and as you guys can see moving

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.910

but I'm finding myself very much under a
lot<00:06:21.740> of<00:06:21.770> pressure<00:06:22.099> from<00:06:22.280> these<00:06:22.490> banshees<00:06:22.879> I

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
lot of pressure from these banshees I

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.390 
lot of pressure from these banshees I
can't<00:06:23.419> really<00:06:23.599> move<00:06:23.719> out<00:06:24.110> until<00:06:24.409> I<00:06:25.009> get<00:06:25.189> enough

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
can't really move out until I get enough

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.100 
can't really move out until I get enough
corruptors<00:06:25.879> to<00:06:26.029> deal<00:06:26.270> with<00:06:26.449> those<00:06:26.599> banshees

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
corruptors to deal with those banshees

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.390 
corruptors to deal with those banshees
and<00:06:28.360> these<00:06:29.360> Hydra<00:06:29.749> lists<00:06:30.080> are<00:06:30.439> just<00:06:30.770> not<00:06:30.949> fast

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
and these Hydra lists are just not fast

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.489 
and these Hydra lists are just not fast
enough<00:06:31.610> anymore<00:06:32.060> to<00:06:32.240> deal<00:06:32.569> with<00:06:32.779> anti<00:06:33.110> air<00:06:33.259> as

enough anymore to deal with anti air as

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:39.519 
enough anymore to deal with anti air as
