see<00:05:45.590> that<00:05:45.620> that<00:05:46.160> passion<00:05:46.460> because<00:05:46.940> I<00:05:46.970> think<00:05:47.539> a

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
see that that passion because I think a

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.110 
see that that passion because I think a
beautiful<00:05:47.990> structure<00:05:48.410> it<00:05:49.039> may<00:05:49.430> be<00:05:49.490> hard<00:05:49.820> for

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
beautiful structure it may be hard for

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.060

some<00:05:50.300> people<00:05:50.450> to<00:05:50.630> see<00:05:50.900> it<00:05:51.080> that<00:05:51.229> way<00:05:51.410> but<00:05:51.470> every

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
some people to see it that way but every

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.710 
some people to see it that way but every
time<00:05:52.190> I<00:05:52.250> look<00:05:52.550> how<00:05:52.669> I<00:05:52.700> get<00:05:52.880> excited<00:05:53.150> the<00:05:53.419> barrel

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
time I look how I get excited the barrel

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.420

be a beautiful beautiful space and we

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.900 
be a beautiful beautiful space and we
hope<00:06:03.139> they<00:06:03.289> can<00:06:03.380> pull<00:06:03.410> it<00:06:03.620> off<00:06:03.710> it's<00:06:04.610> going<00:06:04.820> to

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
hope they can pull it off it's going to

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.790 
hope they can pull it off it's going to
take<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.330> financial<00:06:05.630> viability<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.530> get<00:06:06.680> it

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
take the financial viability to get it

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.740 
take the financial viability to get it
done<00:06:06.979> and<00:06:07.280> to<00:06:07.820> really<00:06:08.030> get<00:06:08.240> people<00:06:08.600> to

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
done and to really get people to

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.080 
done and to really get people to
participate<00:06:09.160> but<00:06:10.160> I<00:06:10.220> think<00:06:10.700> what's<00:06:10.880> going<00:06:11.000> to

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
participate but I think what's going to

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.600 
participate but I think what's going to
make<00:06:11.240> it<00:06:11.479> stand<00:06:12.380> on<00:06:12.590> its<00:06:12.740> own<00:06:12.889> is<00:06:13.130> the

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
make it stand on its own is the

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.029 
make it stand on its own is the
uniqueness<00:06:13.909> of<00:06:14.030> its<00:06:14.360> history<00:06:14.539> its<00:06:15.320> ability<00:06:15.860> to

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
uniqueness of its history its ability to

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.370 
uniqueness of its history its ability to
bring<00:06:16.280> passion<00:06:16.520> to<00:06:16.940> the

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
bring passion to the

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.440 
bring passion to the
and<00:06:17.740> really<00:06:18.310> see<00:06:18.520> it<00:06:18.610> through<00:06:18.880> to<00:06:18.910> where<00:06:19.240> it

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
and really see it through to where it

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.960 
and really see it through to where it
needs<00:06:19.630> to<00:06:20.050> be<00:06:20.170> and<00:06:20.980> if<00:06:21.220> we<00:06:21.370> can<00:06:21.520> hold<00:06:21.640> true<00:06:21.850> to

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
needs to be and if we can hold true to

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.030 
needs to be and if we can hold true to
that<00:06:22.000> I<00:06:22.150> think<00:06:22.750> it's<00:06:22.930> going<00:06:23.260> to<00:06:23.350> have<00:06:23.530> a<00:06:23.800> higher

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
that I think it's going to have a higher

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.210 
that I think it's going to have a higher
value<00:06:24.280> than<00:06:24.510> just<00:06:25.650> with<00:06:26.650> the<00:06:26.770> bottom<00:06:27.040> line

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
value than just with the bottom line

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.180

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
people in and so I think it couldn't be

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.020 
people in and so I think it couldn't be
in<00:07:17.080> a<00:07:17.140> more<00:07:17.170> ideal<00:07:17.440> location<00:07:18.100> it's<00:07:18.820> going<00:07:18.970> to

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030 
in a more ideal location it's going to

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.700 
in a more ideal location it's going to
be<00:07:19.120> something<00:07:19.360> that<00:07:19.570> we<00:07:19.870> can<00:07:19.900> all<00:07:20.200> be<00:07:20.410> proud<00:07:20.440> of
