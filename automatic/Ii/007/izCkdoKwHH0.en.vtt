00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.730 
I found a stroke of luck today when I
was<00:00:08.760> going<00:00:09.120> through<00:00:09.330> my<00:00:09.389> game<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.650> know

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
was going through my game and you know

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.860 
was going through my game and you know
how<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.099> emulators<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.910> can<00:00:12.059> have<00:00:12.269> safe

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
how with emulators you can have safe

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.160 
how with emulators you can have safe
States<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.530> can<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.980> actual

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
States and you can have the actual

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.560 
States and you can have the actual
internal<00:00:16.170> hard<00:00:16.470> drive<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.980> game<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.609> guess

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
internal hard drive of the game I guess

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.790 
internal hard drive of the game I guess
you<00:00:18.660> could<00:00:18.810> call<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.260> like<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> memory

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
you could call it that I like the memory

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.320 
you could call it that I like the memory
chip<00:00:20.039> whatever<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.310> want<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.490> say<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:21.150> could

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
chip whatever you want to say you could

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.759 
chip whatever you want to say you could
have<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.779> save<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.320> as<00:00:22.380> well

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
have that save it as well

definitely failed these are dead dango
snakes<00:02:39.590> think<00:02:39.769> that's<00:02:39.890> what<00:02:40.040> they're<00:02:40.160> called

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
snakes think that's what they're called

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.920 
snakes think that's what they're called
they<00:02:40.489> kind<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.760> look<00:02:40.879> like<00:02:40.910> testicles<00:02:41.840> with

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
they kind of look like testicles with

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.039 
they kind of look like testicles with
mouths<00:02:42.170> but<00:02:42.890> anyway<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:44.090> put<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.690> bombs<00:02:44.870> in

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
mouths but anyway you put the bombs in

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.830 
mouths but anyway you put the bombs in
their<00:02:45.140> mouths<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.650> they'll<00:02:46.130> blow<00:02:46.310> up

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
their mouths and they'll blow up

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.199 
their mouths and they'll blow up
generally<00:02:47.840> as<00:02:48.019> you<00:02:48.380> approach<00:02:48.680> them<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:50.090> you

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
generally as you approach them and you

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.120 
generally as you approach them and you
get<00:02:50.329> closer<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.780> them<00:02:50.959> they<00:02:51.739> will<00:02:51.920> head<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
get closer to them they will head the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.530 
get closer to them they will head the
opposite<00:02:52.459> direction<00:02:52.549> so<00:02:53.060> if<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.329> had<00:02:53.450> the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
opposite direction so if you had the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.240 
opposite direction so if you had the
opposite<00:02:53.780> direction<00:02:54.019> then<00:02:54.260> head<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:55.130> way

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
opposite direction then head the way

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.520 
opposite direction then head the way
that<00:02:55.280> they're<00:02:55.519> going<00:02:55.549> quickly<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:57.260> can<00:02:57.380> beat

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
that they're going quickly you can beat

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.530 
that they're going quickly you can beat
them<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.829> there's<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.790> weird<00:02:59.000> little<00:02:59.150> glitch

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
them and there's a weird little glitch

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.210 
them and there's a weird little glitch
in<00:02:59.810> here<00:03:00.079> it's<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.319> good<00:03:00.530> glitch<00:03:00.769> this<00:03:00.980> time

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
in here it's a good glitch this time

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.650 
in here it's a good glitch this time
it's<00:03:01.400> not<00:03:01.549> any<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.030> bad<00:03:02.180> ones<00:03:02.390> like<00:03:02.510> I've

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
it's not any of the bad ones like I've

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.000 
it's not any of the bad ones like I've
been<00:03:02.900> having<00:03:03.170> for<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.380> past<00:03:03.590> couple<00:03:03.829> of<00:03:03.950> weeks

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
but uh it's a good glitch um as I was

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:09.850 
but uh it's a good glitch um as I was
fighting<00:03:08.780> these<00:03:08.870> guys<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:09.410> know<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.530> probably

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
fighting these guys you know I probably

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:24.589 
like I did earlier because there's a

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:25.839 
like I did earlier because there's a
secret<00:06:24.800> wall<00:06:25.099> in<00:06:25.219> here<00:06:25.370> that<00:06:25.490> you<00:06:25.550> don't<00:06:25.580> know

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
secret wall in here that you don't know

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.219 
secret wall in here that you don't know
about<00:06:26.150> and<00:06:26.300> you<00:06:26.330> need<00:06:26.599> it<00:06:26.629> to<00:06:26.779> finish<00:06:26.990> the

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
about and you need it to finish the

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:29.769 
about and you need it to finish the
dungeon<00:06:27.589> okay<00:06:28.339> like<00:06:28.819> you<00:06:28.939> I<00:06:29.180> tapped<00:06:29.509> on<00:06:29.629> here

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:29.779 
dungeon okay like you I tapped on here

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:30.850 
dungeon okay like you I tapped on here
twice<00:06:29.990> because<00:06:30.139> I<00:06:30.259> remember<00:06:30.529> what<00:06:30.589> it<00:06:30.680> was<00:06:30.710> but

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
twice because I remember what it was but

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.079 
twice because I remember what it was but
if<00:06:31.129> it<00:06:31.219> makes<00:06:31.279> that<00:06:31.490> boring<00:06:31.789> boring<00:06:32.060> boring

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:32.089 
if it makes that boring boring boring

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:33.670 
if it makes that boring boring boring
sound<00:06:32.569> then<00:06:32.839> that's<00:06:33.169> where<00:06:33.289> you<00:06:33.319> have<00:06:33.440> to<00:06:33.469> bomb

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
sound then that's where you have to bomb

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.530 
sound then that's where you have to bomb
it<00:06:33.860> but<00:06:34.370> uh<00:06:34.399> and<00:06:34.759> I<00:06:35.569> think<00:06:35.750> that's<00:06:35.899> the

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
it but uh and I think that's the

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.200 
it but uh and I think that's the
compass<00:06:36.870> inhere<00:06:37.590> yeah<00:06:38.550> it<00:06:38.670> is<00:06:38.760> the<00:06:38.910> compass

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
compass inhere yeah it is the compass

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.340 
compass inhere yeah it is the compass
