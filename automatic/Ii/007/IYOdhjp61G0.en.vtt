00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.080
 hang up with mac os x lion like 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.360
 does that work best i have one 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 macbook air and did not want to use that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.750
 that I'm just from itunes one 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.009
 Play playlist but I found it 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.560
 important if for example a song 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.390
 must come from the audience that one 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.580
 sometimes can hear before and then say 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.689
 hey that suits you the song or that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.800
 does not fit at all 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.220
 That's why I found that the program yes 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.750
 that itunes is less suitable 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.329
 with itunes I have always only the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.410
 possibility that one main exit 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.690
 has and everything about the main output 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.940
 is played then comes from the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.340
 loud speaker out and that is on permanent 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.660
 I think it's a bit too bad 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.100
 you could just get one now 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.329
 playlist the easy and also create 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.460
 that just play 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.170
 but it would be the end of me here 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.579
 something different but in the song 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.129
 I could not say that right now 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.809
 I need my researcher to find out what 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.030
 is played next as it sounds 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.540
 that and move on and that's why 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.450
 then you use such a dj program and 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.299
 that 's really the coolest thing there is 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.939
 really dj is the program so 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.920
 djk y is available on the App Store 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.860
 but there is also a freeware looks 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.689
 not so beautiful is called mix and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.009
 what is the cool thing with this program 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.439
 once i have my two platters 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.210
 can then easily between these controllers 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.610
 great to make the transitions 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.079
 I can continue between the songs 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.299
 Perfect on the iTunes library 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.759
 so even songs that so in the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.920
 drm have to copy protection can be great 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.259
 Trouper be played and the great 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.140
 is one can easily with several 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.579
 work audio output and therefore do 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.759
 I'll ask you if you hang up 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.619
 get an external usb sound card 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.030
 because you can just go here 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.880
 you can just see a picture 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.460
 create a second exit and have one 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.969
 uses the macbook air output for euro 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.640
 headphones and the second exit for 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.930
 this speaker why the usb card 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.610
 for these speakers simply because the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.470
 had more performance had best quality 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.790
 is simply a better sound card than 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.739
 which would be installed internally 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.219
 yes, and then how does it work? 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.909
 I would now my my 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.909
 turntable 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.840
 that is now this plant that would 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.970
 now you can play here so 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.120
 joke like faster or 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.120
 slower 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.250
 exactly I could play now 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.020
 i like the problem i want to go 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.880
 hear the next song from jan delay 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.520
 I can handle it now 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.450
 do the inntal quietly you see 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.000
 these speakers are still playing 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.070
 Sand tropez and over here I want in 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.270
 So my ear hears my head and that 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.440
 interrogate song and I can just do that 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.700
 Activate this up here 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:07.510
 and now play over my headphones 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.830
 so to speak the music off and the bad 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.810
 played that really can hear before 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:20.440
 then i can do the transition too 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:21.970
 So if I want the transition now 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.770
 I can do both 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.460
 So let's play both 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.460
 over the headphones 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.250
 So I have small mistakes, so to speak 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.599
 Although both times are parallel 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.910
 you can move bad in the video 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.950
 Show where I actually get out if 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.780
 you really many party hang up what 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.459
 wanted to get you such an external 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.080
 usb sound card I linked the times 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.959
 the ones below cost creative so 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.940
 a better cost is 25 euros with mac 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.280
 os x lion comes completely compatible 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.609
 does not need to install anything directly 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.680
 here then in the settings yes 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.740
 go into or into the global 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.030
 system finds a control setting 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.550
 her would have to equal exactly 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.130
 here you will also find subsounds 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.590
 this usb sound card you can 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.789
 including the master volume control is 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.370
 recognized immediately 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.860
 and then I'll make you this courage 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.560
 freeware mix to use or the freeware 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.229
 dj no the shard africa 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.030
 dj which costs about eight euros where you 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.820
 really great music can do and that is 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.130
 Really an advantage so pick this up 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.139
 really handy my experience is 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.690
 a wide and worldly difference 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.979
 between itunes and such a dj program 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.690
 because you just keep coming back to itunes 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.280
 The fear is that you are with me 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.310
 is out of print and here you can 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.310
 Preview listen and simply have fun
