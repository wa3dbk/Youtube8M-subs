 Hello, hello, we're all back 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:09.660
 of getafe open and today the postman has 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:14.049
 brought another package that I think are 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.700
 two holes milestone of the new ones I have 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.680
 I really wanted to open it because I was in 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.430
 the championship testing Alberto's 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.750
 maso and the truth is that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.030
 is the rod and nothing is going to be good with 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.390
 respect to getafe open the championship 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:34.710
 organized by sergio and isa has been a 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.629
 very good championship where 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.860
 the rules have been followed very well 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.070
 there were many 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.570
 many new cuberos who have been 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.580
 have been there that have enjoyed the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.000
 championship very good atmosphere very good 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:53.140
 times and nothing to see if they repeat more 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.420
 championships like that in madrid that are the 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.540
 Well, well, let's open the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.130
 packetito effectively here is the 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.670
 new very ball 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.600
 the new logo bucket of may here 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:11.100
 I have one for me 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.080
 and then here is another one for raúl vale he 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.090
 bought these cubes in light take 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.880
 although they were quite a while 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.490
 sending it has arrived very quickly you see that 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.250
 the post in the new east that they use is 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.960
 much faster than the Chinese post of 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.409
 lifetime 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.770
 and well let's try this cube 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.770
 new 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.940
 I'm going to open this here we have the cube 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.900
 that comes perfectly packaged 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.409
 we see here the colors of very very 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.409
 pretty 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.119
 too well packaged comes 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.130
 Over there 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.500
 and well let's make the first turns 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.500
 look very fast this juice is brutal 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.889
 well let's do the alternating pattern 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.689
 to see the difference of colors but 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.730
 they are the same colors so that 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:37.370
 always the orange here super 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.620
 radioactive the green phosphorite very 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.620
 pretty and the yellow phosphorite 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.890
 let's see let's try the cut of 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:52.170
 corners that according to moi cut about 60 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.170
 degrees to see here let's try 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.580
 good as we see it does not cost him to cut 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.700
 line with line a little bit better is a 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.000
 little else does not cut directly but 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.230
 online with short line very easily 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.630
 and good also this cube will have to 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.060
 adjust it and lubricate it to see how it goes 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.510
 really and let's try the cut 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.510
 reverse 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.380
 stronger reverse a little more 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.510
 that the line 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.510
 not nothing of the other world at the moment but 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.780
 after using it and lubricate it and 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.260
 adjust it and I'll do a review telling us 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.260
 How are you 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.020
 but good for now the cube 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.550
 and it seems better than the long ao so 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:47.650
 first impressions because it turns very 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:51.700
 quick to effortlessly rotate the ball 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.340
 a lot and makes the noise very crispy and 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.640
 it costs a bit more to rotate so this one is not 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.190
 it turns very easy 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.480
 I do not know does not have is like it does not drag 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.480
 it both rotates very fast 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.130
 a cuban 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:15.640
 to see what else I can show you the pops 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.150
 let's test if this pump is 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.150
 European 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.350
 nothing this does not hit or do weird things and 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.470
 the corners are difficult to turn 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.780
 they are turned when doing enough force 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.979
 but come on, I do not think this in 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.979
 a resolution turn 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.599
 I'm going to make a 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.699
 a resolution to see how he behaves 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.310
 this cube but let the first 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.289
 impressions could not be better has 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.710
 a very easy turn cuts very corners 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.740
 all right 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.729
 in the absence of lubricating the intentional and 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:56.849
 try it and it's very fast very fast 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.849
 I like this cube to see, let's start 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.390
 Y 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.340
 Well, I think I'm going to leave it here 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.210
 here we have 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.550
 the unboxing of the new very usual on here 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.090
 the other one that I have I'm going to leave here 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.150
 back then that is a great cube 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.340
 I'm looking forward to trying it more thoroughly 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.250
 give a little bit of cane a little 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.560
 chicha and see how and see how it 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.120
 it is good but I see it as 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.000
 my future cube to use in 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.820
 competitions is very beautiful is size 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.850
 standard 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.600
 very fast cuts corners very well do not 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.790
 turn the corners is milk come on 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.580
 Well that here I leave the new May 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:58.230
 jugadón hope you liked the 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.230
 video and see you in the next
