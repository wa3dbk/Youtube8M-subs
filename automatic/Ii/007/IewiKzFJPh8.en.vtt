00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
they having said you know well how long

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.810 
they having said you know well how long
this<00:01:39.990> essentially<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.950> suspensions<00:01:41.490> will<00:01:41.640> be

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
this essentially the suspensions will be

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.600 
this essentially the suspensions will be
no<00:01:42.150> they've<00:01:42.420> only<00:01:42.570> said<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.610> suspending

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.200 
no they've only said that suspending
people<00:01:45.740> rather<00:01:46.740> than<00:01:46.890> finding<00:01:47.340> them<00:01:47.490> is

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
people rather than finding them is

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.039 
people rather than finding them is
really<00:01:48.960> what<00:01:49.380> dis<00:01:50.250> incentivizes<00:01:51.000> them<00:01:51.060> turn

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
really what dis incentivizes them turn

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.670 
really what dis incentivizes them turn
to<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:53.180> to<00:01:54.180> make<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.780> they're<00:01:55.229> like

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
to to to make it's like they're like

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.410 
to to to make it's like they're like
they're<00:01:55.740> doing<00:01:55.979> that's<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:57.329> know

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
they're doing that's what you know

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120 
they're doing that's what you know
there's<00:01:57.600> also<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.960> lot<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.409> talk<00:01:58.619> about<00:01:58.649> safety

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
there's also a lot of talk about safety

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.190 
there's also a lot of talk about safety
in<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.369> NFL<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.880> i<00:02:00.299> think<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:00.960> it's

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
in the NFL and i think it's it's

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.310 
in the NFL and i think it's it's
important<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.090> raise<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.840> issue<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
important to raise the issue of the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.809 
important to raise the issue of the
helmet<00:02:04.680> standards<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:07.979> know<00:02:08.099> there's

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
helmet standards and you know there's

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.360 
helmet standards and you know there's
always<00:02:09.440> new<00:02:10.440> helmets<00:02:10.860> coming<00:02:11.129> into<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
always new helmets coming into the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.140 
always new helmets coming into the
league<00:02:11.489> every<00:02:12.030> three<00:02:12.239> or<00:02:12.300> four<00:02:12.390> years

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
league every three or four years

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.330 
league every three or four years
do<00:02:13.269> these<00:02:13.450> new<00:02:13.659> helmets<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:15.129> they're

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
do these new helmets and they're

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.800 
do these new helmets and they're
supposed<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.670> be<00:02:15.790> concussion<00:02:16.239> proof<00:02:16.450> helmets

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
supposed to be concussion proof helmets

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.679 
supposed to be concussion proof helmets
and<00:02:16.989> can<00:02:17.500> end<00:02:17.680> concussion<00:02:18.280> helping<00:02:18.939> mouth

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:19.689 
and can end concussion helping mouth

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.679 
and can end concussion helping mouth
pieces<00:02:19.989> as<00:02:20.290> well<00:02:20.319> yeah<00:02:20.799> that's<00:02:21.159> true<00:02:21.340> but<00:02:21.939> one

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
pieces as well yeah that's true but one

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.089 
pieces as well yeah that's true but one
of<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.900> issues<00:02:23.019> that<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.409> think<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.739> NFL<00:02:24.069> has

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
of the issues that I think the NFL has

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.250 
of the issues that I think the NFL has
kind<00:02:24.400> of<00:02:24.459> turned<00:02:24.579> a<00:02:24.700> blind<00:02:24.879> eye<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.180> is<00:02:25.540> how

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
kind of turned a blind eye to is how

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.780 
kind of turned a blind eye to is how
that<00:02:26.319> player<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:29.140> how<00:02:29.739> he<00:02:29.799> inflates<00:02:30.609> his

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
that player the the how he inflates his

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.429 
that player the the how he inflates his
helmet<00:02:31.209> before<00:02:31.480> he<00:02:31.780> goes<00:02:31.930> on<00:02:32.079> to<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.260> field

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:32.439 
helmet before he goes on to the field

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.229 
helmet before he goes on to the field
now<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:33.250> used<00:02:33.549> to<00:02:33.640> play<00:02:33.760> high<00:02:33.939> school<00:02:33.970> football

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
now I used to play high school football

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.380 
now I used to play high school football
and<00:02:34.720> when<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.530> would<00:02:35.769> wear<00:02:35.920> my<00:02:36.099> helmet<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.640> would

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
and when I would wear my helmet I would

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.869 
and when I would wear my helmet I would
always<00:02:37.659> make<00:02:38.140> sure<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:38.500> air<00:02:38.680> in<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:38.980> was<00:02:39.579> a

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
always make sure the air in it was a

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.940 
always make sure the air in it was a
little<00:02:40.150> loose<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.290> wouldn't<00:02:41.530> put<00:02:41.920> too

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
little loose so that it wouldn't put too

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.830 
little loose so that it wouldn't put too
much<00:02:42.159> pressure<00:02:42.400> on<00:02:42.640> my<00:02:42.879> head<00:02:43.090> when<00:02:43.659> I<00:02:43.689> was

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
much pressure on my head when I was

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.640 
much pressure on my head when I was
playing<00:02:43.989> very<00:02:44.859> dangerous<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.790> do<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:47.500> it

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
playing very dangerous to do but it

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.430 
playing very dangerous to do but it
doesn't<00:02:47.680> just<00:02:48.040> lessens<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.819> cushion<00:02:49.480> right

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
doesn't just lessens the cushion right

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.250 
doesn't just lessens the cushion right
between<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.180> edge<00:02:52.389> of<00:02:52.659> the<00:02:52.780> helmet<00:02:53.109> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
between the the edge of the helmet the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.780 
between the the edge of the helmet the
outside<00:02:53.620> part<00:02:53.799> of<00:02:53.859> the<00:02:53.920> helmet<00:02:54.159> Zach<00:02:54.430> your

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
outside part of the helmet Zach your

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.309 
outside part of the helmet Zach your
head<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.239> allows<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.900> move<00:02:56.049> around

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
head and allows you to move around

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.920 
head and allows you to move around
inside<00:02:56.909> which<00:02:57.909> increases<00:02:58.569> your<00:02:58.689> rate<00:02:58.900> of

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
inside which increases your rate of

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.170 
inside which increases your rate of
injury<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.680> you<00:02:59.799> actually<00:03:00.040> working<00:03:00.939> cussed

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
injury and you actually working cussed

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.319 
injury and you actually working cussed
what<00:03:01.450> multiple<00:03:02.230> times<00:03:02.500> in<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:03.159> last<00:03:03.489> season

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
what multiple times in that last season

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.179 
what multiple times in that last season
right<00:03:04.599> right<00:03:05.079> but<00:03:05.709> it's<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.489> commonly<00:03:08.099> it's<00:03:09.099> a

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
right right but it's a commonly it's a

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.110 
right right but it's a commonly it's a
common<00:03:09.489> practice<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:10.810> players<00:03:11.879> take<00:03:12.879> part

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
common practice that players take part

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.729 
common practice that players take part
in<00:03:13.209> when<00:03:13.930> they're<00:03:14.049> playing<00:03:14.139> and<00:03:14.379> that's<00:03:14.500> to

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
in when they're playing and that's to

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.229 
in when they're playing and that's to
simply<00:03:15.220> just<00:03:15.370> decrease<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.939> air<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.209> the

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
simply just decrease the air in the

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.809 
simply just decrease the air in the
helmet<00:03:16.569> so<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.900> they<00:03:17.049> are<00:03:17.290> more<00:03:18.250> comfortable

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
helmet so that they are more comfortable

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.000 
helmet so that they are more comfortable
and<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.209> think<00:03:19.480> that's<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.810> huge<00:03:20.290> reason<00:03:20.739> why

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
and I think that's a huge reason why

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.280 
and I think that's a huge reason why
we're<00:03:21.669> seeing<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.060> lot<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.569> lot<00:03:23.079> of<00:03:23.199> these

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
we're seeing a lot of a lot of these

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.680 
we're seeing a lot of a lot of these
concussion<00:03:23.889> kate's<00:03:24.069> oh<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.669> yeah<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.209> NFL's

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
concussion kate's oh and yeah the NFL's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.740 
concussion kate's oh and yeah the NFL's
your<00:03:25.900> grown<00:03:26.139> men<00:03:26.379> flying<00:03:26.680> around<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.340> at<00:03:27.609> 15<00:03:28.449> 10

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
your grown men flying around it at 15 10

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.210 
your grown men flying around it at 15 10
miles<00:03:28.930> per<00:03:29.079> hour<00:03:29.290> smacking<00:03:29.799> into<00:03:29.889> it<00:03:30.099> yet

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
miles per hour smacking into it yet

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.680 
miles per hour smacking into it yet
they're<00:03:30.430> never<00:03:30.579> going<00:03:30.849> to<00:03:30.940> be<00:03:31.060> totally<00:03:31.299> safe

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
they're never going to be totally safe

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.409
