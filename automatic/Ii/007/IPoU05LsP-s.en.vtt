just do a smaller sample to get to show
you<00:01:49.079> how<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.250> you'll<00:01:50.460> actually

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
you how to do it so you'll actually

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.929 
you how to do it so you'll actually
chain<00:01:52.200> all<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.470> way<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> 99<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.820> gonna

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
chain all the way to 99 I'm just gonna

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.630 
chain all the way to 99 I'm just gonna
do<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> few<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.170> create<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.680> effect<00:01:56.430> so

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
do a few just to create the effect so

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.340 
do a few just to create the effect so
you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.909> find<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:57.329> what<00:01:57.450> happens<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.320> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
you can find out what happens so you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.600 
you can find out what happens so you
just<00:01:58.680> don't<00:01:58.829> even<00:01:58.979> worry<00:01:59.250> about<00:01:59.460> these

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
them fall into line where they will and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.290 
them fall into line where they will and
just<00:02:06.840> let<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.649> know<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.369> natural<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.090> think

revolutions to get started it says that

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.060 
revolutions to get started it says that
we<00:03:02.880> need<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.120> chain<00:03:03.450> four<00:03:03.750> now<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.530> chaining

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
we need to chain four now this chaining

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.440 
we need to chain four now this chaining
of<00:03:05.190> four<00:03:05.430> as<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.880> explains<00:03:06.180> in<00:03:06.360> the

of four as it explains in the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.780 
of four as it explains in the
instructions<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:07.110> part<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.830> first<00:03:08.130> V

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
completely up to you so now what we have

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.770 
completely up to you so now what we have
to<00:04:53.340> do<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:53.730> that<00:04:53.910> we<00:04:54.030> have<00:04:54.270> to<00:04:54.450> then<00:04:54.600> start

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
to do is that we have to then start

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.590 
to do is that we have to then start
playing<00:04:55.230> in<00:04:55.440> between<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:56.400> V<00:04:56.580> stitches<00:04:57.060> so

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
playing in between the V stitches so

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.420 
playing in between the V stitches so
essentially<00:04:58.290> we<00:04:58.410> have<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.740> slip<00:04:58.980> stitch<00:04:59.220> in

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
essentially we have to slip stitch in

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.640 
essentially we have to slip stitch in
between<00:04:59.820> the<00:05:00.030> first<00:05:00.330> V<00:05:00.810> stitch<00:05:01.050> that<00:05:01.320> you<00:05:01.410> see

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
between the first V stitch that you see

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.610 
between the first V stitch that you see
and<00:05:01.860> that's<00:05:02.700> where<00:05:02.940> we're<00:05:03.090> going<00:05:03.240> to<00:05:03.330> start

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
and that's where we're going to start

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.660 
and that's where we're going to start
remember<00:05:04.620> I<00:05:04.680> showed<00:05:04.980> you<00:05:05.370> in<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.550> very

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
remember I showed you in the very

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.070 
remember I showed you in the very
beginning<00:05:05.850> everything<00:05:06.300> is<00:05:06.510> working<00:05:06.690> in<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:06.990> B

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
beginning everything is working in the B

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.750 
beginning everything is working in the B
stitch<00:05:07.320> well<00:05:07.860> in<00:05:07.980> order<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.280> start<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.610> row

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
stitch well in order to start the row

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.580 
stitch well in order to start the row
you<00:05:08.820> have<00:05:09.090> to<00:05:09.210> start<00:05:09.450> there<00:05:09.660> so<00:05:10.260> we<00:05:10.380> have<00:05:10.470> to

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
you have to start there so we have to

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.180 
you have to start there so we have to
chain<00:05:10.800> four<00:05:11.160> one<00:05:11.570> two<00:05:12.570> three<00:05:12.900> and<00:05:13.740> four

chain four one two three and four

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.560 
chain four one two three and four
remember<00:05:14.610> that<00:05:14.760> counts<00:05:15.090> as<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.210> double<00:05:15.420> crochet

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.900 
remember that counts as a double crochet
slash<00:05:16.170> chain<00:05:16.500> one<00:05:16.740> and<00:05:16.950> then<00:05:17.550> you're<00:05:17.790> gonna

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
slash chain one and then you're gonna

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.830 
slash chain one and then you're gonna
double<00:05:18.420> crochet<00:05:18.750> into<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.050> same<00:05:19.260> gap<00:05:20.330> okay<00:05:21.330> so
