00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.979 
it's the ways you can use it as I said
it's<00:02:08.040> almost<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.519> sort<00:02:08.790> of<00:02:08.820> use<00:02:09.060> slightly

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
it's almost like a sort of use slightly

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.039 
it's almost like a sort of use slightly
tacky<00:02:10.350> oXXO<00:02:10.860> cube<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.910> dry<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.930> will

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
tacky oXXO cube so it's dry but it will

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.190 
tacky oXXO cube so it's dry but it will
crumble<00:02:13.440> as<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.400> actually<00:02:14.840> get<00:02:15.840> into<00:02:16.079> your

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
crumble as you actually get into your

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.660 
crumble as you actually get into your
hands<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.769> actually<00:02:17.070> start<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.370> mold

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
hands and you actually start to mold

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.460 
hands and you actually start to mold
with<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.209> warmth<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.569> your<00:02:19.629> hands<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.140> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
with the warmth of your hands and the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.570 
with the warmth of your hands and the
friction<00:02:20.800> of<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.920> movement<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.310> actually

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
friction of the movement it actually

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.030 
friction of the movement it actually
comes<00:02:21.819> back<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.420> pace<00:02:22.720> okay<00:02:23.110> it's<00:02:23.709> quite

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
comes back to a pace okay it's quite

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.890 
comes back to a pace okay it's quite
flyable<00:02:24.459> then<00:02:24.849> it's<00:02:25.090> very<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.450> can<00:02:25.480> wrap<00:02:25.750> it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
flyable then it's very you can wrap it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.110 
flyable then it's very you can wrap it
round<00:02:26.019> up<00:02:26.290> baek's<00:02:26.560> yeah<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.700> can<00:02:27.940> wrap<00:02:28.090> it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
round up baek's yeah so you can wrap it

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.479 
round up baek's yeah so you can wrap it
around<00:02:28.269> hook<00:02:28.510> place<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.220> even<00:02:30.220> wrap<00:02:30.340> it

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
around hook place you can even wrap it

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.970 
around hook place you can even wrap it
around<00:02:30.550> your<00:02:30.760> lead<00:02:31.410> use<00:02:32.410> it<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.650> lots<00:02:32.830> of
