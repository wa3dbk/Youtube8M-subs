really<00:01:33.780> look<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.050> that<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.730> said<00:01:35.820> I

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
really look like that but like I said I

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.160 
really look like that but like I said I
always<00:01:36.090> try<00:01:36.300> to<00:01:36.330> get<00:01:36.479> people<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.750> benefit<00:01:37.050> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
always try to get people to benefit of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.719 
always try to get people to benefit of
the<00:01:37.229> doubt<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.190> don't<00:01:38.340> think<00:01:38.520> she<00:01:38.580> would

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the doubt and I don't think she would

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.490 
the doubt and I don't think she would
really<00:01:38.970> send<00:01:39.360> me<00:01:39.510> a<00:01:39.540> used<00:01:39.840> product<00:01:40.260> I<00:01:40.320> don't

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
really send me a used product I don't

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.469 
really send me a used product I don't
not<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.010> she<00:01:41.130> knew<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.400> was<00:01:41.550> juice<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.270> maybe

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
not if she knew it was juice so maybe

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.330 
not if she knew it was juice so maybe
she<00:01:42.660> didn't<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:42.870> it<00:01:43.080> was<00:01:43.200> used<00:01:43.440> that<00:01:44.100> might

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
she didn't know it was used that might

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.230 
she didn't know it was used that might
be<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> different<00:01:44.640> um<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:46.850> different<00:01:47.850> scenario

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
