00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.370
 very good girls very good guys in 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.649
 what are you waiting for? 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.720
 all very well today I told you a 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.820
 news about call of advanced advanced 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.509
 wolfart because we have skills the 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.720
 exoskeleton that are not going to be 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:22.999
 rechargeable and also the cooperative mode 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.419
 of up to 4 players is a visible 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:28.020
 innovation through this exoskeleton 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.270
 let's go with the first 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.040
 one of one of the co-founders of 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.950
 Sledgehammer Games is called michael 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.690
 condrey and has confirmed that none of 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.050
 the skills of the exoskeleton of 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.930
 colonia pando golfard can be recharged 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.050
 they all work with a battery 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.239
 that is generated during its use 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.670
 and is to replace and replaced by each 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.040
 life is to say when they kill you come back 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.600
 but while this being without 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.380
 discomfort to the battery is going to consume 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.110
 and it does not recharge at any time 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.360
 it's a very necessary clarification because 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.550
 some fans because I had no idea 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.190
 and well he has no video they did not have a 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.860
 very clear idea of whether the battery was going 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.800
 recharging if progressively during a 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.290
 short time interval and also because 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.140
 confirm if it's the hammer game had 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.290
 planned to make some adjustment in 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.860
 this exoskeleton as we already know does not go 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.970
 to make any adjustment and it cleared 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.710
 now it is already clear that the high 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.380
 exoskeleton skills do not 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.620
 they can use frivolously that is 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.920
 well not two but you have to spend 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.900
 with heads because it does not only affect the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.869
 difficulty level of the campaign but 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.750
 which also hinders or influences the 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.149
 performance of online players is 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.320
 a detail to consider very 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.630
 important for players 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.640
 competitive they have to be 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.759
 sure to use certain skills 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.070
 of the exoskeleton at times when 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.830
 really can be useful especially 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.660
 in tournaments are some skills that 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.090
 As recommended, there is no need to spend 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.380
 frivolously you have to think about what 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.050
 at the moment they can serve us 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:16.140
 for a game at home maybe not 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:20.099
 it's important but now that they 're mother 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.069
 me hair for the people who are with 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.200
 one of the online tournaments and such that 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.420
 it is very important to know at what time 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.120
 Exactly you have to spend these 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.069
 skills of course the boys 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.650
 who train and who will train within 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.690
 little with this game right away they will get 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.239
 to look at when they will need it 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.010
 so nothing this is news after 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:46.530
 we have the cooperative and maikel country 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.530
 as it has not confirmed that the cooperative 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.360
 russia color goes to advanced war farc va 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.390
 to support a maximum of 4 players 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.849
 and that the small brands of the new 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.010
 xbox one driver that is coming 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.709
 included in the microsoft pack no 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.019
 have nothing to do with the cooperative to 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.090
 Despite the recent rumors we have 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.680
 here that put the right side of the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.530
 hit command 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.930
 and three hits and three valleys as a hit 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.219
 third not how can you say that at 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.140
 could better lead to a cooperative of 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.269
 three will be better but not for nothing 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.400
 you have that has nothing to do with what 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.980
 what is the exoskeleton that is to say and 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.530
 hammer game has commented that this new 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.719
 playable feature was introduced in 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.180
 this game because of the response of the 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:37.310
 fans who demanded an innovation in the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.230
 franchise fans like me for example that 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.450
 He said it always gives the same and 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.519
 really in the last game already up 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.120
 the 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.859
 and without having them because it does not fulfill it being 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.189
 I from the people that I go on the first day 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.870
 I reserve them months and months and months and six 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.719
 of the first ones I buy it because I 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.579
 like the call of duty I like it is a 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:03.639
 really de-stressing game is 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.609
 total stress you put the face of people 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:10.090
 that you do not want in enemies you get the 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:12.639
 games that cause you but three ago 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.650
 years the exoskeleton was not in the 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.959
 mind of the public as it is on the day of 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.300
 today in movies like for example the and 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.759
 recommended maximum 100% and oblivion 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.440
 also recommended 100% as well 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.720
 news where the military has 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.639
 condition based as 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.800
 example to have about 500 people that 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.349
 are disabled or people who have 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.539
 reduced mobility to the legs that 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:39.960
 today it is possible to be in tests 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.539
 and it is impressive 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.789
 three years ago it was a big step 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.699
 forward and it is now when everyone 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.530
 then speaks of this on the other hand michael 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.270
 condrey has also mentioned a couple of 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.789
 very interesting details during the 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.349
 interview the psoe pnv and hammer games are 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.349
 has focused on the development of three 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:01.770
 maps where there is a certain degree of 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:04.020
 the verticality and frantic action 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.990
 gusts of cooperative points will bring 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.330
 I get new ways to use them and 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.000
 let players experience that 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.820
 This mode of the game is a reference in 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.860
 the competitive scene and finally is the 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.259
 hit hammer game is listening in the 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.199
 feedback from all communities to 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.669
 to be able to know what we want and 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.039
 they will continue to do the same after the 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.830
 launch of the game so in order to 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:32.220
 be able to include new changes and contribute 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.389
 many more things the truth is that in 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.550
 this aspect is being worked on 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:39.670
 let's hope that everything they say 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.410
 what the big sack broken and really be 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.090
 so, well, guys, I hope that I have 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.100
 interested this news a little kiss to 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.750
 everyone and see you in another video more than 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.930
 this channel until next time 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.930
 bye
