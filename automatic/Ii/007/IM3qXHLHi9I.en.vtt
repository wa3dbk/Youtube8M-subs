it<00:00:56.109> even<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.039> first<00:00:57.219> time<00:00:57.399> I<00:00:57.430> drove<00:00:57.699> it<00:00:57.879> I<00:00:58.059> was

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
it even the first time I drove it I was

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.180 
it even the first time I drove it I was
like<00:00:58.449> it's<00:00:58.629> a<00:00:58.750> whole<00:00:59.140> new<00:00:59.320> truck<00:00:59.590> it's<00:01:00.160> a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
like it's a whole new truck it's a

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.459 
like it's a whole new truck it's a
completely<00:01:00.609> different<00:01:00.879> truck<00:01:01.270> it's<00:01:02.260> just

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
completely different truck it's just

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.439 
completely different truck it's just
really<00:01:02.680> really<00:01:02.890> really<00:01:03.100> smooth<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:04.000> I<00:01:04.089> got<00:01:04.269> my

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
really really really smooth and I got my

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.690 
really really really smooth and I got my
Suncoast<00:01:05.350> built<00:01:05.619> I<00:01:05.950> was<00:01:06.190> like<00:01:06.310> wow<00:01:06.430> this<00:01:06.640> is

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
Suncoast built I was like wow this is

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.880 
Suncoast built I was like wow this is
nice<00:01:07.000> it's<00:01:07.450> just<00:01:07.570> really<00:01:07.840> really<00:01:08.380> strong<00:01:08.679> but

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
nice it's just really really strong but

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.760 
nice it's just really really strong but
it<00:01:08.979> was<00:01:09.009> still<00:01:09.280> kind<00:01:09.580> of<00:01:09.670> all<00:01:09.910> over<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.210> place

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it was still kind of all over the place

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.200 
it was still kind of all over the place
when<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:11.830> got<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.100> TCM<00:01:12.460> Tunes<00:01:12.670> it's<00:01:12.940> right<00:01:13.090> on

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
when I got the TCM Tunes it's right on

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.210 
when I got the TCM Tunes it's right on
point<00:01:13.479> doesn't<00:01:13.899> miss<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.020> beat<00:01:14.140> but<00:01:14.530> also<00:01:14.710> I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
point doesn't miss a beat but also I

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.940 
point doesn't miss a beat but also I
believe<00:01:15.970> that<00:01:16.479> that's<00:01:16.689> going<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.380> save<00:01:17.680> your

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
believe that that's going to save your

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.950 
believe that that's going to save your
Beltran's<00:01:18.400> too<00:01:18.610> because<00:01:18.939> it's<00:01:19.119> not<00:01:19.180> falling

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
Beltran's too because it's not falling

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.830 
Beltran's too because it's not falling
in<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.590> out<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:20.979> it's<00:01:21.220> not<00:01:21.790> revving<00:01:22.720> up

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
in and out and it's not revving up

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.330 
in and out and it's not revving up
before<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.229> grabs<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.500> next<00:01:23.740> gear<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:24.100> just

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
before it grabs the next gear it's just

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.750 
before it grabs the next gear it's just
right<00:01:25.090> on<00:01:25.270> point

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
right on point

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.970 
right on point
and<00:01:27.760> now<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:29.200> cooking<00:01:29.440> up<00:01:29.620> to<00:01:29.710> speed<00:01:29.950> a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
and now just cooking up to speed a

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.370 
and now just cooking up to speed a
little<00:01:30.160> bit<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.840> can<00:01:31.990> hear<00:01:32.440> already<00:01:33.160> shifted

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
little bit you can hear already shifted

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.260 
little bit you can hear already shifted
not<00:01:35.380> throwing<00:01:35.680> you<00:01:35.740> back<00:01:35.770> in<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.070> seat

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
not throwing you back in the seat

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.230 
not throwing you back in the seat
are<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:38.020> keep<00:01:38.500> shifting<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.820> just<00:01:39.969> really

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
are you keep shifting it's just really

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.719 
are you keep shifting it's just really
smooth<00:01:40.509> transitions

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
smooth transitions

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.969 
smooth transitions
it's<00:01:43.240> not<00:01:43.450> really<00:01:43.750> hard<00:01:43.990> shifts<00:01:44.409> it's<00:01:44.740> not

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
it's not really hard shifts it's not

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:45.779 
it's not really hard shifts it's not
taking<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.340> while

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
taking a while

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.010 
taking a while
it's<00:01:46.119> just<00:01:46.299> crisp<00:01:46.770> into<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.860> next<00:01:48.100> gear

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it's just crisp into the next gear

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.569 
it's just crisp into the next gear
another<00:01:50.020> benefit<00:01:50.500> of<00:01:50.530> TCM<00:01:50.920> tuning<00:01:51.369> that<00:01:51.429> you

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
another benefit of TCM tuning that you

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.039 
another benefit of TCM tuning that you
guys<00:01:51.729> with<00:01:51.909> higher<00:01:52.090> horsepower<00:01:52.390> trucks<00:01:52.869> will

guys with higher horsepower trucks will
appreciate<00:01:53.560> is<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.460> transmission

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
appreciate is that the transmission

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.120 
appreciate is that the transmission
torque<00:01:55.329> converter<00:01:55.689> now<00:01:55.929> locks<00:01:56.590> up<00:01:56.829> when<00:01:57.009> we

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
torque converter now locks up when we

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.130 
torque converter now locks up when we
