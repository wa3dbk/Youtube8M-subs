00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 we are here at the murtensee on one 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.470
 Meadow that is very old has a lot of it 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.960
 plants 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.870
 she was not seen that is one 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.730
 I want to show you how to do it 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.609
 a flower meadow lays on a very 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.570
 rational art we do that 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.650
 machinery 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:35.250
 it's fast and it costs little and 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:36.600
 result is always great here 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.570
 the donor meadow 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.540
 she is mature the donor as she has to 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.430
 many flowers have to be 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.480
 have quality criteria and what also 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.870
 important is that the meadow where that 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.879
 arrives that there is reasonably of the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.879
 similar to the ground 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.590
 Here you can see that already quite a lot 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.590
 Seeds are ripe when the sage is so 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.380
 that it starts ripening down and when 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.780
 If the capsules to make you see the 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.680
 seeds and the fall 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.610
 she does not remember that the seeds 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.030
 to break away 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.869
 they are also brown dry 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:28.509
 this is really the right moment at 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:31.610
 pisa media is ready too 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:36.910
 you just have to touch and the seeds 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:40.869
 jump down and shoot 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.869
 if you do that 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.740
 it is the right time for today 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.320
 sea ​​the seeds mature no fake we are 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.380
 Here on the donation meadow and phenomenon 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.680
 it's already there and the seeds are on 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.979
 which is very important to glue 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.650
 that it is technically well organized 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.570
 we do this mostly in the team 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.670
 means in the networking projects are 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.520
 More and more people are interested in it and it 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.920
 Then several people help someone 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.780
 somebody does that together 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.930
 it is charging pressed 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.209
 transported and distributed what also 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.910
 It is important that you are in the 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:30.170
 press as many knives as you can 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:34.280
 then the eleven you spread out 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.530
 the meadow is more homogeneous that is one 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.200
 Advantage also looks very important that the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.519
 do not heat both 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.130
 it is good for more people 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.010
 do not cooperate that one single 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.390
 person all in a row then does 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.390
 it will take so much time 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.220
 Here we are on the receiver giant 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.920
 The farmer has already tried once 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.330
 with a mix of flowers here too 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.790
 bring that did not have that has nothing 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.900
 folded 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:14.850
 the ground is sandy here like the one at 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.660
 donor meadow the big advantage of 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.210
 home journey 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.420
 is that we make a protective layer 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.690
 on the ground and the seeds under fire 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.610
 they are protected and they will not be 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.480
 even if the summer is really hot and 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.470
 dry 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.930
 however, if you see them you will 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.350
 suffer from heat and sometimes succeed 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.270
 not at all 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.510
 now we are done it will not be anymore 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.930
 we are only actually touching now 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.440
 still forest you a good contact too 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.020
 make intermittent seed this year ever 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.230
 after august september depending on 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:01.750
 fumes of growth one cleaning 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:03.580
 cut you doing on the meadow was 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.730
 with the system 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:12.880
 this has been and still is 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.930
 after a year that's actually the 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:20.830
 Guinness proved very good plaster 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:25.990
 floral save because it was desired, the 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:32.950
 turn show rapidly and has so Secker the 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:37.240
 café yes quote a system because two 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.669
 months after you leave the grass you may ass 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.060
 grown number 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.400
 but after new in front of the horse you 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.370
 slowly grow the desired plant 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:53.169
 and now it is very good as what is 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.190
 if you look at the cost it will 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:05:01.110
 not a flower meadow to install 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:04.600
 on the contrary, who less than very 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.669
 normal normal seed to buy what 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.580
 maybe still important to say is 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.330
 that's what every tree can do 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.110
 do 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.460
 One should only be the mature date 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.520
 can determine 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.200
 that's right, ideally one is 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.040
 a group eg in one 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.620
 networking project 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.350
 that is faster and it is always 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.240
 positive for the project every case 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.240
 Everyone is happy with the matter
