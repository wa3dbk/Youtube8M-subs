hello me through today I'm having
tutorial<00:00:18.290> on<00:00:18.500> how<00:00:18.890> to<00:00:19.100> use<00:00:19.369> our<00:00:19.790> last<00:00:20.060> program

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
tutorial on how to use our last program

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.330 
tutorial on how to use our last program
called<00:00:21.410> optimal<00:00:22.010> bites<00:00:22.279> in<00:00:22.520> tech<00:00:22.730> and<00:00:23.200> i<00:00:24.340> will

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
called optimal bites in tech and i will

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.859 
called optimal bites in tech and i will
show<00:00:25.640> you<00:00:25.700> about<00:00:26.029> it<00:00:26.330> i<00:00:26.689> don't<00:00:26.840> want

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
show you about it i don't want

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.090 
show you about it i don't want
salmonella<00:00:27.320> bumped<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:28.000> so<00:00:31.300> let's<00:00:32.300> begin

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
salmonella bumped it so let's begin

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.380 
salmonella bumped it so let's begin
first<00:00:34.100> of<00:00:34.190> all<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.370> room<00:00:34.519> is<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.970> open<00:00:35.120> the

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
first of all the room is to open the

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.950 
first of all the room is to open the
program<00:00:38.260> as<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:39.769> can<00:00:39.920> see<00:00:40.040> here<00:00:40.280> it<00:00:40.519> is

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
program as you can see here it is

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.600 
program as you can see here it is
showing<00:00:41.960> us<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.440> booster<00:00:42.769> mode<00:00:42.949> and<00:00:43.460> he

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
showing us the booster mode and he

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.910 
showing us the booster mode and he
resets<00:00:44.000> first<00:00:44.540> of<00:00:44.629> all<00:00:44.660> make<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.530> repair<00:00:45.890> fast

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
resets first of all make the repair fast

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.700 
resets first of all make the repair fast
and<00:00:46.519> run<00:00:46.670> silently<00:00:47.120> in<00:00:47.269> the<00:00:47.299> background<00:00:47.710> so

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
and run silently in the background so

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.310 
and run silently in the background so
you<00:00:48.739> can<00:00:48.920> start<00:00:49.040> the<00:00:49.129> booster<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:49.989> then<00:00:50.989> that

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
you can start the booster and then that

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.240 
you can start the booster and then that
that<00:00:51.739> is<00:00:51.860> clear<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:53.170> then<00:00:54.170> you<00:00:55.040> have<00:00:55.129> a

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
that is clear and then you have a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.270 
that is clear and then you have a
computer<00:00:55.610> tweaks<00:00:55.970> and<00:00:56.320> that's<00:00:57.320> there<00:00:57.979> are

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
computer tweaks and that's there are

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.070 
computer tweaks and that's there are
computer<00:00:59.000> tricks<00:00:59.299> that<00:00:59.600> I<00:00:59.629> can<00:00:59.839> be<00:00:59.960> used

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
computer tricks that I can be used

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.649

your computer clean your computer and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.550 
your computer clean your computer and
different<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:53.000> computer<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.870> if<00:01:54.170> all<00:01:54.350> here

also<00:01:54.830> kind<00:01:55.190> of<00:01:55.220> shut<00:01:55.430> down<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.880> computer

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
also kind of shut down the computer

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.080 
also kind of shut down the computer
