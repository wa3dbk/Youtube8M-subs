00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
simple the simplicity of it just running

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.100 
simple the simplicity of it just running

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.420 

then<00:03:13.880> we'll<00:03:14.880> have<00:03:15.090> everybody<00:03:15.630> line<00:03:16.110> up<00:03:16.140> in<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
then we'll have everybody line up in the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.200 
then we'll have everybody line up in the
back<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:19.010> then<00:03:20.010> do<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.220> figure<00:03:20.550> eight<00:03:23.210> where

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
back and then do a figure eight where

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.390 
back and then do a figure eight where
they<00:03:24.360> actually<00:03:24.510> run<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.080> ball<00:03:25.400> like

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
they actually run to the ball like

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.280 
they actually run to the ball like
they're<00:03:26.610> playing<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.970> match<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.840> face<00:03:34.050> can

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
they're playing a match and the face can

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:43.250 
they're playing a match and the face can
be<00:03:34.320> short<00:03:35.840> they<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:37.050> be<00:03:37.230> wide<00:03:41.840> maybe<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.990> little

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
be short they can be wide maybe a little

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:51.350 
be short they can be wide maybe a little
deeper<00:03:43.650> with<00:03:43.830> those<00:03:44.010> feet<00:03:50.060> do<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.120> hit<00:03:51.270> them

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
deeper with those feet do you hit them

00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:01.400 
deeper with those feet do you hit them
deeper<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.720> little<00:03:51.780> wider<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:52.350> deeper<00:03:52.410> Aki

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.690 

it<00:04:02.410> makes<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:02.800> easier<00:04:03.130> then<00:04:03.250> when<00:04:03.430> they<00:04:03.550> go

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
it makes it easier then when they go

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.120 
it makes it easier then when they go
into<00:04:03.820> a<00:04:03.940> game<00:04:04.150> type<00:04:04.390> situation<00:04:05.080> they<00:04:05.710> run<00:04:05.980> to

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
into a game type situation they run to

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.160 
into a game type situation they run to
the<00:04:06.160> ball<00:04:06.400> with<00:04:06.640> their<00:04:06.820> hands<00:04:07.300> they<00:04:07.480> find<00:04:07.990> the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
the ball with their hands they find the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.250 
the ball with their hands they find the
ball<00:04:08.490> they<00:04:09.490> and<00:04:10.150> they<00:04:10.420> finished<00:04:10.810> with<00:04:11.020> it<00:04:11.140> with

ball they and they finished with it with
a<00:04:11.290> good<00:04:11.470> fall<00:04:11.710> through<00:04:12.040> but<00:04:13.650> they<00:04:14.650> get

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
a good fall through but they get

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.540 
a good fall through but they get
acclimated<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.430> going<00:04:15.880> to<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.239> ball<00:04:17.520> so<00:04:18.520> a

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:18.550
