00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 since we see ourselves or we will see 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.839
 the brightest episodes of this meeting 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.179
 both teams certainly sought to 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.230
 Victory put very very much 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.760
 effort 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.070
 resistance was the strongest 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.380
 fought each other fought this 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.660
 heat and stuffiness not so much 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.660
 the quality of football in my opinion is all 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.060
 was high enough 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.029
 albeit without goals but none the less though 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.220
 it is customary to say yes izba is red with angles 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.769
 goal play today there were no goals yet 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.379
 I repeat in my humble opinion we 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:39.400
 you did not waste your time looking 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.400
 this meeting 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.020
 but I repeat this to Ansaldi 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.020
 deserved 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.470
 but he does not finish the career I 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:17.330
 sure the transition to the zenith is like a new 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.870
 challenge is a very important stage 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.510
 and i'm sure that just like ruby ​​and 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.930
 zenith he will be very very good 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.930
 an assistant 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.530
 while we continue to watch the most 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.680
 watch moments and first halftime 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.280
 By the way, the first half ended here. 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.830
 this attack ruby free kicks but 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.890
 now fragments of the second half he 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.120
 perhaps it was more fun to sprinkle it not 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.040
 and 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.300
 could be different as quite right 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.820
 noticed a novel eremenko 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.310
 both could win but this one 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.740
 brushing draw 00 but he's still somewhere 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.110
 in something logical and fair as long as you 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.870
 see how the gable rushed forward tormenting 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.580
 Thai defense is for maintaining and 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.490
 contact with the cabin watching as it is now 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.240
 soared on the football field up 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.100
 Ansaldi 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.100
 surrounded by your partner 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.890
 but here borders naval let out dumbiya 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.690
 dumbia could say 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.450
 sharply decisive word in this meeting 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.850
 remember he was running away essentially one to one and 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.340
 in the end I tried to throw the ball 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.750
 over the goalkeeper but did not work well 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.780
 how much is there on the field and the child and 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.760
 Ryazantsev improved collection game 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.680
 there is a moment at the gates of Akinfeev steel 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.000
 several beautiful combinations we are with you 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.240
 saw brandon had two good points 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.730
 but they did not use and long pass 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.280
 forward to dzagoeva ahead of him 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.440
 selflessly played Sergei Ryzhikov 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.600
 in this game episode no goalkeepers 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.310
 claims to the defenders almost no 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.480
 claims some rough edges would or 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.090
 Here, for example in this episode not 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.590
 the calculated drove the morgan and the ruby ​​could for 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.320
 it pay but here at the moment about 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.230
 to which I have already spoken technically gracefully 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.950
 beautiful outwardly easy but here if 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.950
 would hit dumbia if this parachute 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.040
 landed by Ryzhakov's collar, we would 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.780
 they said it was a wonderful head and 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.570
 chanted that right but the moment when 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.830
 Igor Akinfeev once again in desperate 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.400
 throwing his team saves his team 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.190
 helps again i repeat a good game 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.670
 emotional game let's say so on the nerves 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.310
 and let no heads but do not worry 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.900
 in any case in the first four rounds 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.959
 with performance in the Russian 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.810
 the premier league is full order and here we are 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.670
 don't rule is called lament that in 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.040
 some kind of game here for example in today's 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.170
 let her and the central status of these 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.170
 most of the heads we did not see 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.700
 well rendered a ruby ​​said goodbye to san 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.400
 Sledi the time comes and we deviate 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.260
 for today's match worked for you 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.640
 commentators Vladislav Baturin 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.640
