I'm gonna click and drag that so it is

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.629 
I'm gonna click and drag that so it is
no<00:03:10.940> longer<00:03:11.500> bypassed<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.859> so<00:03:13.069> there<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.400> see

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
no longer bypassed and so there you see

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:20.229 
no longer bypassed and so there you see
it<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.419> bypassed<00:03:14.900> back<00:03:15.109> here<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.700> then

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
it is bypassed back here and then

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.879 
it is bypassed back here and then
whenever<00:03:20.419> we<00:03:20.660> get<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.930> this<00:03:21.049> a<00:03:21.109> lick<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.560> is

whenever we get to this a lick it is

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:27.190 
whenever we get to this a lick it is
active<00:03:23.919> very<00:03:24.919> cool<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:26.269> let's<00:03:26.930> hear<00:03:27.019> what<00:03:27.169> it

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.699 

very<00:03:41.150> cool<00:03:41.390> now<00:03:41.690> let's<00:03:41.810> make<00:03:41.959> it<00:03:42.020> inactive<00:03:42.350> and

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
very cool now let's make it inactive and

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.470 
very cool now let's make it inactive and
hear<00:03:42.830> that<00:03:42.950> same<00:03:43.160> thing<00:03:46.270> there's<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.330> little

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
there but it's it's almost it doesn't

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.740 
there but it's it's almost it doesn't
stick<00:03:51.590> out<00:03:51.680> enough<00:03:51.980> so<00:03:52.190> cleaning<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.390> up<00:03:53.480> using

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
stick out enough so cleaning it up using

stick out enough so cleaning it up using
that<00:03:53.870> effect<00:03:54.350> quick<00:03:54.709> automation<00:03:55.370> of<00:03:55.489> that<00:03:55.760> we

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
that effect quick automation of that we

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.280 
that effect quick automation of that we
could<00:03:56.120> probably<00:03:56.270> go<00:03:56.600> throughout<00:03:56.900> this<00:03:57.020> song

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
could probably go throughout this song

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.840 
could probably go throughout this song
see<00:03:57.650> if<00:03:57.709> there's<00:03:57.860> any<00:03:58.040> other<00:03:58.190> parts<00:03:58.610> that<00:03:58.670> we

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
see if there's any other parts that we

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.229 
see if there's any other parts that we
like<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.239> same<00:03:59.540> effect<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.040> highlight<00:04:01.040> them

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
like that same effect to highlight them

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.360 

that's<00:05:32.840> a<00:05:32.930> bit<00:05:33.110> crazy<00:05:33.290> maybe<00:05:33.920> that<00:05:34.160> doesn't

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
that's a bit crazy maybe that doesn't

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.130 
that's a bit crazy maybe that doesn't
work<00:05:34.610> let's<00:05:34.910> try<00:05:34.970> sixteenth<00:05:35.570> see<00:05:35.930> if<00:05:35.990> that

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
work let's try sixteenth see if that

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:46.960 
work let's try sixteenth see if that
works<00:05:44.620> okay<00:05:45.620> you<00:05:45.890> win<00:05:46.040> some<00:05:46.280> you<00:05:46.310> lose<00:05:46.580> some

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
works okay you win some you lose some

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.480 
works okay you win some you lose some
maybe<00:05:47.270> the<00:05:47.390> tremolo<00:05:47.630> pans<00:05:47.990> not<00:05:48.320> quite<00:05:48.620> working

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
maybe the tremolo pans not quite working

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.490 
maybe the tremolo pans not quite working
out<00:05:49.670> you<00:05:50.180> can<00:05:50.270> get<00:05:50.600> rid<00:05:50.750> of<00:05:50.780> that<00:05:50.870> try

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
out you can get rid of that try

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.740 
out you can get rid of that try
something<00:05:51.890> else<00:05:52.040> and<00:05:52.370> and<00:05:53.090> move<00:05:53.270> on<00:05:53.450> from<00:05:53.480> it

so anyways a couple tips there on how to

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.390 
so anyways a couple tips there on how to
quickly<00:06:32.090> automate<00:06:32.780> the<00:06:33.230> EQ<00:06:33.830> effect<00:06:34.160> with<00:06:34.370> a

quickly automate the EQ effect with a

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.610 
quickly automate the EQ effect with a
pro<00:06:34.790> q2<00:06:35.270> you<00:06:35.600> got<00:06:35.750> the<00:06:35.840> tremolo<00:06:36.080> pan<00:06:36.440> that

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
pro q2 you got the tremolo pan that

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.650 
pro q2 you got the tremolo pan that
maybe<00:06:36.830> didn't<00:06:37.100> work<00:06:37.220> out<00:06:37.430> but<00:06:38.000> hopefully<00:06:38.540> you

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
maybe didn't work out but hopefully you

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.080 
maybe didn't work out but hopefully you
learn<00:06:38.870> and<00:06:39.200> get<00:06:39.500> get<00:06:40.280> that<00:06:40.430> working<00:06:40.760> into<00:06:41.000> your
