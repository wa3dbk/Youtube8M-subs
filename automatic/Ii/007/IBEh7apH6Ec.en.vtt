mission here for being in Southern

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.319 
mission here for being in Southern
California<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.000> should<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.240> pretty

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
California so it should be pretty

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.069 
California so it should be pretty
interesting<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:43.229> see<00:01:43.860> what<00:01:43.979> happens<00:01:44.040> so

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
having an experiment to see what

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.760 
having an experiment to see what
actually<00:01:49.200> happens<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:51.770> hopefully

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
actually happens here but hopefully

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.730 
actually happens here but hopefully
worst-case<00:01:53.220> scenario<00:01:54.409> somebody<00:01:55.409> come<00:01:55.560> knock

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740

something<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.930> highly<00:01:58.770> highly<00:01:58.799> doubt<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.280> but<00:02:00.680> I

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
something I highly highly doubt it but I

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.530 
something I highly highly doubt it but I
don't<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.460> seems<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.090> pretty<00:02:03.299> good

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.759 

basically<00:02:44.880> what<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.030> did<00:02:45.230> before<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.500> came<00:02:46.739> in

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
basically what I did before I came in

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.759

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
that way I wasn't parking here and then

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.559 
that way I wasn't parking here and then
slide<00:02:54.630> my<00:02:54.660> curtains<00:02:55.170> closed<00:02:56.450> basically<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
slide my curtains closed basically the

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.770 
slide my curtains closed basically the
goal<00:02:57.750> was<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.260> have<00:02:58.610> everything<00:02:59.610> set<00:03:00.390> up<00:03:00.420> be

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
goal was to have everything set up be

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.300 
goal was to have everything set up be
able<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.049> roll<00:03:01.230> into<00:03:01.620> place<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:07.100> not<00:03:08.100> have

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
able to roll into place and and not have

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.009 
able to roll into place and and not have
to<00:03:08.519> fiddle<00:03:08.850> with<00:03:08.970> clothes<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.420> curtains<00:03:09.870> and

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
to fiddle with clothes and curtains and

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.650 
to fiddle with clothes and curtains and
attract<00:03:10.350> more<00:03:10.530> attention<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:11.190> way<00:03:11.670> ideally

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
attract more attention that way ideally

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.150 
attract more attention that way ideally
I'd<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:13.049> have<00:03:13.230> blacked<00:03:13.620> out<00:03:13.799> tinted

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
I'd like to have blacked out tinted

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.000 
I'd like to have blacked out tinted
windows<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.260> people<00:03:16.530> could<00:03:16.650> even<00:03:16.830> see

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
windows so that people could even see

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.660 
windows so that people could even see
the<00:03:17.160> curtains<00:03:17.519> anyways<00:03:17.850> but<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:19.620> have<00:03:20.280> gotten

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
the curtains anyways but I have gotten

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.130 
the curtains anyways but I have gotten
that<00:03:20.790> point<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.239> be<00:03:21.359> able<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.570> do<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:21.870> so

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
that point to be able to do that so

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.210 
that point to be able to do that so
maybe<00:03:25.140> down<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.380> road<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.799> might<00:03:25.920> be<00:03:26.010> able<00:03:26.070> to

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
maybe down the road it might be able to

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.910 
maybe down the road it might be able to
do<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.400> maybe<00:03:26.579> next<00:03:26.820> month<00:03:27.090> or<00:03:27.209> something

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
do that maybe next month or something

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.509 
do that maybe next month or something
that<00:03:28.920> would<00:03:29.010> be<00:03:29.160> ideal<00:03:29.250> but<00:03:30.150> anyways<00:03:31.489> Here<00:03:32.489> I

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
that would be ideal but anyways Here I

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.800 
that would be ideal but anyways Here I
am<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.910> time<00:03:33.090> being<00:03:33.329> we're<00:03:33.480> going<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.660> do

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
am the time being we're going to do

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.259 
am the time being we're going to do
little<00:03:34.049> stealth<00:03:34.320> camping<00:03:34.709> tonight<00:03:35.150> see<00:03:36.150> what

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
little stealth camping tonight see what

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.900 
little stealth camping tonight see what
happens<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:37.250> sorry<00:03:38.250> there<00:03:38.459> wasn't<00:03:38.609> too<00:03:38.790> much

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
happens so sorry there wasn't too much

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.449 
happens so sorry there wasn't too much
visually<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.510> look<00:03:39.690> at<00:03:39.870> but<00:03:40.140> this<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.130> part<00:03:41.310> of

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
visually to look at but this is part of

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.039 
visually to look at but this is part of
stealth<00:03:42.269> camping<00:03:42.720> at<00:03:43.350> its<00:03:43.560> best<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:45.049> guess

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
stealth camping at its best so I guess

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.190 
stealth camping at its best so I guess
that's<00:03:46.470> how<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.650> goes<00:03:46.799> my<00:03:47.640> goal<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:49.019> keep

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
that's how it goes my goal is to keep

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.099 
that's how it goes my goal is to keep
most<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.769> lights<00:03:49.980> off<00:03:50.540> inside<00:03:51.540> here<00:03:51.780> is<00:03:51.810> to

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
most of the lights off inside here is to

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.620 
most of the lights off inside here is to
not<00:03:52.260> attract<00:03:52.829> any<00:03:53.010> attention<00:03:53.120> with<00:03:54.120> lights<00:03:54.420> on

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
not attract any attention with lights on

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.930 
not attract any attention with lights on
inside<00:03:55.220> fact<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.370> probably<00:03:56.430> shouldn't<00:03:56.819> even

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
inside fact it probably shouldn't even

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.610 
inside fact it probably shouldn't even
be<00:03:57.060> talking<00:03:57.510> right<00:03:57.750> now<00:03:57.989> don't<00:03:58.200> know<00:03:58.230> how<00:03:58.470> many

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
be talking right now don't know how many

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.550 
be talking right now don't know how many
people<00:03:58.920> can<00:03:59.040> hear<00:03:59.220> me<00:03:59.370> outside<00:03:59.700> but<00:04:00.260> or<00:04:01.260> what

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
people can hear me outside but or what

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.440 
people can hear me outside but or what
but<00:04:01.769> it's<00:04:02.220> pretty<00:04:02.459> quiet<00:04:02.640> neighborhood<00:04:03.180> and

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
but it's pretty quiet neighborhood and

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.940 
but it's pretty quiet neighborhood and
it<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:04.079> fairly<00:04:04.709> late<00:04:05.069> at<00:04:05.549> night<00:04:05.790> it's<00:04:06.950> almost

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
it is fairly late at night it's almost

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.610 
it is fairly late at night it's almost
eleven<00:04:08.370> o'clock<00:04:08.459> p.m.<00:04:09.030> so<00:04:09.359> i<00:04:09.569> think<00:04:10.380> that's

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
eleven o'clock p.m. so i think that's

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.890 
eleven o'clock p.m. so i think that's
another<00:04:10.950> key<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:12.450> move<00:04:12.600> into<00:04:12.870> a

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
another key is to move into a

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.830 
another key is to move into a
neighborhood<00:04:13.260> like<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.700> little<00:04:15.660> bit

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
neighborhood like this a little bit

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.210 
neighborhood like this a little bit
later<00:04:16.049> at<00:04:16.260> night<00:04:18.530> to<00:04:19.530> where<00:04:19.680> there's<00:04:19.889> not<00:04:20.010> much

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
later at night to where there's not much

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.830 
later at night to where there's not much
activity<00:04:20.430> everybody's<00:04:21.090> in<00:04:21.209> bed<00:04:21.389> nobody's

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
activity everybody's in bed nobody's

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.080 
activity everybody's in bed nobody's
seeing<00:04:22.440> vehicles<00:04:23.130> pull<00:04:23.370> up<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.700> park<00:04:23.849> and

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
seeing vehicles pull up and park and

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.810 
seeing vehicles pull up and park and

whatnot

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.230 
whatnot
so<00:04:24.940> it's<00:04:25.510> kind<00:04:25.690> of<00:04:25.720> funny<00:04:25.960> it<00:04:26.110> sounds<00:04:26.290> like

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240
