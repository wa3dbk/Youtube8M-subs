Perkins diesel in it it used to belong
to<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.160> blogger<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.710> was<00:00:46.710> aware<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
to a blogger so I was aware of the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.619 
to a blogger so I was aware of the
machine<00:00:47.489> from<00:00:47.640> before<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.030> never<00:00:48.270> thought<00:00:48.510> I'd

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
machine from before I never thought I'd

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.590 
machine from before I never thought I'd
see<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.840> again<00:00:49.520> now<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.730> own<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> camera<00:00:51.180> can

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
see it again now that I own a camera can

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.450 
see it again now that I own a camera can
do<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.809> right

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
do it right

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.529 
do it right
apparently<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> steering<00:00:53.910> mechanism<00:00:54.420> on

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
apparently the steering mechanism on

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.360 
apparently the steering mechanism on
these<00:00:54.719> old<00:00:54.899> machines<00:00:55.260> use<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:55.949> lever<00:00:56.190> to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
these old machines use one lever to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.330 
these old machines use one lever to
throw<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.699> into<00:00:56.850> forward<00:00:57.300> or<00:00:57.420> back<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.340> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
throw it into forward or back and the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.250 
throw it into forward or back and the
other<00:00:59.520> lever<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.059> knock<00:01:00.239> out<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.600> tracks<00:01:00.960> he'd

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
other lever to knock out one tracks he'd

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.100 
other lever to knock out one tracks he'd
only<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.620> 50%<00:01:02.340> power<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> turn<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
only be 50% power for a turn so it was a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.320 
only be 50% power for a turn so it was a
two<00:01:04.350> handed<00:01:04.680> operation<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
two handed operation to do that and the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.330 
two handed operation to do that and the
valve<00:01:09.570> Bank<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:11.119> located<00:01:12.119> directly<00:01:12.360> under<00:01:13.340> the
