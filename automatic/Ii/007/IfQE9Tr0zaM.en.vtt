plot and tuna machine heads and that's
where<00:00:09.840> some<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.139> confusion<00:00:10.320> has<00:00:10.860> arisen

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
where some of the confusion has arisen

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.220 
where some of the confusion has arisen
of<00:00:11.790> how<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.000> change<00:00:12.360> them<00:00:12.690> because<00:00:13.019> if<00:00:13.139> you

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
of how to change them because if you

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.890 
of how to change them because if you
look<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:14.280> doesn't<00:00:14.429> seem<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.790> be<00:00:14.910> any<00:00:15.150> wind<00:00:15.540> on

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
look it doesn't seem to be any wind on

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.420 
look it doesn't seem to be any wind on
the<00:00:16.680> actual<00:00:17.100> string<00:00:17.400> itself<00:00:18.020> so<00:00:19.020> some<00:00:19.230> people

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
the actual string itself so some people

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.670 
the actual string itself so some people
online<00:00:20.810> I've<00:00:21.810> been<00:00:21.990> asking<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.560> there

this one's got a bit more weighing done

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.700 
this one's got a bit more weighing done
the<00:01:26.270> other<00:01:26.390> ones<00:01:26.630> when<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:26.900> took<00:01:26.960> them<00:01:27.260> off

had no waned on it all and that's the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.340 
had no waned on it all and that's the
beauty<00:01:32.000> of<00:01:32.030> them<00:01:32.300> like<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.480> it<00:01:32.930> does<00:01:33.260> make

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.440 
changing the strain a lot symbol so as
you<00:01:41.630> say<00:01:41.900> this<00:01:42.740> barely<00:01:43.220> was<00:01:43.580> barely<00:01:43.850> any<00:01:44.000> wine

I'm just gonna thread that through do
you<00:02:24.890> feed<00:02:25.100> that<00:02:25.130> through<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:29.209> actual<00:02:29.720> hole

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
you feed that through the actual hole

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.520 
you feed that through the actual hole
that's<00:02:31.489> gone<00:02:31.730> through<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.120> peg<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.320> on<00:02:33.500> a

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
that's gone through the peg is it on a

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.040 
that's gone through the peg is it on a
little<00:02:34.010> bit<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.310> an<00:02:35.120> angle<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.780> doesn't<00:02:35.959> go

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
little bit of an angle so it doesn't go

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.870 
little bit of an angle so it doesn't go
straight<00:02:36.110> through<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:37.310> can<00:02:37.489> be<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.610> little

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
straight through that can be a little

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.190 
straight through that can be a little
bit<00:02:38.030> or<00:02:38.180> what<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.360> get<00:02:38.570> used<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.870> if<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.170> just

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
bit or what I get used to if you just

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.690 
bit or what I get used to if you just
used<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.650> stringing<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.130> straight<00:02:40.459> through

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.390 
used to stringing that straight through
but<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.510> think<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:42.200> idea<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.800> that<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:43.250> that

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
but I think the idea of that is so that

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.860 
but I think the idea of that is so that
when<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.640> turn<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.060> machine<00:02:44.090> had<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:46.370> lock

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
when you turn the machine had the lock

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.970 
when you turn the machine had the lock
part<00:02:49.060> happens<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.200> strings<00:02:51.560> locked

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
part happens so that the strings locked

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.650 
part happens so that the strings locked
into<00:02:52.760> place<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.500> don't<00:02:54.709> need<00:02:55.269> all<00:02:56.269> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
into place so you don't need all the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.960 
into place so you don't need all the
wind<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:57.860> want<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.100> leave<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.250> little<00:02:58.550> bit<00:02:58.820> of

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
wind so I want to leave a little bit of

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.520 
wind so I want to leave a little bit of
wind<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.450> there<00:03:01.150> where<00:03:02.150> when<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.750> tile<00:03:03.350> came

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
wind on there where when the tile came

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.580 
wind on there where when the tile came
out<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.830> factory<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:05.290> didn't<00:03:06.290> seem<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.500> have

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
out the factory I didn't seem to have

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.650 
out the factory I didn't seem to have
much<00:03:06.650> wind<00:03:07.190> on<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.489> on<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.970> other<00:03:08.120> strings

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
much wind on it on the other strings

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.030 
much wind on it on the other strings
I<00:03:08.810> would<00:03:09.769> leave<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.040> little<00:03:10.220> bit<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.519> wind<00:03:12.040> I'm

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
I would leave a little bit of wind I'm

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.500 
I would leave a little bit of wind I'm
turning<00:03:13.280> that<00:03:13.580> now

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.040

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
just wallnut so I like a little bit of

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.710 
just wallnut so I like a little bit of
waning<00:03:21.350> because<00:03:21.560> I<00:03:21.620> want<00:03:21.800> to<00:03:22.270> do<00:03:23.270> an<00:03:23.390> older

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
waning because I want to do an older
