 hi to all in this video we will see 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.300
 how to have the source mode my so we 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.199
 can see that it's on cydia and that 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:22.099
 did we added that in to handle it 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.980
 modified source added and that we put the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:32.740
 Mayan fashion source and therefore to fart 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:34.820
 points made my ic points as here 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.610
 so this secret like that but you have 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.290
 an error message so there for 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.280
 fix that you need to install 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:47.120
 ifile that you can find very 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:55.120
 easily on cydia you will do 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:59.050
 look for you wait for loading 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:07.159
 is there so we'll download high five 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:10.609
 had it installed and confirmed 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.909
 so there is a small load we go 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:16.390
 not sing that it downloads from that 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.810
 done it will have to download high five 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.390
 then a little file on safari 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.799
 but without and file in fact you will 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.250
 not download this file so you have to 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:33.799
 absolutely ifile to modify and have 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.409
 the fashion source my so the a7 the 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.640
 loads 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.640
 here you see a little what it does 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.640
 so here is the alpha it is installed so 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.690
 you can see it as an application 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.700
 in the in the pages of your iphone 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.870
 Here it is 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.870
 so in fact it had to allow 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.590

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.590

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.910

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.290

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.210

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.620

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.340

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:41.230

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.570
