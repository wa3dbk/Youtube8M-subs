00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.299
 I greet you guys and girls as already 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.309
 taken on my channel on Fridays we 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.759
 talking about the constructor 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.910
 and today it will be a mega bloks company 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.789
 and a huge universe heilo set 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.650
 called about like a siege motorcycle 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.410
 as won the articulum 97 97 a few words 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.160
 o box design as always on 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.990
 height 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.849
 however i have a couple of questions 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.000
 connoisseurs of the topic 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.260
 what is this logo with a pyramid in the bottom 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.600
 corner really 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.750
 Illuminati this mega bloks got and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.270
 The second question is what kind of installation is this? 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.110
 Kamenskoe your answers wait in the comments 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:52.920
 and we start and immediately pleasant trifles 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.829
 sense a dog details them a little 7 pieces 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.980
 but to be precise, the part size 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.010
 two by four is a stand for a figure 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.250
 besides the spare parts in the box also 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.460
 you will find assembly instructions 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 advertising booklet 72 details 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.189
 of which will go to create a motorcycle 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.710
 by the way will be in a short neck booklet with 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.409
 technical data of our bike 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.689
 should note it looks quite 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:27.600
 interesting further literally in a nutshell 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.540
 about the construction of which I already give you 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.630
 said I could not personally identify me 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.659
 things like teleporters or 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.950
 some devices to create energy fields 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.390
 but as I said, and more than once I wait for your 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.790
 competent comment what is this 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.000
 setting thank you in advance for your reply 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.119
 and move on and now I suggest 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.659
 talk about the main component of this 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.320
 recruitment 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:00.750
 right this is a siege motorcycle which 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.909
 equipped with a heavy machine gun m 268 h &amp; m jack 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.789
 about overclocking 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.130
 predetermined track unit 140 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.720
 kilometers per hour further I will show you 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.720
 bike functionality 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.519
 it's like a figurine feels on it 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.519
 tracked motorcycle 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.880
 no less important component of this 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.090
 set is figurines which is like me 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.360
 it seems mega bloks always succeed 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.270
 and we start with a covenant is mind fight 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.750
 representative of the lowest caste in the fireplace 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.470
 anti 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.180
 they breathe methane gas and 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.970
 hence for survival on others 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.940
 planets must wear a large tank 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.380
 with methane on my back I always thought that 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.530
 this is some kind of mountains 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.710
 armed with our grumble yes that way these 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.740
 types are called people ominous 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.620
 made of transparent plastic however 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.800
 as covenant himself as far as I understand 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.700
 so megabox was portrayed un'goro 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.800
 in stealth mode the next in line 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.490
 armor spartan mjolnir second 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:18.310
 generations enhanced assault armor and and 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.190
 I can not say that such armor 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.460
 I am very pleased with the first design and 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.280
 detail on top and it is a fact of 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.160
 The second set of different figures is 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.310
 absolute ornament to any collection and 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.740
 armed by our fighter as un standard 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.680
 assault rifle in conclusion I will say 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.200
 only that similar small sets 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.410
 undoubtedly helps you to diversify 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.050
 your collection of both figures and combat 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.780
 technicians moreover buy only one 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.000
 a similar set you can already safely 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.520
 play as you have and 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.030
 positive and negative character 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.790
 what else is there to add a great set and i 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.460
 would even say without any minuses 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.010
 which is rare in my opinion but on this 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.620
 positive note let's end 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:13.350
 like comment tell about
