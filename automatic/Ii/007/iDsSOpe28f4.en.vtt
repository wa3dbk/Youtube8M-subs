because<00:02:54.290> I've<00:02:54.380> actually<00:02:54.560> going<00:02:54.770> to<00:02:54.860> clog<00:02:55.040> up

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
because I've actually going to clog up

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.740 
because I've actually going to clog up
the<00:02:55.220> pores<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:55.610> then<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.850> could<00:02:56.030> grow<00:02:56.270> your

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
the pores and then I could grow your

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
hair is not going to grow as fast if all

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.200 
hair is not going to grow as fast if all
of<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.360> fails<00:02:59.950> then<00:03:00.970> actually<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.000> little

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
of that fails then actually a little

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.080 
of that fails then actually a little
topical<00:03:02.810> solution<00:03:03.350> that<00:03:03.620> we<00:03:04.040> know<00:03:04.280> called
