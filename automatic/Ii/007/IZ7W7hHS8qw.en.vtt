00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello, good kids, we're here 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.120
 new floor god of the envelope team 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.519
 well let's see let's see this time 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.650
 I'm in another account because that's how it ended 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.230
 before to create the template and everything 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.059
 because I do not have any more players then 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.740
 those that touch me are the ones that I have if 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.310
 I do not throw two hours to create the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.080
 team so let's see come on let's go 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.340
 over there to see what's in these envelopes 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.840
 well I just recorded me the three 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.599
 earlier that's why I'm going with the same 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.500
 shirt but afterwards I already change not to 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.850
 watch 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.930
 and the best one goes from arbeloa gómez to see that 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.270
 it makes me little valence valence to win you go 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:46.210
 to go through here that you're going to go around here 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:48.730
 shaarawy are varane good good good 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.730
 pretty weak from what we see 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.829
 pretty weak 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.130
 well we'll see what we can do see 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.400
 very little the forward not gómez to see 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.790
 let's go here 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.040
 gomez and little else is worth it because it seems to me that 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.250
 it's going to be gomez from the forward because 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.990
 we have something else 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.210
 Well, that's what I created the template and now 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.460
 I teach you how it is good guys 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.930
 This has been the team as you see the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.850
 strikers have been pretty good 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.400
 and the midfield also this one that is 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.050
 a little bit slower but it has a good 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.810
 physical and good defense so let's 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.150
 see I put sahraoui around here because 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.330
 the other midfielder I had to see 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.550
 where was I had 49 of rhythm then 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.530
 well I prefer to put it out there could 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.450
 have put Fernandez also but 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.890
 we are going to use a little bit the 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.960
 shaarawy I will not see how it goes in that 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.840
 position as you see chemistry is by 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.240
 the soils 43 of chemistry 80 of average that 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.860
 it's not bad but the defender does not 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.660
 ends a lot of ezcaray and although it does 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.970
 it's a bit slow and I do not like defenses 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.950
 as slow as garay terry we do not see 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.290
 nothing but good let's see what we can 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.050
 do come then let's see 78 of 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.450
 attack 84 in the midfield to see if not 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.220
 would give us with players there front of 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.710
 bronze has an average pint of 85 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.460
 good good good has a team 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.840
 quite powerful I had by sergio bouquets 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.800
 my mother 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.280
 a couple of all 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.190
 we have to stop there more if caught by 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.890
 Where is 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.850
 is that is that look at it 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.850
 come said 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.330

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:37.360

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.190

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.310
 we did not go out 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:47.500
 if he does it for me from chilena flipo that was 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.210
 but not too long fuck come 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.530
 we are squeezing a little bit so 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.819
 less 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.819
 it does not come out anymore it does not come out anymore 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.930
 that was 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.629
 he was getting with the defense on 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.680

 good position 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:34.490

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.450
 well then we have gotten there to win the 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.310
 just left me I could get 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.250
 a mold had some more occasion but 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.730
 I was cutting myself from holding it because 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.320
 had the grave tuck and cost yours 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.700
 to stop them but good has been 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.770
 pretty good is the first game that 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.630
 game that I always see some 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:00.380
 comments to know how many parties has 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:03.350
 played to win the game this from 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:05.120
 that your envelope team bonus and 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.000
 normally it is usually the first or the 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.190
 second not only play much more but you 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.220
 and I teach because it is this account 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.620
 I did not play, I just had it 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:19.130
 for the envelope team he had used 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.570
 well that's the 100,000 envelope and there was not 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.240
 played no match as you see the 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:27.190
 history is 100 so I do not expect anything 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.190
 what you liked and until next time
