00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.680
 mercedes benz class g use of the 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.450
 reductive and blockages 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.230
 differential 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.719
 the mercedes benz g 350 cdi has a 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.490
 permanent all-wheel drive system with 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.180
 a reducer connectable by a 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.180
 electric control 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.310
 under normal conditions the differential 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.109
 central makes a 50% share of the pair 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.349
 to the wheels of the front axle and the 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:33.140
 back and is the electronic system 4 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.210
 gts the one in charge of braking the wheels 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.120
 they skate to try the car 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.760
 Advance 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.199
 when that is not enough there is the 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.329
 possibility of blocking the three 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.489
 Differentials using push buttons 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.110
 what's in the console 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.870
 we tried to raise the same bet 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.730
 of a 40 percent slope 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.199
 approximately is an obstacle in the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.300
 that there comes a time when the only 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.390
 the wheel with good grip is the rear 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.390
 left 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.750
 in the first attempt without blocking the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.340
 differentials the engine force is 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.350
 loses on the two front wheels 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.020
 they just pull and in the back 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.700
 right the left rear wheel we 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.750
 get enough to move around 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.750
 drive the vehicle 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.520
 in the second attempt the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.350
 central differential now both the wheel 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.600
 front left as the back 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.060
 left receives an engine torque all 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.020
 the cat is also enough to 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.020
 continue the ascent 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.500
 in this third attempt they are blocked 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.080
 the three differentials in this 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.270
 circumstance all four wheels receive 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.280
 the same proportion of torque and the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.280
 Pla can complete the ascent
