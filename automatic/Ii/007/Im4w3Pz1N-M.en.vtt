00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
what's up guys Origen here yeah I'm

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.180 
what's up guys Origen here yeah I'm
gonna<00:00:10.790> show<00:00:10.880> you<00:00:11.090> my<00:00:11.629> most<00:00:12.110> common<00:00:12.680> base<00:00:12.889> build

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
gonna show you my most common base build

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.029 
gonna show you my most common base build
and<00:00:13.340> rust<00:00:13.610> it's<00:00:13.940> a<00:00:14.119> pretty<00:00:14.450> easy<00:00:14.750> build<00:00:15.260> it

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
and rust it's a pretty easy build it

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.290 
and rust it's a pretty easy build it
doesn't<00:00:16.309> take<00:00:16.430> a<00:00:16.460> whole<00:00:16.550> lot<00:00:16.730> of<00:00:16.850> resources

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
doesn't take a whole lot of resources

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.029 
doesn't take a whole lot of resources
and<00:00:17.360> it's<00:00:17.480> pretty<00:00:17.630> secure<00:00:17.900> so<00:00:18.350> first<00:00:18.860> you<00:00:18.920> want

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
and it's pretty secure so first you want

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.009 
and it's pretty secure so first you want
to<00:00:19.070> start<00:00:19.130> out<00:00:19.340> with<00:00:19.460> two<00:00:19.849> foundations<00:00:20.630> then

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:21.019 
to start out with two foundations then

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.660 
to start out with two foundations then
follow<00:00:21.349> by<00:00:21.470> adding<00:00:21.890> six<00:00:22.160> pillars<00:00:22.400> to<00:00:22.580> the

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
follow by adding six pillars to the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.300 
follow by adding six pillars to the
outside<00:00:23.000> of<00:00:23.119> that<00:00:23.210> next<00:00:24.170> step<00:00:24.410> adding<00:00:24.859> five

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
outside of that next step adding five

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.670 
outside of that next step adding five
walls<00:00:25.669> around<00:00:26.419> the<00:00:26.570> outside

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
walls around the outside

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.770 
walls around the outside
and<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.400> follow<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.030> the<00:00:30.210> doorway

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:30.780 
and then follow that up with the doorway

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.430 
and then follow that up with the doorway
and<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.680> metal<00:00:31.920> door<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.369> now<00:00:32.970> you<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.210> a

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
and a metal door and now you have a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.600 
and a metal door and now you have a
somewhat<00:00:34.440> secure<00:00:34.830> base<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.220> mean<00:00:35.340> people

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
somewhat secure base I mean people

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.890 
somewhat secure base I mean people
aren't<00:00:35.730> gonna<00:00:35.850> bash<00:00:36.180> your<00:00:36.210> door<00:00:36.540> down<00:00:36.660> because

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
aren't gonna bash your door down because

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.660 
aren't gonna bash your door down because
it's<00:00:37.020> made<00:00:37.140> out<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.290> metal<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.620> people<00:00:38.190> could

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it's made out of metal but people could

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.150 
it's made out of metal but people could
just<00:00:38.880> jump<00:00:39.210> into<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> top<00:00:39.720> if<00:00:39.870> they<00:00:39.989> put<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> box

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
just jump into the top if they put a box

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.680 
just jump into the top if they put a box
in<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.430> barricade<00:00:41.850> or<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.150> know<00:00:42.239> build<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
in a barricade or you know build on the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.479 
in a barricade or you know build on the
outside<00:00:43.080> so<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.380> next<00:00:43.590> step<00:00:43.830> here<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.400> be

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
outside so the next step here is to be

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.740 
outside so the next step here is to be
building<00:00:44.790> upwards<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.360> we're<00:00:45.449> gonna<00:00:45.570> add<00:00:45.720> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
building upwards so we're gonna add a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.990 
building upwards so we're gonna add a
staircases<00:00:46.230> back<00:00:46.650> roof<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.550> top<00:00:47.580> section

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
staircases back roof on the top section

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.390 
staircases back roof on the top section
and<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.080> they<00:00:49.230> add<00:00:49.350> pillars<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.830> top<00:00:50.040> of<00:00:50.220> that

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
and then they add pillars on top of that

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.010 
and then they add pillars on top of that
and<00:00:50.670> then<00:00:50.940> we're<00:00:51.030> gonna<00:00:51.180> follow<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:51.809> by

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and then we're gonna follow that up by

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.630 
and then we're gonna follow that up by
adding<00:00:52.559> some<00:00:52.739> walls<00:00:52.920> around<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> outside<00:00:53.610> of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
adding some walls around the outside of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.580 
adding some walls around the outside of
that<00:00:53.790> and<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:54.449> another<00:00:54.570> doorway<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
that and then another doorway and a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.530 
that and then another doorway and a
metal<00:00:55.830> door<00:00:56.010> follow<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.330> with<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
metal door follow that up with the

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.210 
metal door follow that up with the
ceiling<00:00:57.900> now<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.769> completely<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
ceiling now you have a completely a

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.310 
ceiling now you have a completely a
secure<00:00:59.550> base<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.970> for<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.660> long<00:01:00.840> as<00:01:01.050> people

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
secure base as for as long as people

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.170 
secure base as for as long as people
don't<00:01:01.470> come<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:01.829> c4<00:01:02.460> charges<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.000> take

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
don't come up with c4 charges and take

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.139 
don't come up with c4 charges and take
out<00:01:03.360> your<00:01:03.540> doorways<00:01:04.190> on<00:01:05.190> a<00:01:05.250> side<00:01:05.550> note<00:01:05.580> there's

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
out your doorways on a side note there's

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.120 
out your doorways on a side note there's
also<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.869> spot<00:01:07.170> right<00:01:07.410> here<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.830> middle

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
also a spot right here in the middle

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.680 
also a spot right here in the middle
you're<00:01:08.369> gonna<00:01:08.460> want<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.700> put<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> doorway<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
you're gonna want to put a doorway and a

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.840 
you're gonna want to put a doorway and a
door<00:01:09.869> also<00:01:10.340> basically<00:01:11.340> that's<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.700> want

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
door also basically that's what you want

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.120 
door also basically that's what you want
to<00:01:11.910> do<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.600> make<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.990> secure<00:01:13.350> base<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:13.860> best

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
to do to make a secure base and the best

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.400 
to do to make a secure base and the best
part<00:01:14.430> about<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.820> base<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.229> keep

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
part about this base is you can keep

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.630 
part about this base is you can keep
building<00:01:16.560> onto<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.160> you<00:01:17.280> see<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> two

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
building onto it like you see the two

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.670 
building onto it like you see the two
pillars<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> front<00:01:18.360> if<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.320> added<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
pillars in the front if you added a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.710 
pillars in the front if you added a
staircase<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.399> and<00:01:20.550> walls<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.000> went<00:01:21.630> up<00:01:21.690> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
staircase there and walls and went up to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.760 
staircase there and walls and went up to
the<00:01:21.869> next<00:01:22.050> level<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> same<00:01:22.710> thing

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the next level do the same thing

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.279 
the next level do the same thing
staircase<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:24.030> know<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.420> cross<00:01:24.660> zigzag

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
staircase you know just cross zigzag

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.290 
staircase you know just cross zigzag
back<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:25.500> forth<00:01:25.680> all<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> way<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.149> you

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
back and forth all the way up and you

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.880 
back and forth all the way up and you
eventually<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:28.050> giant<00:01:28.440> base<00:01:28.590> that's

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
eventually have a giant base that's

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.650 
eventually have a giant base that's
pretty<00:01:29.250> much<00:01:29.340> impossible<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.149> into<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
pretty much impossible to get into and

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.330 
pretty much impossible to get into and
now<00:01:31.050> we'll<00:01:31.229> go<00:01:31.350> ahead<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> take<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:31.890> look<00:01:32.130> at<00:01:32.220> it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
now we'll go ahead and take a look at it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.730 
now we'll go ahead and take a look at it
inside<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> game

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.190 

so<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.770> got<00:01:37.920> mine<00:01:38.070> built<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:38.460> about<00:01:38.730> Tao<00:01:39.080> 10<00:01:40.080> or

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so I got mine built up about Tao 10 or

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.680 
so I got mine built up about Tao 10 or
11<00:01:40.500> stories<00:01:40.800> something<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.370> that<00:01:41.690> basically

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
11 stories something like that basically

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.040 
11 stories something like that basically
just<00:01:42.840> keep<00:01:43.050> adding<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.220> play<00:01:45.050> see

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
just keep adding on to it as we play see

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.300 
just keep adding on to it as we play see
you<00:01:46.110> come<00:01:46.320> through<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.560> door<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.250> your

you come through the door it's your
first<00:01:47.550> room<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:47.940> then<00:01:48.030> there's<00:01:48.150> another

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
first room and then there's another

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.720 
first room and then there's another
doorway<00:01:49.400> in<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.490> staircase<00:01:50.760> in<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.510> doorway<00:01:52.080> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
staircase in a doorway and it basically

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.110 
staircase in a doorway and it basically
just<00:01:55.470> goes<00:01:55.740> staircase<00:01:56.220> doorway<00:01:56.700> staircase

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
just goes staircase doorway staircase

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.780 
just goes staircase doorway staircase
Dory<00:01:57.390> alternating<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.260> way<00:01:58.350> up<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:59.640> this

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
Dory alternating all the way up and this

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.250 
Dory alternating all the way up and this
spot<00:02:00.090> right<00:02:00.240> here<00:02:00.300> is<00:02:00.480> X<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:00.990> lookout

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
spot right here is X my little lookout

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.070 
spot right here is X my little lookout
tower<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:02.330> see<00:02:03.330> what's<00:02:03.480> going<00:02:03.720> on<00:02:03.840> are<00:02:03.960> on

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
tower that I see what's going on are on

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.990 
tower that I see what's going on are on
my<00:02:04.230> base<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.740> put<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.010> near<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.490> tree<00:02:05.760> so<00:02:05.940> I

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
my base and I put it near this tree so I

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.850 
my base and I put it near this tree so I
could<00:02:06.120> use<00:02:06.240> these<00:02:06.420> trees<00:02:06.720> for<00:02:06.960> cover<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.830> he

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
could use these trees for cover so he

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.810 
could use these trees for cover so he
couldn't<00:02:08.130> see<00:02:08.220> me<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:08.520> well<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:10.370> we<00:02:11.370> jump<00:02:11.670> back

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
couldn't see me as well so we jump back

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.100 
couldn't see me as well so we jump back
out<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.150> start<00:02:12.600> heading<00:02:12.810> up<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.050> stairs

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
out and start heading up the stairs

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.970 
out and start heading up the stairs
again<00:02:13.440> here<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:16.740> same<00:02:17.040> thing<00:02:17.280> just<00:02:17.480> staircase

I<00:02:40.770> got<00:02:40.980> all<00:02:41.040> these<00:02:41.160> foundations<00:02:42.000> at<00:02:42.090> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
I got all these foundations at the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.900 
I got all these foundations at the
bottom<00:02:42.450> oh<00:02:42.540> I'll<00:02:42.810> go<00:02:42.930> back<00:02:43.080> down<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.910> talk

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
it a little tip on base defense so here

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.370 
it a little tip on base defense so here
we<00:02:51.420> are<00:02:51.450> at<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.660> bottom<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.140> see<00:02:52.290> all

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
we are at the bottom and you see all

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.990 
we are at the bottom and you see all
these<00:02:52.470> foundations<00:02:53.040> around<00:02:53.130> pillars<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.760> top

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
these foundations around pillars on top

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.420 
these foundations around pillars on top
of<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.269> basically<00:02:54.959> what<00:02:55.320> these<00:02:55.440> are<00:02:55.650> for<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.220> to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
of it basically what these are for is to

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.009 
of it basically what these are for is to
keep<00:02:56.610> people<00:02:56.850> from<00:02:57.060> building<00:02:57.330> onto<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.810> side

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
keep people from building onto the side

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.750 
keep people from building onto the side
of<00:02:58.140> my<00:02:58.200> base<00:02:58.410> because<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.280> can't<00:02:59.519> put

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
of my base because you can't put

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.050 
of my base because you can't put
foundations<00:03:00.540> down<00:03:01.130> next<00:03:02.130> like<00:03:02.489> too<00:03:02.670> close<00:03:02.850> to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
foundations down next like too close to

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.490 
foundations down next like too close to
other<00:03:03.180> foundations<00:03:03.750> if<00:03:03.930> they<00:03:04.050> don't<00:03:04.200> attach

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
other foundations if they don't attach

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.280 
other foundations if they don't attach
so<00:03:05.100> they<00:03:05.519> won't<00:03:06.090> be<00:03:06.300> able<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.750> put<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.230> a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
so they won't be able to put in a

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.350 
so they won't be able to put in a
foundation<00:03:08.040> on<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.370> side<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.670> my<00:03:08.760> base<00:03:08.910> build

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
foundation on the side of my base build

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.270 
foundation on the side of my base build
a<00:03:09.420> staircase<00:03:09.660> up<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.500> then<00:03:10.739> blow<00:03:10.920> into<00:03:11.100> my

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
a staircase up and then blow into my

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.550 
a staircase up and then blow into my
walls<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:11.790> if<00:03:11.880> they<00:03:12.630> have<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.050> pretty<00:03:13.200> much<00:03:13.350> go

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
walls so if they have to pretty much go

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.840 
walls so if they have to pretty much go
through<00:03:13.800> my<00:03:13.890> doorways<00:03:14.250> if<00:03:14.400> they<00:03:14.519> want<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.760> get

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
through my doorways if they want to get

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.420 
through my doorways if they want to get
to<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.090> top<00:03:15.300> so<00:03:15.690> oh<00:03:15.959> thanks<00:03:16.950> for<00:03:17.040> watching
