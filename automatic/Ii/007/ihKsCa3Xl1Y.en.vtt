 make a tail in the middle of one 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.880
 circle 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.960
 use one or two sturdy rubber bands 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.960
 and tighten it 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.920
 oh cool 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.840
 roll it up and put it up temporarily 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.840
 fixed with a clamp 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.860
 make following separation to the circle 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.860
 in the form of a half moon 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.590
 a 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.020
 fasten the remaining hair 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.640
 start grabbing a braid around the circle 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.810
 at a camp at only at the 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.810
 right side in this case 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.340
 pull the braid a little around one 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.340
 to make it wider 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.039
 the 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.530
 thoroughly wet the tail from the circle 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.530
 and uses jill or hair spray 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.460
 comb the tail well and divide it 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.460
 two 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.750
 Oh 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.500
 make small tufts and embroider with 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.390
 the coarse blunt needle under the elastic 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.400
 on to the other side 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.730
 try to spread them evenly over the circle 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.730
 divide 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.980
 also can 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.500
 now the petals are off the flower 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.659
 made in the same way as net 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.659
 only now do you leave a loop 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.000
 the first suit you only go through the 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.040
 elastic 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.410
 all subsequent tufts first pass through the 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.100
 previous loops before they pass through the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.100
 go elastic 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.009
 Oh 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.960
 also 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.180
 with a little pulling and picking 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.180
 try to distribute everything evenly 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.900
 make some curls in the loose plucking 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:15.240
 use hair spray to fix everything 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:26.719
