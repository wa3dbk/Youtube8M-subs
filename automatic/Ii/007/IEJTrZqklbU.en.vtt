00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 interlocutor you choose one of the 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.490
 two each time and we start with 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.950
 two former Nantes retirees 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.040
 maxime bossis and the Parisian Paul the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.870
 guen me I take two games I serve 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.309
 to what becomes in the life of all 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.710
 days I 've never seen you put yourself in 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.630
 angry at someone or being aggressive 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.250
 did you change what happened to you 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.760
 now to get out of his hinges of 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.000
 from time to time yes it's true that before 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.310
 I did not speak very often or I stay 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.300
 a little bit about me now it's 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.059
 true when there is something to say 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.489
 which seems important to me 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.649
 club I do not hesitate and I think like 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.480
 that's clear in between all 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.219
 people and did I think a little 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.010
 more trust then the second 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.930
 sequence takes us very far amilly 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.789
 in the loiret and in your youth 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.260
 you played with franck gava in teams 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.850
 of young people and you have as coach 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.969
 jean-françois laurent who is now 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.680
 in paris saint-germain with young people 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.449
 well I'm fine I'll see him in the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.399
 last game on that I rather listen 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.340
 the question of jean françois patrice 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.519
 hello ten years back 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.479
 a memorable year for you maybe 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.369
 a bad memory 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.960
 I took you to a friendly match 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.880
 against the club that was at the favorite club 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.409
 at that moment are you going away 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.409
 remember 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.710
 and yes I remember it was against 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.330
 paris i think because i have 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.510
 it is true that I loved this team 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.400
 I was going to see them at the Princes' Park 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.220
 regularly with a friend and we have 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.190
 I think we lost that match had to 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.500
 take a beautiful beautiful rust surely 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.270
 but it is true that they had very 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.440
 good players in this team and that 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.320
 remains a good memory because it is 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.100
 I really like this team then 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.050
 last sequence 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.350
 beware it is the one that gives the fiber 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.330
 sensitive one side papa pascal lecoq have 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.130
 been found near orleans and your 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.560
 megan brother who is a footballer a saw 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.149
 in niort 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.670
 ah well i will choose 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.460
 I saw my brother a short time ago 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.080
 listened to the question of my father patrice 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.890
 if you realize that your son does not like 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.929
 not football 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.390
 she would be a big disappointment for 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.670
 that's what happened to him when 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.190
 you were little because you did not want 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.570
 watch the matches on TV news yes 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.400
 exactly that I remember very well and 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.250
 then my mother takes me back time in 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.019
 time it's true I'm saying I 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.489
 did not watch the matches when I was 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.380
 very small my father he loved to watch 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.700
 the matches and with me listen to me I 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.420
 I did not want to go play 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.739
 out and all now for monfils 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.480
 for now he's starting to type a 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.739
 little bit in the balloon and I 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.900
 the impression that he may be going 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.700
 put it only 20 months so it's a 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.650
 little young but hey maybe yes he 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.060
 is going to get a little bit earlier and if he 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.630
 wants to do football I will not prevent 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.630
 not on the contrary
