00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.000
 hello all this is almost master and today 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.400
 we will learn to place blocks of 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.780
 glass like these from here 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.780
 this is a room 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.900
 in which we have decided to place four 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.840
 glass blocks 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:28.050
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.050
 put tyranny to make marks 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.870
 this so that for the blocks 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.739
 stay in this form if it is the room 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.880
 all are parallel parallel and not one 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.880
 well and the other well 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:49.100
 we measure the width that is 19 centimeters 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.260
 and then we proceed to pass 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.469
 and the line 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.190
 so that the line matches this 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.190
 and stay straight 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.489
 in the same way on this side 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.640
 now to place the blocks should be 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.890
 place these slightly above 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.940
 of this surface of the surface of the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.729
 roof for that because the rain or something 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.420
 they slip and do not accumulate they do not possess 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.270
 here and inside 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.450
 inside on the bottom it will be like 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.990
 a kind of hole 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:36.140
 which he is not going to be going to give 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.140
 an appearance that they were lights 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.259
 a fence or something like a dim light 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.310
 that on the one hand that would be basically 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.310
 everything now 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.670
 on this roof it was already planned to place 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.560
 or place these video blocks like this 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.790
 is that he left 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:06.150
 about this cavity but in case 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:10.410
 it was not so simply s 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:13.830
 you start making the hole taking 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.920
 note that it must match a 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.310
 brick this roof is technopor by 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.310
 that's no problem 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.620
 It is effective effective and itchy 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.850
 but what if they remember that the ceiling 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.110
 is 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.760
 a column of bricks and one of 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.620
 concrete brick concrete brick 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.080
 concrete in the concrete is the iron 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.300
 what gives support if we want to place 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.100
 cubes we must match that 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.470
 exist 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.080
 that goes exactly where is a 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.200
 brick so that we do not have the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.200
 need 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.190
 so that we are not going to deal with the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.730
 iron 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.130
 that would be on the one hand everything is done by 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.380
 the top of the roof 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:08.530
 once we place this here 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:12.160
 we align place with mortar mix 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:15.920
 the mixture should be a little must be 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:20.680
 Pretty fluid enough for you to enter 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.409
 for all these cavities and 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.470
 and we make these little marks here 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:29.890
 these little ones 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:34.420
 how can i say we plucked this piece 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:37.830
 of cement for what 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.830
 go in a kind of 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.639
 of trapeze something like that the top part 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.310
 that is large and the bottom part that 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:50.299
 be small what for a tremor or 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.249
 something holds this here that a block 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.189
 he also has these indentations that he's going 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:57.489
 to help hold it here is going to be done 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.489
 mix 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.080
 taking this into account let's proceed 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.080
 to place the table 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:17.280
 as you can see this is the result 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.590
 I had told them at the beginning that if 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.650
 it was roof they had to do it raised 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.130
 for the protection of the rain but as 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.610
 see this area has projection for a 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.940
 terrace or something like that the floor is needed 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.330
 obviously there will be an awning 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.330
 over 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.090
 I hope you have served this video 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.090
 see you until next time 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.069
 it looks down 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.460
 and what we are going to do now is wait 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.529
 to dry for later 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.679
 yr peeling with a hammer 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:08.080
 a sincere convoy giving it a way 

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:10.000
 square 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.810
 and then how to proceed to tarrajeo and 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.370
 Let it remain as a kind of square 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:21.639
 and as a natural light 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:25.379
 the room but what 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.379
 it looks directly too
