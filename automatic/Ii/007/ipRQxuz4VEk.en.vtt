 He's all right here talking and talking. 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.430
 Welcome to the last episode of 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.260
 first with athletic madrid galera 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.870
 today we define whether it is justified in 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.120
 first division if we are demoted 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.100
 Let's see what will happen is our 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.320
 last episode we have there from 5 to 1 of the 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.360

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.540
 four wins a draw and three 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.940
 defeats we need a 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.920
 to ensure our maintenance here 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.199
 in the first division in the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.940
 time we have control than seven goals 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.909
 even has six goals 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.850
 Gabi has 4 for in 2 place if raul 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.500
 garcía has a goal and now he is looking for 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.930
 first opponent other than a team 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.260
 very strong though it is on top of him and 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.640
 It's no big deal if the face 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.340
 I have the impression that I played against 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.150
 Nero was a beauty neither with the cot 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.220
 covers at the ends have about 99 type 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.370
 9% sure you do not find it 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.620
 study davi silva de maria 9 that was the 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.800
 cm of him is fernandinho if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.500
 this exactly to start to leave 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.660
 on top of him 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.410
 Garcia pulls the ball gabi placed in the middle 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.450
 of the area already pulled by mandy command putz 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:47.240
 The old ball went under the lower leg. 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:50.650
 not entered old places is still going to cook 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.390
 for God's sake does not interest the ball 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:58.520
 old ball does not enter the environment 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.010
 enters or who holds the ball a little 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.230
 the years he was arriving in the area where 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.750
 what arrived on the other side dominated pulled 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.039
 the kit cut to the goal where the kit 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.019
 out the incredible is Maria 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.450
 placing in the area 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:18.890
 our passing very dangerously head 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.750
 of fernández chiquero 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.900
 Mole ball boy goes for one year 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.650
 Unbelievable sky that conditions have 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.360
 taken the ball at the last second old ro 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.430
 Garcia our great back 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.590
 putz in the other corner I do not know how to paint 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.570
 button in this corner left of the d'here 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.350
 another old right corner 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.900
 I saw lamela I swear to you. 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.270
 already for the first time we will 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.500
 losing unbelievable goals galera 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.750
 precision in the pass of our team're 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.970
 should still owes too 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.280
 make these goals talks down under there 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.959
 of the short leg and do not enter ti have the 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:07.720
 opportunity to score and do not 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:10.870
 funk that ball but the kit inside mano 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.850
 finally in a move that no one would 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.430
 maybe you've been waiting for the right moment 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.320
 relief was getting very bad on the ball and 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.270
 completely lost the time of the ball and then O 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.209
 dominate with the chest send the kit 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.430
 finally old finally the matador 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.440
 entered wax 1 to 0 missing 15 minutes 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.560
 to end the game 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.519
 the abyss van in the branch have more than in the 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.519
 Mole area 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.430
 oh my God 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.920
 end of game 1 to 0 skinny skinny 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.430
 but rather guarantee us in the first division 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.110
 Selfishness was better in the field with grade 7.9 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.780
 people on his side here fernandinho 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.160
 note 7.5 blank at least the kit that 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.260
 put our body in 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.910
 savior there does not look at the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.440
 four finalizations for the 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.730
 our side two for them 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.880
 we are a little bit - possession of the ball 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.700
 accurate on the pass was bad 52 almost 52% 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.950
 We 're going to give it to him. 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.450
 look here we reach 16 points very 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.160
 well you stayed in the same division 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.079
 In a league you'll realize 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.989
 stay in the current division 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.790
 we got there with 16 points in 5 with five 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.190
 wins a draw and three defeats in 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.350
 nine games in the team artillery 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.169
 we got eight goals from mandzukic 6 from 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.560
 griezmann qav had four shifts m2 and 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:27.100
 Garcia had a couple of goals galera 21 goals 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.290
 only nine games is just say right 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.030
 because in our last in the first and with 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.910
 England made 30 goals in eight 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.370
 games then explain why and 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.470
 why this is due to the team 's question 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.120
 This is not a very 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.590
 recommended for you to play the first 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.990
 I recommend, but not 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.030
 I recommend what I recommend but I recommend it 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.310
 Man, you do not have speed like that. 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.260
 team is the first question is this you 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.780
 There are players there the years are over. 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.100
 speed of the sides and selfishness rest 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.600
 it's very technical 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.160
 except that it does not have speed 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.160
 has a lot of physical guys 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.130
 They are all very technical and will 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.949
 Cattle is that 73 Play 180 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.530
 but which he has 73 but is not 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.630
 strong the mtur before and 2 but neither is it 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.669
 strong the big event of the kit is more 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.590
 strong the pace is not so strong 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.090
 also people who mean you 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.680
 You have to work hard for the ball 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.020
 You leave on the counterattack on the run. 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.370
 for example without touching the ball and such 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.740
 something else that maybe I could 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.660
 have abused is not abused so was the 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.160
 head of dodo nods and 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.350
 Human the kit also occasionally 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.110
 you can cross the ball in the area and things 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.600
 I do not say it's a very 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.139
 very recommended also because of this 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.000
 You do not have a team that 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.070
 Let's be afraid of faces. 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.919
 so connected have players who are good 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.900
 in their respective most expensive positions 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.660
 You have to touch the ball a lot, you have to 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.960
 have absurd creativity for you and 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.460
 games had played the team tet old is 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.860
 that game that was getting expensive 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.410
 connection was punk had that other game 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.720
 that we took the goal the 90 was punk 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:04.539
 Also last few games we had the 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.520
 opportunity only that I have suffered here to 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.500
 create the opportunities that this team was 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.690
 different status in the first 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.729
 England and if there is already a 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.760
 little more complicated to play 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.889
 anyway it's position by position here I go 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.780
 speak by sector I liked the goalkeeper did not 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.910
 I liked the good defense of serve defender 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.380
 vacancy in the middle of the field I liked it more 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.330
 My face was missing something was a 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.550
 blast is missing something there 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.320
 to the law is required in this team 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.150
 The attack is good, but it's very bad. 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.330
 slow was very slow and ball control 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.280
 his is hideous old is complicated hand 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.590
 he also does not have a good pass and 61% 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.210
 so sometimes it ends up breaking your 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.110
 attack because of that it is 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.520
 sensational 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.500
 here too a swallow does not 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.860
 Summer is not not recommended but it is 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.180
 recommended by Amaral also know out 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.100
 pro team 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.630
 more than reasonable there the team of 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.759
 athletic of madrid unfortunately is a 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.860
 kind of guy who loves real life but here in the 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:07:00.220
 game is what to play in winter has to 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:02.740
 not having a note 6 was not a note 7 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.210
 that was not so bad so roof is so 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:09.550
 going down the firewood but it was not so bad 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:12.910
 Well, thank you. 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:15.250
 time I was hoping to get some things 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.289
 more with the team but I think maybe 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.389
 I eat football from every dvd maybe 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:21.250
 team is also having a clear drink 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:23.560
 little at last if you liked the video 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.849
