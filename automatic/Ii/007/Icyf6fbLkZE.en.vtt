00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
a home when so many people wanted them

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.600 
a home when so many people wanted them
and<00:04:42.750> we<00:04:42.840> decided<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.500> only<00:04:43.530> fair<00:04:44.040> way<00:04:44.250> was<00:04:44.460> to

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
and we decided the only fair way was to

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.360 
and we decided the only fair way was to
have<00:04:44.760> some<00:04:45.000> sort<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.300> contest

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.220 

and<00:04:48.910> so<00:04:49.120> we<00:04:49.449> came<00:04:49.630> up<00:04:49.690> with<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.960> idea<00:04:50.169> of

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
and so we came up with the idea of

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.960 
and so we came up with the idea of
asking<00:04:50.410> people<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:50.889> please<00:04:51.220> write<00:04:51.580> in<00:04:51.730> and

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
asking people to please write in and

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.420 
asking people to please write in and
describe<00:04:52.270> why<00:04:53.110> they<00:04:53.410> felt<00:04:53.770> their<00:04:54.010> home<00:04:54.190> would

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
describe why they felt their home would

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.950 
describe why they felt their home would
be<00:04:54.580> perfect<00:04:54.970> for<00:04:55.000> scarlet<00:04:55.570> and<00:04:55.690> or<00:04:55.840> the

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
be perfect for scarlet and or the

be perfect for scarlet and or the
kittens<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:56.560> why<00:04:57.070> they<00:04:57.280> wanted<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.669> adopt

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940

letters and read them and we narrowed it
down<00:05:05.670> and<00:05:06.060> eventually<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.840> three<00:05:07.080> homes<00:05:07.290> were
