lot younger and faster than Collazo in
the<00:03:32.560> future<00:03:32.889> but<00:03:33.609> nonetheless<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.930> was<00:03:35.049> a<00:03:35.560> good

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
the future but nonetheless it was a good

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.250 
the future but nonetheless it was a good
comeback<00:03:36.879> fight<00:03:37.120> for<00:03:37.329> corn<00:03:37.540> but<00:03:38.109> he'll

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
comeback fight for corn but he'll

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.920 
comeback fight for corn but he'll
definitely<00:03:38.439> face<00:03:38.889> stiffer<00:03:39.250> test<00:03:39.489> than<00:03:39.669> this

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
definitely face stiffer test than this

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.539 
definitely face stiffer test than this
definitely<00:03:40.930> but<00:03:41.199> I<00:03:41.439> predicted<00:03:42.189> corn<00:03:42.430> would

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
definitely but I predicted corn would

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.729 
definitely but I predicted corn would
lose<00:03:42.729> this<00:03:42.879> fight<00:03:43.120> by<00:03:43.299> KO<00:03:43.569> I<00:03:43.930> didn't<00:03:44.590> think

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
lose this fight by KO I didn't think

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.170 
lose this fight by KO I didn't think
he'd<00:03:44.919> be<00:03:44.949> able<00:03:45.099> to<00:03:45.189> hold<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.549> together<00:03:45.669> for<00:03:45.849> 12

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
he'd be able to hold it together for 12

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.899 
he'd be able to hold it together for 12
rounds<00:03:46.389> so<00:03:46.689> he<00:03:46.810> proved<00:03:47.109> me<00:03:47.290> wrong<00:03:47.500> I<00:03:47.909> always

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
rounds so he proved me wrong I always

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.339 
rounds so he proved me wrong I always
knew<00:03:49.060> he<00:03:49.150> had<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.389> speed<00:03:49.659> I<00:03:49.689> always<00:03:50.019> knew<00:03:50.199> he

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
knew he had to speed I always knew he

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.530 
knew he had to speed I always knew he
had<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.680> boxing<00:03:51.069> ability<00:03:51.159> you<00:03:51.699> know<00:03:51.819> to<00:03:51.879> give

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
had the boxing ability you know to give

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.240 
had the boxing ability you know to give
colossal<00:03:53.049> problems<00:03:53.470> at<00:03:53.590> long<00:03:53.769> range<00:03:54.040> and

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
colossal problems at long range and

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.009 
colossal problems at long range and
whatnot<00:03:54.609> but<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.180> thought<00:03:55.419> at<00:03:55.569> some<00:03:55.599> stage

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
whatnot but I thought at some stage

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.649 
whatnot but I thought at some stage
kalasa<00:03:56.349> would<00:03:56.530> catch<00:03:56.739> him<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:57.009> take<00:03:57.069> him<00:03:57.370> out

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
kalasa would catch him and take him out

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.559 
kalasa would catch him and take him out
corn<00:03:58.659> would<00:03:58.810> maybe<00:03:59.019> make<00:04:00.000> mistakes<00:04:01.000> defensive

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
corn would maybe make mistakes defensive

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.479 
corn would maybe make mistakes defensive
mistakes<00:04:01.720> but<00:04:02.199> he<00:04:02.409> really<00:04:02.829> held<00:04:03.040> his<00:04:03.129> boxing

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
mistakes but he really held his boxing

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.520 
mistakes but he really held his boxing
together<00:04:03.639> the<00:04:04.569> structure<00:04:05.019> was<00:04:05.169> very<00:04:05.229> very

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
together the structure was very very

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.939 
together the structure was very very
good<00:04:05.650> compared<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.489> how<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.329> used<00:04:07.389> to<00:04:07.599> be<00:04:07.949> and

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
good compared to how it used to be and

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.280 
good compared to how it used to be and
you<00:04:09.370> got<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.639> win<00:04:09.790> can't<00:04:10.239> see<00:04:10.389> nothing<00:04:10.720> too

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
you got the win can't see nothing too

Khan's<00:04:18.009> body<00:04:18.310> shots<00:04:18.579> this<00:04:19.180> is<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.479> second

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
Khan's body shots this is the second

time now he's dropped a tough guy with
body<00:04:21.579> shot<00:04:21.820> so<00:04:22.029> corn<00:04:22.570> seems<00:04:22.779> to<00:04:22.900> be<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.020> better

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
body shot so corn seems to be a better

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.409 
body shot so corn seems to be a better
puncher<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.800> body<00:04:24.039> then<00:04:24.820> he<00:04:25.060> is<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.330> the

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
puncher to the body then he is to the

do you think he could you know mix it

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.920 
do you think he could you know mix it
with<00:04:34.120> at<00:04:34.569> the<00:04:34.770> 147<00:04:35.770> pound<00:04:36.009> in<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.849> 147<00:04:37.780> pound

with at the 147 pound in the 147 pound
weight<00:04:38.080> division<00:04:38.500> how<00:04:39.039> do<00:04:39.160> you<00:04:39.250> think<00:04:39.370> he

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
weight division how do you think he

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.279 
weight division how do you think he
would<00:04:39.610> do<00:04:39.699> against<00:04:39.970> Floyd<00:04:40.180> I<00:04:40.419> mean<00:04:40.569> the<00:04:41.050> Floyd

Maidana fight ain't happened yet so I

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.580 
Maidana fight ain't happened yet so I
might<00:04:43.539> be<00:04:43.660> talking<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:44.020> bit<00:04:44.139> premature<00:04:44.349> but

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
might be talking a bit premature but

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.860 
might be talking a bit premature but
