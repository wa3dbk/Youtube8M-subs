00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
of killing spree by one second killing

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.050

spree does seven attacks over four
seconds<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.709> i<00:02:39.709> think<00:02:40.220> this<00:02:40.370> extra<00:02:40.880> second

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
seconds and i think this extra second

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.500 
seconds and i think this extra second
adds<00:02:41.510> two<00:02:42.380> additional<00:02:42.950> attacks<00:02:43.310> per<00:02:44.239> weapon

adds two additional attacks per weapon
so<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.410> total<00:02:45.829> of<00:02:46.040> four<00:02:46.340> additional<00:02:46.730> strikes

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
so a total of four additional strikes

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.840 
so a total of four additional strikes
that<00:02:47.870> extra<00:02:47.900> second<00:02:48.560> makes<00:02:49.190> killing<00:02:49.670> spree
