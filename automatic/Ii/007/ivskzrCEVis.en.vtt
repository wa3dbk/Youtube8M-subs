just<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:01.750> been<00:03:01.930> involved<00:03:02.170> in<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.680> many<00:03:02.799> more

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
just have been involved in so many more

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.039 
just have been involved in so many more
traditional<00:03:03.670> theatrical<00:03:04.239> productions<00:03:04.750> but

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
traditional theatrical productions but

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.080 
traditional theatrical productions but
they're<00:03:05.560> unusual<00:03:06.340> how<00:03:06.549> they're<00:03:06.730> put<00:03:06.970> together

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
they're unusual how they're put together

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.170 
they're unusual how they're put together
I<00:03:07.360> mean<00:03:07.660> as<00:03:07.780> opposed<00:03:08.079> to<00:03:08.200> just<00:03:08.349> being<00:03:08.470> written

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
I mean as opposed to just being written

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.900 
I mean as opposed to just being written
by<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.209> single<00:03:10.900> person<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.650> then<00:03:11.889> put<00:03:12.760> through

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
by a single person and then put through

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.150 
by a single person and then put through
the<00:03:13.060> process<00:03:13.569> of<00:03:13.750> casting<00:03:14.019> can<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:14.829> tell<00:03:15.010> us<00:03:15.040> a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
the process of casting can you tell us a

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.530 
the process of casting can you tell us a
little<00:03:15.250> bit<00:03:15.400> more<00:03:15.579> about<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.000> process<00:03:16.510> that

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
little bit more about the process that

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.840 
little bit more about the process that
leads<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.889> creation<00:03:18.100> of<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.489> vaudeville

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
leads to the creation of a vaudeville

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.759 
leads to the creation of a vaudeville
show

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
show

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.220 
show
well<00:03:20.769> I<00:03:21.130> always<00:03:21.790> start<00:03:22.060> with<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.209> story<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.989> I

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
well I always start with a story that I

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.170 
well I always start with a story that I
write<00:03:24.359> scene<00:03:25.359> by<00:03:25.540> scene<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.200> then<00:03:26.769> I<00:03:27.180> assign

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
write scene by scene and then I assign

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.129 
write scene by scene and then I assign
each<00:03:28.510> scene<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:30.100> musician<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.139> the

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
each scene to a musician and the

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.000 
each scene to a musician and the
musician<00:03:33.030> writes<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.180> song<00:03:34.389> for<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:34.780> scene<00:03:35.139> so

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
musician writes a song for that scene so

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.039 
musician writes a song for that scene so
it's<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.340> bit<00:03:36.489> of<00:03:36.639> an<00:03:36.790> operetta<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.750> light

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
it's a bit of an operetta a light

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.620 
it's a bit of an operetta a light
operetta<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.810> then<00:03:40.810> in<00:03:41.109> each<00:03:41.230> scene<00:03:41.769> I

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
operetta and then in each scene I

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.830 
operetta and then in each scene I
choreograph<00:03:44.940> all<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:46.739> dancers<00:03:48.569> so<00:03:49.569> that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
choreograph all of the dancers so that

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.160 
choreograph all of the dancers so that
it's<00:03:50.200> each<00:03:50.950> scene<00:03:51.280> has<00:03:51.519> a<00:03:51.549> sort<00:03:51.940> of<00:03:52.030> flow<00:03:52.540> that

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
it's each scene has a sort of flow that

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.809 
it's each scene has a sort of flow that
the<00:03:53.319> audience<00:03:53.739> can<00:03:54.099> watch<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:55.380> understand

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
the audience can watch and understand

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.449 
the audience can watch and understand
through<00:03:57.819> dance<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.650> closest<00:04:00.069> thing<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.280> a

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
through dance but the closest thing to a

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.430 
through dance but the closest thing to a
script<00:04:00.970> in<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.209> traditional<00:04:01.690> sense<00:04:01.930> is<00:04:02.200> really

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
script in a traditional sense is really

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.670 
script in a traditional sense is really
just<00:04:02.680> these<00:04:02.829> songs<00:04:03.220> isn't<00:04:03.639> it<00:04:03.790> it's<00:04:04.150> just

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
just these songs isn't it it's just

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.539 
just these songs isn't it it's just
everything<00:04:05.680> is<00:04:05.799> told<00:04:06.069> through<00:04:06.220> song<00:04:06.519> and

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
everything is told through song and

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.409 
everything is told through song and
riddle<00:04:07.739> yeah<00:04:08.769> but<00:04:09.370> all<00:04:09.489> told<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.849> match<00:04:10.150> a

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
riddle yeah but all told to match a

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.559 
riddle yeah but all told to match a
story<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:11.430> initially<00:04:12.430> is<00:04:12.609> conceived<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.359> by

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
story that initially is conceived of by

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.449 
story that initially is conceived of by
you<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:14.079> then<00:04:14.200> once<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.620> songs<00:04:14.859> are<00:04:15.099> done<00:04:15.250> you

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
you and then once the songs are done you

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.039 
you and then once the songs are done you

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
also had one that sort of weaves them

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.610 
also had one that sort of weaves them
all<00:04:17.200> into<00:04:17.409> the<00:04:17.620> show<00:04:17.859> with<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.400> dance<00:04:18.640> and<00:04:19.030> the

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
all into the show with the dance and the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.680 
all into the show with the dance and the
cool<00:04:20.620> this<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.250> a<00:04:21.340> very<00:04:21.549> unusual<00:04:21.880> approach

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
cool this is a very unusual approach

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.240 
cool this is a very unusual approach
it's<00:04:23.020> not<00:04:23.229> really<00:04:23.590> how<00:04:23.740> things<00:04:24.009> are<00:04:24.160> usually

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
it's not really how things are usually

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.029 
it's not really how things are usually
done<00:04:24.669> I<00:04:24.880> think<00:04:25.240> that<00:04:25.630> people<00:04:26.470> who<00:04:26.710> have<00:04:26.800> spoken

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
done I think that people who have spoken

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.749 
done I think that people who have spoken
to<00:04:27.430> have<00:04:28.210> compared<00:04:28.720> your<00:04:28.870> work<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.949> lot<00:04:30.580> of

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
to have compared your work to a lot of

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.430 
to have compared your work to a lot of
more<00:04:31.090> sort<00:04:31.569> of<00:04:31.660> high-minded

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
more sort of high-minded

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.150 
more sort of high-minded
stuff<00:04:32.889> like<00:04:33.539> Robert<00:04:34.539> Wilson<00:04:34.750> or<00:04:35.319> like<00:04:35.740> old

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
stuff like Robert Wilson or like old

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.249 
stuff like Robert Wilson or like old
Berthold<00:04:36.910> Brecht<00:04:36.970> theatre<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:37.870> things<00:04:38.080> like

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
Berthold Brecht theatre and things like

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.790
