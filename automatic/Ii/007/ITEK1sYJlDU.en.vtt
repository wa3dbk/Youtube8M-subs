00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.529 
frost but I'm a little worried about
this<00:01:51.009> in<00:01:51.189> this<00:01:51.310> new<00:01:51.490> kid<00:01:51.700> on<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.819> block<00:01:51.909> Hudson

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
this in this new kid on the block Hudson

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:53.910 
this in this new kid on the block Hudson
I<00:01:52.630> hear<00:01:52.840> his<00:01:52.929> power-to-weight<00:01:53.259> ratios

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
I hear his power-to-weight ratios

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:14.640 
I hear his power-to-weight ratios
phenomenal<00:01:55.079> against<00:01:56.079> you<00:01:56.819> know<00:01:58.590> okay

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.220 

so<00:02:15.970> these<00:02:16.970> are<00:02:17.030> those<00:02:17.299> impressive<00:02:17.870> drag

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
so these are those impressive drag

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.080 
so these are those impressive drag
numbers<00:02:18.560> I've<00:02:18.709> ever<00:02:18.890> seen<00:02:19.129> I'll<00:02:19.700> never<00:02:19.849> seen

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
numbers I've ever seen I'll never seen

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.550 
numbers I've ever seen I'll never seen
by<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.299> drag<00:02:20.569> this<00:02:20.720> one<00:02:20.959> would<00:02:21.110> power<00:02:21.319> that

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
by the drag this one would power that

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.369 
by the drag this one would power that
high<00:02:21.769> really<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:23.150> got<00:02:23.329> the<00:02:23.450> best<00:02:23.629> power<00:02:23.959> drag

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
high really you got the best power drag

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.160 
high really you got the best power drag
ratio<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:25.040> when<00:02:25.280> we<00:02:25.310> test<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:25.819> here<00:02:25.879> I<00:02:26.209> think

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
ratio in when we test it here I think

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.420 
ratio in when we test it here I think
it's<00:02:27.290> because<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.590> can<00:02:27.709> get<00:02:27.799> so<00:02:27.950> low<00:02:28.129> on<00:02:28.159> the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
it's because you can get so low on the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.390 
it's because you can get so low on the
bike<00:02:28.610> no<00:02:28.909> one<00:02:29.060> else<00:02:29.180> gets<00:02:29.329> down<00:02:29.569> but<00:02:30.400> keep

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
bike no one else gets down but keep

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.880 
bike no one else gets down but keep
working<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:31.849> that<00:02:31.879> position<00:02:32.209> oh<00:02:32.620> how<00:02:33.620> does<00:02:33.769> he

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890
