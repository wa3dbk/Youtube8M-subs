command that starts with get age and

of the list and if I just type the gate
for<00:02:13.370> example<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.940> could<00:02:14.450> see<00:02:14.629> every<00:02:15.200> single

could<00:04:29.150> be<00:04:29.270> working<00:04:29.450> on<00:04:29.690> more<00:04:29.930> than<00:04:30.020> one<00:04:30.170> script

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
could be working on more than one script

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.080 
could be working on more than one script
at<00:04:30.560> once<00:04:30.800> or<00:04:31.070> more<00:04:31.250> than<00:04:31.370> one<00:04:31.490> version<00:04:31.700> of<00:04:31.970> a

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
at once or more than one version of a

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.440 
at once or more than one version of a
script<00:04:32.920> simultaneously<00:04:33.920> and<00:04:34.130> just<00:04:34.820> click

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
script simultaneously and just click

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.910 
script simultaneously and just click
back<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:35.720> forth<00:04:35.930> between<00:04:36.230> them<00:04:38.290> but<00:04:39.290> I<00:04:39.440> think

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
back and forth between them but I think

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.920 
back and forth between them but I think
the<00:04:40.340> best<00:04:40.580> new<00:04:40.790> feature<00:04:41.060> is<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.540> debugger

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
the best new feature is the debugger

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.650 
the best new feature is the debugger
which<00:04:42.260> is<00:04:42.530> now<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.220> graphic<00:04:43.970> debugger<00:04:44.390> that<00:04:44.420> you

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
which is now a graphic debugger that you

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.170 
which is now a graphic debugger that you
can<00:04:44.810> access<00:04:45.230> here<00:04:45.290> I<00:04:45.770> can<00:04:46.610> set<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:46.880> breakpoint

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
can access here I can set a breakpoint

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.540 
can access here I can set a breakpoint
I'm<00:04:48.080> going<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.470> select<00:04:48.650> this<00:04:49.010> line<00:04:49.250> right<00:04:49.490> here

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
I'm going to select this line right here

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.660 
I'm going to select this line right here
and<00:04:50.030> I<00:04:50.570> can<00:04:50.720> either<00:04:50.840> press<00:04:51.080> f9<00:04:51.470> or<00:04:51.950> I<00:04:52.370> can

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
and I can either press f9 or I can

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.370 
and I can either press f9 or I can
right-click<00:04:52.910> and<00:04:53.180> click<00:04:53.480> toggle<00:04:53.900> breakpoint

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
right-click and click toggle breakpoint

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.340 
right-click and click toggle breakpoint
and<00:04:54.890> that's<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.640> toggle<00:04:55.940> so<00:04:56.540> I<00:04:56.570> can<00:04:56.840> turn<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.110> off

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
and that's a toggle so I can turn it off

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.200 
and that's a toggle so I can turn it off
and<00:04:57.710> on<00:04:57.980> now<00:05:00.130> when<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.160> run<00:05:01.400> again<00:05:01.790> I'm<00:05:02.000> going<00:05:02.150> to

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
and on now when I run again I'm going to

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.000 
and on now when I run again I'm going to
press<00:05:02.420> f5<00:05:04.630> execution<00:05:05.630> starts<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.260> it<00:05:06.680> stops

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
press f5 execution starts and it stops

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.040 
press f5 execution starts and it stops
when<00:05:07.670> it<00:05:07.700> hits<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.120> breakpoint<00:05:08.570> just<00:05:08.780> before

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
when it hits the breakpoint just before

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.870 
when it hits the breakpoint just before
it<00:05:09.140> executes<00:05:09.590> it<00:05:09.770> and<00:05:09.980> it<00:05:10.430> turns<00:05:10.670> it<00:05:10.850> yellow

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
it executes it and it turns it yellow

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.540 
it executes it and it turns it yellow
and<00:05:11.390> then<00:05:11.960> in<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.290> output<00:05:12.680> pane<00:05:12.950> I<00:05:12.979> can<00:05:13.310> see

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
and then in the output pane I can see

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.610 
and then in the output pane I can see
that<00:05:13.729> I'm<00:05:13.880> in<00:05:14.090> debug<00:05:14.479> mode<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:15.080> all

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
that I'm in debug mode and all

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.740 
that I'm in debug mode and all
so<00:05:15.710> down<00:05:15.889> here<00:05:16.250> in<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.520> command<00:05:16.820> line<00:05:16.940> I'm<00:05:17.449> in

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
so down here in the command line I'm in

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.840 
so down here in the command line I'm in
debug<00:05:18.080> mode<00:05:18.110> right<00:05:18.530> now<00:05:18.680> so<00:05:19.310> in<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:19.580> command

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
debug mode right now so in the command

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.090 
debug mode right now so in the command
line<00:05:20.060> if<00:05:20.419> I<00:05:20.570> wanted<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:20.930> view<00:05:21.290> the<00:05:21.500> contents<00:05:21.949> of

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
some variable I can just type it in and

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.460 
some variable I can just type it in and
it<00:05:25.639> shows<00:05:25.910> me<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.270> current<00:05:26.570> value<00:05:26.960> of<00:05:27.139> that

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
it shows me the current value of that

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.730 
it shows me the current value of that
variable<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:28.510> can<00:05:29.510> also<00:05:29.690> see<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.139> call<00:05:30.380> stack

can also single step through my code

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.900 
can also single step through my code
with<00:05:45.260> the<00:05:45.440> same<00:05:45.710> keys<00:05:46.070> that<00:05:46.370> I'd<00:05:46.490> use<00:05:46.729> in

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
involves a call to a function or

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.170 
involves a call to a function or

I<00:06:01.940> can<00:06:02.060> hit<00:06:02.389> f5<00:06:03.139> again<00:06:03.830> to<00:06:04.490> continue<00:06:04.699> running

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
I can hit f5 again to continue running

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.650 
I can hit f5 again to continue running
until<00:06:06.979> the<00:06:07.310> next<00:06:07.610> breakpoint<00:06:07.940> or<00:06:08.330> until<00:06:08.570> the

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
until the next breakpoint or until the

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.409 
until the next breakpoint or until the
end<00:06:08.870> so<00:06:09.470> I<00:06:09.500> hit<00:06:09.919> f5<00:06:10.250> just<00:06:10.580> then<00:06:10.789> and<00:06:11.030> it

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
end so I hit f5 just then and it

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.629 
end so I hit f5 just then and it
continued<00:06:11.900> running<00:06:12.110> and<00:06:12.440> gave<00:06:12.919> me<00:06:13.070> my<00:06:13.220> output

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
continued running and gave me my output

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.659 
continued running and gave me my output
so<00:06:14.630> you<00:06:15.080> get<00:06:15.260> pretty<00:06:15.500> much<00:06:15.590> all<00:06:15.979> the<00:06:16.280> basic

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
so you get pretty much all the basic

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.760 
so you get pretty much all the basic
functionality<00:06:17.180> of<00:06:17.660> a<00:06:17.780> nice<00:06:18.020> debugger<00:06:18.530> for

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
functionality of a nice debugger for

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.800 
functionality of a nice debugger for
your<00:06:18.919> scripts<00:06:19.250> it's<00:06:19.760> a<00:06:19.880> very<00:06:20.210> nice<00:06:20.479> feature

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
your scripts it's a very nice feature

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.710 
your scripts it's a very nice feature
and<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:22.490> there<00:06:22.789> you've<00:06:22.940> seen<00:06:22.970> it<00:06:23.210> a<00:06:23.450> quick

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
and and there you've seen it a quick

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.469
