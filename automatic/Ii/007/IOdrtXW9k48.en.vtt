00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.719 
you try to extinguish a chip and fire
using<00:01:56.090> water<00:01:56.860> I'm<00:01:57.860> sure<00:01:58.189> you'll<00:01:58.399> agree<00:01:58.490> that

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
using water I'm sure you'll agree that

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.910 
using water I'm sure you'll agree that
that<00:01:59.090> was<00:01:59.270> not<00:01:59.299> very<00:01:59.600> successful<00:01:59.750> in<00:02:00.470> fact

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
that was not very successful in fact

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.520 
that was not very successful in fact
positively<00:02:01.819> dangerous<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.539> you<00:02:03.140> can<00:02:03.319> imagine

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
positively dangerous and you can imagine

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.469 
positively dangerous and you can imagine
the<00:02:03.860> effect<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.340> would<00:02:04.459> have<00:02:04.520> in<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:04.970> small<00:02:05.270> room
