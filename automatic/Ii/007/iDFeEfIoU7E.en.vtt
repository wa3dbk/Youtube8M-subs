00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.099
 welcome italian dose welcome 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.120
 my kitchen 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.940
 We're going to give a boost today. 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.920
 in those helinho to talk to people snake in 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:23.340
 around knowing complete with jesus arrives 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:39.980
 the company also super different 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:39.980
 Come on, I do not even know how he is. 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.530
 Now, who said it right, even the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.379
 sides 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.219
 they will stay the way it is crafted 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.890
 135 degrees 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.489
 now we're going to seal the chicken that goes 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.800
 after finishing cooking in the forum 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:08.400
 here we use peanut oil 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:12.470
 but if you want we will not lose 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.330
 juice if you continue but I would go and have a look 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.930
 to seal well when you put the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.520
 chicken 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.520
 it fit 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.590
 After you finish there, you put in the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.960
 Towel paper because it's supposed to be good. 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.800
 take all that excess of 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.400
 fat 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.710
 then we will totally roll in the 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.150
 clipboards 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:44.780
 so you can not make accounts first 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:48.170
 placed on the tip and then you go 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.330
 scroll horizontally and where they end 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.220
 just before finishing what already begins 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.880
 the other 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.990
 Look here, people put it a little bit. 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.830
 Wool and follow it here it will stay 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.130
 for letting the peace follow the drawing board 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.710
 besides giving a chicken flavor will help 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.700
 he does not stay dry gets wet 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.420
 inside and we are one more pass 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.420

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.769

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.769
 20 minutes until cooked 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:45.910
 while the chicken in the picture we already 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.010
 go preparing the salad 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.980
 Let's start with the orange 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.060
 it has to be totally shelled and 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.730
 without foot 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.070
 we get so my zone looks 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.740
 How beautiful is the orange flame in Tarouco? 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.940
 see mean is wonderful 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:09.300
 we start by taking the two covers and 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:14.080
 now we're cutting like this 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.150

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.230

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.260
 I think I'm really in love with this 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.690
 orange does not open 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.430
 is a juice made with her that is well 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.410
 red is wonderful 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.510
 Now we'll leave you resting for 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.690
 15 minutes because if we put 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.480

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.400

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.290

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.690
 It's already in the pan 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.620
 now we will put the wine and 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.730
 let it evaporate 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.730
 Look at her there. 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.940

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.980

 Do you like 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.910

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:08.910
 Look, this old house was super 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:13.460
 tasty and the taste of ccab with crispy 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:16.979
 from the fresh clipboard on the salad 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:20.849
 simplicity that orange candy 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.800
 it all became so the marquesa flavors 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.650
 So wonderful, I think you'll have to 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.940
 quality that focus on grilled chicken 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.099

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.789
