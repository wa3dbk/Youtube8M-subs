6.0 like I said I switched a couple of
things<00:01:46.829> around<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.430> gonna<00:01:47.520> be<00:01:47.670> off<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
things around so it's gonna be off a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.480 
things around so it's gonna be off a
little<00:01:48.060> bit<00:01:48.619> but<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.950> little<00:01:50.159> walk<00:01:50.460> around

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
little bit but just a little walk around

pretty<00:02:04.500> easy<00:02:04.650> pretty<00:02:05.580> easy<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.940> go<00:02:06.229> but

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
pretty easy pretty easy to go but

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.350 
pretty easy pretty easy to go but
definitely<00:02:08.130> use<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.819> see<00:02:08.970> me<00:02:09.119> gold

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
definitely use this to see me gold

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.820 
definitely use this to see me gold
instead<00:02:09.990> of<00:02:10.080> switching<00:02:10.380> back<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.679> forth

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
instead of switching back and forth

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.190 
instead of switching back and forth
trying<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.250> find<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.520> perfect<00:02:11.760> balance<00:02:12.200> so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
trying to find that perfect balance so

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.750 
trying to find that perfect balance so
basically<00:02:13.500> what<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.709> do<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.580> pick

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
basically what I do you can pick

whatever respect you want to be I real

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.820 
whatever respect you want to be I real
frost<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.400> I'm<00:02:17.459> gonna<00:02:17.580> pick<00:02:17.730> cross<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.830> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
frost so I'm gonna pick cross and the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.590 
frost so I'm gonna pick cross and the
PvP<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.670> what<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.180> do

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
PvP is what I do

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.290 
PvP is what I do
so<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:21.900> fake<00:02:22.050> target<00:02:22.380> level<00:02:22.620> PvP<00:02:23.040> now<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
so just fake target level PvP now the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.420 
so just fake target level PvP now the
step<00:02:24.510> for<00:02:24.840> D<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.500> little<00:02:25.800> bit<00:02:25.920> different<00:02:26.310> in

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
step for D is a little bit different in

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.760 
step for D is a little bit different in
this<00:02:26.640> than<00:02:26.820> most<00:02:27.090> stuff<00:02:27.360> now<00:02:28.080> definitely<00:02:28.620> have

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
this than most stuff now definitely have

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.910 
this than most stuff now definitely have
hit<00:02:28.950> at<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.160> top<00:02:29.340> got<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.090> 2040

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
hit at the top got to have it to 2040

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.020 
hit at the top got to have it to 2040
but<00:02:31.920> sometimes<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.550> know<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.880> want<00:02:33.000> to

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
but sometimes you know you want to

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.030 
but sometimes you know you want to
switch<00:02:33.300> off<00:02:33.510> if<00:02:33.720> you're<00:02:33.840> playing<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.290> frost

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
switch off if you're playing a frost

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.920 
switch off if you're playing a frost
mage<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.459> you're<00:02:35.580> using<00:02:35.790> another<00:02:36.330> tempest

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
mage and you're using another tempest

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.090 
mage and you're using another tempest
over<00:02:37.260> across<00:02:37.500> bottom

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
over across bottom

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.860 
over across bottom
haste<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:38.880> probably<00:02:39.150> better<00:02:39.330> for<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.720> you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
haste is probably better for you you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.290 
haste is probably better for you you
know<00:02:40.050> hit<00:02:40.290> more<00:02:40.500> make<00:02:40.890> more<00:02:41.010> often<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:42.000> if<00:02:42.180> you

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
know hit more make more often but if you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.759 
know hit more make more often but if you
wanted<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.570> go<00:02:42.810> for<00:02:42.959> like<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.200> shatters<00:02:43.560> and

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
wanted to go for like the shatters and

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.620 
wanted to go for like the shatters and
stuff<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.700> know<00:02:44.790> I'd<00:02:44.910> switch<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.269> up<00:02:45.360> I

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
stuff you know I'd switch it up I

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.830 
stuff you know I'd switch it up I
personally<00:02:46.440> don't<00:02:46.650> use<00:02:46.769> this<00:02:47.420> stat<00:02:48.420> priority

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
personally don't use this stat priority

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.800 
personally don't use this stat priority
I<00:02:48.870> use<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.320> go<00:02:49.500> intellect<00:02:50.489> crit<00:02:50.850> haste<00:02:51.180> mastery

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
I use I go intellect crit haste mastery

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.740 
I use I go intellect crit haste mastery
so<00:02:52.470> I'm<00:02:52.530> gonna<00:02:52.620> move<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:53.070> up<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.700> bit<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.660> know

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
so I'm gonna move this up a bit you know

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.360 
so I'm gonna move this up a bit you know
to<00:02:54.810> pick<00:02:55.050> up<00:02:55.170> how<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.290> want<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.800> presets<00:02:56.250> are

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
to pick up how you want the presets are

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.560 
to pick up how you want the presets are
pretty<00:02:56.550> good<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.030> know<00:02:57.209> if<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.390> want<00:02:57.540> to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
pretty good but you know if you want to

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.540 
pretty good but you know if you want to
make<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.019> couple<00:02:58.260> changes<00:02:58.380> obviously<00:02:59.070> up<00:02:59.430> to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
make a couple changes obviously up to

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.199 
make a couple changes obviously up to
you<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:01.680> yeah<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.340> actually<00:03:03.000> I'm<00:03:03.090> gonna

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
you and so yeah and actually I'm gonna

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.100 
you and so yeah and actually I'm gonna
move<00:03:03.450> faster<00:03:03.930> down<00:03:05.360> no<00:03:06.360> I'm<00:03:06.630> keeping<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.989> there

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
move faster down no I'm keeping it there

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.479 
move faster down no I'm keeping it there
I<00:03:07.350> think<00:03:07.470> that's<00:03:07.650> how<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:07.829> usually<00:03:08.010> use<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.400> I

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
I think that's how I usually use it I

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.949 
I think that's how I usually use it I
just<00:03:08.549> reset<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.090> add-on<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:09.510> it's<00:03:09.630> gonna<00:03:09.780> hop

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
just reset the add-on so it's gonna hop

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.470 
just reset the add-on so it's gonna hop
but<00:03:10.890> anyway<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.160> did<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.730> set<00:03:11.880> up<00:03:12.000> how<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.269> want

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
but anyway so did it set up how you want

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.420 
but anyway so did it set up how you want
just<00:03:12.780> make<00:03:12.900> sure<00:03:13.079> hits<00:03:13.230> on<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.470> top<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.280> all

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
just make sure hits on the top and all

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.000 
just make sure hits on the top and all
you<00:03:14.489> got<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.730> do<00:03:14.820> is<00:03:14.970> hit<00:03:15.120> calculate<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:16.010> it

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
you got to do is hit calculate and it

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.410 
you got to do is hit calculate and it
will<00:03:17.190> bring<00:03:17.370> everything<00:03:17.670> up<00:03:17.910> for<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.329> you

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
will bring everything up for you so you

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.330 
will bring everything up for you so you
you<00:03:19.019> calculate<00:03:19.470> everything<00:03:19.709> exactly<00:03:20.130> how

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
you calculate everything exactly how

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.530 
you calculate everything exactly how
they<00:03:20.579> want<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.850> put<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.090> for<00:03:21.239> you

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
they want to put it for you

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.630 
they want to put it for you
you're<00:03:21.900> gonna<00:03:21.989> hit<00:03:22.140> show<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:23.280> shows<00:03:23.489> you

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
you're gonna hit show and it shows you

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.880 
you're gonna hit show and it shows you
what<00:03:23.670> it's<00:03:24.000> going<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.269> do<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:25.350> change<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.739> so

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
what it's going to do to change it so

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.310 
what it's going to do to change it so
the<00:03:26.010> helmet<00:03:26.220> we're<00:03:26.579> gonna<00:03:26.700> take<00:03:26.940> off<00:03:27.320> 230

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
the helmet we're gonna take off 230

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.960 
the helmet we're gonna take off 230
mastery<00:03:28.829> we're<00:03:29.340> gonna<00:03:29.519> switch<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.730> over<00:03:29.850> to

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
mastery we're gonna switch it over to

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.729 
mastery we're gonna switch it over to
hit<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.450> we're<00:03:30.600> getting<00:03:30.810> our<00:03:30.989> hit<00:03:31.230> rating<00:03:31.530> for

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
hit so we're getting our hit rating for

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.140 
hit so we're getting our hit rating for
sure<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.220> then<00:03:32.310> it<00:03:32.400> goes<00:03:32.579> for<00:03:32.760> your<00:03:32.880> next

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
sure and then it goes for your next

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.509 
sure and then it goes for your next
priority<00:03:33.570> so<00:03:34.320> it's<00:03:34.410> gonna<00:03:34.530> get<00:03:34.709> hit<00:03:34.920> no<00:03:35.190> matter

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
priority so it's gonna get hit no matter

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.520 
priority so it's gonna get hit no matter
what<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.180> then<00:03:36.390> after<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.019> it's<00:03:37.200> gonna<00:03:37.260> go

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
what and then after that it's gonna go

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.160 
what and then after that it's gonna go
for<00:03:37.739> crit<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.579> if<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.820> can't<00:03:39.030> get<00:03:39.180> it'll<00:03:39.989> get<00:03:40.079> as

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
for crit and if I can't get it'll get as

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.660 
for crit and if I can't get it'll get as
much<00:03:40.290> as<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.590> can<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:40.769> then<00:03:41.040> once<00:03:41.310> that's<00:03:41.519> over

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
much as it can and then once that's over

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.160 
much as it can and then once that's over
to<00:03:41.970> go<00:03:42.060> for<00:03:42.239> masteries<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:42.720> I'll<00:03:42.900> go<00:03:42.989> for

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
to go for masteries and I'll go for

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.430 
to go for masteries and I'll go for

bring<00:04:46.130> up<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.400> hit<00:04:46.550> a<00:04:46.580> little<00:04:46.850> bit<00:04:47.320> I'm<00:04:48.320> pretty

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
bring up the hit a little bit I'm pretty

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.860 
bring up the hit a little bit I'm pretty
close<00:04:48.740> so<00:04:48.770> it's<00:04:48.980> not<00:04:49.070> gonna<00:04:49.250> do<00:04:49.340> two<00:04:49.520> too<00:04:49.669> much

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
close so it's not gonna do two too much

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.120 
close so it's not gonna do two too much
there's<00:04:50.870> additional<00:04:51.320> settings<00:04:51.830> here<00:04:51.950> you

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
there's additional settings here you

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.500 
there's additional settings here you
really<00:04:52.340> don't<00:04:52.520> have<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:52.640> screw<00:04:52.940> these<00:04:53.150> this<00:04:53.390> is

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
really don't have to screw these this is

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.930 
really don't have to screw these this is
just<00:04:53.660> more<00:04:53.900> like<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.200> cosmetics<00:04:54.800> of<00:04:54.950> it<00:04:55.100> and

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
just more like the cosmetics of it and

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.090 
just more like the cosmetics of it and
you<00:04:56.270> know<00:04:56.360> how<00:04:56.480> it<00:04:56.570> works<00:04:56.860> so<00:04:57.860> don't<00:04:58.010> really

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
you know how it works so don't really

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.460 
you know how it works so don't really
worry<00:04:58.250> about<00:04:58.280> that<00:04:58.460> but<00:04:59.140> basically<00:05:00.140> once<00:05:00.380> this

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
worry about that but basically once this

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.020 
worry about that but basically once this
window<00:05:00.770> is<00:05:00.830> open<00:05:01.130> you're<00:05:01.370> good<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.610> go<00:05:01.640> go

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
window is open you're good to go go

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.750 
window is open you're good to go go
ahead<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:02.300> hit<00:05:02.419> reforge<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:04.310> it<00:05:04.400> does<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:04.610> all

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
ahead and hit reforge and it does it all

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.040 
ahead and hit reforge and it does it all
by<00:05:04.940> itself<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.360> don't<00:05:05.480> have<00:05:05.660> to<00:05:05.750> be<00:05:05.840> touching

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
by itself you don't have to be touching

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.710 
by itself you don't have to be touching
this<00:05:06.230> at<00:05:06.470> all<00:05:06.650> does<00:05:07.370> it<00:05:07.400> all<00:05:07.669> by<00:05:07.850> itself<00:05:08.120> and

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
this at all does it all by itself and

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.050 
this at all does it all by itself and
should<00:05:09.530> be<00:05:09.740> done<00:05:10.040> so<00:05:10.640> we'll<00:05:10.760> just<00:05:10.850> do<00:05:10.970> it

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
should be done so we'll just do it

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.760 
should be done so we'll just do it
calculate<00:05:11.870> one<00:05:11.990> more<00:05:12.169> time<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.500> make<00:05:12.650> sure

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
calculate one more time to make sure

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.920 
calculate one more time to make sure
everything<00:05:13.160> is<00:05:13.310> good<00:05:13.490> to<00:05:13.550> go<00:05:13.669> and<00:05:14.150> everything

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
everything is good to go and everything

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.930 
everything is good to go and everything

says no reforge everything has

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.700 
says no reforge everything has
checkmarks<00:05:17.480> that<00:05:17.690> means<00:05:17.900> it's<00:05:18.050> awesome<00:05:18.530> and

checking your stat party for this look

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.719 
checking your stat party for this look
at<00:05:24.169> the<00:05:24.260> gear<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:24.800> everything<00:05:25.010> hasn't<00:05:25.520> been

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
at the gear and everything hasn't been

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.300 
at the gear and everything hasn't been
swapped<00:05:26.030> back<00:05:26.210> I<00:05:26.510> was<00:05:26.720> supposed<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.140> be<00:05:27.320> there

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
swapped back I was supposed to be there

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.340 
swapped back I was supposed to be there
everything<00:05:29.240> is<00:05:29.330> back<00:05:29.660> how<00:05:29.840> it's<00:05:29.990> supposed<00:05:30.260> to

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
everything is back how it's supposed to

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.300 
everything is back how it's supposed to
be<00:05:30.820> if<00:05:31.820> you<00:05:31.970> went<00:05:32.090> and<00:05:32.300> swapped<00:05:32.600> that<00:05:32.780> had<00:05:32.990> this

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
be if you went and swapped that had this

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.180 
be if you went and swapped that had this
reforged<00:05:34.310> over<00:05:34.580> which<00:05:34.790> it<00:05:34.970> took<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.270> off<00:05:36.100> if<00:05:37.100> I

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
reforged over which it took it off if I

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.290 
reforged over which it took it off if I
could<00:05:37.340> off<00:05:37.460> of<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.669> weapon<00:05:38.000> because

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
could off of the weapon because

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.940 
could off of the weapon because
obviously<00:05:38.540> you<00:05:39.080> think<00:05:39.260> that<00:05:39.380> was<00:05:39.500> necessary

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
obviously you think that was necessary

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.219 
obviously you think that was necessary
or<00:05:40.040> whatever<00:05:40.250> I<00:05:40.340> was<00:05:40.460> doing<00:05:40.810> but<00:05:41.810> you<00:05:41.930> know<00:05:42.020> it

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
you over the hit rating it might do it

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.080 
you over the hit rating it might do it
like<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.080> point<00:05:51.380> one<00:05:51.650> or<00:05:51.680> point<00:05:51.890> two<00:05:52.310> but<00:05:52.970> it's

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
like the point one or point two but it's

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.730 
like the point one or point two but it's
doing<00:05:53.360> the<00:05:53.450> best<00:05:53.630> for<00:05:53.870> you<00:05:53.990> mine<00:05:54.260> just<00:05:54.500> so

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
doing the best for you mine just so

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.100 
doing the best for you mine just so
happens<00:05:55.040> to<00:05:55.130> be<00:05:55.220> six<00:05:55.580> even<00:05:56.000> so<00:05:56.690> obviously

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
happens to be six even so obviously

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.330 
happens to be six even so obviously
there's<00:05:57.289> a<00:05:57.320> really<00:05:57.560> really<00:05:57.590> good<00:05:57.919> job<00:05:57.950> which

on top of this if you guys want to as a
mage<00:06:05.600> I<00:06:05.960> think<00:06:06.229> what<00:06:06.410> is<00:06:06.560> the<00:06:06.940> crit<00:06:07.940> cap

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
mage I think what is the crit cap

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.560 
mage I think what is the crit cap
something<00:06:08.720> like<00:06:08.930> oh<00:06:09.350> gee

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
something like oh gee

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.440 
something like oh gee
from<00:06:11.110> like<00:06:11.730> 22<00:06:12.730> or<00:06:12.760> something<00:06:13.150> like<00:06:13.210> that<00:06:13.300> I

can't remember offhand but you can bring

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.030 
can't remember offhand but you can bring
it<00:06:16.120> to<00:06:16.150> the<00:06:16.420> the<00:06:16.870> crit<00:06:17.110> soft<00:06:17.350> cap<00:06:17.590> and<00:06:17.860> then
