and right now I'm almost all the way in

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.450 
and right now I'm almost all the way in
to<00:00:53.100> prevent<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.850> tilt<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.260> try<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.800> change

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
could call it and I put it at the first

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.640 
could call it and I put it at the first
place<00:01:13.369> for<00:01:14.369> our<00:01:14.490> began<00:01:14.880> which<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.650> something

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
place for our began which is something

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.039 
place for our began which is something
that<00:01:16.979> would<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.430> would<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> play<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:18.450> but

it's just too annoying now because it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.539 
it's just too annoying now because it
tilts<00:01:23.100> even<00:01:23.509> easier<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:25.189> like<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.369> can

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
tilts even easier and like you can

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.609
