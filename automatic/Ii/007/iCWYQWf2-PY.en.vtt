that instead of having the Barbie on you
prefer<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.710> front<00:00:47.059> because<00:00:48.059> if

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
prefer to have it in front because if

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.520 
prefer to have it in front because if
it's<00:00:48.390> backwards<00:00:48.899> first<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.260> all<00:00:49.350> when<00:00:49.440> you

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it's backwards first of all when you

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.470 
it's backwards first of all when you
pick<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> stretch<00:00:51.270> your

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
pick it up you have to stretch your

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.510 
pick it up you have to stretch your
shoulders<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.170> really<00:00:52.410> hurt<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.340> when

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
shoulders and can really hurt and when

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.010 
shoulders and can really hurt and when
you<00:00:53.610> press<00:00:53.879> since<00:00:54.149> you're<00:00:54.270> pressing<00:00:54.510> slightly

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you press since you're pressing slightly

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.959 
you press since you're pressing slightly
backwards<00:00:55.469> sometimes<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.829> hit<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> pins<00:00:56.309> so

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
backwards sometimes you hit the pins so

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.119 
backwards sometimes you hit the pins so
here<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.690> adjust<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.170> proper<00:00:58.500> position<00:00:59.100> for

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
here just adjust the proper position for

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.420 
here just adjust the proper position for
you<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.940> pretty<00:01:00.649> easy<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.010> pick<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> up

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
you it's pretty easy just to pick it up

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.620 
you it's pretty easy just to pick it up
here<00:01:04.549> here<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.760> since<00:01:06.030> you're<00:01:06.180> pressing

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
here here so since you're pressing

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.990 
here here so since you're pressing
slightly<00:01:07.110> backwards<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.250> don't<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
slightly backwards you don't have to

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.440 
slightly backwards you don't have to
worry<00:01:09.119> about<00:01:09.210> hitting<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> pins<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.020> you're

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
worry about hitting the pins and you're

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.850 
worry about hitting the pins and you're
much<00:01:12.450> safer<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.260> we'll<00:01:13.409> do<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
much safer so what we'll do for that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.539 
much safer so what we'll do for that
movement<00:01:14.570> which<00:01:15.570> will<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.049> sets<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.470> three<00:01:17.430> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
movement which will do sets of three to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
movement which will do sets of three to
five<00:01:17.729> reps<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.150> start<00:01:18.390> with<00:01:18.570> five<00:01:18.810> we're<00:01:19.350> just

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
five reps so start with five we're just

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.800 
five reps so start with five we're just
on<00:01:19.950> weight<00:01:20.220> every<00:01:20.580> set<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.030> weight<00:01:21.270> every<00:01:21.600> set

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
on weight every set and weight every set

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
on weight every set and weight every set
until<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> maximum<00:01:22.950> weekend<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.490> five

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
until in the maximum weekend for five

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.580 
until in the maximum weekend for five
reps<00:01:23.939> then<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.720> go<00:01:24.869> slightly<00:01:25.140> heavier

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
reps then we can go slightly heavier

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.920 
reps then we can go slightly heavier
doing<00:01:25.770> sets<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.130> three<00:01:26.340> reps<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:27.479> morning

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
doing sets of three reps this morning

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.649 
doing sets of three reps this morning
it's<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.240> performance<00:01:30.240> space<00:01:30.420> work

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
it's it's more on performance space work

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.200 
it's it's more on performance space work
out<00:01:30.840> lots<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.710> pricing<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.729> six

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
out lots of pricing we have I think six

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.539 
out lots of pricing we have I think six
different<00:01:33.570> pressing<00:01:33.900> movements<00:01:34.400> lots<00:01:35.400> of

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
different pressing movements lots of

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.520 
different pressing movements lots of
step<00:01:35.759> that's<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.210> very<00:01:36.390> weight<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.930> this

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
step that's a very weight and this

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.749 
step that's a very weight and this
actually<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.009> gonna<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.220> isolation

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
actually know it's gonna be isolation

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.640 
actually know it's gonna be isolation
work<00:01:38.970> mostly<00:01:39.450> superset<00:01:40.020> report<00:01:40.320> says<00:01:40.470> stuff

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
work mostly superset report says stuff

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.469 
work mostly superset report says stuff
like<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.829> always<00:01:41.729> prefer<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
like that always prefer to do the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.450 
like that always prefer to do the
isolation<00:01:43.049> work<00:01:43.229> after<00:01:43.829> heavy<00:01:43.979> pressing

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
isolation work after heavy pressing

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.399 
isolation work after heavy pressing
because<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> muscle<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.240> activated<00:01:45.869> nicer

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
because the muscle is activated nicer

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.859 
because the muscle is activated nicer
and<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.610> activate<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> mussel<00:01:48.750> bar

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
and then you can activate the mussel bar

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.480 
and then you can activate the mussel bar
so<00:01:49.530> we'll<00:01:49.680> start<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.130> will<00:01:50.220> start

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
so we'll start here it will start

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.880 
so we'll start here it will start

good<00:03:27.890> I've<00:03:28.280> just<00:03:28.490> seen<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:31.960> good<00:03:34.060> make<00:03:35.060> sure

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
good I've just seen it good make sure

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:49.470 
good I've just seen it good make sure
you<00:03:35.330> have<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.450> weight<00:03:35.630> of<00:03:35.690> every<00:03:36.020> step

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.490 

well<00:03:50.480> that's<00:03:50.600> because<00:03:50.900> first<00:03:51.290> of<00:03:51.380> all

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
well that's because first of all

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.040 
well that's because first of all
traditional<00:03:52.370> setup<00:03:52.670> you<00:03:53.450> have<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.720> pick<00:03:53.900> up

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
traditional setup you have to pick up

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.050 
traditional setup you have to pick up
the<00:03:54.200> bar<00:03:54.380> backwards<00:03:54.950> which<00:03:55.790> put<00:03:56.030> the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
the bar backwards which put the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.460 
the bar backwards which put the
shoulders<00:03:56.480> in<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:56.690> really<00:03:56.870> bad<00:03:57.110> position

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
shoulders in a really bad position

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.160 
shoulders in a really bad position
because<00:03:57.770> it<00:03:58.100> over<00:03:58.340> stretches<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.970> value<00:04:02.170> then

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
because it over stretches the value then

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.530 
because it over stretches the value then
the<00:04:03.200> second<00:04:03.530> reason<00:04:03.680> is<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:04.040> most

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
the second reason is that most

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.479 
the second reason is that most
traditional<00:04:05.540> shoulder<00:04:06.080> benches<00:04:06.560> are<00:04:06.739> 90

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
traditional shoulder benches are 90

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.390 
traditional shoulder benches are 90
degrees<00:04:08.080> 90<00:04:09.080> degrees<00:04:09.470> is<00:04:09.709> not<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.920> strong

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
degrees 90 degrees is not a strong

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.760 
degrees 90 degrees is not a strong
pressing<00:04:10.880> position<00:04:11.300> it's<00:04:12.050> almost<00:04:12.410> impossible

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
pressing position it's almost impossible

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.170 
pressing position it's almost impossible
to<00:04:13.190> get<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.430> bar<00:04:13.610> in<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.730> proper<00:04:14.060> position

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
to get the bar in the proper position

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.830 
to get the bar in the proper position
and<00:04:14.600> press<00:04:15.050> that<00:04:16.540> because<00:04:17.540> since<00:04:17.720> you're

and press that because since you're

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.920 
and press that because since you're
already<00:04:17.959> 90<00:04:18.410> degrees<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:20.239> have<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.540> press

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
already 90 degrees you have to press

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.110 
already 90 degrees you have to press
slightly<00:04:21.320> forward<00:04:21.859> to<00:04:21.890> get<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.130> bar<00:04:22.280> off<00:04:22.460> here

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120

we're in a prep prep proper pressing

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.900 
we're in a prep prep proper pressing
groove<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.510> it's<00:04:27.169> high<00:04:27.800> enough<00:04:27.830> to<00:04:28.580> focus

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
groove and it's high enough to focus

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.960 
groove and it's high enough to focus
more<00:04:29.150> on<00:04:29.180> shoulders<00:04:29.800> but<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.950> slight<00:04:31.280> incline

more on shoulders but the slight incline

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.050 
more on shoulders but the slight incline
allows<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:33.050> use<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.230> bit<00:04:33.470> more<00:04:33.500> weight<00:04:34.060> so

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
allows you to use a bit more weight so

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.520 
allows you to use a bit more weight so
it's<00:04:35.180> better<00:04:35.360> for<00:04:35.570> overloading<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.200> shoulder

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
it's better for overloading the shoulder

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.170 
it's better for overloading the shoulder

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
yes I'm just trying to explain how weak

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.910 
yes I'm just trying to explain how weak
I<00:04:55.470> am<00:04:55.500> right<00:04:55.800> now<00:04:55.950> six<00:04:56.310> no<00:04:57.260> waste<00:04:58.260> unimportant

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
I am right now six no waste unimportant

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.030 
I am right now six no waste unimportant
what<00:04:59.640> it<00:04:59.760> is<00:04:59.910> but<00:05:00.320> only<00:05:01.320> with<00:05:01.470> proper<00:05:01.770> reform

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
what it is but only with proper reform

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.170 
what it is but only with proper reform
and<00:05:02.130> proper<00:05:02.400> technique<00:05:02.790> so<00:05:02.940> it's<00:05:03.060> not<00:05:03.120> the

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
and proper technique so it's not the

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:16.380 
and proper technique so it's not the
same<00:05:03.420> thing<00:05:03.450> as<00:05:03.660> a<00:05:03.720> machine<00:05:04.050> yeah

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.900 

good

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.050 

already<00:05:22.690> more<00:05:22.870> solid<00:05:23.490> is<00:05:24.490> it<00:05:24.640> the<00:05:24.730> nervous

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
already more solid is it the nervous

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.550 
already more solid is it the nervous
system<00:05:25.390> that's<00:05:25.540> taking<00:05:25.810> a<00:05:25.870> while<00:05:25.900> or<00:05:26.350> is<00:05:26.440> it

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
system that's taking a while or is it

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.410 
system that's taking a while or is it
like<00:05:26.590> smaller<00:05:27.040> muscle<00:05:27.460> groups<00:05:27.490> I<00:05:27.910> can<00:05:28.240> already

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
like smaller muscle groups I can already

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.870 
like smaller muscle groups I can already
see<00:05:28.870> that<00:05:29.160> compared<00:05:30.160> to<00:05:30.280> this<00:05:30.370> first<00:05:30.670> two

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
see that compared to this first two

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.390 
see that compared to this first two
shetty's<00:05:31.330> much<00:05:31.570> much<00:05:31.840> better<00:05:32.400> nobody

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
shetty's much much better nobody

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.520 
shetty's much much better nobody
adjusting<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.420> action<00:05:34.720> of<00:05:34.780> disguising

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
adjusting the action of disguising

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.510 
adjusting the action of disguising
muscles<00:05:35.950> with<00:05:36.700> the<00:05:36.820> strong<00:05:37.420> pressing<00:05:37.900> muscles

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.350 

so<00:05:42.520> yes<00:05:42.730> it<00:05:42.880> is<00:05:43.000> a<00:05:43.030> nervous<00:05:43.420> system<00:05:43.720> thing

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
so yes it is a nervous system thing

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.730 
so yes it is a nervous system thing
coordinate<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:46.480> action<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:47.020> smaller<00:05:47.560> and

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
coordinate the action of the smaller and

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:57.480 
coordinate the action of the smaller and
bigger<00:05:47.890> muscles<00:05:54.450> good<00:05:55.450> job<00:05:56.310> can<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.370> spot

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
bigger muscles good job can you spot

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
bigger muscles good job can you spot
