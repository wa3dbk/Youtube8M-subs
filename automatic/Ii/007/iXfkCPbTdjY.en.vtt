00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.760 

it'll<00:01:31.550> play<00:01:31.760> a<00:01:31.930> it'll<00:01:32.930> just<00:01:33.080> make<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.260> beat<00:01:33.560> and

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
it'll play a it'll just make a beat and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.730 
it'll play a it'll just make a beat and
flash<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:34.730> LED<00:01:35.290> for<00:01:36.290> a<00:01:36.320> hundred<00:01:36.650> milliseconds

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
flash the LED for a hundred milliseconds

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.210

if<00:01:39.740> it's<00:01:39.920> turning<00:01:40.250> any<00:01:40.400> other<00:01:40.550> direction<00:01:42.220> the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
if it's turning any other direction the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.660 
if it's turning any other direction the
next<00:01:43.490> step<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:45.170> determine<00:01:45.530> direction<00:01:46.010> and

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
next step is to determine direction and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.469 
next step is to determine direction and
make<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.210> do<00:01:47.300> something<00:01:47.360> useful<00:01:49.150> if<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.270> bring

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
make it do something useful if you bring

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.550 
make it do something useful if you bring

hard way it won't hurt the device but if

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.300 
hard way it won't hurt the device but if

your digital outs I'm going to speak

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.620 
your digital outs I'm going to speak
around<00:03:35.300> which<00:03:35.720> is<00:03:35.900> almost<00:03:36.740> a<00:03:36.890> dead<00:03:37.070> short<00:03:37.630> will

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
around which is almost a dead short will

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.200 
around which is almost a dead short will
pull<00:03:38.840> all<00:03:38.930> these<00:03:39.110> low<00:03:39.670> it's<00:03:40.670> like<00:03:40.820> having<00:03:41.090> a

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
pull all these low it's like having a

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.670 
pull all these low it's like having a
eight<00:03:41.780> on<00:03:42.100> pulldown<00:03:43.100> resistor<00:03:44.350> but<00:03:45.350> anyways

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
eight on pulldown resistor but anyways

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.790 
eight on pulldown resistor but anyways
my<00:03:45.890> hard<00:03:46.100> drive<00:03:46.310> motor<00:03:46.580> and<00:03:50.290> if<00:03:51.290> I<00:03:51.470> wanted<00:03:51.620> to

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
my hard drive motor and if I wanted to

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.740 
my hard drive motor and if I wanted to
if<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:52.790> knew<00:03:52.940> how<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.150> i<00:03:53.590> could<00:03:54.590> use<00:03:55.190> these<00:03:55.750> these

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
if I knew how to i could use these these

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.010 
if I knew how to i could use these these
two<00:03:57.020> right<00:03:57.470> here<00:03:57.500> or<00:03:57.980> on<00:03:58.460> interrupts<00:03:58.910> 0<00:03:59.630> and<00:03:59.810> 1

two right here or on interrupts 0 and 1

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.730 
two right here or on interrupts 0 and 1
I<00:04:00.520> could<00:04:01.520> use<00:04:01.670> that<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.180> make<00:04:03.050> my<00:04:03.260> code<00:04:03.470> more

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
I could use that to make my code more

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.890 
I could use that to make my code more
efficient<00:04:04.220> but<00:04:04.760> since<00:04:05.060> I'm<00:04:05.270> not<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.750> that

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
efficient but since I'm not to that

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.450 
efficient but since I'm not to that

you<00:04:26.980> can<00:04:27.100> do<00:04:27.190> all<00:04:27.220> kind<00:04:27.550> of<00:04:27.610> stuff<00:04:27.790> with<00:04:27.970> this

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
you can do all kind of stuff with this

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.530 
you can do all kind of stuff with this
let<00:04:30.460> me<00:04:30.550> try<00:04:30.670> to<00:04:30.790> make<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:30.940> safe<00:04:31.270> with<00:04:31.510> a

let me try to make a safe with a

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.210 
let me try to make a safe with a

combination make it programmable and

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.770 
combination make it programmable and
then<00:04:39.060> have<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.090> let<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.420> know<00:04:40.540> when<00:04:40.690> you

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
then have it let you know when you

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.590 
then have it let you know when you
successfully<00:04:41.170> put<00:04:41.590> in<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.770> code<00:04:42.270> but<00:04:43.270> in<00:04:43.390> order

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
to in order to do that amount to

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.230 
to in order to do that amount to
recognize<00:04:45.850> direction<00:04:46.420> and<00:04:46.600> counts<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:49.060> is

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
recognize direction and counts it is

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.610 
recognize direction and counts it is
very<00:04:49.420> accurate<00:04:49.690> I<00:04:49.990> don't<00:04:50.230> see<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.410> lot<00:04:50.590> of

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
very accurate I don't see a lot of

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.560 
very accurate I don't see a lot of
bounce<00:04:50.950> when<00:04:51.340> I<00:04:51.370> do<00:04:51.520> look<00:04:51.820> at<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.030> serial<00:04:52.390> data

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
bounce when I do look at the serial data

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.020 
bounce when I do look at the serial data
I<00:04:52.930> don't<00:04:53.620> have<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.770> serial<00:04:54.190> monitor<00:04:54.280> up<00:04:54.790> right

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
I don't have the serial monitor up right

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.320 
I don't have the serial monitor up right
now<00:04:55.240> but<00:04:55.720> uh<00:04:56.520> I'll<00:04:57.520> have<00:04:57.640> it<00:04:57.670> connected<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.240> the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
now but uh I'll have it connected to the

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.100 
now but uh I'll have it connected to the
computer<00:05:00.360> but<00:05:01.360> as<00:05:01.450> soon<00:05:01.540> as<00:05:01.660> I<00:05:01.720> can<00:05:01.840> do<00:05:01.900> that

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
computer but as soon as I can do that

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.040 
computer but as soon as I can do that
then<00:05:02.140> I<00:05:02.470> can<00:05:02.620> determine<00:05:02.770> direction<00:05:03.130> and

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
then I can determine direction and

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.940 
then I can determine direction and
increment<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.880> I<00:05:07.320> could<00:05:08.320> put<00:05:08.530> a<00:05:08.560> button<00:05:08.830> on

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
increment and I could put a button on

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.360 
increment and I could put a button on
there<00:05:09.160> to<00:05:09.400> set<00:05:09.820> a<00:05:09.850> programming<00:05:10.480> mode<00:05:11.370> maybe

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
there to set a programming mode maybe

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.040 
there to set a programming mode maybe
set<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.640> variable<00:05:13.000> on<00:05:13.240> a<00:05:13.330> flash<00:05:13.570> card<00:05:13.600> or

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
set a variable on a flash card or

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.840 
set a variable on a flash card or
something<00:05:14.230> like<00:05:14.410> that<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:15.390> then<00:05:17.670> wait<00:05:18.670> your

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
something like that and then wait your

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.520 
something like that and then wait your
input<00:05:19.240> against<00:05:19.920> against<00:05:20.920> the<00:05:20.950> code<00:05:21.220> or<00:05:21.760> just

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
input against against the code or just

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.330 
input against against the code or just
hard<00:05:23.530> code<00:05:23.830> a<00:05:25.350> password<00:05:26.350> in<00:05:26.500> there<00:05:26.710> and<00:05:26.920> then

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
hard code a password in there and then

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.020 
hard code a password in there and then
just<00:05:27.550> use<00:05:27.700> your<00:05:27.850> encoder<00:05:28.150> like<00:05:28.390> a<00:05:28.420> padlock<00:05:30.030> use

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
just use your encoder like a padlock use

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.520 
just use your encoder like a padlock use
your<00:05:31.150> imagination<00:05:31.210> sure<00:05:32.080> you<00:05:32.200> can<00:05:32.320> use<00:05:32.410> this

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
your imagination sure you can use this

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.700 
your imagination sure you can use this
for<00:05:32.680> a<00:05:32.770> lot<00:05:32.830> of<00:05:32.890> stuff<00:05:33.130> volume<00:05:33.730> controls<00:05:34.710> other

for a lot of stuff volume controls other

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.230 
for a lot of stuff volume controls other

types of remote controls anyways fun to
build<00:05:41.970> it'll<00:05:42.970> be<00:05:43.090> even<00:05:43.240> more<00:05:43.480> fun<00:05:43.540> to<00:05:44.050> figure

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
build it'll be even more fun to figure

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:55.320 
build it'll be even more fun to figure
