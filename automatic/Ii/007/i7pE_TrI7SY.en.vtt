fences chess and whatnot I did do the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.910 
fences chess and whatnot I did do the
basic<00:00:46.020> layout<00:00:46.140> here<00:00:46.440> because<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.739> kind<00:00:46.860> of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
basic layout here because it's kind of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.590 
basic layout here because it's kind of
hard<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> do<00:00:47.280> from<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:47.579> head<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.149> here<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.480> is

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
hard to do from my head so here it is

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.049 
hard to do from my head so here it is
it's<00:00:48.809> basically<00:00:49.710> five<00:00:50.039> blocks<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.760> water<00:00:50.969> in

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
it's basically five blocks with water in

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.420 
it's basically five blocks with water in
the<00:00:51.149> middle<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.739> one<00:00:52.949> connecting

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the middle and like like one connecting

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.990 
the middle and like like one connecting
the<00:00:53.520> edge<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.629> two<00:00:54.840> three<00:00:55.530> two<00:00:56.000> two

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the edge so it's just two three two two

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.639 
the edge so it's just two three two two
three<00:00:57.030> two<00:00:57.960> if<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.410> kind<00:00:58.620> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
because I don't think glowstone kind of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.410

except for finishing the furnace over

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.810 
except for finishing the furnace over
here<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.410> you<00:04:59.410> want<00:04:59.620> might<00:04:59.830> want<00:05:00.010> to<00:05:00.100> want<00:05:00.760> to

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
here the you want might want to want to

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.250 
here the you want might want to want to
connect<00:05:01.090> that<00:05:01.180> up<00:05:01.450> you<00:05:01.720> can<00:05:01.750> go<00:05:01.990> ahead<00:05:02.110> just

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
connect that up you can go ahead just

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.590 
connect that up you can go ahead just
raise<00:05:02.440> it<00:05:02.650> up<00:05:02.800> one<00:05:03.220> and<00:05:03.520> this<00:05:04.389> is<00:05:04.479> where

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
raise it up one and this is where

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.700 
raise it up one and this is where
actually<00:05:04.870> where<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.050> stairs<00:05:05.320> going<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:05.590> come

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
actually where the stairs going to come

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.300 
actually where the stairs going to come
into<00:05:05.860> play

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
into play

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.200 
into play
you<00:05:06.460> place<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.270> stair<00:05:07.570> right<00:05:08.380> here<00:05:09.000> here<00:05:10.000> and

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
you place the stair right here here and

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.360 
you place the stair right here here and
then<00:05:10.330> how<00:05:10.510> did<00:05:10.660> I<00:05:10.720> do<00:05:10.780> it<00:05:11.140> I<00:05:11.380> think<00:05:12.010> I<00:05:12.100> did<00:05:12.280> it

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
then how did I do it I think I did it

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.990 
then how did I do it I think I did it
right<00:05:12.550> there<00:05:12.850> and<00:05:13.120> then<00:05:13.330> of<00:05:13.710> right<00:05:14.710> here<00:05:15.280> and

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
right there and then of right here and

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.150 
right there and then of right here and
then<00:05:16.210> you<00:05:16.330> connect<00:05:16.660> it<00:05:16.840> like<00:05:16.870> that<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:18.010> then

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
then you connect it like that and then

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.590 
then you connect it like that and then
you<00:05:18.310> of<00:05:18.430> course<00:05:18.669> just<00:05:19.000> do<00:05:19.120> like<00:05:19.210> one<00:05:19.419> more

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
you of course just do like one more

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.480 
you of course just do like one more
little<00:05:19.810> support<00:05:20.260> right<00:05:20.410> there<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:21.039> hold<00:05:21.190> it<00:05:21.340> up

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
little support right there to hold it up

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.700 
little support right there to hold it up
and<00:05:21.820> that's<00:05:22.479> pretty<00:05:22.690> much<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.229> end<00:05:23.440> at<00:05:23.620> the

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
and that's pretty much the end at the

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.260 
and that's pretty much the end at the
end<00:05:23.919> of<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.220> tutorial<00:05:24.430> you<00:05:24.850> can<00:05:25.000> pretty<00:05:25.180> much

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
end of the tutorial you can pretty much

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.120 
end of the tutorial you can pretty much
do<00:05:25.539> whatever<00:05:25.630> you<00:05:26.110> guys<00:05:26.229> want<00:05:26.620> in<00:05:26.770> here<00:05:26.979> you
