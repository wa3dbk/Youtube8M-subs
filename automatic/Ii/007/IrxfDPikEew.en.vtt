00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.070
 yes 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.070
 hi people I am that I believed you but also 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.840
 known as the one that sends mosquitoes 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.670
 to be shown at night and 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.220
 I'm here to show you a trick 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.800
 for an adventure or any other map 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.200
 what do you give minecraft that is simply 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.840
 I was inspired that the other day 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.440
 I was watching a video of Super Mario and 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.760
 I said why not do this in minecraft 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.200
 maybe it's funny and the truth then 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.200
 It has taken me quite a long time and have 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.329
 this guys sounds to you I come here to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.730
 this block is high 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.630
 oh my god 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.220
 equilicua and start to grow that to see 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.460
 I'm going to go here 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:57.980
 to see if today I can go up here 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:01.430
 perfect cool too and here that there 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.440
 an interestingly good mushroom 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.290
 these guys 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.170
 what I have been preparing and the truth 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.229
 Well, it's quite simple, so I'm going to 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.420
 teach what I 've done is worth it and here it is 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.640
 the cause of all this because here is 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.290
 several things that happen are not worth it 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.990
 put sound because the truth then 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.149
 it does not matter what a peeing sound is 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.619
 free and free but hey nothing happens 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.840
 I think it was like that the sound I do not know I'm not 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.570
 very fan of informing me but good the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.860
 issue is that here is a test way you 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.380
 something strange happens that is that 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.149
 when I do so well right now 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.909
 it's off I think so it does not happen 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.250
 again while you are standing 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.170
 now it's on, so here's a 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.060
 test because when I do a jump 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.920
 it detects that I am closer to this 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.869
 block therefore this block here 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.369
 makes a little jump and then skeleton and that 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.140
 everything is worth that yes that took me quite 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.810
 time because he has insufficiency 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.190
 well what happens what happens 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.479
 here is quite always I'm not going to 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.159
 teach all the commands because they are 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.229
 enough that the only thing they do is 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.690
 create vines upwards and such 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.369
 but it has good this here has its 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.590
 science because it cost me enough to do it 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.179
 and is that the block of a jump is worth 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.920
 with a fal insan 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.409
 the idea of ​​the block and then this is 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.819
 convert because if it would not fall to the 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.680
 ground then this had to turn 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.000
 make a set block what he does is 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.519
 that a block appears here and stops 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.049
 and then, as you can see, some 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.480
 lianas up all of them to one 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.359
 animation a succession from coman blogs 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.799
 from set blogs to write everything and 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.879
 then there is something rather curious that is 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.680
 how well mister now so let's go 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.439
 see it again I approach here I do 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.049
 a 2 is here makes a hit and now 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.969
 it starts to grow it starts seeing it 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.310
 until it gets there and then there 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:43.460
 well it stops worth that has a 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.480
 trick and that is when I did it 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.400
 here are two are like two vines in 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.520
 a block because this is only generated 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.590
 in consell blog in the goods is worth only 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.510
 generates them on one side however I 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.030
 I put at the same time and therefore generated 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.290
 also on this side but what happens that 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.420
 there is something quite curious is that I do not 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.530
 I can upload I mean in a normal video 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.360
 can not go up then I've done 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.300
 well I have done that are generated here 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.890
 stairs every two then this is worth 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.370
 bad because it allows you to upload easily 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.900
 because this goes up with stairs without 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.300
 But it's here and you raise it 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.830
 this is how stairs this combine and 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.480
 so on then then cool 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.890
 quite a failure because if you're 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.000
 here you see the stairs are left 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.190
 pretty bad but good 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.110
 from here back they do not look bad then 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.260
 Suv is perfectly cool pretty 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.270
 the truth and well these stairs are 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.670
 generated on this side of here is worth there 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.410
 on this side here the goods are of 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.200
 this side and the whites on this side 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.610
 so then it's pretty cool 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.320
 it happens pretty well doing well 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.830
 this we are going to give here a command of 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.850
 street separately to see what happens 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.980
 and it is here for example there is generated the 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.690
 head and all you see are generated 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.850
 time because here and now they would be generated 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.700
 the bines are worth and are deleting those 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.320
 heads and good as you see this is 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.460
 Pretty cool the truth and I do not know why 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.470
 demons tell him about his wardrobe 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.270
 because I the only super Mario that I played 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.880
 in my good life the only super mario 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.290
 that I liked that he will play was one that 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.470
 plays in the super nintendo that is a 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.200
 console already very old and I played it already 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.790
 when I was 11 years old or things like that I do not know 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.310
 why the hell did the idea of 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.480
 make it super mario but well there what 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.670
 you have guys, I hope you liked it 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.810
 this little video and as always this 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.400
 with the action of chapín never the 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.600
 I remove but that you also do 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.860
 your ideas I already know that it's a bit 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.180
 complicated to do this from the commands 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.150
 but you have a great time doing those 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.730
 things that cool a lot and you know not 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.510
 forget to go to the movies a greeting and 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.510
 peace 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.680
 like if you like the video thank you for 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.720
 see him 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.080
