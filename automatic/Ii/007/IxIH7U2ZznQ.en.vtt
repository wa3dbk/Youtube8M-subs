00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.720
 black chocolate to be able to put the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.410
 eyes and decorate the tongues with chocolate 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.630
 the 85 cocoa we keep putting nuggets 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.210
 I know I know it's fine because it was cited 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.610
 everything I say is a little Chinese but 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.290
 it looks very good then what was it 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.450
 we did with this one because it 's pink we made 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.800
 an important truffle that has hanging 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.500
 I like that they have crunchy 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.300
 we can see and feel it when we are 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.479
 eating the things that I have a crispy 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.390
 and get to this crunch feeling and 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.220
 inside the palate the most interesting thing is 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.470
 that we use a karmic bacon 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.210
 many people really in many cultures 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.610
 in Latin America the bacon is used 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.210
 for breakfast then now we had 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.790
 to chocolate very important we take the 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.100
 confit and then the eyes that have 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.050
 an expression also the desserts that already 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.700
 is not the typical happy face and the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.590
 eyes but not really have a 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.509
 expression so that children also be 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.650
 much more affable that they can 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.360
 consume 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:10.660
 We made the porcupine here 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.490
 we made the snakes the plug be 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.450
 as long or as short as you 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.400
 want 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.950
 then the joke is simply a 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.590
 good kneading the previous hydration before 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.120
 of putting the pep powder is fine 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.830
 important because if they do not start to 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.010
 crack the ar and will no longer serve us 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.350
 nothing comes out then remember that what 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.390
 The best thing about being an adult is that all 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.990
 days we have to feel like children 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.990
 in chocolate shop
