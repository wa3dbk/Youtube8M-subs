00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.790 

the<00:02:07.610> next<00:02:07.940> ability<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:08.780> have<00:02:09.050> chosen<00:02:09.320> is

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
the next ability that I have chosen is

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.960 
the next ability that I have chosen is
Magnum<00:02:10.340> shot<00:02:10.550> nine<00:02:11.300> shots<00:02:11.720> just<00:02:12.940> morphed<00:02:13.940> from

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
Magnum shot nine shots just morphed from

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.380 
Magnum shot nine shots just morphed from
scattershot<00:02:14.740> it's<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:16.300> knock-back<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:19.390> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
scattershot it's a knock-back and the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.950 
scattershot it's a knock-back and the
more<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.940> scatter<00:02:22.940> shot<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.390> maintenance<00:02:23.630> shot

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
more of scatter shot to maintenance shot

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.370 
more of scatter shot to maintenance shot
just<00:02:24.800> knocks<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.760> back<00:02:25.790> as<00:02:26.180> well<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.350> just

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
just knocks you back as well so it just

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.440 
just knocks you back as well so it just
doubles<00:02:27.950> doubles<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.520> distance<00:02:28.940> between<00:02:29.060> you

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
doubles doubles the distance between you

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.060 
doubles doubles the distance between you
two<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:29.900> it's<00:02:30.080> more<00:02:30.880> just<00:02:32.650> more<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.709> like<00:02:33.890> a

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
two so it's more just more of like a

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.320 
two so it's more just more of like a
carding<00:02:34.640> ability<00:02:35.980> next<00:02:36.980> ability<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.640> power

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
carding ability next ability is power

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.640 
carding ability next ability is power
surge<00:02:38.800> power<00:02:39.800> surge<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.690> morphed<00:02:41.690> from<00:02:43.209> search

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
surge power surge is morphed from search

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.850 
surge power surge is morphed from search
this<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.800> just<00:02:45.980> increase<00:02:46.459> weapon<00:02:46.730> damage<00:02:47.860> the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
this is just increase weapon damage the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
this is just increase weapon damage the
idea<00:02:49.400> of<00:02:49.550> this<00:02:49.730> build<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:51.220> pop<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.520> and

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
idea of this build is to pop this and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.650 
idea of this build is to pop this and
then<00:02:54.190> do<00:02:55.190> your<00:02:55.310> focus<00:02:55.670> teams<00:02:55.880> so<00:02:56.180> then<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.420> hit

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
then do your focus teams so then you hit

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.699 
then do your focus teams so then you hit
a<00:02:56.690> lot<00:02:57.230> more<00:02:58.330> that's<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.750> theory<00:03:00.050> behind<00:03:00.290> it

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
a lot more that's the theory behind it

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.850 
a lot more that's the theory behind it
if<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:02.720> have<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.230> test<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:03.560> out<00:03:03.709> myself

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
if I have to test this out myself

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.920 
if I have to test this out myself
because<00:03:04.610> it's<00:03:04.730> his<00:03:04.850> weapon<00:03:05.209> damage<00:03:05.360> i'm<00:03:05.660> just

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
because it's his weapon damage i'm just

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.539 
because it's his weapon damage i'm just
guessing<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:08.090> damage<00:03:08.540> from<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:09.549> weapon

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
guessing that the damage from the weapon

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.310 
guessing that the damage from the weapon
abilities<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:12.670> based<00:03:13.670> off<00:03:13.970> weapon<00:03:14.390> damage<00:03:14.510> so

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
abilities is based off weapon damage so

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.090 
abilities is based off weapon damage so
that's<00:03:15.709> just<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:16.280> theory<00:03:16.790> behind<00:03:17.299> that<00:03:18.100> yeah

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
that's just a theory behind that yeah

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.430 
that's just a theory behind that yeah
it's<00:03:19.280> just<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:20.080> daydream<00:03:21.190> minefields<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:23.440> more

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
it's just a daydream minefields is more

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.520 
it's just a daydream minefields is more
from<00:03:24.830> dejah<00:03:25.250> Cline's<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.290> reason<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.320> chose

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
from dejah Cline's the reason I chose

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.050 
from dejah Cline's the reason I chose
this<00:03:27.590> because<00:03:29.560> if<00:03:30.560> you're<00:03:30.860> placing<00:03:31.549> minds

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
this because if you're placing minds

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.250 
this because if you're placing minds
around<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.900> just<00:03:33.530> makes<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.459> tug<00:03:34.700> easier<00:03:35.630> to

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.789 

just<00:03:39.260> cut<00:03:39.470> around<00:03:40.120> if<00:03:41.120> most<00:03:41.900> players<00:03:42.200> will<00:03:42.530> try

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
just cut around if most players will try

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.100 
just cut around if most players will try
to<00:03:42.860> dodge<00:03:43.220> them<00:03:43.519> which<00:03:44.269> means<00:03:44.630> they<00:03:44.930> have<00:03:45.080> to

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
to dodge them which means they have to

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.380 
to dodge them which means they have to
do<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.320> lot<00:03:45.560> more<00:03:45.620> running<00:03:46.160> around<00:03:46.489> trying<00:03:47.209> to

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
do a lot more running around trying to

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.229 
do a lot more running around trying to
get<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.110> you<00:03:48.400> there<00:03:49.400> will<00:03:49.580> be<00:03:49.610> some<00:03:49.970> players

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
get to you there will be some players

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.360 
get to you there will be some players
just<00:03:50.780> go<00:03:50.930> who<00:03:51.440> gives<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.769> crap<00:03:51.799> it's<00:03:52.190> going<00:03:52.310> to

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
just go who gives a crap it's going to

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.509 
just go who gives a crap it's going to
run<00:03:52.549> into<00:03:52.700> these<00:03:52.850> minds<00:03:53.650> but<00:03:54.650> they<00:03:55.220> will<00:03:55.459> be

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
run into these minds but they will be

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.140 
run into these minds but they will be
immobilized<00:03:56.510> for<00:03:56.780> 1.5<00:03:57.380> seconds<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.280> meaning

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
immobilized for 1.5 seconds so meaning

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.430 
immobilized for 1.5 seconds so meaning
they're<00:03:59.330> just<00:03:59.510> going<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.720> stand<00:04:00.019> there<00:04:00.200> for

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
they're just going to stand there for

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.979 
they're just going to stand there for
1.5<00:04:00.920> seconds<00:04:01.370> so<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.299> Huracan<00:04:02.720> this<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:02.930> a

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
1.5 seconds so the Huracan this is a

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.030 
1.5 seconds so the Huracan this is a
really<00:04:03.350> good<00:04:03.500> ability<00:04:03.980> for<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.489> range<00:04:04.850> sorcerer

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
really good ability for a range sorcerer

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.860 
really good ability for a range sorcerer
with<00:04:07.040> a<00:04:07.070> bow<00:04:07.310> sort<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.239> reminds<00:04:08.540> me<00:04:08.660> of<00:04:08.780> a

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
with a bow sort of reminds me of a

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.069 
with a bow sort of reminds me of a
hunter<00:04:09.290> from<00:04:10.010> all<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:10.310> Warcraft<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:11.810> next

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
hunter from all the Warcraft the next

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.860 
hunter from all the Warcraft the next
ability<00:04:12.290> I<00:04:12.680> decided<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.670> choose<00:04:13.970> was<00:04:14.390> room

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
ability I decided to choose was room

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.720 
ability I decided to choose was room
rune<00:04:15.440> cage<00:04:16.510> this<00:04:17.510> is<00:04:17.690> more<00:04:17.989> from

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
rune cage this is more from

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.560 
rune cage this is more from
prison<00:04:19.440> basically<00:04:20.440> this<00:04:21.180> disorientate<00:04:22.180> the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
prison basically this disorientate the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.810 
prison basically this disorientate the
target<00:04:23.020> for<00:04:23.170> 16<00:04:23.620> seconds<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.800> Mort<00:04:27.100> version

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
target for 16 seconds the Mort version

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.920 
target for 16 seconds the Mort version
after<00:04:28.950> that<00:04:29.950> effect<00:04:30.460> ends<00:04:30.790> they're<00:04:31.510> stunned

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
after that effect ends they're stunned

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.100 
after that effect ends they're stunned
for<00:04:32.110> three<00:04:32.380> seconds<00:04:32.830> so<00:04:33.420> the<00:04:34.420> theory<00:04:34.960> behind

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
for three seconds so the theory behind

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.320 
for three seconds so the theory behind
this<00:04:35.590> is<00:04:36.390> after<00:04:37.390> you<00:04:37.890> power<00:04:38.890> surge<00:04:39.220> then<00:04:40.180> you

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
this is after you power surge then you

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.840 
this is after you power surge then you
hit<00:04:40.540> them<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.810> photo<00:04:41.080> toward<00:04:41.350> you<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:42.580> quickly

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
hit them a photo toward you you quickly

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.810 
hit them a photo toward you you quickly
cast<00:04:43.240> this<00:04:43.600> it's<00:04:44.170> only<00:04:44.350> 1.5<00:04:44.650> second<00:04:45.220> cast<00:04:45.460> so

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
cast this it's only 1.5 second cast so

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.030 
cast this it's only 1.5 second cast so
you<00:04:45.910> should<00:04:46.120> be<00:04:46.150> able<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.420> get<00:04:46.510> it<00:04:46.540> off<00:04:47.040> you

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
you should be able to get it off you

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.650 
you should be able to get it off you
cast<00:04:48.340> this<00:04:49.650> they're<00:04:50.650> stuck<00:04:51.010> in<00:04:51.220> a

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
cast this they're stuck in a

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.470 
cast this they're stuck in a
disorientate<00:04:52.660> for<00:04:53.050> 16<00:04:53.560> seconds<00:04:54.250> then<00:04:55.210> you

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
disorientate for 16 seconds then you

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.580 
disorientate for 16 seconds then you
should<00:04:55.720> be<00:04:55.840> able<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.080> get<00:04:56.170> another<00:04:56.380> one<00:04:56.530> of

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
should be able to get another one of

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.130 
should be able to get another one of
these<00:04:56.710> off<00:04:57.100> and<00:04:57.430> then<00:04:58.240> just<00:04:58.270> knock<00:04:58.810> them<00:04:58.930> back

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
these off and then just knock them back

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.370 
these off and then just knock them back
and<00:04:59.670> do<00:05:00.670> it<00:05:00.700> do<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.000> you<00:05:01.210> want<00:05:01.390> this<00:05:02.020> is<00:05:02.200> just

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
and do it do it you want this is just

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.840 
and do it do it you want this is just
the<00:05:02.500> theory<00:05:02.800> behind<00:05:02.920> yeah<00:05:03.520> that's<00:05:03.760> just

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
the theory behind yeah that's just

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.570 
the theory behind yeah that's just
that's<00:05:04.630> what<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:04.930> build<00:05:05.140> is<00:05:05.380> I'll<00:05:06.250> give<00:05:06.490> you

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
that's what the build is I'll give you

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.450 
that's what the build is I'll give you
guys<00:05:06.730> a<00:05:06.760> link<00:05:07.150> below<00:05:08.020> that<00:05:08.500> is<00:05:08.620> in<00:05:09.280> the
