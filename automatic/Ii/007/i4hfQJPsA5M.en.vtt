00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
and we're naive if we're gonna think

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.360

educational point of view the point I'm

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.300 
educational point of view the point I'm
talking<00:02:33.209> about<00:02:33.269> is<00:02:33.569> what<00:02:33.959> is<00:02:34.140> race<00:02:34.349> his<00:02:35.040> race

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
talking about is what is race his race

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.399 
talking about is what is race his race
genetic<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:35.939> the<00:02:36.000> color<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.239> your<00:02:36.329> skin

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
genetic is it the color of your skin

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.780 
genetic is it the color of your skin
what<00:02:37.409> is<00:02:37.530> race<00:02:37.709> because<00:02:38.430> if<00:02:38.519> you<00:02:38.579> look<00:02:38.700> at

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
what is race because if you look at

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.580 
what is race because if you look at
Anton<00:02:39.030> Ferdinand<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.780> John<00:02:40.200> Terry<00:02:40.409> for

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
Anton Ferdinand and John Terry for

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.979 
Anton Ferdinand and John Terry for
example<00:02:41.040> Anton<00:02:41.790> Ferdinand<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.390> probably

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
example Anton Ferdinand is probably

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.349 
example Anton Ferdinand is probably
closer<00:02:43.319> genetically<00:02:44.250> because<00:02:44.909> his<00:02:45.060> mother<00:02:45.239> is

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
closer genetically because his mother is

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.339 
closer genetically because his mother is
white<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.720> his<00:02:45.840> father's<00:02:46.139> from<00:02:46.260> the

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
white and his father's from the

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.899 
white and his father's from the
Caribbean<00:02:46.799> presumably<00:02:47.400> he<00:02:47.579> would<00:02:47.670> have<00:02:47.790> had

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
Caribbean presumably he would have had

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.490 
Caribbean presumably he would have had
some<00:02:48.090> white<00:02:48.239> blood<00:02:48.389> in<00:02:48.480> him<00:02:48.690> in<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.840> past<00:02:49.049> so

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
some white blood in him in the past so

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.410 
some white blood in him in the past so
genetically<00:02:49.950> he'd<00:02:50.370> be<00:02:50.489> closer<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.909> John<00:02:51.150> Terry

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
genetically he'd be closer to John Terry

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.599 
genetically he'd be closer to John Terry
than<00:02:51.750> for<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.200> completely<00:02:52.829> black<00:02:53.010> West<00:02:53.220> African

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
than for a completely black West African

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.869 
than for a completely black West African
so<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.209> he<00:02:54.329> white<00:02:54.540> his<00:02:55.440> mother<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.799> white<00:02:55.980> these

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
so is he white his mother is white these

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.069 
so is he white his mother is white these

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
complex complex issue in West Africa you

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.970 
complex complex issue in West Africa you
can<00:03:39.030> have<00:03:39.209> two<00:03:39.450> black<00:03:40.050> West<00:03:40.350> Africans<00:03:40.770> who

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
can have two black West Africans who

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.910 
can have two black West Africans who
genetically<00:03:41.580> are<00:03:41.840> much<00:03:42.840> more<00:03:43.020> diverse<00:03:43.230> than<00:03:43.709> a

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
genetically are much more diverse than a

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.770
