hey guys this is going to be an
introduction<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.529> jungling<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.130> neutral<00:00:05.460> camps

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
introduction to jungling a neutral camps

introduction to jungling a neutral camps
part<00:00:06.450> 1<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:07.140> I'm<00:00:07.379> going<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.589> be<00:00:07.740> going<00:00:07.890> over<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
part 1 so I'm going to be going over the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.730 
part 1 so I'm going to be going over the
basic<00:00:09.240> mechanics<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.900> how<00:00:09.929> these<00:00:10.410> nutria

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
basic mechanics of how these nutria

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.789 
basic mechanics of how these nutria
camps<00:00:10.980> work<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.400> they<00:00:11.969> are<00:00:12.240> just<00:00:12.799> random

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
camps work so they are just random

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.340 
camps work so they are just random
creeps<00:00:14.280> neutral<00:00:14.700> creeps<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.330> kind<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.170> hang

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
creeps neutral creeps that kind of hang

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.140 
creeps neutral creeps that kind of hang
out<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.710> jungle<00:00:16.859> they<00:00:17.580> are<00:00:17.699> all<00:00:17.850> over<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
out in the jungle they are all over the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.929 
out in the jungle they are all over the
map<00:00:18.180> signified<00:00:18.930> by<00:00:18.960> these<00:00:19.350> little<00:00:19.939> triangles

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
map signified by these little triangles

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.410 
map signified by these little triangles
here<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.900> they<00:00:21.990> range<00:00:22.199> from<00:00:22.320> easy<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.420> ancient

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
here and they range from easy to ancient

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.109 
here and they range from easy to ancient
which<00:00:24.630> are<00:00:24.779> hard<00:00:25.490> what<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.550> need<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.789> know<00:00:26.820> is

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
which are hard what you need to know is

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.839 
which are hard what you need to know is
they<00:00:27.359> spawn<00:00:27.660> at<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> one-minute<00:00:28.349> mark<00:00:28.849> as

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
they spawn at the one-minute mark as

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.479 
they spawn at the one-minute mark as
long<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.150> there<00:00:30.300> are<00:00:30.449> no<00:00:30.650> units<00:00:31.650> inside<00:00:32.219> them

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
long as there are no units inside them

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.810 
long as there are no units inside them
so<00:00:32.669> units<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.120> be<00:00:33.149> anything<00:00:33.710> like<00:00:34.710> wards<00:00:35.250> they

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
so units can be anything like wards they

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.950 
so units can be anything like wards they
can<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.090> hero<00:00:36.329> control<00:00:36.660> unit<00:00:36.930> sites<00:00:37.110> creeps<00:00:37.829> or

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
can be hero control unit sites creeps or

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.920 
can be hero control unit sites creeps or
was<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.110> wolves<00:00:40.500> from<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.860> lycanthropy<00:00:41.930> they

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
was it wolves from the lycanthropy they

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.540 
was it wolves from the lycanthropy they
can<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.170> heroes<00:00:43.440> themselves<00:00:44.570> as<00:00:45.570> long<00:00:45.780> as

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
can be heroes themselves as long as

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.430 
can be heroes themselves as long as
there<00:00:47.550> aren't<00:00:47.760> any<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.149> those<00:00:48.300> within<00:00:48.629> this

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
there aren't any of those within this

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.240 
there aren't any of those within this
sort<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.160> invisible<00:00:50.520> area<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.680> neutral<00:00:53.010> camps

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
sort of invisible area the neutral camps

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.639 
sort of invisible area the neutral camps
will<00:00:53.430> spawn<00:00:53.699> another<00:00:54.210> set<00:00:54.780> into<00:00:55.050> camp<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.379> if<00:00:55.559> I

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
will spawn another set into camp so if I

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.650 
will spawn another set into camp so if I
kill<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:55.890> off<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.449> spawn

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
kill this off it's not going to spawn

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.110 
kill this off it's not going to spawn
into<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.140> minute<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:58.680> long<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.489> there

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
into the one minute as long as there

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.750 
into the one minute as long as there
isn't<00:01:00.300> anything<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> inside<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:02.399> area<00:01:02.730> i

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
isn't anything in the inside this area i

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.859 
isn't anything in the inside this area i
think<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.149> camp<00:01:04.700> area<00:01:05.700> looks<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.570> this

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
think this camp area looks like this

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.500 
think this camp area looks like this
route<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.920> goes<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.220> here<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:10.010> back<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.549> it's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
route it goes up here and back here it's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.670 
route it goes up here and back here it's
a<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.810> bit<00:01:12.900> closer<00:01:13.049> by<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:13.470> i'm<00:01:13.560> up

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
a little bit closer by that when i'm up

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.910 
a little bit closer by that when i'm up
again<00:01:14.119> in<00:01:15.119> about<00:01:15.270> 10<00:01:15.630> seconds<00:01:15.990> another<00:01:16.619> camp

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
again in about 10 seconds another camp

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.340 
again in about 10 seconds another camp
will<00:01:17.100> spawn<00:01:17.369> your<00:01:18.119> top<00:01:18.420> tower<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:19.080> under

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
will spawn your top tower is under

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.749 
will spawn your top tower is under
attack<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.689> i<00:01:24.799> should<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.490> spawn

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
attack and then i should just do spawn

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.679 
attack and then i should just do spawn
camp<00:01:27.030> major<00:01:27.990> kohls<00:01:28.790> your<00:01:29.790> total<00:01:30.150> its<00:01:30.299> bonds

this happen it won't spawn as soon as I
step<00:01:48.149> out<00:01:48.860> they<00:01:49.860> respond<00:01:51.290> there<00:01:52.290> can't<00:01:52.500> be

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
step out they respond there can't be

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.050 
step out they respond there can't be
more<00:01:52.770> than<00:01:52.829> one<00:01:53.070> unless<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.460> stack<00:01:53.700> which
