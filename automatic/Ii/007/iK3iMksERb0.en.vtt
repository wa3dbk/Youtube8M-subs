thing is tiny too I love this how small
is<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.170> comparison<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.949> some<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
is this in comparison to some of the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.889 
is this in comparison to some of the
other<00:00:32.430> cameras<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.510> market

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
other cameras that you see on the market

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.970 
other cameras that you see on the market
well<00:00:33.989> actually<00:00:34.140> it's<00:00:34.380> very<00:00:34.559> small<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:34.950> fact

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
well actually it's very small in fact

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.650 
well actually it's very small in fact
this<00:00:35.219> one<00:00:35.399> has<00:00:35.550> built<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.969> Wi-Fi<00:00:36.000> which<00:00:36.540> I'll

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
this one has built in Wi-Fi which I'll

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.910 
this one has built in Wi-Fi which I'll
talk<00:00:36.780> more<00:00:36.840> about<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.350> second<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.860> we

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
talk more about in a second and we

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.410 
talk more about in a second and we
believe<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> smallest<00:00:39.210> one

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
believe that it's the smallest one

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
believe that it's the smallest one
available<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.140> feature<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.710> what

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
available with that feature and what

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.410 
available with that feature and what
we've<00:00:41.280> really<00:00:41.520> done<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.790> taken<00:00:41.969> strides<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
we've really done is taken strides to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.970 
we've really done is taken strides to
kind<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.660> minimize<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.260> forward<00:00:43.590> profile

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
kind of minimize the forward profile

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.950 
kind of minimize the forward profile
here<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.059> wear<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> say<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.930> side

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
here so if you wear it say on the side

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660 
here so if you wear it say on the side
of<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.289> head<00:00:46.410> or<00:00:46.559> something<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.219> it's

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
of your head or something like this it's

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.220 
of your head or something like this it's
much<00:00:47.969> smaller<00:00:48.239> than<00:00:48.390> most<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
much smaller than most of the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.380 
much smaller than most of the
competition<00:00:49.649> out<00:00:50.010> there<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.520> how<00:00:50.879> rugged<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
competition out there but how rugged is

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360 
competition out there but how rugged is
this<00:00:51.629> camera<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.079> its<00:00:52.350> own<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.160> want<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
this camera on its own so if you want to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.850 
this camera on its own so if you want to
make<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.640> ruggett<00:00:53.910> what<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.360> use<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
make it ruggett what you do is use the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.810 
make it ruggett what you do is use the
recognised<00:00:55.860> housing<00:00:56.219> here<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.430> waterproof

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
recognised housing here this waterproof

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.790 
recognised housing here this waterproof
housing<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.629> good<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> 60<00:00:58.469> meters

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
housing this is good down to 60 meters

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.979 
housing this is good down to 60 meters
underwater<00:00:59.489> so<00:00:59.910> you<00:00:59.969> would<00:01:00.270> implode<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.629> think

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
underwater so you would implode I think

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.130 
underwater so you would implode I think
before<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:02.070> dies<00:01:02.539> just<00:01:03.539> pop<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.899> here

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
before this dies just pop it in here

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.219 
before this dies just pop it in here
clamp<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.890> down<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:06.240> we're<00:01:06.630> fully<00:01:06.840> rugged

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
clamp it down and now we're fully rugged

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
clamp it down and now we're fully rugged
throw<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.860> off<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> building<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> want<00:01:08.729> not

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
throw it off a building if you want not

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.240 
throw it off a building if you want not
that<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.090> recommend<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.950> know<00:01:11.040> again

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
always wondered that because you see

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.330 
always wondered that because you see
these<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.830> know<00:01:16.920> they're<00:01:17.070> meant<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> be

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
