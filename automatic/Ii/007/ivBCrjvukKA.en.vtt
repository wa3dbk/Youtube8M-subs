00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
 the storm in a glass of water 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.809
 There are things that however much people 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.580
 try not to replace 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.939
 and it is precisely those things that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.210
 The more people you need, the more you do not have today. 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.269
 It's over, for example, imagine that you're 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.099
 stopped in traffic and suddenly appears 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.199
 that urge to go to the bathroom 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.719
 half an hour before you had passed by 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.620
 front of a dozen bathrooms but not 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.350
 needed 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.390
 and now you urgently need one and do not 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.430
 has nothing that can replace 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 Of course we do not just do this with 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.020
 bathrooms have many other things 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.629
 we only notice when we do not have 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.000
 or lost we had to send the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.520
 most important messages exactly 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.920
 when they are without internet or doing 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.000
 calls more people only when they are 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.670
 cell phone signal 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.190
 The biggest example is that of the water that has 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.650
 when we are dying of thirst only 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.700
 A glass of water resolves but at the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.799
 to waste 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.840
 nobody stops and thinks that drinking water 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.210
 which is coming down the tail 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.909
 there are a number of solutions to avoid 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.689
 the waste that can be adopted by 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.939
 all 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.610
 the first attitudes are those that 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.770
 everyone knows how to turn the faucet on 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.990
 time to brush your teeth do not sweep the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.259
 sidewalk with the hose taking baths 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.810
 faster but we can go beyond time 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.240
 to be able to choose 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.759
 concern about the conservation of water by 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.640
 example a simple jeans can 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.610
 consume 10 thousand liters of water in their 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.860
 stages of production and transportation is 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.930
 company's duty to innovate to reduce 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.680
 consumption and develop all water for the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.479
 nature 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.610
 many companies are already worrying 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.380
 installing 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.290
 water treatment in their own 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.049
 factories among other solutions 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.240
 there is no excuse nowadays for the government and 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.790
 numerous institutions facilitate the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.700
 implementation of this and other 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.320
 of sustainability without giving up the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.360
 profit 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.820
 and competitiveness are many 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.590
 market technology systems 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.660
 rainwater harvesting 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.150
 humidity sensors for the control of 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.580
 go to sanction or irrigation system by 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.520
 drip to simpler solutions 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.470
 such as taps with generators and 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.530
 automatic closure or vases 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.680
 double-flow toilets which at the end of the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.750
 every home business should have and it's not just 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.480
 question to save money get 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.250
 certified or meet the laws is 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.410
 solve the problems in the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.930
 present and ensure our quality of 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.280
 life in the future but the most 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.070
 important of all 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.709
 and here it makes more difference is to acquire 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.900
 yes awareness awareness 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.430
 no use having more expensive equipment and 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.530
 latest technology 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.480
 after all it is our behavior that 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.340
 defines our destiny 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.250
 so when we need to go to the 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.470
 bathroom in the future we will have no problems 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.930
 sustainability is a new way of 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.330
 to see and act in the world is to forget 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.030
 sites like the practical portal are tips 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.310
 presentations on this topic and many 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.680
 others because whether we want our 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.160
 whole squad is just a glass of water well 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.160
 great
