00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.940

 episode of audio mania the rubric 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.160
 frizzantina where I try to give you gods 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.680
 advice about audio and music 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.840
 sound inside your videos today 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.140
 a special episode because we will do 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.970
 the unboxing of my new purchase a h1 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.890
 zoom one of those external microphones 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 which I also advised you in 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.779
 previous episode and a real e 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:36.660
 own product review with 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:39.559
 so much of test then call to talk and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.559
 away with the initials 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:50.360
 ok let's start with opening the box is 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:01:01.129
 inside there is another box I have 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:01:05.869
 made maybe ok by opening the box there 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.090
 we immediately realize that this is 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.400
 definitely a piece of plastic in 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.619
 actually i'm joking it's really it though 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.030
 very light which can be a 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.700
 advantage especially if you have 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.250
 intend to mount it over yours 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.560
 camera or video camera on the left 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.330
 we have the line out where you can enter 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.460
 your headphone to hear what 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.830
 exactly you are taking up the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.350
 volume control and even more 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.750
 Low space to insert the micro sd 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.330
 who gave us a free 2 gb 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.119
 of capacity that meanwhile benefits us 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.940
 moe we are going to insert it from the other 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.460
 part we find the usb port the key 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.040
 turning on the trash button for 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.190
 delete clips the classic controls 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.860
 to send play back and forth e 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.390
 the input volume controller 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.020
 then it allows you to raise or lower it 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.720
 the incoming signal further in in 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.360
 line where you can attack wanting a 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.869
 another microphone if one of the microphones 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.820
 del of h1 does not satisfy you above 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.280
 we have the system of two 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.940
 microphones for recording 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.040
 this opposite you have the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.290
 very clear rack button for 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.720
 start your recordings and a 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.510
 display where you can monitor the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.700
 input volume of your signal the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.890
 time of your registration and the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.870
 battery charge level 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.790
 in the back you also have 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.920
 these three switches which are these three le 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.200
 gray peaks the first a serves to have 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.350
 a cut on the low frequencies the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.750
 second serves to adjust or not in 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.299
 automatic input signal and 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.079
 third choose the format in which 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.900
 you will then record mp3 or wav this 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.970
 recorder also offers you different types 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.320
 of registration methods 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.540
 this with regards to the mode 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.190
 web and this with regard to the 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.230
 mp3 mode 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.380
 obviously behind we also have the compartment 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.570
 for the battery and the very practical 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.940
 connection for the tripod inside 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.710
 of the box together with the battery e 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.160
 you will also find a micro sd 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.160
 sd micro sd adapter which can be 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.080
 very comfortable inside I found the 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.840
 manuals in three different languages ​​Italian 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.570
 English and French and obviously not 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.459
 I will use none of the three I would say 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.950
 that the time has come also because they are the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.430
 4 am to start doing some 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.080
 test 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.550
 this is recorded with a h1 zoom 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.000
 this is recorded with the microphone 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.890
 inside of the canon 600d is now for 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.490
 conclude even a small test 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.490
 musical 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.260
 3 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.820
 I hope I have been helpful to you 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.320

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.240

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.430

 record in wave mode both 44 and a 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:54.640
 48 that to around 96 thousand
