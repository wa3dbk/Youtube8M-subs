original which I'll show you cuz I have
the<00:00:56.250> original<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.610> me<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.820> well<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.930> see

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the original with me as well you can see

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.340 
the original with me as well you can see
it's<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> dual<00:00:58.350> slider<00:00:59.000> opens<00:01:00.000> up<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.480> 12<00:01:01.079> key

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it's a dual slider opens up for a 12 key

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.090 
it's a dual slider opens up for a 12 key
alphanumeric<00:01:02.329> keypad<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:04.019> well<00:01:04.320> as<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.710> full

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
alphanumeric keypad as well as the full

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.530 
alphanumeric keypad as well as the full
QWERTY<00:01:05.339> keyboard<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.000> showed<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
QWERTY keyboard that we showed you and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.899 
QWERTY keyboard that we showed you and
the<00:01:06.960> keyboard<00:01:07.320> itself<00:01:07.530> has<00:01:07.920> changed<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.610> bit

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
the keyboard itself has changed a bit

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.600 
the keyboard itself has changed a bit
from<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> original<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.930> well<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:11.070> uh<00:01:11.100> let's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
from the original as well so uh let's

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.850 
from the original as well so uh let's
pull<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.150> other<00:01:12.600> ocean<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.560> original

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
pull up the other ocean the original

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.140 
pull up the other ocean the original
ocean<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.820> see<00:01:14.939> what<00:01:15.030> they<00:01:15.119> look

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
ocean and so you can see what they look

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.620 
ocean and so you can see what they look
like<00:01:15.390> compared<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.810> each<00:01:15.900> other<00:01:17.180> in<00:01:18.180> terms<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
like compared to each other in terms of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.280 
like compared to each other in terms of
size<00:01:18.930> they're<00:01:19.799> very<00:01:20.340> much<00:01:20.640> similar<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:22.259> can

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
size they're very much similar you can

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.450 
size they're very much similar you can
see<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.710> really<00:01:22.830> doesn't<00:01:23.070> seem<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
see that it really doesn't seem to be a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.980 
see that it really doesn't seem to be a
whole<00:01:23.610> lot<00:01:23.640> difference<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.150> terms<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.509> basic

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
whole lot difference in terms of basic

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.200 
whole lot difference in terms of basic
dimensions<00:01:25.470> between<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.979> two<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.340> which

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
dimensions between the two of them which

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.569 
dimensions between the two of them which
isn't<00:01:27.390> necessarily<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.960> bad<00:01:27.990> thing

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
isn't necessarily a bad thing

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.859 
isn't necessarily a bad thing
the<00:01:29.579> original<00:01:29.850> ocean<00:01:30.119> while<00:01:30.299> kind<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.689> baked

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the original ocean while kind of baked

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.590 
the original ocean while kind of baked
was<00:01:31.259> pretty<00:01:31.950> usable<00:01:32.130> device<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.000> usable

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
was pretty usable device and usable

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.350 
was pretty usable device and usable
largely<00:01:33.900> because<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.070> keyboard<00:01:35.579> now<00:01:36.299> you

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
largely because of the keyboard now you

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.480 
largely because of the keyboard now you
can<00:01:36.509> see<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.900> original<00:01:37.710> ocean<00:01:38.310> has

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
can see the original ocean has

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.460 
can see the original ocean has
individual<00:01:39.030> keys<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> QWERTY<00:01:39.960> keyboard

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
individual keys on the QWERTY keyboard

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.249 
individual keys on the QWERTY keyboard
where<00:01:40.680> whereas<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.610> new<00:01:42.119> device<00:01:42.420> has<00:01:42.990> like

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
where whereas the new device has like

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.819 
where whereas the new device has like
one<00:01:43.530> membrane<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.790> raised<00:01:45.420> areas

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
one membrane with raised areas

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.249 
one membrane with raised areas
oddly<00:01:47.430> enough<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:48.210> actually<00:01:48.479> prefer<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> new

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
oddly enough I actually prefer the new

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.630 
oddly enough I actually prefer the new
keyboard<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.890> even<00:01:50.159> though<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.340> doesn't<00:01:50.490> have

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
keyboard and even though it doesn't have

keyboard and even though it doesn't have
individual<00:01:51.149> keys<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:52.079> still<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.430> three<00:01:53.430> row

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
individual keys it's still a three row

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.830 
individual keys it's still a three row
layout<00:01:54.000> which<00:01:54.180> means<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.570> little<00:01:54.689> bit

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
layout which means you get a little bit

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.420 
layout which means you get a little bit
of<00:01:54.960> funny<00:01:55.350> stuff<00:01:55.619> going<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.950> here<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
space bar between some of the letters

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.289 
space bar between some of the letters
but<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.469> terms<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:59.009> feel<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.909> keys<00:02:00.090> work

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
but in terms of feel the keys work

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.940 
but in terms of feel the keys work
really<00:02:00.509> well<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.590> find<00:02:01.799> them

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
really well and I just find them

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.499 
really well and I just find them
visually<00:02:02.369> very<00:02:02.549> easy<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.969> see<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.360> know<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
visually very easy to see you know the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.880 
visually very easy to see you know the
large<00:02:03.810> letters<00:02:04.200> make<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.439> really<00:02:04.680> easy<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
large letters make it really easy to

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.560 
large letters make it really easy to
track<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.729> know<00:02:05.820> what<00:02:05.969> you're<00:02:06.090> doing<00:02:06.360> and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
track you know what you're doing and

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.779 
track you know what you're doing and
I've<00:02:07.409> been<00:02:07.619> very<00:02:07.950> pleased<00:02:08.250> with<00:02:08.399> using<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
I've been very pleased with using the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.529 
I've been very pleased with using the
keyboard

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
keyboard

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.070 
keyboard
in<00:02:10.929> terms<00:02:11.170> of<00:02:11.349> the<00:02:11.560> keypads<00:02:12.480> both<00:02:13.480> are<00:02:13.780> quite

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
in terms of the keypads both are quite

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.759 
in terms of the keypads both are quite
similar

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
similar

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.399 
similar
again<00:02:15.190> this<00:02:15.549> is<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.760> membrane<00:02:16.420> type<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.140> new

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
again this is a membrane type on the new

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.259 
again this is a membrane type on the new
ocean<00:02:17.620> -<00:02:17.920> as<00:02:18.069> opposed<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.430> individual<00:02:18.849> keys<00:02:19.090> on

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
ocean - as opposed to individual keys on

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.369 
ocean - as opposed to individual keys on
the<00:02:19.360> original<00:02:19.659> ocean<00:02:19.930> but<00:02:20.049> I<00:02:20.140> don't<00:02:20.290> think

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
the original ocean but I don't think

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.570 
the original ocean but I don't think
anybody's<00:02:20.799> really<00:02:20.860> going<00:02:21.129> to<00:02:21.190> complain<00:02:21.519> about

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
anybody's really going to complain about

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.600 
anybody's really going to complain about
that<00:02:21.900> one<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.140> major<00:02:23.560> changes<00:02:23.920> though<00:02:24.370> is

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
that one of the major changes though is

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.750 
that one of the major changes though is
the<00:02:25.030> d-pad<00:02:25.720> while<00:02:26.409> on<00:02:26.680> they<00:02:26.920> still<00:02:27.310> work<00:02:27.489> both

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the d-pad while on they still work both

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.729 
the d-pad while on they still work both
work<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.599> know<00:02:28.660> up/down<00:02:29.049> functionality

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
work for you know up/down functionality

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.559 
work for you know up/down functionality
and<00:02:29.830> stuff<00:02:30.010> like<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:31.660> new<00:02:33.120> d-pad<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:34.360> the

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
and stuff like that the new d-pad on the

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.910 
and stuff like that the new d-pad on the
new<00:02:34.900> ocean<00:02:35.430> also<00:02:36.430> has<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:37.379> optical<00:02:38.379> joystick

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
new ocean also has a optical joystick

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.559 
new ocean also has a optical joystick
type<00:02:39.099> functionality<00:02:39.640> which<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.090> kind<00:02:40.299> of<00:02:40.360> cool

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
type functionality which is kind of cool

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.190 
type functionality which is kind of cool
right<00:02:41.970> now<00:02:42.970> it's<00:02:43.209> on<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.329> low<00:02:43.510> setting<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:44.079> it's

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
right now it's on a low setting so it's

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.720 
right now it's on a low setting so it's
pretty<00:02:44.319> easy<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.680> control<00:02:44.920> but<00:02:45.129> it<00:02:45.220> actually

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
pretty easy to control but it actually

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.949 
pretty easy to control but it actually
gives<00:02:45.879> you<00:02:45.970> some<00:02:46.180> sort<00:02:46.329> of<00:02:46.450> scrolling

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
gives you some sort of scrolling

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.330 
gives you some sort of scrolling
abilities<00:02:47.349> when<00:02:47.500> you're<00:02:47.620> in<00:02:47.680> long<00:02:47.829> lists<00:02:48.190> and

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
abilities when you're in long lists and

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.160 
abilities when you're in long lists and
things<00:02:48.459> like<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:48.730> -<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.269> that's<00:02:49.840> something

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
things like that - so that's something

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.470 
things like that - so that's something
that's<00:02:50.319> new<00:02:50.500> otherwise<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.790> controls<00:02:52.329> around

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
that's new otherwise the controls around

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.039 
that's new otherwise the controls around
here<00:02:52.810> are<00:02:52.900> all<00:02:52.989> pretty<00:02:53.170> much<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.319> same<00:02:53.470> and

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
here are all pretty much the same and

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.150 
here are all pretty much the same and
like<00:02:56.049> on<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.739> original<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.910> have<00:02:57.940> soft<00:02:58.840> keys

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
like on the original you have soft keys

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.500 
like on the original you have soft keys
in<00:03:00.160> all<00:03:00.370> locations<00:03:00.579> that<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.209> would<00:03:01.329> need

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
in all locations that you would need

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.059 
in all locations that you would need
them<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:01.900> there's<00:03:02.109> a<00:03:02.140> soft<00:03:02.410> key<00:03:02.590> over<00:03:02.799> here<00:03:02.829> on

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
them so there's a soft key over here on

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.710 
them so there's a soft key over here on
the<00:03:03.160> left<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.519> right<00:03:03.670> so<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.390> makes

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
the left and right so it makes

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.449 
the left and right so it makes
everything<00:03:04.959> very<00:03:05.049> consistent<00:03:05.859> very<00:03:05.920> easy<00:03:06.280> to

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
everything very consistent very easy to

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.440 
everything very consistent very easy to
use<00:03:08.099> one<00:03:09.099> of<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.250> things<00:03:09.489> that<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.910> original

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
use one of the things that the original

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.240 
use one of the things that the original
ocean<00:03:10.660> was<00:03:10.780> known<00:03:10.959> for<00:03:11.200> was<00:03:11.410> its<00:03:11.560> male<00:03:11.739> client

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
ocean was known for was its male client

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.009 
ocean was known for was its male client
so<00:03:12.459> we're<00:03:12.609> gonna<00:03:12.700> pull<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:12.970> up<00:03:13.239> it's

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
so we're gonna pull that up it's

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.379 
so we're gonna pull that up it's
actually<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.319> combined<00:03:14.849> messaging<00:03:15.849> client<00:03:16.299> it

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
actually a combined messaging client it

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.409 
actually a combined messaging client it
supports<00:03:17.069> instant<00:03:18.069> messaging<00:03:18.459> text<00:03:18.880> MMS

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
supports instant messaging text MMS

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.860 
supports instant messaging text MMS
