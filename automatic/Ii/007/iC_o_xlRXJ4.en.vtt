00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
out i've tested on variety of fabrics

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.479 
out i've tested on variety of fabrics
but<00:00:36.930> always<00:00:37.079> test<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.620> scratch<00:00:37.920> we're<00:00:38.340> using

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
but always test a scratch we're using

but always test a scratch we're using
any<00:00:38.790> markers<00:00:39.710> so<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> right<00:00:41.550> side<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
any markers so this is the right side of

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.410 
any markers so this is the right side of
my<00:00:42.480> second<00:00:42.989> seam<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.280> that's<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.149> seemed

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
my second seam and that's the seemed

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.680 
my second seam and that's the seemed
right<00:00:45.450> there<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.670> second<00:00:47.670> edge<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
right there this is the second edge to

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.470 
right there this is the second edge to
go<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:48.960> there<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:50.250> am<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.910> use<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.120> pin

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
go on there and I am going to use a pin

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.180 
go on there and I am going to use a pin
here<00:00:54.410> just<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:56.239> temporarily<00:00:57.559> align<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.890> so

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
here just to temporarily align this so

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.860 
here just to temporarily align this so
you<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.699> here<00:01:00.000> that's<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.270> guide<00:01:00.539> for

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
you can see here that's the guide for

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.229 
you can see here that's the guide for
where<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.079> place<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.530> seam<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.250> I'm<00:01:03.000> going

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
where to place this seam and I'm going

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.240 
where to place this seam and I'm going
to<00:01:03.329> put<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:04.220> right<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.280> top<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
to put this right on top of that and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:18.230 
to put this right on top of that and
then<00:01:09.409> put<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.799> pin<00:01:11.760> just<00:01:12.479> barely<00:01:13.400> through<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:17.240> so

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
then put a pin just barely through it so

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.910 
then put a pin just barely through it so
that<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> looks<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:20.570> this<00:01:21.570> okay<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.500> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that it looks like this okay so that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.950 
that it looks like this okay so that
seam<00:01:23.220> line<00:01:23.430> matches<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:24.060> everything<00:01:24.570> matches

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
seam line matches up everything matches

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.300 
seam line matches up everything matches
that<00:01:24.990> pretty<00:01:25.350> well<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.680> might<00:01:25.799> move<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.189> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that pretty well we might move it up a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.570 
that pretty well we might move it up a
little<00:01:26.430> bit

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.260 

okay<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:33.500> matches<00:01:33.830> up<00:01:33.980> well<00:01:34.130> now<00:01:35.030> when<00:01:35.240> I

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
okay so that matches up well now when I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.180 
okay so that matches up well now when I
do<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.600> second<00:01:35.930> side<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.290> my<00:01:36.470> zipper<00:01:36.920> I

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.180 
do the second side of my zipper I
usually<00:01:37.760> start<00:01:38.060> from<00:01:38.270> this<00:01:38.450> end<00:01:38.870> and<00:01:39.200> I<00:01:39.860> stitch

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
usually start from this end and I stitch

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.750 
usually start from this end and I stitch
to<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.520> top<00:01:40.730> and<00:01:40.940> that's<00:01:41.240> fine<00:01:41.570> I've<00:01:42.170> done<00:01:42.470> it

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
second side from here at the top that's

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.370 
second side from here at the top that's
fine<00:01:53.180> but<00:01:53.480> remember<00:01:53.900> you're<00:01:54.020> going<00:01:54.200> to<00:01:54.260> have

fine but remember you're going to have

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.800 
fine but remember you're going to have
the<00:01:54.560> garment<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:55.580> crammed<00:01:56.090> into<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.570> sole

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
the garment so crammed into the sole

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:11.070 
the garment so crammed into the sole
space<00:01:57.200> here<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:57.800> let's<00:01:58.460> just<00:01:58.640> based<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:09.729> then

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
space here so let's just based and then

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:53.850 
space here so let's just based and then
switch<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:24.080> we'll<00:02:24.950> sew<00:02:25.310> up<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.820> other<00:02:26.060> side

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.089 

and<00:02:54.860> once<00:02:55.280> again<00:02:55.480> trim<00:02:56.480> off<00:02:56.750> all<00:02:57.290> your<00:02:57.650> threads

and once again trim off all your threads
don't<00:02:58.700> leave<00:02:58.879> them<00:02:59.060> hanging<00:02:59.209> around<00:02:59.629> so<00:02:59.870> they

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
don't leave them hanging around so they

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.570 
don't leave them hanging around so they
can<00:03:00.140> tangle<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.650> make<00:03:00.860> me<00:03:01.069> him<00:03:02.410> okay<00:03:03.410> now<00:03:04.250> this

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
can tangle and make me him okay now this

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.850 
can tangle and make me him okay now this
is<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.790> sort<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.480> test<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:06.110> see<00:03:06.349> how<00:03:06.830> well

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
is a sort of the test to see how well

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.920 
is a sort of the test to see how well
