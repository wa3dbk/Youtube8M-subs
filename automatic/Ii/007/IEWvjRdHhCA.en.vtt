practical world vibrations are

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.150 
practical world vibrations are
transmitted<00:00:49.180> from<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.570> transducers<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.620> the

rest<00:00:51.340> of<00:00:51.490> the<00:00:51.580> cabinet<00:00:51.760> and<00:00:52.090> so<00:00:52.330> we<00:00:52.960> have<00:00:53.110> to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
rest of the cabinet and so we have to

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.580 
rest of the cabinet and so we have to
put<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.350> lot<00:00:53.500> of<00:00:53.590> effort<00:00:53.890> into<00:00:54.480> analyzing<00:00:55.590> how

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
put a lot of effort into analyzing how

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.040 
put a lot of effort into analyzing how
that<00:00:56.890> vibration<00:00:57.579> is<00:00:57.820> communicated<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:58.870> the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
that vibration is communicated to the

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.920 
that vibration is communicated to the
cabinet<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.650> how<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.520> cabinet<00:01:01.120> vibrates<00:01:01.690> in

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
cabinet and how the cabinet vibrates in

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.210 
cabinet and how the cabinet vibrates in
response<00:01:02.380> to<00:01:02.650> that<00:01:03.250> mechanical<00:01:04.079> energy<00:01:05.220> so

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
response to that mechanical energy so

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.670 
response to that mechanical energy so
that<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.939> cabinet<00:01:07.329> does<00:01:07.810> itself<00:01:08.350> does<00:01:08.649> not

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
that the cabinet does itself does not

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.069 
that the cabinet does itself does not
radiate<00:01:09.130> sound<00:01:09.790> that<00:01:10.030> will<00:01:10.149> undo<00:01:10.689> all<00:01:10.930> the

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
radiate sound that will undo all the

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.719 
radiate sound that will undo all the
good<00:01:11.110> work<00:01:11.439> that's<00:01:11.500> that's<00:01:12.070> created<00:01:12.520> by<00:01:12.670> the

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
good work that's that's created by the

good work that's that's created by the
by<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.210> transducers

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.930 

well<00:01:18.260> if<00:01:18.380> we<00:01:18.500> identify<00:01:18.650> by<00:01:19.280> acoustical

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
well if we identify by acoustical

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.140 
well if we identify by acoustical
measurements<00:01:20.480> first<00:01:20.870> that<00:01:21.350> there<00:01:21.560> is

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
measurements first that there is

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.120 
measurements first that there is
unwanted<00:01:23.150> radiation<00:01:23.960> then<00:01:24.290> we<00:01:24.500> go<00:01:24.710> looking

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
unwanted radiation then we go looking

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.850 
unwanted radiation then we go looking
for<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.730> source<00:01:26.000> of<00:01:26.210> that<00:01:26.270> radiation<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.290> we

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
for the source of that radiation and we

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.050 
for the source of that radiation and we
do<00:01:28.040> this<00:01:28.220> with<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.550> scanning<00:01:28.850> laser

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
do this with the scanning laser

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.180 
do this with the scanning laser
vibrometer<00:01:29.390> which<00:01:30.080> is<00:01:30.230> really<00:01:30.410> a<00:01:30.500> laser<00:01:30.770> beam

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
vibrometer which is really a laser beam

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.390 
vibrometer which is really a laser beam
that<00:01:31.520> scans<00:01:32.270> in<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:32.930> raster<00:01:33.860> fashion

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
that scans in a raster fashion

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.030 
that scans in a raster fashion
horizontal<00:01:35.180> lines<00:01:35.479> that<00:01:35.870> then<00:01:36.140> move<00:01:36.380> over<00:01:36.710> a

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
horizontal lines that then move over a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.360 
horizontal lines that then move over a
surface<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:37.880> in<00:01:38.660> doing<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:38.960> they<00:01:39.560> allow<00:01:39.860> us<00:01:40.040> to

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
surface and in doing so they allow us to

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.230 
surface and in doing so they allow us to
visualize<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.930> see<00:01:42.260> actually<00:01:43.040> how<00:01:43.250> different
