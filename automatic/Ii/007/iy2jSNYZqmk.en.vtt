00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.740 
and what I think they should have done
they<00:01:57.350> should<00:01:57.530> have<00:01:57.650> just<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.510> allowed<00:01:59.510> people

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
they should have just and allowed people

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.110 
they should have just and allowed people
to<00:01:59.900> use<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.560> wrong<00:02:00.710> classes<00:02:01.190> so<00:02:01.850> instead<00:02:02.060> of

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
to use the wrong classes so instead of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.440 
to use the wrong classes so instead of
