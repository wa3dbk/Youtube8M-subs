silver edging we can go right up to

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.330 
silver edging we can go right up to
those<00:02:28.630> lines<00:02:28.990> but<00:02:29.710> we<00:02:29.860> don't<00:02:30.010> have<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.220> worry

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
those lines but we don't have to worry

know maybe about five minutes depending
on<00:02:50.890> your<00:02:50.950> climate<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:52.560> then<00:02:53.560> they're<00:02:53.739> ready

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
on your climate and then they're ready

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.610 
on your climate and then they're ready
to<00:02:54.190> use<00:02:54.370> it's<00:02:54.580> really<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:55.180> simple<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:56.410> nice

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
myself so we don't have to worry about

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.370 
myself so we don't have to worry about
it<00:04:15.190> too<00:04:15.400> much<00:04:16.229> let<00:04:17.229> that<00:04:17.410> dry

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
it too much let that dry

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.590 
it too much let that dry
and<00:04:20.250> then<00:04:20.459> continue<00:04:22.040> to<00:04:23.040> mark<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.460> sauce<00:04:23.670> it

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
and then continue to mark the sauce it

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.450 
and then continue to mark the sauce it
reminds<00:04:24.990> not<00:04:25.260> dark<00:04:25.530> enough<00:04:25.740> for<00:04:25.950> you<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.100> can

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
reminds not dark enough for you you can

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.360 
reminds not dark enough for you you can
come<00:04:26.640> back<00:04:26.790> in<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.780> do<00:04:28.350> a<00:04:28.380> second<00:04:28.800> coat<00:04:29.010> but

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
come back in and do a second coat but

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.980 
come back in and do a second coat but
this<00:04:29.490> is<00:04:29.640> really<00:04:29.880> so<00:04:30.090> much<00:04:30.120> easier<00:04:30.630> than<00:04:30.780> if<00:04:30.870> we

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
this is really so much easier than if we

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.170 
this is really so much easier than if we
tried<00:04:31.230> to<00:04:31.350> paint<00:04:31.470> stripes<00:04:31.880> with<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:32.910> brush
