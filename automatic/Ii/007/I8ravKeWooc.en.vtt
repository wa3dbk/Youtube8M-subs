and<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> biggest<00:00:34.890> investment<00:00:35.550> we've

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
and it's the biggest investment we've

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.580 
and it's the biggest investment we've

actually made in our history and the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.990 
actually made in our history and the
first<00:00:37.800> stage<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.430> which<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.850> really

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
first stage of that which is really

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.150 
first stage of that which is really
exciting<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.809> deployment<00:00:40.380> of<00:00:40.649> five<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.130> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
exciting is a deployment of five and a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.819 
exciting is a deployment of five and a
half<00:00:41.309> thousand<00:00:41.850> CFC<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.989> laptops<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.680> those

half thousand CFC one laptops to those
frontline<00:00:44.160> engineers<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.600> was<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:45.930> we

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
frontline engineers and it was really we

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.750 
frontline engineers and it was really we
chose<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.530> start<00:00:46.800> there<00:00:47.070> because<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.580> was<00:00:47.670> an

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
chose to start there because it was an

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.980 
chose to start there because it was an
area<00:00:47.910> where<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.570> make<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> big<00:00:48.960> difference

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
area where we can make a big difference

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.100 
area where we can make a big difference
by<00:00:49.650> deploying<00:00:50.340> those<00:00:50.580> new<00:00:50.820> devices<00:00:51.390> with

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
by deploying those new devices with

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.590 
by deploying those new devices with
Windows<00:00:52.500> 8<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.980> new<00:00:53.100> operating<00:00:53.490> system<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
Windows 8 as a new operating system to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.400 
Windows 8 as a new operating system to
really<00:00:54.750> address<00:00:55.110> some<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.380> challenges

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
really address some of the challenges

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.360 
really address some of the challenges
we're<00:00:56.040> facing<00:00:56.070> around<00:00:56.760> device<00:00:57.570> speed

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
we're facing around device speed

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.280 
we're facing around device speed
connectivity<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.940> reliability<00:01:00.420> we've

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
connectivity and reliability we've

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.380 
connectivity and reliability we've
started<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:01.910> increases<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:02.940> our

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
started to see increases in our

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.390 
started to see increases in our
engineers<00:01:03.930> productivity<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> result<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
engineers productivity as a result of

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.760 
engineers productivity as a result of
using<00:01:05.549> Toughbook<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.229> speak<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.619> many

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
using Toughbook so if you speak to many

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.109 
using Toughbook so if you speak to many
engineers<00:01:08.159> about<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.549> they'll<00:01:08.700> say<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.000> this

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
engineers about it they'll say that this

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.520 
engineers about it they'll say that this
can<00:01:09.270> say<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.630> them<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.869> know<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.320> an<00:01:10.409> hour

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
can say for them you know up to an hour

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.260 
can say for them you know up to an hour
an<00:01:10.710> hour<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.979> half<00:01:11.100> perhaps<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.909> some<00:01:12.149> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
an hour and a half perhaps in some of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.580 
an hour and a half perhaps in some of
their<00:01:12.390> working<00:01:12.540> day<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.079> that<00:01:13.200> simply<00:01:13.560> means

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
their working day and that simply means

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.230 
their working day and that simply means
that<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:14.009> can<00:01:14.189> get<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.460> more<00:01:14.610> customers<00:01:14.790> on

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
that we can get to more customers on

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.940 
that we can get to more customers on
time<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.720> give<00:01:15.810> better<00:01:15.990> service<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.770> tough

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
time and give better service the tough

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.350 
time and give better service the tough
books<00:01:17.189> made<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> lot<00:01:17.670> easier<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:18.090> our

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
books made it a lot easier for our

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.539 
books made it a lot easier for our
engineers<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.259> get<00:01:19.409> around<00:01:19.740> because<00:01:20.219> they've

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
engineers to get around because they've

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.520 
engineers to get around because they've
got<00:01:20.789> connectivity<00:01:21.539> an<00:01:21.990> animation<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
got connectivity an animation that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.499 
got connectivity an animation that
starts<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.340> works<00:01:23.490> when<00:01:23.700> they<00:01:23.819> need<00:01:23.999> it<00:01:24.030> it

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
starts up and works when they need it it

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.940 
starts up and works when they need it it
really<00:01:24.719> means<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.679> go

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
really means that they can you know go

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.260 
really means that they can you know go
through<00:01:25.979> their<00:01:26.429> day's<00:01:26.700> work

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
through their day's work

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.879 
through their day's work
without<00:01:27.509> having<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.990> go<00:01:28.109> back<00:01:28.139> to<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.469> telephone

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:28.889 
without having to go back to a telephone

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.289 
without having to go back to a telephone
exchange<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.609> connect<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.210> know

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
exchange and connect to it you know

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.899 
exchange and connect to it you know
hardwired<00:01:30.749> broadband<00:01:31.679> and<00:01:31.950> download<00:01:32.729> so

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
hardwired broadband and download so

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.609 
hardwired broadband and download so
they've<00:01:33.060> got<00:01:33.179> their<00:01:33.359> own<00:01:33.389> you<00:01:34.109> know<00:01:34.170> office

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
they've got their own you know office

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.980 
they've got their own you know office
home<00:01:35.219> from<00:01:35.490> home<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:36.420> them<00:01:36.569> as<00:01:36.689> they<00:01:36.810> travel

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
home from home with them as they travel

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.809 
home from home with them as they travel
about<00:01:37.289> it's<00:01:37.499> made<00:01:37.649> things<00:01:37.679> much<00:01:38.159> easier<00:01:38.609> for

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
about it's made things much easier for

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.309 
about it's made things much easier for
them<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.270> device<00:01:39.509> helps<00:01:39.719> with<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:39.990> customer

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
them the device helps with the customer

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.529 
them the device helps with the customer
interface<00:01:40.639> because<00:01:41.639> it<00:01:41.880> switches<00:01:42.209> very

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
interface because it switches very

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.120 
interface because it switches very
easily<00:01:42.719> from<00:01:43.109> being<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.469> laptop<00:01:43.889> to<00:01:44.039> a<00:01:44.069> tablet

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
easily from being a laptop to a tablet

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.429 
easily from being a laptop to a tablet
so<00:01:44.819> a<00:01:44.850> good<00:01:45.029> example<00:01:45.389> would<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.689> where

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
so a good example would be where
