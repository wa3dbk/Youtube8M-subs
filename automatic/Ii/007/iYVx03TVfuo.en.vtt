00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.050
 hello to all and all its angles 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.840
 highlights is found on the game call of 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.060
 black duty ops two not on a party 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.550
 in multi or zombies but on the mode 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.529
 custom party as you have it 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.990
 noticed I'm all alone it's not 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.040
 to play a game against someone 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.960
 it's just to show you 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.710
 a little bug on the maintained october 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.960
 2025 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.490
 so here it is a little balm mercier 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.489
 not a goal that will win you 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.230
 something or not actually for 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.309
 find two three four video games 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.079
 in this video game to see blackhawks 2 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.960
 so that's what's good is that 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.620
 the brothers team are handed a version 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.850
 future of newton in this game in the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.800
 following the black earth 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.410
 the only thing that is I find average 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.449
 personally is that paris are in 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.309
 general but also so if we want to do 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.760
 than nme and we want to come across 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.000
 this card is dead and it's a 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.870
 downloadable fnac card so all the 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.329
 the world is not so that's when I start 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.979
 to part the purpose of this bug is to 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.670
 destroy the heads of all the dummies 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.040
 in the map and outside giono map 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.549
 when we see them all in less than 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.130
 two minutes 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.200
 so I'm alone it's better 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.710
 to do a two or three years spread 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.030
 tasks and it's faster when 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.740
 from a beef to models who is hiding 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.219
 obviously not to forget 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.259
 sorry and be careful 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.630
 obviously not to go over time 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.570
 is that two minutes 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.969
 less than two minutes to destroy the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.289
 head of every morning so that's it then 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:57.020
 put second know also is that two 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.490
 minutes that's it and it can 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.009
 seem long but it's very very short 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.719
 especially and 7 maps may seem small and 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.820
 when we are all alone doing this for 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.700
 destroy the heads of all the dummies 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:14.800
 and suddenly becomes 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.000
 big and two minutes it becomes a 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.920
 minute turns into a few 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.780
 second I feel like I'm going 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.000
 do not lie to you this video that makes the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:28.090
 seventh time I 'm trying so that's it 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.519
 so already I destroy the head 2 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.560
 maintain the first house and 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.560
 be careful to aim your head as well 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.560
 my fault with nalaga people then 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.850
 she was also the models in 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.650
 out of the mark as you can 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.709
 to see right behind there are two 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.370
 and cecile of the canteen when they are there 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.890
 to destroy 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:58.340
 So here it is 48 seconds is ok 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.340
 I am wide enough 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.840
 so here it stays all the back 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.760
 here to do but obviously has not 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.569
 the longer the house stays 33 seconds 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:16.430
 I think it's feasible it's very 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:19.489
 feasible we see the tension attention 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.950
 especially not to forget one 21 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.440
 second hands for the time this 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.230
 situation you look down left 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.860
 of your screen and you have time to 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.190
 the part 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.549
 and if it goes below 8 minutes 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.610
 it's dead, so the 6 seconds 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:44.200
 but here I am normally 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:47.480
 I hope we're going to check 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.769
 so physically manage I officiated 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.799
 has no others and if there are others 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.860
 it's dead so we'll check them on 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.269
 the screen sail I managed the bug in 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.489
 less than two minutes destroy the whole 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.400
 head of being drunk actively to destroy 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.620
 all the heads of all the models 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.519
 in the map 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.470
 so then I must have done 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:11.150
 in less than 2 minutes you go 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:14.690
 in front of the screen here where he wrote the 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.039
 number of people then there for that and 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.060
 you see a change in the panel 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:21.979
 then there is written activision-blizzard square 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.099
 to play so you keep square 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.389
 you see the character's hands 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.960
 which he moves with joystick and you see 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.400
 a video game 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.099
 so to change video game you 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.660
 press r2 or l2 to return to 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:36.400
 back 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:40.160
 that's it then I do not know how my day 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:44.270
 so that's so it's a little bug 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.280
 obviously it's not a big 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.720
 bug but it's a mega it's funny 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.740
 still from the team 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.320
 treyarch and here you are remember on 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.180
 square to leave 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.480
 finally here you have you have the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.220
 bundle october 2001 therefore does have the 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.640
 orders it's very simple it's enough 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.640
 ok it's good 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.660
 so to start the game you press 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.720
 just on start 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.610
 on the web start and you play it like 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.610
 his sister part good here I am dead 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.460
 afterwards to relaunch the game 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.490
 so here I do not know what it takes 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.000
 to make my little one stay on people 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.740
 here is after you to discover the games 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.180
 not I wanted to just watch then there I 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:39.630
 do not know what to do mark 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:42.349
 so catch up with the bombs with that yeah 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:47.789
 and there, what should we do 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:50.400
 here we have a plane and it takes 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:55.639
 avoid it that's complicated I you 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:58.099
 leave that so you found the 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.020
