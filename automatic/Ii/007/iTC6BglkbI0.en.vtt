00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.850 
some nice effects you can change the
audio<00:01:43.240> flike<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.780> dialogue<00:01:44.230> and<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.440> music

audio flike the dialogue and the music
and<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:45.310> can<00:01:45.430> also<00:01:45.520> slow<00:01:45.760> down<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:46.000> footage

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
and you can also slow down the footage

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.540 
and you can also slow down the footage
all<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:46.660> way<00:01:46.780> down<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.440> five<00:01:47.830> percent<00:01:48.070> which

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
all the way down to five percent which

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.370 
all the way down to five percent which
is<00:01:48.670> really<00:01:48.970> nice<00:01:49.150> so<00:01:49.600> let's<00:01:49.630> head<00:01:49.870> into<00:01:50.080> the

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
that I use the most is the free camera

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.080 
that I use the most is the free camera

intensity to three ok so right now this
shot<00:02:31.750> looks<00:02:31.989> pretty<00:02:32.230> boring<00:02:32.530> with<00:02:32.800> this<00:02:32.890> one

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130

set camera just like this so what you

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.050 
set camera just like this so what you
can<00:02:35.440> do<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.709> actually<00:02:35.950> set<00:02:36.340> another<00:02:36.610> marker

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
can do is actually set another marker

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.030 
can do is actually set another marker
further<00:02:37.390> ahead<00:02:37.630> of<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.080> timeline<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.800> then

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
further ahead of the timeline and then

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.800 
further ahead of the timeline and then
you<00:02:39.100> can<00:02:39.250> edit<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.700> camera<00:02:40.120> too<00:02:40.239> maybe<00:02:40.480> let's

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
you can edit that camera too maybe let's

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.000 
you can edit that camera too maybe let's
say<00:02:41.519> up<00:02:42.519> here<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:44.230> let's<00:02:44.380> save<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.620> one<00:02:44.890> as

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
say up here so let's save that one as

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.470 
say up here so let's save that one as
well<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.459> then<00:02:45.760> if<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:45.940> go<00:02:46.060> back<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.390> the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
other camera which we just placed out so

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.800 
other camera which we just placed out so

now it looks like this so you can get

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.240 
now it looks like this so you can get
really<00:02:59.050> really<00:02:59.380> creative<00:02:59.620> with<00:02:59.920> lots<00:03:00.100> of

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250

let's try to make a dramatic running
scene<00:03:06.430> on<00:03:06.580> Franklin<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.420> let's<00:03:07.720> see<00:03:07.930> here<00:03:08.320> zoom

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
scene on Franklin so let's see here zoom

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.280 
scene on Franklin so let's see here zoom
in<00:03:09.160> a<00:03:09.190> little<00:03:09.340> bit<00:03:09.519> let's<00:03:10.510> try<00:03:10.690> some<00:03:10.870> effects

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
in a little bit let's try some effects

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.870 
in a little bit let's try some effects
let's<00:03:11.500> see<00:03:11.620> let's<00:03:11.830> try<00:03:11.980> some<00:03:12.160> filters<00:03:12.580> okay

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
let's see let's try some filters okay

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.340 
let's see let's try some filters okay
let's<00:03:13.030> go<00:03:13.120> with<00:03:13.269> this<00:03:13.330> one<00:03:13.570> then<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:13.930> select<00:03:14.260> the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
let's go with this one then I select the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.720
