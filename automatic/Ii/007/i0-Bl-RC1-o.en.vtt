running<00:00:46.930> cycling<00:00:47.199> skiing<00:00:47.650> you<00:00:48.250> know<00:00:48.280> all<00:00:48.400> that

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
running cycling skiing you know all that

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:50.010 
running cycling skiing you know all that
body<00:00:48.790> heat<00:00:49.030> builds<00:00:49.329> up<00:00:49.450> on<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.629> inside<00:00:49.870> of<00:00:49.899> a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
body heat builds up on the inside of a

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.990 
body heat builds up on the inside of a
jacket<00:00:50.410> we're<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.129> one<00:00:51.280> technology<00:00:51.850> that

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
jacket we're the one technology that

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.180 
jacket we're the one technology that
allows<00:00:52.180> that<00:00:52.390> vapor<00:00:52.750> to<00:00:53.020> leave<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.620> jacket<00:00:54.040> in

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
allows that vapor to leave the jacket in

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.340 
allows that vapor to leave the jacket in
vapor<00:00:54.460> form<00:00:54.640> now<00:00:55.360> we<00:00:55.420> keep<00:00:55.629> you<00:00:55.750> dry<00:00:55.989> from<00:00:56.289> the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
vapor form now we keep you dry from the

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.080 
vapor form now we keep you dry from the
rain<00:00:56.440> on<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:56.829> outside<00:00:57.160> as<00:00:57.309> well<00:00:57.340> so<00:00:57.850> we're

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
rain on the outside as well so we're

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.000 
rain on the outside as well so we're
windproof<00:00:58.480> waterproof<00:00:58.750> and<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.860> most

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
windproof waterproof and the most

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.040 
windproof waterproof and the most
breathable<00:01:00.309> you<00:01:01.059> know<00:01:01.180> Chad<00:01:01.420> I<00:01:01.449> think<00:01:01.719> I<00:01:01.809> kind

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
breathable you know Chad I think I kind

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.209 
breathable you know Chad I think I kind
of<00:01:02.110> need<00:01:02.260> a<00:01:02.289> little<00:01:02.530> proof<00:01:02.890> about<00:01:03.070> this

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
of need a little proof about this

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.060 
of need a little proof about this
waterproof<00:01:04.119> breathable<00:01:04.590> technology<00:01:05.590> let's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
waterproof breathable technology let's

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.740 
waterproof breathable technology let's
see<00:01:06.220> what<00:01:06.310> that's<00:01:06.460> all<00:01:06.640> about<00:01:06.700> so<00:01:07.420> this<00:01:07.570> is<00:01:07.720> a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
see what that's all about so this is a

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.320 
see what that's all about so this is a
demonstration<00:01:07.990> we<00:01:08.680> use<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:09.100> show<00:01:10.090> how<00:01:10.300> the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
demonstration we use to show how the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.450 
demonstration we use to show how the
product<00:01:10.869> breeze<00:01:11.080> so<00:01:11.920> we've<00:01:12.039> got<00:01:12.190> a<00:01:12.220> very

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
product breeze so we've got a very

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.370 
product breeze so we've got a very
simple<00:01:12.899> contraption<00:01:13.899> here<00:01:14.020> basically

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
simple contraption here basically

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.020 
simple contraption here basically
pumping<00:01:14.830> air<00:01:14.979> underneath<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.640> three-layer

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
pumping air underneath a three-layer

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.940 
pumping air underneath a three-layer
laminate<00:01:16.509> this<00:01:16.960> would<00:01:17.080> be<00:01:17.110> a<00:01:17.200> common<00:01:17.560> laminate

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
laminate this would be a common laminate

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.100 
laminate this would be a common laminate
used<00:01:18.160> in<00:01:18.369> a<00:01:18.490> in<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:18.850> rainproof<00:01:19.110> waterproof

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
used in a in a rainproof waterproof

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.790 
used in a in a rainproof waterproof
jacket<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:22.360> you<00:01:22.479> can<00:01:22.599> see<00:01:22.780> on<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:22.959> top<00:01:23.170> as

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
jacket if you can see on the top as

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.100 
jacket if you can see on the top as
bubbles<00:01:24.310> forming<00:01:24.700> on<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.720> simulates

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
bubbles forming on that that simulates

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.870 
bubbles forming on that that simulates
what<00:01:26.800> happens<00:01:27.190> when<00:01:27.310> your<00:01:27.429> body<00:01:27.610> when<00:01:27.819> you

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
what happens when your body when you

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.889 
what happens when your body when you
build<00:01:28.060> up<00:01:28.179> heat<00:01:28.300> on<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.509> inside<00:01:28.720> of<00:01:28.750> your

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
build up heat on the inside of your

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.020 
build up heat on the inside of your
jacket<00:01:29.319> the<00:01:30.099> heat<00:01:30.280> vapor<00:01:30.490> can<00:01:30.729> leave<00:01:30.880> the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
jacket the heat vapor can leave the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.150 
jacket the heat vapor can leave the
jacket<00:01:31.450> now<00:01:31.840> it's<00:01:31.990> also<00:01:32.170> waterproof<00:01:32.560> so<00:01:33.039> the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160
