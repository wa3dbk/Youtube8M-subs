00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.680
 you can get a recipe that a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.540
 My friend, my name is janaína caetano. 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.049

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.170
 banana split light as it can be a 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.640
 banana split in that thing full of 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.130
 fat does not nowadays would make 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.530
 a nice and legal way , and that any 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.150
 one I could do at home and come 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.369
 remembering that all the ingredients of the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.270
 the description of the video in the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.340
 youtube 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.659
 so let's go and do our homework here 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.250
 band is it that we need 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.350
 Manage everything an ice cream 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.619
 What are we going to use as ice cream and 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.329
 urt good frozen remains frozen up 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.549
 You froze the guti he goes to work. 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.460
 that you have to make you leave it at 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.890
 freezer for an hour and a half exactly 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.960
 If you get past this, it will get very hard and 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.899
 can fail and if you stay less than you 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.270
 It gets very soft so an hour and a half is 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.219
 the ideal 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.049
 My son, but the test in your house. 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.820
 but it should not be very different from that 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.579
 And what were we going to do? 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.259
 flavors I got here an ultimatum to 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.540
 any brand you choose the brand 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.190
 of your preference and I'll put it here 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:20.239
 everything is a teaspoon of car 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.580
 chocolate powder and that is the ete know 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.430
 esso shell is chocolate milk powder 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.810
 because it has to be light recipe then the 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.840
 people will make our taste of 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.349
 chocolate here mixing the chocolate in 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.940
 powder 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.700
 before putting it in the freezer then 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.650
 a fine blend here and after dinho 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.360
 a study shows that you now how it is 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.120
 that will make another taste and put a 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.160
 coffee spoon just fine even cooking 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.900
 so on the essence of vanilla 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.750
 look and then we will mix for 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.920
 make our vanilla flavor and then 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.769
 that you mix well 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.290
 You close like that again and leave it there. 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.209
 in the freezer an hour and a half and then the pocket 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.579
 come back here did not show the next one. 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.470
 step for you 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.150
 good then after our yogurt 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.940
 becoming child it is obvious that they do not stay 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.340
 any consistency of yours is only then of the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.920
 Ice cream they get a little more grinder 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.690
 and such but that's just a detail because 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.180
 It looks wonderful and I do that. 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.370
 procedure because it stays longer 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.840
 So, this is how the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.420
 people are going to come back here to our banana 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.609

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.579
