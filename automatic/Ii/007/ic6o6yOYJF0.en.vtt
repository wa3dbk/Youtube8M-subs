 Y 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.320
 and 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.010
 do not 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.309
 all right 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.950
 Hi, I'm like a pedrona and in this 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.559
 opportunity I'm trying the guitar 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.960
 of the brand and aitor to be model jota tlt 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.079
 it's a pretty versatile guitar from a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.960
 classic body 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.159
 the body is made of maple has the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.080
 particularity that the strings 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.000
 enter through the back what 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.520
 gives more support to the guitar 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 fingerboard is of rosewood and enters traveler 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.840
 we have hydraulic plugs and the typical 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.729
 logo of the brand 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.500
 as for electronics it has two acid 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.000
 pretty good that's pretty 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.039
 surprising for the price that it has is 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.270
 avoid that pretty economical guitar 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:30.460
 but in terms of quality it's incredible 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.329
 it's a basic and nothing simple in a 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.329
 classic combination 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.450
 selector of three positions one volume and 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.360
 a tone is true that the tones of this 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.920
 guitar are pretty pretty changes 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.920
 in the three conditions 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.030
 d 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.950
 all right 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.600
 one really that the sound of the 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.830
 guitar is amazing is not enough 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.930
 versatile and has a pretty tone 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.010
 balanced since it's a guitar 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.580
 highly recommended 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.580
 and 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.170
 ah
