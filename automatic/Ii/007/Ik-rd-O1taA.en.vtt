00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
from 14 to a hundred and then apply this

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.920 
from 14 to a hundred and then apply this
to<00:02:20.140> our<00:02:20.170> board<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:24.099> now<00:02:24.609> as<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:24.819> touch<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.450> the

strong because we've reduced the
sensitivity<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:32.170> not<00:02:32.379> strong<00:02:32.709> enough<00:02:33.010> to

an<00:03:12.909> overlay<00:03:13.359> in<00:03:13.599> this<00:03:14.230> case<00:03:14.560> two<00:03:15.430> millimeters

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
an overlay in this case two millimeters

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.349 
of clear acrylic to our design affects
the<00:03:19.870> sensitivity<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.829> how<00:03:21.340> we<00:03:21.400> can<00:03:21.729> tune<00:03:22.000> for

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
the sensitivity and how we can tune for

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:31.500 
the sensitivity and how we can tune for
it<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:29.290> if<00:03:29.409> I<00:03:29.530> go<00:03:29.680> back<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.669> other<00:03:30.879> CapSense

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
it so if I go back to the other CapSense

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.280 
it so if I go back to the other CapSense
input<00:03:32.400> with<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.430> original<00:03:34.030> settings<00:03:34.449> you<00:03:35.139> can

input with the original settings you can

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.580 
input with the original settings you can

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
see as I touch it some signal is

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.390 
see as I touch it some signal is
detected<00:03:39.359> but<00:03:40.359> not<00:03:40.599> enough<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.709> even<00:03:41.889> make<00:03:42.190> the

red<00:03:42.579> bar<00:03:42.819> move<00:03:43.590> we<00:03:44.590> can<00:03:44.769> make<00:03:44.829> this<00:03:45.190> design

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
red bar move we can make this design

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.270 
red bar move we can make this design
more<00:03:45.879> sensitive<00:03:46.599> now<00:03:46.629> by<00:03:47.560> reducing<00:03:48.159> the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
more sensitive now by reducing the

more sensitive now by reducing the
idec's<00:03:48.729> setting<00:03:49.150> I'm<00:03:49.750> going<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.049> choose<00:03:50.319> three

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
idec's setting I'm going to choose three

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:58.770 
idec's setting I'm going to choose three
and<00:03:51.780> applying<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.229> our<00:03:53.349> board<00:03:56.970> now<00:03:57.970> as<00:03:58.359> I

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
and applying that to our board now as I

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.050 
and applying that to our board now as I
touch<00:03:59.049> the<00:03:59.709> button<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.430> can<00:04:00.489> see<00:04:00.639> there's

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
touch the button you can see there's

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.119 
touch the button you can see there's
enough<00:04:01.329> signal<00:04:01.959> now<00:04:02.109> to<00:04:02.169> move<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.560> red<00:04:02.889> bar

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
enough signal now to move the red bar

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.020 
enough signal now to move the red bar
and<00:04:03.959> it's<00:04:04.959> difficult<00:04:05.349> to<00:04:05.709> get<00:04:05.889> it<00:04:06.069> to<00:04:06.250> exceed

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
and it's difficult to get it to exceed

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.289 
and it's difficult to get it to exceed
the<00:04:07.180> finger<00:04:07.479> threshold<00:04:08.699> so<00:04:09.699> I'm<00:04:09.819> going<00:04:10.120> to

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
the finger threshold so I'm going to

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.629 
the finger threshold so I'm going to
also<00:04:10.720> reduce<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.409> finger<00:04:11.889> threshold<00:04:12.400> to

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
also reduce the finger threshold to

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:19.729 
also reduce the finger threshold to
match<00:04:12.849> the<00:04:13.120> signal<00:04:15.930> apply<00:04:16.930> that<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.440> board

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.790 

and<00:04:20.739> now<00:04:21.130> as<00:04:21.340> I<00:04:21.459> press<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:22.000> finger<00:04:22.560> with<00:04:23.560> the

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
and now as I press the finger with the

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.459 
and now as I press the finger with the
two<00:04:24.010> millimeters<00:04:24.580> of<00:04:24.760> overlay<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:26.080> can<00:04:26.110> see

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:26.469 
two millimeters of overlay you can see

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:28.340 
two millimeters of overlay you can see
I'm<00:04:26.620> detecting
