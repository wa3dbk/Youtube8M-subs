00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
situation works alright so what we did

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.249 
situation works alright so what we did
is<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.399> use<00:01:53.610> some<00:01:53.820> wood<00:01:54.000> braces<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.780> about<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
is we use some wood braces on about the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.709 
is we use some wood braces on about the
fourth<00:01:55.530> level<00:01:56.000> kind<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.060> angled<00:01:57.420> them<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
fourth level kind of angled them on the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.260 
fourth level kind of angled them on the
side<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.759> that<00:01:59.759> way<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.119> could

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
side like this and that way we could

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.020 
side like this and that way we could
brace<00:02:01.229> them<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.040> bricks<00:02:02.399> as<00:02:02.579> we<00:02:02.700> leaned<00:02:02.909> them

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
brace them the bricks as we leaned them

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.850 
brace them the bricks as we leaned them
in<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.329> then<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.409> top<00:02:04.590> would

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
in and then you can see the top would

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.429 
in and then you can see the top would
just<00:02:05.009> use<00:02:05.159> piece<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.790> plywood<00:02:06.200> with<00:02:07.200> some

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
just use piece of plywood with some

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.010 
just use piece of plywood with some
