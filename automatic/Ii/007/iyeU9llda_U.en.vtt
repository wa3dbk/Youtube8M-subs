we're taking a look at the sig p226 this
is<00:00:17.210> the<00:00:18.040> p226<00:00:19.040> r<00:00:19.489> that<00:00:20.360> comes<00:00:20.630> with<00:00:20.869> a<00:00:21.140> light

which is just it's pretty much your
standard<00:00:42.710> sig<00:00:43.310> it's<00:00:43.460> got<00:00:43.700> different

the elite dark also has the high high
ride<00:01:39.940> extended<00:01:40.940> beaver<00:01:41.270> tail<00:01:41.770> so<00:01:42.770> you<00:01:42.860> can<00:01:43.010> get

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
ride extended beaver tail so you can get

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.550 
ride extended beaver tail so you can get
a<00:01:43.190> higher<00:01:43.430> grip<00:01:43.729> on<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.090> you<00:01:44.840> can<00:01:44.960> see<00:01:45.140> here<00:01:45.409> on

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
a higher grip on it you can see here on

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.899 
a higher grip on it you can see here on
the<00:01:45.710> standard<00:01:46.100> sig<00:01:46.869> it<00:01:47.869> has<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.170> lower<00:01:49.070> non

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
the standard sig it has a lower non

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.310 
the standard sig it has a lower non
extended<00:01:50.479> beaver<00:01:50.990> tail<00:01:51.640> so<00:01:52.869> this<00:01:53.869> is<00:01:54.049> more

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
extended beaver tail so this is more

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.370 
extended beaver tail so this is more
like<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.950> 1911<00:01:56.439> style<00:01:57.439> back<00:01:57.740> strap<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.360> also

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
like a 1911 style back strap and also

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.840 
like a 1911 style back strap and also
the<00:02:00.380> checkering<00:02:00.830> on<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.549> front<00:02:01.909> strap<00:02:02.180> is<00:02:02.450> a

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
the checkering on the front strap is a

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.109 
the checkering on the front strap is a
you<00:02:04.850> can<00:02:04.970> see<00:02:05.710> on<00:02:06.710> here<00:02:07.189> it's<00:02:07.369> like<00:02:07.549> aggressive

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
you can see on here it's like aggressive

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.219 
you can see on here it's like aggressive
and<00:02:08.269> in<00:02:08.420> both<00:02:08.599> directions

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
and in both directions

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.339 
and in both directions
on<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.519> elite<00:02:10.879> dark<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.510> on<00:02:11.779> the<00:02:11.930> standard

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
on the elite dark and on the standard

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.510 
on the elite dark and on the standard
sig<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:13.819> just<00:02:14.090> goes<00:02:14.329> left<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.379> right<00:02:15.590> and

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
sig it just goes left to right and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.750 
sig it just goes left to right and
it<00:02:17.030> doesn't<00:02:17.390> have<00:02:17.510> both<00:02:17.720> directions<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:21.760> it

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
it doesn't have both directions of it

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.190 
it doesn't have both directions of it
only<00:02:22.910> has<00:02:23.120> see<00:02:23.540> how<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.750> only<00:02:23.870> goes<00:02:24.050> in<00:02:24.170> one

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
only has see how it only goes in one

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.280 
only has see how it only goes in one
direction<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.820> little<00:02:26.000> bit<00:02:26.150> better<00:02:26.360> a

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
direction so a little bit better a

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.370 
direction so a little bit better a
little<00:02:27.730> bit<00:02:28.730> better<00:02:28.820> checkering<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:29.390> there

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
little bit better checkering on there

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.070 
little bit better checkering on there
they<00:02:30.560> both<00:02:30.770> have<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:32.600> front<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:32.960> the

they both have the the front of the
trigger<00:02:33.500> guard<00:02:33.800> oh<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.950> guess<00:02:37.250> so

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
trigger guard oh I guess so

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.760 
trigger guard oh I guess so
see<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.150> one<00:02:38.300> has<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.410> front<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.710> the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
see this one has it the front of the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.720 
see this one has it the front of the
trigger<00:02:39.890> guard<00:02:40.130> has<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.460> in<00:02:40.550> both<00:02:40.700> directions

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
trigger guard has it in both directions

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.190 
trigger guard has it in both directions
and<00:02:41.570> then<00:02:42.530> on<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:42.860> one<00:02:43.100> on<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.520> regular<00:02:44.200> p226

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
and then on this one on the regular p226

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.330 
and then on this one on the regular p226
it<00:02:45.410> only<00:02:45.560> has<00:02:45.770> it<00:02:46.120> in<00:02:47.120> one<00:02:47.360> direction<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:49.130> main

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
it only has it in one direction the main

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.510 
it only has it in one direction the main
the<00:02:50.180> main<00:02:50.210> difference<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.080> trigger<00:02:51.650> you

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
the main difference is the trigger you

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.830 
the main difference is the trigger you
can<00:02:52.550> tell<00:02:52.820> by<00:02:52.940> looking<00:02:52.970> at<00:02:53.300> them<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:53.630> has<00:02:53.810> a

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
can tell by looking at them this has a

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.950 
can tell by looking at them this has a
really<00:02:54.080> thicker<00:02:54.830> trigger<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.460> this<00:02:55.610> has<00:02:55.820> a

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
really thicker trigger and this has a

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.650 
really thicker trigger and this has a
thinner<00:02:56.960> trigger<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:59.080> the<00:03:00.080> elite<00:03:00.320> dark<00:03:00.590> has<00:03:00.890> a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
thinner trigger the the elite dark has a

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.600 
thinner trigger the the elite dark has a
has<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.690> very<00:03:03.050> short<00:03:03.470> reset<00:03:03.980> on<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.340> trigger

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
has a very short reset on the trigger

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.710 
has a very short reset on the trigger
and<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.560> little<00:03:09.650> bit<00:03:09.920> better<00:03:10.720> for

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
and so it's a little bit better for

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.230 
and so it's a little bit better for
follow-up<00:03:12.110> shots<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:13.280> can<00:03:13.400> see<00:03:13.610> in<00:03:13.850> single

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
follow-up shots you can see in single

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.690 
follow-up shots you can see in single
action<00:03:14.390> how<00:03:14.690> far<00:03:14.990> the<00:03:15.830> standard<00:03:16.280> trigger<00:03:16.520> is

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
action how far the standard trigger is

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.640 
action how far the standard trigger is
and<00:03:17.000> then<00:03:17.120> here<00:03:17.390> it's<00:03:17.990> a<00:03:18.050> little<00:03:18.140> bit<00:03:18.290> further

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
and then here it's a little bit further

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.770 
and then here it's a little bit further
back<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.220> there's<00:03:20.150> just<00:03:20.330> a<00:03:20.420> little<00:03:20.540> bit<00:03:20.630> of

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
back and there's just a little bit of

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.990 
back and there's just a little bit of
take-up<00:03:21.050> so<00:03:21.260> when<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:21.470> reset<00:03:21.890> it's<00:03:22.760> got<00:03:22.970> a

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
take-up so when you reset it's got a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.070 
take-up so when you reset it's got a
really<00:03:23.209> short<00:03:23.510> reset<00:03:24.020> I<00:03:25.209> measured<00:03:26.209> both<00:03:26.840> these

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
really short reset I measured both these

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.150 
really short reset I measured both these
guns<00:03:27.350> with<00:03:27.920> my<00:03:28.510> my<00:03:29.510> Lyman<00:03:29.959> Digital<00:03:30.920> trigger

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
chambered in the 357 sig cartridge which

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.570 
chambered in the 357 sig cartridge which
is<00:04:48.040> a<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:50.020> really<00:04:50.170> cool<00:04:50.470> cartridges<00:04:51.100> developed

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
is a so really cool cartridges developed

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.450 
is a so really cool cartridges developed
in<00:04:51.730> 1994<00:04:52.660> and<00:04:54.180> it<00:04:55.180> was<00:04:55.300> named<00:04:55.540> 357<00:04:56.380> because<00:04:56.710> sig

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
in 1994 and it was named 357 because sig

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.550 
in 1994 and it was named 357 because sig
was<00:04:57.640> trying<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.000> replicate<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:59.410> performance

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
was trying to replicate the performance

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.430 
was trying to replicate the performance
of<00:05:00.460> 125<00:05:01.390> green<00:05:02.610> 357<00:05:03.610> Magnum<00:05:04.140> fired<00:05:05.140> from<00:05:05.290> a

4-inch<00:05:05.800> revolver<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.990> so<00:05:07.990> they<00:05:08.590> provided<00:05:09.160> a

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
4-inch revolver and so they provided a

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.020 
4-inch revolver and so they provided a
cartridge<00:05:10.000> that<00:05:10.360> was<00:05:10.510> close<00:05:11.580> close<00:05:12.580> to<00:05:12.850> that

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
cartridge that was close close to that

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.170 
cartridge that was close close to that
357<00:05:13.840> Magnum<00:05:14.500> but<00:05:14.770> in<00:05:15.010> a<00:05:15.550> semi-automatic
