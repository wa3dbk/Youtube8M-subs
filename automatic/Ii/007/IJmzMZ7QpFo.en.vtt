00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.370
 I'm going to show you how to crochet patches 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.469
 to 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.029
 can embroider this creates a whole 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:19.099
 nice flat connection in this video 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.660
 I use granny squares but you can 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.490
 this way of crocheting together 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.810
 make use for a lot 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.419
 different types of crocheted 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.980
 for example one for clothing to it 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.599
 to be able to clearly visualize, I go 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.340
 use a different color but normal 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.669
 so you do this with the same 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.669
 colour 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.649
 It is important to go to the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.780
 stitches to watch with you used only 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:49.550
 the outer loops of the v-tjes 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.649
 Do you share in both this case 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.289
 I start in the middle of the corner 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.149
 granny square has 3 unloading on the corner 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:59.739
 so i start with the middle of the 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.999
 unload and then I just put it under it 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.999
 outer thread of the feather 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.890
 do with one piece and then do 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.930
 I agree with other you walk you love 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.570
 so the nice side of that crochet to 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.790
 you upstairs 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.040
 I visit the same stitch with the other 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.290
 on you and there I am stabbing again 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.290
 through the outer loop 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.290
 then I pick up the thread the old man 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.470
 and both parts through both parts 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.370
 removing from the hook is one 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.110
 and two then I go into the 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.420
 next stitch and I'm going the same again 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.020
 so keep order first in this 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:54.200
 insert a piece of cloth and then into this light 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:57.010
 stitches under the outer loop of it 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.010
 front patch 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.900
 the streets work out shows on the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:07.720
 insert the bottom into the next 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.720
 stitch off the other piece 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.300
 so now we put the three loop on the needle one 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.750
 purple from the wire that goes to the bunch 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:22.749
 goes and two loops of the pieces then 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:29.620
 strike out 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:33.900
 delete continue in the stitch 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:37.230
 next stitch again only outside slash ' 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.230
 other patch 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:46.769
 only the outer loop 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.769
 fire through all the loops 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.650
 the hook stitches you make is actually 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.650
 the half fixed 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.680
 it is the loop of the front piece 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.150
 outer loop of the rear end 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.570
 you 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.570
 capsize 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.680
 by canceling by canceling 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.350
 and so you see that there is a very beautiful one 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.850
 flat connection 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.050
 and if you have it in the same color 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:26.500
 makes you see almost nothing there 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.500
 more of
