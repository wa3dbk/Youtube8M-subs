balls<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.640> wool<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:50.180> then<00:00:50.870> as<00:00:51.080> I<00:00:51.200> went<00:00:51.410> in<00:00:51.559> went

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
balls of wool and then as I went in went

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.740 
balls of wool and then as I went in went
to<00:00:51.860> different<00:00:51.980> locations<00:00:52.280> I<00:00:53.059> just<00:00:53.480> couldn't

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
to different locations I just couldn't

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.720

be<00:00:53.900> bothered<00:00:53.930> like<00:00:54.410> I'm<00:00:54.590> tangling<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:55.550> it

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
be bothered like I'm tangling it so it

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.260 
be bothered like I'm tangling it so it
started<00:00:56.320> as<00:00:57.320> sort<00:00:58.100> of<00:00:58.160> a<00:00:58.250> satirical<00:00:58.760> concept

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
started as sort of a satirical concept

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.479 
started as sort of a satirical concept
when<00:00:59.540> I<00:00:59.570> saw<00:00:59.930> a<00:01:00.230> boy<00:01:00.440> tongue<00:01:01.220> a<00:01:01.250> piece<00:01:01.460> of

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
when I saw a boy tongue a piece of

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.610 
when I saw a boy tongue a piece of
string<00:01:01.879> around<00:01:02.270> a<00:01:02.420> pole<00:01:02.600> in<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.780> playground<00:01:03.350> I

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
string around a pole in the playground I

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.869 
string around a pole in the playground I
was<00:01:03.830> thinking<00:01:04.190> about<00:01:04.220> doing<00:01:04.430> something

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
was thinking about doing something

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.900 
was thinking about doing something
really<00:01:05.210> profound<00:01:05.500> some<00:01:06.500> big<00:01:06.680> statement<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:07.430> I

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
really profound some big statement and I

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.430 
really profound some big statement and I
joked<00:01:08.210> about<00:01:08.330> doing<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.780> whole<00:01:08.930> major<00:01:09.140> work

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
joked about doing a whole major work

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
joked about doing a whole major work
that<00:01:10.280> string<00:01:10.759> and<00:01:11.030> then<00:01:11.800> actually<00:01:12.800> decided<00:01:13.430> to

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
that string and then actually decided to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.219 
that string and then actually decided to
do<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.060> see<00:01:14.270> how<00:01:14.300> far<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:14.780> could<00:01:14.899> take

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
do that and see how far I could take

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.310 
do that and see how far I could take
something<00:01:15.649> that<00:01:15.680> was<00:01:16.509> quite<00:01:17.509> simple<00:01:18.080> and

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
something that was quite simple and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.260 
something that was quite simple and
almost<00:01:18.619> forgotten<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:19.369> sort<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.060> bring<00:01:20.240> it

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
almost forgotten and sort of bring it

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.790 
almost forgotten and sort of bring it
into<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.630> limelight<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:21.259> see<00:01:21.470> how<00:01:21.619> people

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800
