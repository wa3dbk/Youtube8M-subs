so let's give us a weed reading of the

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.459 
so let's give us a weed reading of the
wheel<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.659> only<00:03:36.810> one<00:03:36.900> we<00:03:36.959> have<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.140> check<00:03:37.349> on

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:38.449 
wheel the only one we have to check on
this<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.620> make<00:03:37.799> sure<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:38.040> give<00:03:38.159> us<00:03:38.219> a<00:03:38.310> white

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
this to make sure to give us a white

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.619 
this to make sure to give us a white
will<00:03:38.909> win<00:03:38.989> so<00:03:39.989> we've<00:03:40.170> got<00:03:40.379> 14<00:03:41.159> and<00:03:41.430> 13.5<00:03:42.390> so

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
will win so we've got 14 and 13.5 so

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.440 
will win so we've got 14 and 13.5 so
we've<00:03:42.719> got<00:03:42.840> 14<00:03:43.290> spin<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.040> up

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.180 

and<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.050> is<00:03:49.170> an<00:03:49.260> old<00:03:49.410> wheels<00:03:49.650> or<00:03:49.860> probably

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
and this is an old wheels or probably

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.339 
and this is an old wheels or probably
might<00:03:50.400> as<00:03:50.490> well<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.840> basically<00:03:51.990> you've<00:03:52.319> got

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
might as well so basically you've got

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.440 
might as well so basically you've got
the<00:03:52.590> options<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:53.099> banging<00:03:53.970> weights<00:03:54.239> on<00:03:54.360> the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
the options of banging weights on the

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.430 
the options of banging weights on the
sides<00:03:55.310> SF<00:03:56.310> is<00:03:57.150> an<00:03:57.330> option<00:03:57.630> of<00:03:57.690> banging<00:03:58.080> just

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
sides SF is an option of banging just

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.470 
sides SF is an option of banging just
one<00:03:58.620> right<00:03:58.830> here<00:03:59.040> you've<00:03:59.940> got<00:04:00.090> another<00:04:00.209> way

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
one right here you've got another way

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.390 
one right here you've got another way
that<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.630> can<00:04:00.780> do<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.050> so<00:04:01.890> that's<00:04:02.069> basically

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
that you can do that so that's basically

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.710 
that you can do that so that's basically
the<00:04:02.540> simple<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.660> simplicity<00:04:04.020> of<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.290> machine

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
the simple and simplicity of the machine

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.150 
the simple and simplicity of the machine
placing<00:04:06.720> both<00:04:06.870> that's<00:04:07.410> done<00:04:07.530> outside<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.890> tight

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
placing both that's done outside a tight

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:21.800 
placing both that's done outside a tight
either<00:04:08.660> looks<00:04:09.660> tidy<00:04:09.930> bow

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:29.719 

a<00:04:22.550> screencap<00:04:26.389> condition<00:04:28.550> basically<00:04:29.550> will

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
a screencap condition basically will

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.390 
a screencap condition basically will
just<00:04:29.759> tell<00:04:29.999> you<00:04:30.029> about<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.240> bomb<00:04:30.509> we've<00:04:30.749> got
