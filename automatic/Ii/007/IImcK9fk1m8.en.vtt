some<00:00:24.290> new<00:00:24.500> mock-ups<00:00:25.040> for<00:00:25.220> some<00:00:26.090> new<00:00:26.570> road

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
some new mock-ups for some new road

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.310 
some new mock-ups for some new road
pieces<00:00:27.830> road<00:00:28.279> we'll<00:00:28.580> put<00:00:28.730> that<00:00:28.880> in<00:00:29.000> quotes<00:00:29.320> the

pieces road we'll put that in quotes the
basic<00:00:30.710> background<00:00:31.189> is<00:00:31.760> that<00:00:31.789> a<00:00:32.029> customer<00:00:32.330> who

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
basic background is that a customer who

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.860 
basic background is that a customer who
has<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.379> set<00:00:33.920> of<00:00:34.190> my<00:00:34.400> flexible<00:00:35.090> roads<00:00:35.360> that<00:00:35.720> are

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
has a set of my flexible roads that are

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.979 
has a set of my flexible roads that are
cast<00:00:36.019> in<00:00:36.290> rubber<00:00:36.730> he<00:00:37.730> has<00:00:38.030> requested<00:00:38.780> a

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
cast in rubber he has requested a

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.340 
cast in rubber he has requested a
thinner<00:00:39.470> set<00:00:39.920> to<00:00:40.790> represent<00:00:41.300> a<00:00:41.510> sort<00:00:42.050> of<00:00:42.110> more

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
thinner set to represent a sort of more

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.820 
thinner set to represent a sort of more
of<00:00:42.379> a<00:00:42.530> walking<00:00:43.040> path<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:44.140> actually<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.410> had<00:00:45.800> a

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
of a walking path and actually I had a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.189 
of a walking path and actually I had a
request<00:00:46.160> for<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:46.610> quite<00:00:47.120> a<00:00:47.150> while<00:00:47.479> back<00:00:47.839> but

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
request for this quite a while back but

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.439 
request for this quite a while back but
I<00:00:48.530> thought<00:00:48.769> it<00:00:48.920> was<00:00:49.040> a<00:00:49.070> bit<00:00:49.339> of<00:00:49.580> an<00:00:49.760> of<00:00:49.970> a<00:00:50.150> niche

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
I thought it was a bit of an of a niche

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.020 
I thought it was a bit of an of a niche
piece<00:00:50.839> and<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:51.890> when<00:00:52.370> you<00:00:52.729> know<00:00:52.850> with<00:00:53.000> the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
piece and so when you know with the

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.460 
piece and so when you know with the
wider<00:00:53.360> Road<00:00:53.720> which<00:00:53.900> I<00:00:53.989> thought<00:00:54.140> would<00:00:54.260> have<00:00:54.440> a

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
wider Road which I thought would have a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.750 
wider Road which I thought would have a
little<00:00:54.769> bit<00:00:54.920> of<00:00:54.949> a<00:00:55.129> more<00:00:55.339> of<00:00:55.489> an<00:00:55.610> application

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
little bit of a more of an application

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.680 
little bit of a more of an application
broad<00:00:56.600> broadly<00:00:57.199> speaking<00:00:57.699> but<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:59.269> customer

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
broad broadly speaking but this customer

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.060 
broad broadly speaking but this customer
is<00:00:59.750> a<00:00:59.809> very<00:01:00.019> good<00:01:00.080> customer<00:01:00.650> of<00:01:00.680> mine<00:01:00.890> he's

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
is a very good customer of mine he's

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.759 
is a very good customer of mine he's
been<00:01:01.220> with<00:01:01.309> me<00:01:01.369> for<00:01:01.699> a<00:01:01.729> long<00:01:01.940> time<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.650> and<00:01:03.650> I

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
been with me for a long time and and I

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.190 
been with me for a long time and and I
think<00:01:03.799> I<00:01:04.220> think<00:01:04.580> having<00:01:05.089> multiple<00:01:05.720> requests

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
think I think having multiple requests

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.440 
think I think having multiple requests
indicate<00:01:06.979> that<00:01:07.010> it<00:01:07.220> might<00:01:07.369> have<00:01:07.580> some<00:01:07.820> fit<00:01:08.330> in

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
indicate that it might have some fit in

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.600 
indicate that it might have some fit in
the<00:01:08.570> market<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.170> what<00:01:10.100> I've<00:01:10.190> done<00:01:10.220> is<00:01:10.400> I've

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
the market so what I've done is I've

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.480 
the market so what I've done is I've
created<00:01:10.670> some<00:01:11.060> mock-ups<00:01:11.299> here<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:12.460> take<00:01:13.460> a

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
created some mock-ups here to take a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.730 
created some mock-ups here to take a
look<00:01:13.580> at<00:01:13.850> today<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.510> show<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:15.350> a<00:01:15.470> little<00:01:15.650> bit

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
look at today and show you a little bit

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.020 
look at today and show you a little bit
about<00:01:15.950> what<00:01:16.100> I'm<00:01:16.189> thinking<00:01:16.520> about<00:01:16.610> and

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
about what I'm thinking about and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.060 
about what I'm thinking about and
provide<00:01:17.689> you<00:01:17.900> some<00:01:18.170> opportunity<00:01:18.650> maybe<00:01:18.799> for

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
provide you some opportunity maybe for

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.920 
provide you some opportunity maybe for
some<00:01:19.250> feedback<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.000> well<00:01:20.270> let<00:01:20.450> me<00:01:20.510> show<00:01:20.540> you<00:01:20.690> my

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
some feedback so well let me show you my

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.460 
some feedback so well let me show you my
designs<00:01:21.740> as<00:01:22.040> meagre<00:01:23.000> as<00:01:23.150> they<00:01:23.330> are<00:01:23.510> and<00:01:23.720> we<00:01:24.350> can

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
designs as meagre as they are and we can

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.750 
designs as meagre as they are and we can
go<00:01:24.560> from<00:01:24.590> there<00:01:25.960> so<00:01:27.010> brief<00:01:28.010> description<00:01:28.580> of

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
go from there so brief description of

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.630 
go from there so brief description of
these<00:01:28.940> pieces<00:01:29.300> first<00:01:29.780> there's<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.620> variety<00:01:31.400> of

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
these pieces first there's a variety of

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.770 
these pieces first there's a variety of
shapes<00:01:32.000> that<00:01:32.180> I've<00:01:32.390> produced<00:01:32.870> here<00:01:33.430> here's<00:01:34.430> a

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
shapes that I've produced here here's a

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.350 
shapes that I've produced here here's a
three-way<00:01:35.780> intersection<00:01:37.090> set<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:38.240> know

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
three-way intersection set you know

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.320 
three-way intersection set you know
short<00:01:38.720> straits<00:01:39.140> I've<00:01:39.980> done<00:01:40.220> two<00:01:40.460> of<00:01:40.790> these<00:01:40.970> 12

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
short straits I've done two of these 12

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.590 
short straits I've done two of these 12
inches<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:42.110> wide<00:01:42.440> 90<00:01:43.400> degree<00:01:43.700> about<00:01:44.180> not<00:01:44.390> wide

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
inches a wide 90 degree about not wide

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.090 
inches a wide 90 degree about not wide
but<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:44.930> long<00:01:45.200> 90<00:01:45.590> degree<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:46.100> short<00:01:46.820> 90<00:01:47.150> degree<00:01:47.480> a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
but a long 90 degree a short 90 degree a

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.990 
but a long 90 degree a short 90 degree a
45<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:50.600> connector<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:52.040> main<00:01:52.700> road

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
45 and a connector to the main road

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.250 
45 and a connector to the main road
system<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.860> those<00:01:55.040> are<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.190> basic

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
system so those are the basic

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.930 
system so those are the basic
identification<00:01:57.260> of<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.409> pieces<00:01:57.920> the<00:02:00.640> if<00:02:01.640> you

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
identification of the pieces the if you

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.370 
identification of the pieces the if you
if<00:02:02.120> you're<00:02:02.240> not<00:02:02.390> familiar<00:02:02.659> maybe<00:02:03.080> I<00:02:03.200> should

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
if you're not familiar maybe I should

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.740 
if you're not familiar maybe I should
start<00:02:03.590> there<00:02:03.950> with<00:02:04.280> my<00:02:04.610> other<00:02:04.909> Road<00:02:05.240> pieces

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
start there with my other Road pieces

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.570 
start there with my other Road pieces
you<00:02:06.050> might<00:02:06.229> want<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.530> go<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.920> take<00:02:07.100> a<00:02:07.130> look<00:02:07.400> at

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
you might want to go and take a look at

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.399 
you might want to go and take a look at
them<00:02:07.760> there<00:02:08.569> are<00:02:08.629> three<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.989> half<00:02:09.019> inches

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 
them there are three and a half inches

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.240 
them there are three and a half inches
wide<00:02:09.890> so<00:02:10.700> this<00:02:10.849> gives<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.150> sense<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.720> its

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
wide so this gives you a sense of its

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.309 
wide so this gives you a sense of its
general<00:02:13.250> dimensions<00:02:13.819> here<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.420> they<00:02:15.110> feature

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
general dimensions here and they feature

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.860 
general dimensions here and they feature
a<00:02:15.470> few<00:02:15.709> rocks<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.250> them<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:17.090> had<00:02:17.209> put<00:02:17.480> in<00:02:17.629> a

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
a few rocks in them and I had put in a

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.979 
a few rocks in them and I had put in a
small<00:02:18.500> hump<00:02:18.799> on<00:02:19.310> various<00:02:20.299> spots<00:02:20.569> along<00:02:20.930> the

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
small hump on various spots along the

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.530 
small hump on various spots along the
way<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:22.220> indicate<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.760> know<00:02:22.879> where<00:02:23.150> wheel

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
way to indicate you know where wheel

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.750 
way to indicate you know where wheel
tracks<00:02:23.930> or<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:24.650> know<00:02:24.800> people<00:02:25.100> walking<00:02:25.520> side

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
tracks or you know people walking side

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.220 
tracks or you know people walking side
by<00:02:25.790> side<00:02:26.180> you<00:02:26.510> know<00:02:26.630> my

by side you know my

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.290 
by side you know my
would<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.470> earth<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:28.129> little<00:02:28.190> bit<00:02:28.400> deeper<00:02:28.760> now

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
would the earth a little bit deeper now

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.960 
would the earth a little bit deeper now
before<00:02:30.200> i<00:02:30.230> discuss<00:02:30.709> these<00:02:30.860> further<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.580> did

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
before i discuss these further I did

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.940 
before i discuss these further I did
have<00:02:32.180> many<00:02:32.390> people<00:02:32.870> well<00:02:33.379> I<00:02:33.409> shouldn't<00:02:33.860> say

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
have many people well I shouldn't say

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.699 
have many people well I shouldn't say
many<00:02:34.250> some<00:02:35.140> suggest<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.260> i<00:02:36.349> should<00:02:36.560> have

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
many some suggest that i should have

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.509 
many some suggest that i should have
tire<00:02:36.950> tracks<00:02:37.370> or<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:38.000> know<00:02:38.209> other<00:02:38.569> kinds<00:02:39.110> of

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
tire tracks or you know other kinds of

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.420 
tire tracks or you know other kinds of
impressions<00:02:40.519> in<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.819> roads<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:42.709> i<00:02:42.739> avoided

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
impressions in the roads but i avoided

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.830 
impressions in the roads but i avoided
that<00:02:43.580> because<00:02:43.910> i<00:02:44.000> wanted<00:02:44.390> them<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.690> be

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
that because i wanted them to be

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.500 
that because i wanted them to be
universally<00:02:45.769> applicable<00:02:46.190> through<00:02:47.090> variety

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510

of time periods and if i put in you know
tire<00:02:49.640> tracks<00:02:50.000> or<00:02:50.239> wagon<00:02:50.720> wheel<00:02:50.870> marks<00:02:51.260> or

tire tracks or wagon wheel marks or

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.140 
tire tracks or wagon wheel marks or
something<00:02:51.920> like<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.099> it's<00:02:52.760> really<00:02:53.000> going<00:02:53.090> to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
something like that it's really going to

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.240 
something like that it's really going to
restrict<00:02:53.360> their<00:02:53.750> application<00:02:54.470> so<00:02:54.739> it's

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
restrict their application so it's

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.160 
restrict their application so it's
already<00:02:55.459> kind<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.060> an<00:02:56.180> itchy<00:02:56.420> product<00:02:57.019> we

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
already kind of an itchy product we

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.309 
already kind of an itchy product we
don't<00:02:57.379> need<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.739> make<00:02:58.459> it<00:02:58.610> even<00:02:58.819> more<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.390> so

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
don't need to make it even more so so

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.589 
don't need to make it even more so so
that<00:03:00.470> was<00:03:00.620> my<00:03:00.650> original<00:03:00.890> intent<00:03:01.549> and<00:03:02.150> design

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
that was my original intent and design

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.490 
that was my original intent and design
with<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.049> main<00:03:03.590> set<00:03:04.099> now<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:06.109> customer

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
with the main set now the customer

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.460 
with the main set now the customer
requested<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.640> do<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.239> narrower<00:03:08.870> set<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.410> I

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
requested that I do a narrower set and I

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.009 
requested that I do a narrower set and I
had<00:03:09.650> actually<00:03:10.310> done<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:11.090> very<00:03:11.450> basic

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
had actually done the very basic

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.289 
had actually done the very basic
preliminary<00:03:12.530> cuts<00:03:12.890> for<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.400> mock-up<00:03:13.790> for<00:03:14.239> a

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
preliminary cuts for a mock-up for a

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.720 
preliminary cuts for a mock-up for a
narrower<00:03:14.810> set<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.829> actually<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.310> wasn't<00:03:16.459> too

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
narrower set so actually it wasn't too

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.880 
narrower set so actually it wasn't too
too<00:03:17.239> onerous<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.900> get<00:03:18.049> these<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.500> this<00:03:18.650> current

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
too onerous to get these to this current

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.970 
too onerous to get these to this current
stage<00:03:19.420> these<00:03:20.420> pieces<00:03:20.660> are<00:03:20.959> two<00:03:21.319> inches<00:03:21.769> wide

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
stage these pieces are two inches wide

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.509 
stage these pieces are two inches wide
and<00:03:22.690> hope<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:24.019> get<00:03:24.170> tippy<00:03:24.829> here<00:03:25.069> hold<00:03:25.340> on<00:03:25.489> a

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
and hope I get tippy here hold on a

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:32.319 
and hope I get tippy here hold on a
second<00:03:28.390> mr.<00:03:29.390> mr.<00:03:29.930> McLean<00:03:30.290> all<00:03:30.980> right<00:03:31.160> um<00:03:31.459> it's

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
second mr. mr. McLean all right um it's

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.170 
second mr. mr. McLean all right um it's
a<00:03:32.510> believable<00:03:32.989> footpath<00:03:33.560> for<00:03:33.919> one<00:03:34.180> depending

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
a believable footpath for one depending

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.199 
a believable footpath for one depending
on<00:03:35.299> how<00:03:35.480> deep<00:03:35.720> in<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.290> flock<00:03:36.859> and<00:03:37.099> foliage<00:03:37.730> at<00:03:38.030> or

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
on how deep in I flock and foliage at or

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.479 
on how deep in I flock and foliage at or
I<00:03:38.239> could<00:03:39.019> add<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.470> little<00:03:39.650> width<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.130> then

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
I could add a little width and then

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.420 
I could add a little width and then
you'd<00:03:40.849> have<00:03:40.880> room<00:03:41.269> for<00:03:41.540> two<00:03:41.620> individuals<00:03:42.620> very

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
you'd have room for two individuals very

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.879 
you'd have room for two individuals very
close<00:03:43.819> side<00:03:44.299> by<00:03:44.480> side<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:45.319> this<00:03:45.440> seemed<00:03:45.680> like<00:03:45.709> a

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
close side by side so this seemed like a

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.559 
close side by side so this seemed like a
good<00:03:46.130> width<00:03:46.459> to<00:03:46.669> go<00:03:46.849> I<00:03:46.880> didn't<00:03:47.239> want<00:03:47.359> to<00:03:47.419> go<00:03:47.510> too

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
good width to go I didn't want to go too

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.710 
good width to go I didn't want to go too
much<00:03:47.930> more<00:03:48.230> narrow<00:03:48.470> with<00:03:48.799> it<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.180> felt<00:03:50.599> like

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
much more narrow with it and I felt like

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.690 
much more narrow with it and I felt like
that<00:03:50.900> was<00:03:51.019> a<00:03:51.079> decent<00:03:51.230> compromise<00:03:51.709> you<00:03:52.370> know<00:03:52.489> as

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
that was a decent compromise you know as

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.670 
that was a decent compromise you know as
compared<00:03:53.209> to<00:03:53.299> you<00:03:53.750> know<00:03:53.870> seeing<00:03:54.109> the<00:03:54.230> spacing

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
compared to you know seeing the spacing

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.640 
compared to you know seeing the spacing
here<00:03:54.940> add<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.000> little<00:03:56.450> variety<00:03:56.630> that<00:03:57.380> was<00:03:57.500> my

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
here add a little variety that was my

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.110 
here add a little variety that was my
thinking<00:03:57.889> now<00:03:58.630> these<00:04:00.400> basically<00:04:01.400> what<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.000> did

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
thinking now these basically what I did

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.030 
thinking now these basically what I did
on<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.750> original<00:04:03.230> let<00:04:03.349> me<00:04:03.410> go<00:04:03.530> back<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:03.739> that

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
on the original let me go back to that

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.220 
on the original let me go back to that
I've<00:04:04.340> tried<00:04:04.549> to<00:04:04.700> emulate<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.359> here<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:05.930> I

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
I've tried to emulate that here is I

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.610 
I've tried to emulate that here is I
built<00:04:06.530> up<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:06.950> little<00:04:07.579> burn<00:04:08.180> along<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.049> edge<00:04:09.230> of

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
built up a little burn along the edge of

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.069 
built up a little burn along the edge of
this<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.669> sort<00:04:10.940> of<00:04:11.000> give<00:04:11.239> it<00:04:11.269> a<00:04:11.450> little<00:04:11.480> bit<00:04:11.870> of

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
this to sort of give it a little bit of

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.770 
this to sort of give it a little bit of
a<00:04:12.739> transition<00:04:13.160> you<00:04:13.849> know<00:04:13.970> there's<00:04:14.239> a<00:04:14.299> you<00:04:14.690> know

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
a transition you know there's a you know

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.379 
a transition you know there's a you know
like<00:04:14.900> it's<00:04:15.109> worn<00:04:15.440> down<00:04:15.769> in<00:04:16.130> here<00:04:16.910> and<00:04:17.090> this

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
like it's worn down in here and this

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.020 
like it's worn down in here and this
ends<00:04:17.780> a<00:04:17.870> little<00:04:18.260> thickness<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.190> rubber<00:04:19.519> to

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
ends a little thickness to the rubber to

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.029 
ends a little thickness to the rubber to
help<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.479> lay<00:04:20.690> flat<00:04:21.079> as<00:04:21.320> I<00:04:21.349> really<00:04:21.799> need<00:04:22.010> a

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
help it lay flat as I really need a

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.710 
help it lay flat as I really need a
little<00:04:22.310> gravity<00:04:22.729> to<00:04:22.910> help<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.270> rubbers<00:04:23.539> very

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
little gravity to help the rubbers very

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.779 
little gravity to help the rubbers very
soft<00:04:24.020> but<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.530> can<00:04:24.740> have<00:04:24.919> a<00:04:24.949> little<00:04:25.160> memory<00:04:25.610> in

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
soft but it can have a little memory in

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.550 
soft but it can have a little memory in
it<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.120> want<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.389> flip<00:04:26.570> up<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:26.990> adding<00:04:27.500> a

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
it and want to flip up and adding a

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.260 
it and want to flip up and adding a
little<00:04:27.710> weight<00:04:27.979> along<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.430> edges<00:04:28.580> just<00:04:28.789> helps

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
little weight along the edges just helps

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.290 
little weight along the edges just helps
it<00:04:29.449> to<00:04:29.570> settle<00:04:29.780> down<00:04:30.020> a<00:04:30.080> little<00:04:30.229> bit<00:04:31.300> now

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
it to settle down a little bit now

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.540 
it to settle down a little bit now
because<00:04:32.660> these<00:04:32.840> pieces<00:04:33.139> are<00:04:33.349> quite<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.340> bit

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
because these pieces are quite a bit

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.990 
because these pieces are quite a bit
more<00:04:34.729> narrow<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.440> i'm<00:04:36.440> assuming<00:04:36.710> are<00:04:37.250> not

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
more narrow and i'm assuming are not

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.209 
more narrow and i'm assuming are not
traveled<00:04:38.510> by<00:04:38.690> vehicles<00:04:39.200> what<00:04:39.890> i've<00:04:40.010> done<00:04:40.159> is

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:40.219 
traveled by vehicles what i've done is

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.820 
traveled by vehicles what i've done is
i've<00:04:40.520> just

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
i've just

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.640 
i've just
made<00:04:40.980> that<00:04:41.310> little<00:04:41.520> berm<00:04:41.820> very<00:04:42.660> very<00:04:43.140> slight

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
made that little berm very very slight

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.680 
made that little berm very very slight
on<00:04:43.950> these<00:04:44.310> but<00:04:45.120> there<00:04:45.240> is<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.390> little

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
on these but there is a little

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.620 
on these but there is a little
noticeable<00:04:46.230> rise<00:04:46.590> at<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.010> edge<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:47.630> I'm

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
noticeable rise at the edge and I'm

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.210 
noticeable rise at the edge and I'm
hoping<00:04:48.960> that<00:04:49.050> that's<00:04:49.320> going<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:49.530> be<00:04:49.680> okay<00:04:50.010> once

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
hoping that that's going to be okay once

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.980 
hoping that that's going to be okay once
i'm<00:04:50.460> casting<00:04:51.060> those<00:04:51.420> that<00:04:51.630> they'll<00:04:51.780> still

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
i'm casting those that they'll still

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.750 
i'm casting those that they'll still
have<00:04:52.020> enough<00:04:52.320> weight<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.560> sit<00:04:52.890> down<00:04:53.100> i<00:04:53.340> think

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
have enough weight to sit down i think

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.150 
have enough weight to sit down i think
they<00:04:53.880> should<00:04:54.090> but<00:04:54.660> anyway<00:04:55.560> that's<00:04:55.830> why<00:04:56.040> i've

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
they should but anyway that's why i've

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.520 
they should but anyway that's why i've
gone<00:04:56.340> with<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.610> slightly<00:04:56.940> smaller<00:04:57.300> berm<00:04:57.930> along

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
gone with a slightly smaller berm along

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.440 
gone with a slightly smaller berm along
the<00:04:58.680> edges<00:04:58.830> here<00:04:59.250> i<00:04:59.400> don't<00:05:00.180> know<00:05:00.240> if<00:05:00.270> that's

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
the edges here i don't know if that's

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.640 
the edges here i don't know if that's
going<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.720> focus<00:05:01.170> but<00:05:01.380> you<00:05:01.590> get<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.770> idea<00:05:03.650> so

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
going to focus but you get the idea so

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.400 
going to focus but you get the idea so
now<00:05:05.490> because<00:05:06.090> these<00:05:06.360> are<00:05:06.630> more<00:05:06.840> narrow<00:05:07.110> and

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
now because these are more narrow and

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.310 
now because these are more narrow and
there's<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.190> lot<00:05:08.490> of<00:05:08.520> space<00:05:08.970> I'm<00:05:09.660> a<00:05:09.720> little<00:05:10.230> bit

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
there's a lot of space I'm a little bit

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.380 
there's a lot of space I'm a little bit
more<00:05:10.470> restricted<00:05:11.070> for<00:05:11.250> adding<00:05:11.610> details<00:05:12.090> to

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
more restricted for adding details to

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.240 
more restricted for adding details to
them<00:05:12.630> so<00:05:13.560> what<00:05:13.680> I've<00:05:13.770> done<00:05:13.800> is<00:05:13.980> I've<00:05:14.190> taken

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
them so what I've done is I've taken

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.820 
them so what I've done is I've taken
some<00:05:14.700> very<00:05:14.910> very<00:05:15.150> small<00:05:15.450> rocks<00:05:15.750> sanded<00:05:16.680> them

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
some very very small rocks sanded them

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.970 
some very very small rocks sanded them
down<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:18.060> then<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.900> know<00:05:19.020> attach<00:05:19.410> them<00:05:19.740> and

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
down and then you know attach them and

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.550 
down and then you know attach them and
I've<00:05:20.400> scattered<00:05:20.970> them<00:05:21.180> about<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.780> tried<00:05:22.410> to

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
I've scattered them about and tried to

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.970 
I've scattered them about and tried to
add<00:05:22.680> a<00:05:23.160> little<00:05:23.400> bit<00:05:23.850> of<00:05:23.910> variety<00:05:24.470> also<00:05:25.470> so<00:05:25.950> that

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
add a little bit of variety also so that

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.010 
add a little bit of variety also so that
they<00:05:26.190> tie<00:05:26.430> in<00:05:26.670> thematically<00:05:27.240> with<00:05:27.540> the<00:05:27.690> wider

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
they tie in thematically with the wider

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.380 
they tie in thematically with the wider
Road<00:05:28.350> set<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.520> they<00:05:29.640> just<00:05:29.850> give<00:05:29.970> me<00:05:30.000> something

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
Road set and they just give me something

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.540 
Road set and they just give me something
to<00:05:30.540> paint<00:05:30.870> on<00:05:31.080> them<00:05:31.380> just<00:05:31.410> to<00:05:31.830> break<00:05:32.160> it<00:05:32.310> up<00:05:32.400> a

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
to paint on them just to break it up a

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.420 
to paint on them just to break it up a
little<00:05:32.850> bit<00:05:33.120> more<00:05:33.390> visually<00:05:34.080> in<00:05:34.800> addition<00:05:35.130> to

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
little bit more visually in addition to

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.460 
little bit more visually in addition to
that<00:05:35.610> what<00:05:36.180> i<00:05:36.240> did<00:05:36.600> on<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:36.900> couple<00:05:37.260> of<00:05:37.350> the

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
that what i did on a couple of the

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.910 
that what i did on a couple of the
pieces<00:05:37.620> as<00:05:38.010> i<00:05:38.130> went<00:05:38.370> in<00:05:38.610> and<00:05:38.820> bulked<00:05:39.720> up<00:05:39.920> the

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
pieces as i went in and bulked up the

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.430 
pieces as i went in and bulked up the
area<00:05:41.220> now<00:05:41.400> this<00:05:41.430> doesn't<00:05:41.790> really<00:05:42.300> look<00:05:42.660> giant

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
area now this doesn't really look giant

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.800 
area now this doesn't really look giant
perhaps<00:05:44.010> depending<00:05:44.880> on<00:05:45.030> how<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.210> final<00:05:45.690> video

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
perhaps depending on how the final video

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.500 
perhaps depending on how the final video
renders<00:05:46.470> on<00:05:46.710> but<00:05:47.040> this<00:05:47.580> is<00:05:47.760> a<00:05:47.790> little<00:05:48.180> bit<00:05:48.300> of<00:05:48.330> a

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
renders on but this is a little bit of a

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.010 
renders on but this is a little bit of a
mound<00:05:48.830> that<00:05:49.830> is<00:05:49.890> going<00:05:50.310> to<00:05:50.370> sit<00:05:50.880> proud<00:05:51.270> on<00:05:51.660> the

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
mound that is going to sit proud on the

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.170 
mound that is going to sit proud on the
surface<00:05:52.470> of<00:05:52.740> the<00:05:52.860> path<00:05:53.070> and<00:05:53.370> I've<00:05:53.910> done<00:05:54.150> that

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
surface of the path and I've done that

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.570 
surface of the path and I've done that
scattered<00:05:55.020> around<00:05:55.140> on<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:55.770> couple<00:05:56.280> of<00:05:56.370> them

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
scattered around on a couple of them

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.760 
scattered around on a couple of them
just<00:05:56.850> to<00:05:57.030> give<00:05:57.210> it<00:05:57.240> a<00:05:57.450> little<00:05:57.870> topography

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
just to give it a little topography

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.160 
just to give it a little topography
variation<00:05:59.520> wouldn't<00:06:00.360> be<00:06:00.450> much<00:06:00.600> to<00:06:00.810> add<00:06:00.930> in

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
variation wouldn't be much to add in

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.200 
variation wouldn't be much to add in
more<00:06:01.200> of<00:06:01.650> that<00:06:01.830> and<00:06:02.040> depends<00:06:02.700> on<00:06:02.790> really<00:06:03.060> how

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
more of that and depends on really how

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.960 
more of that and depends on really how
rough<00:06:03.480> of<00:06:03.660> a<00:06:03.750> look<00:06:03.960> we're<00:06:04.470> going<00:06:04.650> for<00:06:04.800> on<00:06:05.310> the

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
rough of a look we're going for on the

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.100 
rough of a look we're going for on the
pathway<00:06:06.750> if<00:06:07.200> you<00:06:07.320> will<00:06:07.820> so<00:06:08.870> that's<00:06:09.870> something

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
pathway if you will so that's something

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.770 
pathway if you will so that's something
that<00:06:10.260> could<00:06:10.500> be<00:06:10.620> amended<00:06:11.130> you<00:06:12.120> can<00:06:12.270> see<00:06:12.450> here

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
that could be amended you can see here

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.650 
that could be amended you can see here
and<00:06:12.900> of<00:06:12.960> course<00:06:13.140> a<00:06:13.200> little<00:06:13.350> bit<00:06:13.440> darker<00:06:13.560> here

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
and of course a little bit darker here

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.870 
and of course a little bit darker here
so<00:06:15.660> the<00:06:15.780> goal<00:06:15.960> being<00:06:16.200> that<00:06:16.590> there<00:06:17.220> will<00:06:17.370> be<00:06:17.400> you

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
so the goal being that there will be you

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.760 
so the goal being that there will be you
know<00:06:18.000> this<00:06:18.450> can<00:06:18.690> be<00:06:18.780> used<00:06:18.960> as<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.290> connector

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
know this can be used as the connector

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.010 
know this can be used as the connector
piece<00:06:20.040> and<00:06:20.340> then<00:06:20.610> with<00:06:20.970> a<00:06:21.000> full<00:06:21.300> set<00:06:21.570> of<00:06:21.810> this

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
piece and then with a full set of this

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.130 
piece and then with a full set of this
of<00:06:22.890> the<00:06:23.070> other<00:06:23.220> pieces<00:06:23.520> you'll<00:06:23.940> have<00:06:24.120> see<00:06:24.930> here

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
of the other pieces you'll have see here

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.810 
of the other pieces you'll have see here
12<00:06:25.470> 24<00:06:26.310> plus<00:06:26.880> another<00:06:27.060> 6<00:06:27.480> is<00:06:27.750> 30<00:06:28.370> you<00:06:29.370> know<00:06:29.520> say

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
12 24 plus another 6 is 30 you know say

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.060 
12 24 plus another 6 is 30 you know say
almost<00:06:30.150> 40<00:06:30.660> inches<00:06:30.930> of<00:06:31.110> road<00:06:31.320> with<00:06:31.620> a<00:06:31.680> single

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
cast with a couple curves and a couple

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.040 
cast with a couple curves and a couple
you<00:06:34.410> know<00:06:34.560> in<00:06:34.710> a<00:06:34.740> fork<00:06:35.340> and<00:06:35.880> whatnot<00:06:36.390> but<00:06:36.900> that

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
you know in a fork and whatnot but that

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.510 
you know in a fork and whatnot but that
gives<00:06:37.140> you<00:06:37.260> a<00:06:37.320> look<00:06:37.560> at<00:06:37.740> it<00:06:37.800> these<00:06:38.010> are<00:06:38.160> for

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
gives you a look at it these are for

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.680 
gives you a look at it these are for
people<00:06:38.670> who<00:06:38.850> are<00:06:38.940> curious<00:06:39.120> these<00:06:39.390> are<00:06:39.510> based

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
people who are curious these are based

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.370 
people who are curious these are based
on<00:06:39.900> point<00:06:40.440> 06<00:06:41.330> styrene<00:06:42.330> which<00:06:42.570> I've<00:06:42.720> cut<00:06:42.990> and

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
on point 06 styrene which I've cut and

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.980 
on point 06 styrene which I've cut and
sanded<00:06:43.680> down<00:06:44.010> and<00:06:44.310> then<00:06:44.820> you<00:06:45.480> know<00:06:45.600> I'll<00:06:45.840> be

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
sanded down and then you know I'll be

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.800 
sanded down and then you know I'll be
making<00:06:46.800> a<00:06:47.070> you<00:06:47.670> know<00:06:47.790> silicone<00:06:48.210> mold<00:06:48.480> of<00:06:48.660> these

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
making a you know silicone mold of these

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.020 
making a you know silicone mold of these
and<00:06:49.080> then<00:06:49.500> from<00:06:49.710> the<00:06:49.830> silicone<00:06:50.220> mold<00:06:50.460> I'll<00:06:50.730> be

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
and then from the silicone mold I'll be

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.510 
and then from the silicone mold I'll be
pouring<00:06:51.450> in<00:06:51.600> urethane<00:06:52.380> rubber<00:06:52.740> to<00:06:53.220> get<00:06:53.370> the

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
pouring in urethane rubber to get the

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.850 
pouring in urethane rubber to get the
final<00:06:53.730> piece

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
final piece

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.550 
final piece
so<00:06:55.860> that<00:06:56.009> gives<00:06:56.160> you<00:06:56.310> a<00:06:56.340> quick<00:06:56.639> look<00:06:56.880> at<00:06:57.090> the

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
so that gives you a quick look at the

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.650 
so that gives you a quick look at the
Masters<00:06:58.560> for<00:06:58.860> the<00:06:59.009> upcoming<00:06:59.449> pathways<00:07:00.449> will

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
Masters for the upcoming pathways will

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.680 
Masters for the upcoming pathways will
call<00:07:00.840> them<00:07:00.960> paths<00:07:01.229> and<00:07:01.789> this<00:07:02.789> is<00:07:03.000> my<00:07:03.180> sort<00:07:03.600> of

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690 
call them paths and this is my sort of

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.020 
call them paths and this is my sort of
stop<00:07:03.930> point<00:07:04.410> just<00:07:04.680> to<00:07:04.800> check<00:07:05.070> in<00:07:05.310> with<00:07:05.340> the

stop point just to check in with the

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.480 
stop point just to check in with the

community and the customer to see if
there's<00:07:08.699> any<00:07:08.850> revisions<00:07:09.360> that<00:07:09.419> need<00:07:09.750> to<00:07:10.050> be

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
there's any revisions that need to be

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.749 
there's any revisions that need to be
done<00:07:10.410> or<00:07:10.710> whether<00:07:10.860> I'm<00:07:11.009> going<00:07:11.190> in<00:07:11.370> a<00:07:11.520> totally

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 
done or whether I'm going in a totally

done or whether I'm going in a totally
wrong<00:07:12.150> direction<00:07:12.330> before<00:07:12.750> I<00:07:12.930> pour<00:07:13.340> the<00:07:14.340> rubber

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550 
wrong direction before I pour the rubber

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.249 
wrong direction before I pour the rubber
which<00:07:14.789> is<00:07:14.970> the<00:07:15.210> most<00:07:15.389> expensive<00:07:15.600> part<00:07:16.020> of<00:07:16.169> the

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 
which is the most expensive part of the

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.590 
which is the most expensive part of the
process<00:07:16.470> so<00:07:16.949> feel<00:07:17.910> free<00:07:17.940> to<00:07:18.150> leave<00:07:18.360> comments

keep your eye on the channel I'll be
coming<00:07:22.949> back<00:07:23.039> probably<00:07:23.610> in<00:07:23.850> a<00:07:24.150> little<00:07:24.600> bit

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
coming back probably in a little bit

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.020 
coming back probably in a little bit
down<00:07:25.020> the<00:07:25.050> road<00:07:25.199> with<00:07:26.100> some<00:07:26.280> more<00:07:26.430> updates<00:07:26.880> on

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.030 
down the road with some more updates on

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.770 
down the road with some more updates on
some<00:07:27.240> projects<00:07:27.690> that<00:07:27.840> I<00:07:27.870> have<00:07:28.050> going<00:07:28.229> on<00:07:28.470> and<00:07:28.669> I

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780 
some projects that I have going on and I

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.210 
some projects that I have going on and I
think<00:07:30.780> we'll<00:07:31.020> just<00:07:31.169> keep<00:07:31.199> this<00:07:31.440> one<00:07:31.500> short<00:07:31.889> so

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 
think we'll just keep this one short so

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.219 
think we'll just keep this one short so
thanks<00:07:33.150> for<00:07:33.240> joining<00:07:33.479> me<00:07:33.660> and<00:07:33.840> I'll<00:07:34.050> talk<00:07:34.169> to
