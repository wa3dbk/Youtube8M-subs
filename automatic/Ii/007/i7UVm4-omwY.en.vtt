00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.180 

very<00:00:24.400> often<00:00:25.000> when<00:00:25.390> a<00:00:25.420> driver<00:00:25.750> does<00:00:26.290> use<00:00:26.710> a<00:00:26.740> whip

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.190 
very often when a driver does use a whip

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.280 
very often when a driver does use a whip
they're<00:00:27.850> not<00:00:28.090> necessarily<00:00:28.660> hitting<00:00:29.200> the

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
they're not necessarily hitting the

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.840 
they're not necessarily hitting the
horse<00:00:29.500> I<00:00:29.620> mean<00:00:29.650> sometimes<00:00:29.920> the<00:00:30.280> whip<00:00:30.460> isn't

even hitting the horses flesh no
sometimes<00:00:33.250> or<00:00:33.580> most<00:00:33.610> of<00:00:33.880> times<00:00:34.090> it's<00:00:34.270> hitting

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
sometimes or most of times it's hitting

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.090 
sometimes or most of times it's hitting
either<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:34.750> shaft<00:00:34.990> and<00:00:35.380> a<00:00:35.410> lot<00:00:35.860> of<00:00:35.890> times

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
either the shaft and a lot of times

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.170 
either the shaft and a lot of times
that's<00:00:36.250> where<00:00:36.490> like<00:00:36.760> if<00:00:36.910> you're<00:00:37.000> standing

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
that's where like if you're standing

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.520 
that's where like if you're standing
outside<00:00:37.390> and<00:00:37.690> you<00:00:37.750> hear<00:00:37.900> the<00:00:38.050> cracking<00:00:38.410> noise

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
outside and you hear the cracking noise

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.560 
outside and you hear the cracking noise
is<00:00:38.710> -<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.160> whip<00:00:39.309> hitting<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.610> shaft<00:00:39.850> we're

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
is - the whip hitting the shaft we're

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.120 
is - the whip hitting the shaft we're
hitting<00:00:40.780> a<00:00:40.840> saddle<00:00:41.140> pad<00:00:41.290> or<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.590> wheel<00:00:41.800> disc

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
hitting a saddle pad or the wheel disc

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.590 
hitting a saddle pad or the wheel disc
if<00:00:42.489> you<00:00:42.580> flip<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:42.820> whip<00:00:43.030> out<00:00:43.150> to<00:00:43.270> the<00:00:43.330> side<00:00:43.480> of

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
if you flip the whip out to the side of

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.060 
if you flip the whip out to the side of
sitting<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.870> wheel<00:00:43.989> disc<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:44.470> not<00:00:44.650> really

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
sitting the wheel disc and not really

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.340 
sitting the wheel disc and not really
hitting<00:00:45.250> anything<00:00:45.460> close<00:00:46.030> to<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.270> horse<00:00:46.480> you

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
hitting anything close to the horse you

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.010 
hitting anything close to the horse you
know<00:00:47.379> so<00:00:48.340> what<00:00:48.730> I<00:00:48.760> mean<00:00:48.970> excuse<00:00:49.420> to<00:00:49.660> encourage

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
know so what I mean excuse to encourage

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.350 
know so what I mean excuse to encourage
them<00:00:50.200> along<00:00:50.230> more<00:00:50.800> so<00:00:50.980> than<00:00:51.220> just<00:00:51.670> sit<00:00:52.239> out

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
them along more so than just sit out

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.299 
them along more so than just sit out
there<00:00:52.480> and<00:00:52.540> flip<00:00:53.200> on<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.440> horse<00:00:53.650> just<00:00:54.100> think

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
there and flip on the horse just think

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.100 
there and flip on the horse just think
about<00:00:54.400> it<00:00:54.700> you're<00:00:55.210> coming<00:00:55.540> down<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.720> stretch

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
about it you're coming down the stretch

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.970 
about it you're coming down the stretch
and<00:00:56.530> all<00:00:57.490> these<00:00:57.700> drivers<00:00:57.970> are<00:00:58.329> going<00:00:58.450> right

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and all these drivers are going right

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.920 
and all these drivers are going right
and<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.610> hear<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.300> you're<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.450> horse<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:01.870> you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
and you hear and you're a horse and you

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.380 
and you hear and you're a horse and you
see<00:01:02.200> you're<00:01:02.520> hopping<00:01:03.520> on<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.820> wheel<00:01:04.030> disc

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
see you're hopping on the wheel disc

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.450 
see you're hopping on the wheel disc
you're<00:01:04.630> thinking<00:01:05.020> right<00:01:06.450> behind<00:01:07.450> me<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:09.100> it's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
you're thinking right behind me so it's

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.249 
you're thinking right behind me so it's
one<00:01:09.670> of<00:01:09.700> those<00:01:09.820> things<00:01:10.180> where<00:01:10.450> he<00:01:10.960> can<00:01:11.080> maybe

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
one of those things where he can maybe

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.749 
one of those things where he can maybe
wants<00:01:11.619> to<00:01:11.710> get<00:01:11.830> away<00:01:11.920> from<00:01:12.070> that<00:01:12.369> noise

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
wants to get away from that noise

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.210 
wants to get away from that noise
um<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.860> horses<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.910> do<00:01:16.450> get<00:01:17.350> encouraged<00:01:17.920> by

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
um so horses that do get encouraged by

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.330 
um so horses that do get encouraged by
the<00:01:18.280> whip<00:01:18.550> though<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:19.149> older<00:01:19.570> horses<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:20.200> know

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the whip though the older horses I know

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.219 
the whip though the older horses I know
sometimes<00:01:21.340> they're<00:01:21.850> kind<00:01:22.540> of<00:01:22.630> smarter<00:01:23.080> than

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
sometimes they're kind of smarter than

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.800 
sometimes they're kind of smarter than
the<00:01:23.350> driver<00:01:23.680> maybe<00:01:24.040> yes<00:01:24.580> you<00:01:25.149> know<00:01:25.270> it's<00:01:25.420> it

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
the driver maybe yes you know it's it

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.420 
the driver maybe yes you know it's it
depends<00:01:26.140> on<00:01:26.259> who<00:01:26.409> are<00:01:26.530> some<00:01:26.710> horses<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.280> know

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
depends on who are some horses you know

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.610 
depends on who are some horses you know
take<00:01:28.330> encouragement<00:01:28.840> well<00:01:28.930> some<00:01:29.260> don't<00:01:29.470> like

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
take encouragement well some don't like

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.230 
take encouragement well some don't like
it<00:01:29.799> at<00:01:29.860> all<00:01:29.950> some<00:01:30.280> will<00:01:30.400> just<00:01:30.610> pretty<00:01:31.060> much

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
it at all some will just pretty much

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.760 
it at all some will just pretty much
pull<00:01:31.510> up<00:01:31.659> and<00:01:31.840> slow<00:01:32.110> write<00:01:32.290> down<00:01:32.470> if<00:01:32.680> you

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
pull up and slow write down if you

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.130 
pull up and slow write down if you
really<00:01:33.130> get<00:01:33.250> after<00:01:33.430> them<00:01:33.700> so<00:01:34.330> it's<00:01:34.720> kind<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.080> a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
really get after them so it's kind of a

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.020 
really get after them so it's kind of a
touch-and-go<00:01:35.710> situation<00:01:35.979> of<00:01:36.610> which<00:01:36.760> horse

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
touch-and-go situation of which horse

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.090 
touch-and-go situation of which horse
likes<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.659> which<00:01:37.750> ones<00:01:37.960> don't<00:01:38.110> fans<00:01:38.799> are

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
likes and which ones don't fans are

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.460 
likes and which ones don't fans are
probably<00:01:39.310> very<00:01:39.670> used<00:01:39.940> to<00:01:40.060> seeing<00:01:40.330> drivers<00:01:40.840> use

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
probably very used to seeing drivers use

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.960 
probably very used to seeing drivers use
whips<00:01:41.770> especially<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.460> fans<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:42.820> North

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
whips especially the fans in North

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.700 
whips especially the fans in North
America<00:01:43.510> right<00:01:43.780> well<00:01:43.960> actually<00:01:44.140> it's<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.530> rule

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
America right well actually it's a rule

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.200 
America right well actually it's a rule
that<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.920> driver<00:01:45.220> has<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.490> carry<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:45.850> whip<00:01:46.030> with

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
that a driver has to carry a whip with

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.180 
that a driver has to carry a whip with
him<00:01:46.360> it's<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.320> certain<00:01:47.619> length<00:01:47.799> and<00:01:48.130> the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190
