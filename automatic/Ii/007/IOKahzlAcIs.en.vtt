answer to him was as follows everybody

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.790 
answer to him was as follows everybody
is<00:00:37.380> different<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.490> generally<00:00:39.650> from<00:00:40.650> my

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
is different but generally from my

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.820 
is different but generally from my
experience<00:00:41.400> the<00:00:42.030> body<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.540> only<00:00:42.630> handle<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
experience the body can only handle a

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.320 
experience the body can only handle a
certain<00:00:44.100> amount<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.340> protein<00:00:44.640> at<00:00:44.970> one<00:00:45.120> time

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
certain amount of protein at one time

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.680 
certain amount of protein at one time
you<00:00:45.540> can't<00:00:45.780> ingest<00:00:47.060> 100<00:00:48.060> grams<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.480> protein

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
you can't ingest 100 grams of protein

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.450 
you can't ingest 100 grams of protein
and<00:00:48.990> expect<00:00:49.380> the<00:00:49.470> body<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.010> body<00:00:50.220> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and expect the body of your body to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
and expect the body of your body to
efficiently<00:00:50.940> digest<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.720> and<00:00:52.020> use<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
efficiently digest that and use it to

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.910 
efficiently digest that and use it to
build<00:00:53.220> muscle<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> that's<00:00:55.440> why<00:00:55.680> I'm

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
build muscle so that's why I'm

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.070 
build muscle so that's why I'm
bodybuilding<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.640> try<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> eat<00:00:57.150> or<00:00:57.780> in

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
bodybuilding you try to eat or in

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.100 
bodybuilding you try to eat or in
powerlifting<00:00:58.680> also<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.340> try<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> eat<00:01:00.120> smaller

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
powerlifting also you try to eat smaller

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.030 
powerlifting also you try to eat smaller
mini<00:01:01.920> meals<00:01:02.280> more<00:01:02.850> often<00:01:03.120> throughout<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.780> day

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
mini meals more often throughout the day

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.460 
mini meals more often throughout the day
therefore<00:01:05.040> you're<00:01:05.280> getting<00:01:05.840> between<00:01:06.840> 20

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
therefore you're getting between 20

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.260 
therefore you're getting between 20
maybe<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.890> third<00:01:08.070> 20<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.550> 30<00:01:08.760> grams<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
maybe and third 20 to 30 grams of

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.020 
maybe and third 20 to 30 grams of
protein<00:01:09.510> per<00:01:09.990> meal<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.370> way<00:01:11.520> your<00:01:11.670> body's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
protein per meal that way your body's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.420 
protein per meal that way your body's
not<00:01:12.060> getting<00:01:12.540> shot<00:01:12.810> anybody<00:01:13.650> could<00:01:14.040> take<00:01:14.250> that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
not getting shot anybody could take that

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.700 
not getting shot anybody could take that
protein<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.150> put<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.510> work<00:01:15.690> for<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.560> that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
protein and put it to work for so that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.570 
protein and put it to work for so that
was<00:01:16.830> my<00:01:16.860> advice<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.760> gentleman<00:01:19.580> this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
was my advice to this gentleman this

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.120 
was my advice to this gentleman this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
young man that emailed us about 20 to 30

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.130 
young man that emailed us about 20 to 30
grams<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.700> protein<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.600> found<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.020> my

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
own body builders and power levels will

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.580 
own body builders and power levels will
