00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.800 
here we found the perfect base look at
this<00:01:10.770> top<00:01:10.979> compartment<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.760> open<00:01:12.030> it's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
perfect I mean there's hardly any walls

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.539 
perfect I mean there's hardly any walls
to<00:01:15.659> break<00:01:15.840> except<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.009> core<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.280> on

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
to break except for in the core and on

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.429 
to break except for in the core and on
the<00:01:17.640> bottom<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.180> i<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.750> take<00:01:18.900> out<00:01:19.020> half<00:01:19.229> this

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the bottom so i can take out half this

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.140 
the bottom so i can take out half this
base<00:01:19.680> without<00:01:19.950> having<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> break<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:21.090> than

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
base without having to break more than

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.870 
base without having to break more than
one<00:01:21.450> wall<00:01:21.689> that's<00:01:22.500> exactly<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:23.250> i<00:01:23.310> want<00:01:23.610> only

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
one wall that's exactly what i want only

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.480 
one wall that's exactly what i want only
thing<00:01:24.630> i<00:01:24.720> am<00:01:24.930> very<00:01:25.259> concerned<00:01:25.590> about<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.189> big

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
thing i am very concerned about is big

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.420 
thing i am very concerned about is big
bombs<00:01:27.080> there's<00:01:28.080> some<00:01:28.350> tombstones<00:01:28.979> around

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
bombs there's some tombstones around

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.899 
bombs there's some tombstones around
which<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.450> firstly<00:01:30.869> leads<00:01:31.470> me<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.770> believe

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
which it firstly leads me to believe

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.190 
which it firstly leads me to believe
someone<00:01:32.909> has<00:01:33.090> already<00:01:33.210> tagged<00:01:33.570> space<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
someone has already tagged space and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.249 
someone has already tagged space and
hopefully<00:01:34.710> trip<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.220> bombs<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:36.030> may<00:01:36.990> not<00:01:37.200> be

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
hopefully trip the bombs that may not be

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.280 
hopefully trip the bombs that may not be
the<00:01:37.530> case<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.299> I'm<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.509> drop<00:01:39.750> my<00:01:39.960> witches
