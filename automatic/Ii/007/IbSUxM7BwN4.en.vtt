00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.230

make sure place over here like that and
then<00:01:43.939> play<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.329> not<00:01:45.540> repeater<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:48.060> then

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
then play so it's not repeater and then

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.790 
then play so it's not repeater and then
push<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.299> way<00:01:51.420> back<00:01:55.369> then

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
push it all the way back then

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.590 
push it all the way back then
a<00:01:58.740> block<00:01:59.740> right<00:02:00.190> over<00:02:00.250> here<00:02:00.790> so<00:02:01.150> if<00:02:01.300> it's<00:02:01.450> on

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
a block right over here so if it's on

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.720 
a block right over here so if it's on
this<00:02:01.750> side<00:02:01.810> you<00:02:02.170> place<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.530> over<00:02:02.620> here<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.190> on

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
this side you place it over here and on

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.000 
this side you place it over here and on
this<00:02:03.910> side<00:02:04.150> you<00:02:04.180> place<00:02:04.540> over<00:02:04.870> here<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.320> you

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
this side you place over here and you

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.890 
this side you place over here and you
need<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.280> redstone<00:02:06.700> torch<00:02:06.970> I<00:02:07.450> forgot<00:02:07.750> to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
need a redstone torch I forgot to

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.880 
need a redstone torch I forgot to
mention<00:02:08.050> that<00:02:09.810> redstone<00:02:10.810> torch<00:02:11.080> facing<00:02:11.770> it

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
mention that redstone torch facing it

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.050 
mention that redstone torch facing it
this<00:02:12.040> way<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.450> all<00:02:13.780> of<00:02:13.990> those<00:02:14.110> activate<00:02:15.060> same

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
this way so all of those activate same

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.360 
this way so all of those activate same
thing<00:02:16.240> on<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:16.570> side<00:02:16.630> but<00:02:17.050> over<00:02:17.320> here<00:02:17.530> and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
thing on this side but over here and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.110 
thing on this side but over here and
then<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.420> should<00:02:19.570> activate<00:02:19.990> like<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.410> hmm

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
then it should activate like that hmm

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.930 
then it should activate like that hmm
then<00:02:22.120> place<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.780> tripwire<00:02:23.740> hook<00:02:24.280> on<00:02:24.520> each<00:02:24.700> of

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
then place a tripwire hook on each of

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.400 
then place a tripwire hook on each of
these<00:02:25.060> blocks<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:26.010> then<00:02:27.010> pour<00:02:27.550> him<00:02:27.760> back<00:02:28.410> you

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
these blocks and then pour him back you

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.550 
these blocks and then pour him back you
want<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.680> kind<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:29.980> disguise<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:32.320> wire

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
want to kind of disguise the the wire

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.440 
want to kind of disguise the the wire
even<00:02:33.010> though<00:02:33.340> it's<00:02:33.460> hard<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.820> see<00:02:34.000> just<00:02:34.030> can<00:02:34.360> we

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
even though it's hard to see just can we

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.110 
even though it's hard to see just can we
get<00:02:34.630> bit<00:02:34.780> harder<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:36.220> just<00:02:36.520> place<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.060> you

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
get bit harder so just place it and you

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.800 
get bit harder so just place it and you
should<00:02:37.270> hear<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> click<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:39.490> then<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.300> should

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
should hear a click and then it should

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.120 
should hear a click and then it should
open<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:43.000> close<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:44.140> nut<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.620> shows<00:02:44.950> if

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
open and close that nut that shows if

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.630 
open and close that nut that shows if
you<00:02:45.250> did<00:02:45.460> it<00:02:45.550> right<00:02:45.750> now<00:02:46.750> I'm<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:48.100> is<00:02:48.310> you

you did it right now I'm this is you
basically<00:02:49.740> basically<00:02:50.740> finished<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.460> trap<00:02:51.760> so

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
basically basically finished the trap so

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.900 
basically basically finished the trap so
now<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:52.690> want<00:02:53.110> to<00:02:53.200> dig<00:02:54.040> right<00:02:54.370> here<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:57.460> then

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.080 

just<00:03:00.910> dig<00:03:01.660> a<00:03:01.690> little<00:03:01.840> hole<00:03:01.989> up<00:03:02.830> no<00:03:03.459> accident

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
just dig a little hole up no accident

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:12.479 
just dig a little hole up no accident
you<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.100> do<00:03:06.250> just<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.880> little<00:03:07.060> extra<00:03:11.489> so

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
you have to do just a little extra so

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.290 
you have to do just a little extra so
you<00:03:12.900> can<00:03:13.900> make<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.410> hole<00:03:14.680> up<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.280> here<00:03:15.580> okay

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
you can make the hole up to here okay

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.400 
you can make the hole up to here okay
and<00:03:17.170> then<00:03:18.010> place<00:03:18.400> lava<00:03:18.880> here<00:03:19.270> water<00:03:19.690> anything

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
and then place lava here water anything

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.360 
and then place lava here water anything
it's<00:03:20.739> up<00:03:20.830> to<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:22.660> just<00:03:23.620> fill<00:03:23.920> this<00:03:24.040> with

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
lava or water exactly that you can just

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.100 
lava or water exactly that you can just
leave<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.070> empty<00:03:27.220> if<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.550> want<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.970> it's<00:03:28.930> a

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
leave it empty if you want to it's a

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.110 
leave it empty if you want to it's a
matter<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.410> opinion

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
matter of opinion

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.090

try to have to hide all the redstone and
hide<00:04:05.200> all<00:04:05.530> of<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:06.180> all<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.480> distance<00:04:08.050> so

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
hide all of the all of the distance so

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.540 
hide all of the all of the distance so

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
you don't want to make it look like a

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.410 
you don't want to make it look like a
trap

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
trap

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.340 
trap
and<00:04:10.510> um<00:04:11.290> do<00:04:11.860> best<00:04:12.760> is<00:04:13.090> to<00:04:13.600> hide<00:04:13.750> these<00:04:13.990> to<00:04:14.200> hide

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
and um do best is to hide these to hide

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.720 
and um do best is to hide these to hide
these<00:04:14.560> I'll<00:04:14.860> just<00:04:15.069> show<00:04:15.250> you<00:04:15.280> how<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.520> hide

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
these I'll just show you how to hide

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.050 
these I'll just show you how to hide
those<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.829> basically<00:04:17.829> making<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.459> double<00:04:18.700> layer

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
those is basically making a double layer

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.670 
those is basically making a double layer
of<00:04:19.890> blocks<00:04:20.890> so<00:04:21.310> you<00:04:21.370> can<00:04:21.579> do<00:04:21.730> this<00:04:22.110> I'll<00:04:23.110> say

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
of blocks so you can do this I'll say

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.920 
of blocks so you can do this I'll say
four<00:04:24.190> blocks<00:04:24.460> high<00:04:25.110> same<00:04:26.110> over<00:04:26.380> here<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:28.570> then

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
four blocks high same over here and then

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.670 
four blocks high same over here and then
just<00:04:29.610> cover<00:04:30.610> it<00:04:30.820> like<00:04:30.970> that<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:34.350> do<00:04:35.350> the<00:04:35.380> same

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
just cover it like that and do the same

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.390 
just cover it like that and do the same
thing<00:04:35.950> here

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
thing here

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:44.510 
thing here
keep<00:04:37.090> keep<00:04:37.630> doing<00:04:37.930> that<00:04:41.130> do<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:42.340> like<00:04:42.520> that

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
keep keep doing that do that like that

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.830 
keep keep doing that do that like that
so<00:04:45.520> it<00:04:45.910> looks<00:04:46.120> like<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:48.940> it'll<00:04:49.210> be<00:04:49.330> hard<00:04:49.360> to<00:04:49.690> see

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
so it looks like so it'll be hard to see

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.230 
so it looks like so it'll be hard to see
then<00:04:50.050> you<00:04:50.110> can<00:04:50.230> I<00:04:50.260> carry<00:04:50.500> dark<00:04:50.980> so<00:04:51.310> it<00:04:51.910> doesn't

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
then you can I carry dark so it doesn't

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:59.210 
then you can I carry dark so it doesn't
like<00:04:52.360> show<00:04:52.660> so<00:04:53.700> same<00:04:54.700> thing<00:04:54.910> on<00:04:55.030> this<00:04:55.180> side

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:09.390 

double<00:05:00.220> layer<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:08.380> yeah<00:05:08.890> you<00:05:08.950> don't<00:05:09.220> have<00:05:09.310> to

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
double layer so yeah you don't have to

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.600 
double layer so yeah you don't have to
do<00:05:09.640> that<00:05:09.790> back<00:05:10.030> part<00:05:10.330> if<00:05:10.480> you<00:05:10.690> want<00:05:10.900> it<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:12.430> yeah

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
do that back part if you want it so yeah

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.640 
do that back part if you want it so yeah
and<00:05:13.030> then<00:05:13.900> you<00:05:14.050> can<00:05:14.169> just<00:05:14.410> cover<00:05:14.680> this<00:05:16.020> so<00:05:17.020> this

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
and then you can just cover this so this

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.740 
and then you can just cover this so this
trap<00:05:18.040> works<00:05:18.340> with<00:05:18.580> people<00:05:19.000> who<00:05:19.210> are<00:05:19.419> walking

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
trap works with people who are walking

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.260 
trap works with people who are walking
normally<00:05:22.350> and<00:05:23.350> then<00:05:23.500> it<00:05:23.770> works<00:05:24.100> with<00:05:24.460> people

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
normally and then it works with people

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.770 
normally and then it works with people
and<00:05:25.390> Springs<00:05:25.930> I'll<00:05:26.440> show<00:05:26.710> you<00:05:26.770> that<00:05:26.950> right<00:05:27.100> now

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
and Springs I'll show you that right now

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:36.240 
and Springs I'll show you that right now
spring<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:33.250> I<00:05:33.940> think<00:05:34.300> if<00:05:35.020> it's<00:05:35.320> if<00:05:35.860> you<00:05:36.070> guys

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
spring and I think if it's if you guys

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.950 
spring and I think if it's if you guys
did<00:05:36.460> exactly<00:05:36.940> same<00:05:37.300> five<00:05:37.690> Pistons<00:05:38.290> and<00:05:39.300> five<00:05:40.300> a

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
did exactly same five Pistons and five a

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.860 
did exactly same five Pistons and five a
two<00:05:41.229> by<00:05:41.380> five<00:05:41.560> I<00:05:41.919> think<00:05:42.190> it<00:05:42.640> also<00:05:42.970> takes<00:05:43.450> people

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
two by five I think it also takes people

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.050 
two by five I think it also takes people
who<00:05:43.960> Bryant<00:05:44.500> sprint<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.100> jump<00:05:47.610> yeah<00:05:48.610> so<00:05:49.030> I

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
who Bryant sprint and jump yeah so I

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.750 
who Bryant sprint and jump yeah so I
think<00:05:49.330> I<00:05:49.720> tried<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.140> jump<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:50.680> it<00:05:51.310> caught<00:05:51.580> me

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
think I tried to jump and it caught me
