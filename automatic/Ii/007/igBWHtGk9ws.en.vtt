00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
we're just going to kind of cook it at

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.270 
we're just going to kind of cook it at
that<00:03:04.360> lower<00:03:04.810> temperature<00:03:05.440> we're<00:03:05.950> really<00:03:06.070> not

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
that lower temperature we're really not

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.100 
that lower temperature we're really not
approach<00:03:06.670> are<00:03:06.910> here<00:03:07.120> because<00:03:07.570> it<00:03:07.810> will<00:03:07.930> very

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
approach are here because it will very

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.820 
approach are here because it will very
pretty<00:03:08.350> quickly<00:03:08.820> all<00:03:09.820> right<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.830> drills

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
pretty quickly all right so drills

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.680 
pretty quickly all right so drills
actually<00:03:12.220> up<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.430> about<00:03:12.550> 650<00:03:13.240> so<00:03:13.390> it's<00:03:13.510> one

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
actually up to about 650 so it's one

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.240 
actually up to about 650 so it's one

little bit to lock in a lot of that

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.590 
little bit to lock in a lot of that
smoke<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:57.340> also<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.700> drop<00:03:57.970> that<00:03:58.120> temperature

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
smoke and also to drop that temperature

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.330 
smoke and also to drop that temperature
back<00:03:58.720> down<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.170> controllable<00:03:59.620> amount<00:03:59.980> we

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
back down to a controllable amount we

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
check on this in about two minutes flip

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.960 
check on this in about two minutes flip
it<00:04:05.080> over<00:04:05.200> give<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.070> another<00:04:06.160> two<00:04:06.460> minutes<00:04:06.760> and

coloring you'll see when we flip these

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.090 
coloring you'll see when we flip these
we're<00:04:28.990> gonna<00:04:29.110> have<00:04:29.200> peace<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.410> grill<00:04:29.770> marks
