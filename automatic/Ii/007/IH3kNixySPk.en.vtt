just rip tide right here to the body the
compressor<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:27.330> right<00:00:27.750> there<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.460> have<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
compressor is right there I have a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.069 
compressor is right there I have a
ground<00:00:30.000> wire<00:00:30.090> right<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:33.180> wires<00:00:33.420> connect

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
ground wire right here the wires connect

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.260 
ground wire right here the wires connect
right<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> relay<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:38.489> there's<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.969> wire

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
right here to a relay and there's a wire

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.709 
right here to a relay and there's a wire
that<00:00:39.480> goes<00:00:39.540> for<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> power<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.719> compressor

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
that goes for a power to the compressor

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.040 
that goes for a power to the compressor
and<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.350> there's<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.920> fuse<00:00:44.480> it<00:00:45.480> connects<00:00:45.840> in

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and then there's a fuse it connects in

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.369 
and then there's a fuse it connects in
here<00:00:47.989> to<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.920> regular<00:00:50.370> horns<00:00:50.760> fuse<00:00:51.350> then<00:00:52.350> I

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
here to the regular horns fuse then I

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.490 
here to the regular horns fuse then I
have<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.039> horse<00:00:53.309> which<00:00:53.640> go<00:00:54.480> through<00:00:55.320> the
