 much difference to make pasta now 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.029
 same in the gta iv I advise you to give it 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.160
 cane before they leave because 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.140
 same arrives at the 1.10 the 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.820
 mansions and you have to have pasta for 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.039
 buy it all 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.500
 for this trick we're going to need a 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.890
 bike my advice the bmx in the cheapest 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.620
 800 dots are at fault a car of 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.780
 the 1.09 update if you did not have 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.430
 none is as simple as that 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.470
 you buy the cheapest one and from there 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.910
 you are doing enough to go buying 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.309
 better cars and that you walk more 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.230
 because for doing the trick once 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.150
 let's have all things clear and ready 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.530
 and ready we will take the car with the 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.350
 that we are going to do the trick and we will leave 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.690
 from the garage 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.820
 once we are out of the garage we 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.440
 let's lower the two of the car because 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.809
 you will have to prepare a small trampita 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.670
 to say it somehow then 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.950
 imp that is going to stay 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.479
 by helping out what he's going to do 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.570
 is getting out of the car 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.369
 come here where you see that I go I see 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.890
 the marks that stay on the floor 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.080
 skid those marks you always leave them 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.450
 the cars when they leave the garage 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.820
 then I saw the partner by go 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.250
 help him to CÃ¡ceres that area fill it with 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.780
 f4 for when we go out with the 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.790
 bike bust more 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.650
 it has to be with c4 obligatorily 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.570
 because the bread has to go back 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.890
 from inside the car if he left us 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.350
 kill from outside the car when 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.909
 we were going to go out with our bike 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.740
 car would disappear automatically and 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.979
 would reappear inside the garage that's why 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.720
 it is mandatory that they be c4 once 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.369
 all prepared little imp is stuck in 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.190
 the car with those of four times 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.979
 waiting for me to leave I'll take the 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.530
 bike and I'll go outside when I'm 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.630
 going over the trap line 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.509

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.520

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.170
 this order and turn off the play or make a thousand 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.470
 moved as they were before is 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.360

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.989
 quietly because I'm going to walk 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.569
 It's already there and we're going to sell the 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.220
 car, nothing to do 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.830
 just go out with the bike that the 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.880
 bursting colleague and selling the car 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.230

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.069
 the car when leaving the garage what yes 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.959
 what should be taken into account is that 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.530
 we'll have to call the mechanic to 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.659
 ask for them 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.489
 to ask him to bring us the car if 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.709
 we went back to our garage and 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.420
 let's enter our garage we could 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.859
 get to lose the vehicle what 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.719
 we have to do is just as 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.849

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.969
 once the mechanic has brought us the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.709
 car we go back to the garage we left another 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:02.810
 time with the bike and we repeat the 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.810
