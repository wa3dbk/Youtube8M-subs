which is possible by the way but here
all<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.380> do<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.680> literally<00:01:08.040> bump<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.790> onto

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
all you do is literally bump it onto

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.330 
all you do is literally bump it onto
your<00:01:09.479> spacebar<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.470> it'll<00:01:10.890> go<00:01:10.950> ahead<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
your spacebar and it'll go ahead and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.399 
your spacebar and it'll go ahead and
have<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.610> verify<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.360> your<00:01:12.390> phone<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
have you verify with your phone that you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.350 
have you verify with your phone that you
want<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.740> connect<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.220> computer<00:01:14.790> now<00:01:15.299> you

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
want to connect to this computer now you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.789 
want to connect to this computer now you
have<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> bump<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.049> hard<00:01:16.229> enough<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.619> your

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
have to bump it hard enough that your

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.160 
have to bump it hard enough that your
phone<00:01:17.070> sensor<00:01:17.640> will<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.000> able<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.330> vibrate<00:01:18.930> or

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
phone sensor will be able to vibrate or

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.469 
phone sensor will be able to vibrate or
send<00:01:19.710> off<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> tone<00:01:20.220> letting<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> know<00:01:21.119> that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
send off a tone letting you know that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.050 
send off a tone letting you know that
basically<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.590> has<00:01:22.740> activated<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.640> sense

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
basically it has activated the sense

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.179 
basically it has activated the sense
that<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.540> are<00:01:24.570> tapping<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.409> spacebar<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that you are tapping on the spacebar and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.499 
that you are tapping on the spacebar and
then<00:01:26.580> for<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> computer<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.450> go
