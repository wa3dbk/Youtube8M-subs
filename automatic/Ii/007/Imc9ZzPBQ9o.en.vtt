00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
noticed about it and windows 8 it's hard

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.260 
noticed about it and windows 8 it's hard
to<00:00:49.630> get<00:00:49.750> used<00:00:49.900> to<00:00:50.110> but<00:00:50.739> I<00:00:51.040> like<00:00:51.700> the<00:00:51.820> windows<00:00:52.090> 8

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
to get used to but I like the windows 8

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.030 
to get used to but I like the windows 8
setup<00:00:52.510> on<00:00:52.870> it<00:00:52.899> mmm<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:55.210> pretty<00:00:55.360> good<00:00:56.230> it

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
setup on it mmm it's pretty good it

7 but what it comes with is Windows 8
and<00:01:01.660> I've<00:01:02.500> noticed<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.880> it's<00:01:04.560> quite<00:01:05.560> fast

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and I've noticed that it's quite fast

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.920 
and I've noticed that it's quite fast
it's<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.619> fan<00:01:08.920> speed<00:01:09.340> I've<00:01:09.790> tried<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:10.689> change

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
it's the fan speed I've tried to change

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.700 
it's the fan speed I've tried to change
the<00:01:11.049> fan<00:01:11.409> speed<00:01:11.740> but<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:13.380> software<00:01:14.380> that<00:01:14.590> were

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
the fan speed but the software that were

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.359 
the fan speed but the software that were
using<00:01:14.770> wasn't<00:01:15.729> working<00:01:16.030> very<00:01:16.240> good<00:01:16.329> and<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:18.040> I

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
using wasn't working very good and but I

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.149 
using wasn't working very good and but I
don't<00:01:19.329> know<00:01:19.389> if<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.539> can<00:01:19.659> hear<00:01:19.959> it<00:01:20.109> now<00:01:20.319> but

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
don't know if you can hear it now but

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.059 
don't know if you can hear it now but
you<00:01:21.310> can<00:01:21.490> hardly<00:01:21.670> hear<00:01:22.090> it<00:01:22.560> well<00:01:23.560> I<00:01:23.709> can<00:01:23.950> hardly

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:24.069 
you can hardly hear it well I can hardly

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.789 
you can hardly hear it well I can hardly
hear<00:01:24.429> it<00:01:24.490> but<00:01:25.179> sometimes<00:01:25.749> when<00:01:26.649> you're

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
hear it but sometimes when you're

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.440 
hear it but sometimes when you're
playing<00:01:26.979> games<00:01:27.280> or<00:01:27.700> when<00:01:27.759> you're<00:01:27.939> launching<00:01:28.119> a

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
playing games or when you're launching a

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.669 
playing games or when you're launching a
game<00:01:29.009> are<00:01:30.009> you<00:01:30.130> doing<00:01:30.369> something<00:01:31.679> intensive

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
game are you doing something intensive

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.069 
game are you doing something intensive
on<00:01:32.799> it<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.490> fans<00:01:33.759> do<00:01:34.119> speed<00:01:34.479> up<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:34.869> they<00:01:35.049> are

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
on it the fans do speed up and they are

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.980 
on it the fans do speed up and they are
quite<00:01:35.439> noticeable<00:01:36.069> so<00:01:36.520> that's<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:37.119> bad<00:01:37.749> point

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
quite noticeable so that's a bad point

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.550 
quite noticeable so that's a bad point
but<00:01:38.229> it<00:01:38.319> also<00:01:38.380> keeps<00:01:38.829> it<00:01:39.039> cool<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:40.409> also<00:01:41.409> it's

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
but it also keeps it cool and also it's

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.419 
but it also keeps it cool and also it's
my<00:01:42.340> room's<00:01:42.579> pretty<00:01:42.700> warm<00:01:43.270> at<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.479> moment<00:01:44.429> but

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
my room's pretty warm at the moment but

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.069 
my room's pretty warm at the moment but
if<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:45.639> just<00:01:45.819> open<00:01:46.209> up<00:01:46.299> sorry<00:01:46.810> about<00:01:46.990> the

shaking camera I just open up speed from
I<00:01:54.179> don't<00:01:55.179> know<00:01:55.359> how<00:01:55.539> accurate<00:01:55.840> this<00:01:56.349> is

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.990 

the<00:02:08.280> heat<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:11.070> these<00:02:11.310> fan<00:02:11.640> speeds

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
the heat to it so all these fan speeds

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.840 
the heat to it so all these fan speeds
are<00:02:12.300> running<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:14.100> if<00:02:14.160> we<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.370> get<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.670> focus

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
are running so if we can get it to focus

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.650 
are running so if we can get it to focus
oh<00:02:16.850> these<00:02:17.850> are<00:02:18.090> all<00:02:18.210> speeds<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:20.030> no<00:02:21.030> sorry

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
oh these are all speeds and no sorry

oh these are all speeds and no sorry
this<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.560> heat<00:02:22.770> in<00:02:23.130> which<00:02:23.780> all<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
this is the heat in which all the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.660 
this is the heat in which all the
components<00:02:25.560> are<00:02:25.650> running<00:02:25.890> out<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.520> it's

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
components are running out so it's

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.910 
components are running out so it's
pretty<00:02:26.880> long<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:28.140> I've<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.560> been<00:02:28.650> watching

million spintires
it<00:02:37.380> really<00:02:38.310> gets<00:02:38.520> over<00:02:38.700> 50<00:02:39.270> degrees<00:02:39.650> maximum

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650

and but as you can see and it's a it's
just<00:03:33.630> quite<00:03:33.840> small<00:03:34.170> computer<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.330> there's

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
just quite small computer and there's

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.289 
just quite small computer and there's
nothing<00:03:36.690> really<00:03:37.530> great<00:03:37.860> about<00:03:38.070> it<00:03:38.130> but<00:03:38.519> I<00:03:38.760> ran

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
nothing really great about it but I ran

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.509 
nothing really great about it but I ran
all<00:03:39.420> my<00:03:39.600> games<00:03:39.870> on<00:03:40.080> medium<00:03:40.500> graphics<00:03:40.709> at<00:03:41.310> room

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
all my games on medium graphics at room

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.729 
all my games on medium graphics at room
on<00:03:41.940> high<00:03:42.330> because<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.959> lag<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.500> get

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
on high because of the lag that I get

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.570 
on high because of the lag that I get
and<00:03:45.320> but<00:03:46.320> there<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.680> pretty<00:03:46.950> good<00:03:47.130> graphics

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
and but there is pretty good graphics

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.940 
and but there is pretty good graphics

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
that you get out of the games and that

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.030 
that you get out of the games and that
you<00:03:50.070> can<00:03:50.280> play<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.989> like<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:52.380> design<00:03:52.590> here

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
you can play and I like this design here

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.509 
you can play and I like this design here
you<00:03:53.670> can<00:03:53.850> push<00:03:54.090> that<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.950> comes<00:03:56.220> out<00:03:56.370> so

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
you can push that and that comes out so

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.670 
you can push that and that comes out so
it's<00:03:56.610> nicely<00:03:56.850> hidden<00:03:57.320> there's<00:03:58.320> just<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.560> little
