encouraging I think in the environment I
work<00:02:40.060> in<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.570> lighting<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.440> the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
work in that the lighting and the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.310 
work in that the lighting and the
constant<00:02:41.920> bars<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.490> harm<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.850> machines<00:02:43.320> this

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
constant bars and harm of machines this

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.590 
constant bars and harm of machines this
could<00:02:44.590> be<00:02:44.620> coincidence<00:02:44.950> dr.<00:02:45.940> young<00:02:46.150> wants<00:02:46.480> to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
could be coincidence dr. young wants to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.260 
could be coincidence dr. young wants to
do<00:02:46.720> further<00:02:46.990> research<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:48.160> southwark<00:02:48.850> this<00:02:49.150> is
