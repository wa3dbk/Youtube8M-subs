00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.069
 hello friends rest comes some 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.839
 possible 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.950
 I do not have to apologize to you 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.179
 I have nothing at the moment 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.070
 uploaded 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.200
 I have to say that, too 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.199
 I'm innocent about that and I did 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.910
 a pretty violent car accident me 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.539
 I'm stuck with my car 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.760
 go and a little older 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:29.250
 elderly citizens are unrestrained to me 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.980
 in the back and then at first 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.160
 over with fun even if the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.960
 emergency admission been full program and 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.210
 the funny thing was that the lady behind 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.739
 not at the police about me 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.309
 complained because I'm on the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.750
 Highway Park and the policeman can do it 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.239
 But you already know that then bin 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.649
 aftman jam 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.370
 that gives me a bit too 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.660
 think and of course I am a time 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.250
 i have failed too long now 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.260
 a few things that make me so 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.890
 But I'm a bit accompanying 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.140
 made a great and vowed 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.920
 solemn ski is again something 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.900
 After my illness phase should be annoying 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 makes with recipes and sang hire the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.159
 I remembered 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.960
 and the rain is also developing 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.000
 I have to explain briefly today 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.920
 why i go in the supermarket and think 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.020
 So what could one say as a snail vasco 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.600
 and when you also look the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.680
 deep- frozen box club and then I see it 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.570
 again from the company schlmmer schlmmer 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.329
 frozen pan for 499 or whether 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.400
 say calmly with his mixture 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.729
 hey I've been doing for ten years 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.729
 the German tractor 23 sad one 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.369
 few mushrooms grand brought here 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:56.930
 onion a potato 2 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.900
 I still have miles in Altendorf 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:07.840
 left over salt 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:11.500
 pepper ebola that was a bad pan 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.970
 of all vegans with power against 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.950
 potatoes carbohydrates a bit 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.280
 in it and tastes great 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.120
 you look so you know that too 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.620
 I cut the mushrooms in very thin 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.240
 stripes so far are the mushrooms 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.080
 cut I'll show you 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.980
 again look so well about 3 mm thick 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.810
 is even the worse times 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.280
 as well as mushrooms from year so and before you 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.560
 second cutting I make my flag 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.310
 on full throttle then that can be 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.590
 ever the onion and heat 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.209
 dashing onion small you belong 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.080
 you want kriegel had circles 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.700
 Renchen 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.610
 I like to cut the carrots fast 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.930
 also borrow 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.130
 the carrots have reuters under the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.690
 Slices makes it so in the here 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.989
 Meanwhile on the pan already hot 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.340
 be there and pack everything except the 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.340
 potatoes first 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.090
 which is pretty important to me right now 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.650
 picture now 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.280
 is it the cover pan to the 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.800
 but makes enough air let that in 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.070
 but the pan can heat up 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.630
 a moisture from our vegetables that 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.070
 have to go outside 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.540
 Today I know I have the 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.120
 Potato intentionally at the end 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.380
 I have been with you very much since 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.840
 the game tailor 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.310
 and because they are the fastest 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.310
 also in the pan the fastest chaos 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.350
 he has a lot of friends at some point 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:09.069
 lost from its moisture 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:12.040
 Pleasantly quite good and then has 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.580
 you just add the potatoes and 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.139
 let the world arrive 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:24.820
 at the occasion we can ever 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:38.290
 Salt and pepper according to your needs 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:40.630
 over it it rings probably worse flag 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.900
 frozen or from the pack on 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.889
 This is a rest sugar of the 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.590
 Pediatrician has seen it totally 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.120
 quickly cut into oil salt 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.460
 pepper and we are a bit more 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.740
 above and finish this perfect 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.080
 eat as carbohydrates in it 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.990
 These are just vitamins in there since I saw 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.180
 taste in there is of course also in 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.289
 the shit podiums want to sell with 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.950
 Do it yourself without 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:12.070
 I quickly made flavor enhancers 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:16.479
 now knows briefly then always two now 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.820
 away for the decoration because I have to be honest 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.380
 I have my friends in the ego mine 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.580

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.330
 small i have the intention of course 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:36.030
 not cooked because of course 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.949
 that the essential oils of the 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.360
 taste of may in which 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:42.360
 Of course we know more 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.400
 have more air and now they are 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.580
 essential oils that give in now 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.780
 vollgas 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.610
 it still gets through with the warm food 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.229
 and out of experience, yes anyway 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.000
 eat none yes there is much to say 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.650
 comes down pretty well that mixed 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.530
 Now it all comes to the aroma 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:06.030
 that is the madness that is joy 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.490
 friends trust me 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.919

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.289
 Seen here went totally fast tastes 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.139
 It will be totally good and now it will show 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.969

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:20.569

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.360
 you say there everything is in it what you are 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.340

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.620
 cures and shit and sluggish and left 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.220

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.240

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.500

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.500
 until next time
