some<00:04:28.050> details<00:04:28.469> on<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.770> helmet<00:04:29.039> so<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:29.969> thought

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
some details on the helmet so I thought

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.000 
some details on the helmet so I thought
he<00:04:30.330> was<00:04:30.419> rather<00:04:30.599> boring<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:31.320> so<00:04:31.529> I<00:04:31.560> took<00:04:31.680> him

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010

supposed to be kind of looks like a bird

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.430 
supposed to be kind of looks like a bird
to<00:04:43.889> me<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:44.550> then<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:45.360> did<00:04:45.539> paint<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.020> numa

which you can see on the little Numa

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.219 
which you can see on the little Numa
graphic<00:04:49.529> kind<00:04:49.800> of<00:04:49.889> looks<00:04:50.010> like<00:04:50.099> a<00:04:50.960> manga<00:04:51.960> a

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
graphic kind of looks like a manga a

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.120 
graphic kind of looks like a manga a
little<00:04:52.949> manga<00:04:53.250> design<00:04:53.610> on<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:54.719> on<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.130> arf

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
little manga design on the on the arf

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.240 
little manga design on the on the arf
trooper<00:04:56.669> boil<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.469> just<00:04:58.469> copied<00:04:58.620> it<00:04:58.889> on<00:04:59.010> there

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
trooper boil I just copied it on there

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.580 
trooper boil I just copied it on there
because<00:04:59.400> obviously<00:05:00.210> he<00:05:00.690> would<00:05:00.960> probably<00:05:01.409> have

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
because obviously he would probably have

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.180 
because obviously he would probably have
that<00:05:01.770> on<00:05:01.919> this<00:05:02.130> helmet<00:05:03.440> if<00:05:04.440> he<00:05:04.650> had<00:05:04.830> it<00:05:04.949> on<00:05:05.039> the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
that on this helmet if he had it on the

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.820 
that on this helmet if he had it on the
arf<00:05:05.370> trooper<00:05:05.580> helmet<00:05:05.940> it<00:05:06.150> would<00:05:06.270> make<00:05:06.449> sense

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
arf trooper helmet it would make sense

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.730 
arf trooper helmet it would make sense
so<00:05:08.029> that<00:05:09.029> pretty<00:05:09.180> much<00:05:09.300> does<00:05:09.659> it<00:05:09.870> there<00:05:10.139> the

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
so that pretty much does it there the

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.769 
so that pretty much does it there the
way<00:05:10.860> that<00:05:11.039> i<00:05:11.070> weathered<00:05:11.580> them<00:05:11.820> talk<00:05:12.449> about<00:05:12.479> the

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:12.779 
way that i weathered them talk about the

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.149 
way that i weathered them talk about the
way<00:05:12.870> that<00:05:13.020> i<00:05:13.080> weathered<00:05:13.380> them<00:05:13.560> i<00:05:13.680> didn't<00:05:13.979> use

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
way that i weathered them i didn't use

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.459 
way that i weathered them i didn't use
my<00:05:14.339> usual<00:05:17.270> method<00:05:18.270> for<00:05:18.539> weathering<00:05:19.080> clones

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
my usual method for weathering clones

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.829 
my usual method for weathering clones
that<00:05:19.710> i<00:05:19.830> do<00:05:19.889> i<00:05:20.070> use<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.760> pastel<00:05:21.270> or<00:05:21.539> not<00:05:21.810> I

00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:21.839 
that i do i use the pastel or not I

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.029 
that i do i use the pastel or not I
didn't<00:05:22.320> even<00:05:22.500> do<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.740> wash<00:05:22.919> i<00:05:23.190> did<00:05:23.370> actually<00:05:23.550> a

the black paint and then I rubbed it on

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.260 
the black paint and then I rubbed it on
a<00:05:34.710> piece<00:05:34.949> of<00:05:34.979> paper<00:05:35.159> until<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:35.669> was<00:05:35.820> almost<00:05:35.969> no
