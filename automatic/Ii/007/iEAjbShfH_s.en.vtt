but<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> neon<00:00:27.869> ninja<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.199> also<00:00:28.529> very

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
but the neon ninja is also very

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.359 
but the neon ninja is also very
difficult<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.670> use<00:00:29.970> at<00:00:30.300> first<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.900> should<00:00:31.109> say

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
difficult to use at first I should say

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.580

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
but when you learn how to use them it's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.340

bit<00:05:23.469> more<00:05:23.710> of<00:05:23.830> a<00:05:23.919> cooldown<00:05:24.310> than<00:05:24.550> everything

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
bit more of a cooldown than everything

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:30.420 
bit more of a cooldown than everything
else<00:05:24.969> that<00:05:27.750> guy<00:05:28.750> might<00:05:29.440> come<00:05:29.740> into<00:05:29.979> the<00:05:30.069> battle

ult<00:06:04.520> and<00:06:05.440> I'm<00:06:06.440> sure<00:06:06.770> there<00:06:07.040> are<00:06:07.190> other<00:06:07.400> ways

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
ult and I'm sure there are other ways

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.280 
ult and I'm sure there are other ways
you<00:06:07.730> can<00:06:07.850> do<00:06:08.000> it<00:06:08.030> too<00:06:08.360> but<00:06:08.840> that's<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.170> way

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
you can do it too but that's the way

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.360 
you can do it too but that's the way
that<00:06:09.470> I<00:06:09.530> see<00:06:09.890> is<00:06:10.010> most<00:06:10.280> effective<00:06:12.010> so<00:06:13.010> what<00:06:13.250> I'm

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
that I see is most effective so what I'm

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.730 
that I see is most effective so what I'm
going<00:06:13.520> to<00:06:13.580> go<00:06:13.700> ahead<00:06:13.730> and<00:06:13.970> do<00:06:14.060> now<00:06:14.290> is<00:06:15.290> tell<00:06:15.620> you
