a process of structured serendipity that
means<00:00:18.800> that<00:00:19.070> I<00:00:19.310> set<00:00:19.640> up<00:00:19.669> the<00:00:19.939> circumstances

individual life experiences when I was
little<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.770> used<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.010> draw<00:03:03.190> all<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.520> time<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:04.180> I

little I used to draw all the time and I

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.320 
little I used to draw all the time and I
suppose<00:03:05.680> like<00:03:05.920> most<00:03:06.160> girls<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.640> drew<00:03:06.850> horses

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330

all<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:08.140> time<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.380> loved<00:03:08.770> horses<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.400> think<00:03:09.430> the

all the time I loved horses I think the

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.250 
all the time I loved horses I think the
figure<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.269> horse<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.720> probably<00:03:10.989> one<00:03:11.140> of<00:03:11.170> the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
figure of a horse is probably one of the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.740 
figure of a horse is probably one of the

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
most elegant figures there is and I used

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.150 
most elegant figures there is and I used
to<00:03:13.870> draw<00:03:14.110> women's<00:03:14.530> faces<00:03:15.130> very<00:03:16.030> very<00:03:16.480> very

asking for guidance I remember I came

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.000 
asking for guidance I remember I came
into<00:04:00.599> my<00:04:00.780> studio<00:04:01.079> and<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:01.469> looked<00:04:01.709> at<00:04:01.950> a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
into my studio and I looked at a

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.789 
into my studio and I looked at a
painting<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.939> was<00:04:03.209> doing<00:04:03.719> these<00:04:03.959> forms<00:04:04.379> at<00:04:04.620> that

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
painting I was doing these forms at that

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.580 
painting I was doing these forms at that
time<00:04:05.129> I<00:04:05.489> looked<00:04:06.209> at<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.480> painting<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.290> saw

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
time I looked at the painting and I saw

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.559 
time I looked at the painting and I saw
past<00:04:08.069> present<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.639> future<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:09.030> was<00:04:09.269> like

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
past present and future I was like

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.009 
past present and future I was like
suspended<00:04:10.139> in<00:04:10.290> time<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:11.010> was<00:04:11.250> amazing<00:04:12.150> feeling

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
suspended in time it was amazing feeling

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.670 
suspended in time it was amazing feeling
of<00:04:13.230> love<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:15.269> just<00:04:15.959> being<00:04:16.199> completely

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
of love that just being completely

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.499 
of love that just being completely
surrounded<00:04:16.979> by<00:04:17.489> love<00:04:17.699> and<00:04:17.910> there<00:04:18.120> wasn't<00:04:18.269> any

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
surrounded by love and there wasn't any

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.569 
surrounded by love and there wasn't any
food<00:04:18.870> than<00:04:19.139> I'm<00:04:19.320> dying<00:04:19.620> or<00:04:20.099> anything<00:04:20.130> like

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
food than I'm dying or anything like

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.510 
food than I'm dying or anything like
that<00:04:20.639> you<00:04:21.000> just<00:04:21.030> knew<00:04:21.740> that<00:04:22.740> everything's

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
that you just knew that everything's

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.670 
that you just knew that everything's
perfect<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:24.740> so<00:04:25.740> when<00:04:26.190> I<00:04:26.220> do<00:04:26.370> my<00:04:26.669> work<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:27.240> don't

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
perfect and so when I do my work I don't

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.070 
perfect and so when I do my work I don't
think<00:04:28.680> about<00:04:28.800> that<00:04:28.949> so<00:04:29.310> much<00:04:29.460> anymore<00:04:29.759> as<00:04:30.240> I

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
think about that so much anymore as I

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.710 
think about that so much anymore as I
think<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.860> joy<00:04:32.160> wanting<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.120> paintings<00:04:33.509> to<00:04:33.599> be

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
think of joy wanting the paintings to be

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.800 
think of joy wanting the paintings to be
joyful<00:04:34.020> when<00:04:34.889> the<00:04:35.009> person<00:04:35.570> approaches<00:04:36.570> them

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
joyful when the person approaches them

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.969 
joyful when the person approaches them
and<00:04:37.699> understanding<00:04:38.699> that<00:04:38.940> we<00:04:39.180> are<00:04:39.210> a

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
and understanding that we are a
