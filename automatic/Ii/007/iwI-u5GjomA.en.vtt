00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:10.059
 Nice to meet you, Yoko Ishigami 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:14.000
 This time I tried it on the radio about the audition of all night Nippon zero 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:21.619
 I want to talk about what I want to do 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:26.270
 Raz is a traditional form of postcards and recently recruited nails from listeners 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:32.419
 More and more and Toka read by taking it in the program Te 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:34.020
 I think that there is always a program going on, but in that I 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.680
 It has been featured 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.000
 I am very happy when I was born 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:45.410
 I also I'd love because this form it it 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.850
 I'm want to increase is when this time I'll do it 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:54.840
 One twitter is how to increase 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:58.660
 I 'm doing Twitter, but there are a lot of people these days 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:06.220
 Link that twitter and the radio nicely 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:08.280
 It's fun if you can take real voices of listeners in real time in the form of simultaneous precedent 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:14.010
 I think that is not- 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:19.290
 What I think floats Speaking of February, a little ne my Twitter I tried of my machine 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:24.690
 When I asked him to ask if it was going to be there 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.670
 I'd think of another fold in after Valentine's Day is that it is this I unique 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:32.130
 It's a February Stake 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.230
 This is a story about horse racing but I love horse racing again and I look at my twitter 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.210
 There are a lot of people who like horse racing for me 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.990
 That's why in February there is a g 1 sound loud race febrary stakes 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:48.770
 There was also 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:54.510
 It is the day of the cat in February 22 ex- Nyan Nyan Nyan if it is a minority 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:59.730
 I hate it I wish Toka such comment came pretty because after jumping out soon not buy next 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:07.140
 I have a lot of comments coming up like this with just this phrase that says February 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:09.119
 But I feel like that while I'm talking to a listener on Twitter with a rate hike time 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.110
 How does the comment arrive 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.500
 For example, what is good for the February Stakes this year 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.540
 Pollen measures 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:25.430
 I 'm doing something like this or that kind of voice is same as Dawn and I pick it up 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:31.129
 And we thought that want to make a radio in the feeling that a conversation with the person of the listener 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.969
 It is a story I do not know whether I can actually do it yet, but I thought it would be fun 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:37.730
 People 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:39.560
 After this one my voice I want to listen to it for a little more 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.550
 Thank you in advance 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.550
