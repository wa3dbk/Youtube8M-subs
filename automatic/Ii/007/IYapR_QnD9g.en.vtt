get into it so let's as we get into that
exploding<00:00:40.730> right<00:00:40.879> now<00:00:41.680> you<00:00:42.680> can<00:00:42.830> use<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:43.250> as

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
exploding right now you can use this as

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.869 
exploding right now you can use this as
the<00:00:43.580> portrait<00:00:44.420> or<00:00:44.900> landscape<00:00:45.800> view<00:00:46.400> doesn't

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
the portrait or landscape view doesn't

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.640 
the portrait or landscape view doesn't
matter<00:00:47.410> and<00:00:48.410> at<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.309> top<00:00:49.489> it<00:00:49.550> says<00:00:49.700> low<00:00:50.239> light

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
matter and at the top it says low light

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.560 
matter and at the top it says low light
pause<00:00:51.650> periodically<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:52.610> if<00:00:53.089> there<00:00:53.300> is<00:00:53.390> no

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
pause periodically so if there is no

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.750 
pause periodically so if there is no
light<00:00:53.839> and<00:00:54.230> then<00:00:54.980> basically<00:00:55.280> you<00:00:55.460> get<00:00:55.550> to<00:00:55.670> go<00:00:55.730> a

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
light and then basically you get to go a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.210 
light and then basically you get to go a
lot<00:00:55.970> slower<00:00:56.150> because<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.230> kind<00:00:57.589> of<00:00:57.620> patch<00:00:57.830> the

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
lot slower because it kind of patch the
