00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
sure the setting is in RGB just here and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.279 
sure the setting is in RGB just here and
just<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.649> tend<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> do<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.100> lift<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.550> um

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
just what I tend to do is lift it up um

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.130 
just what I tend to do is lift it up um
because<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:46.710> lifting<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.579> little<00:00:47.730> bit

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
because I like lifting it a little bit

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.840 
because I like lifting it a little bit
making<00:00:49.140> figure<00:00:49.680> nice<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.100> pale<00:00:50.340> even<00:00:50.789> though

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
making figure nice and pale even though

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.610 
making figure nice and pale even though
she's<00:00:51.030> repaired<00:00:51.390> already<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:52.289> looks<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.530> lot

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
she's repaired already it looks a lot

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.760 
she's repaired already it looks a lot
better<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.420> then<00:00:54.420> I'll<00:00:54.600> tend<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.050> go<00:00:55.379> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
better and then I'll tend to do is go to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.639 
better and then I'll tend to do is go to
each<00:00:55.949> channel<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:59.280> just<00:01:00.270> slightly<00:01:01.020> in

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
each channel and just just slightly in

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.349 
each channel and just just slightly in
this<00:01:01.859> case<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.579> bit<00:01:02.699> warmer<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.300> I

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
this case on a little bit warmer so I

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.990 
this case on a little bit warmer so I
just<00:01:03.570> did<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> red<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.369> green<00:01:05.670> channel

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
just did the red and the green channel

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.880 
just did the red and the green channel
is<00:01:06.150> always<00:01:06.360> great<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.110> adjust<00:01:07.500> when<00:01:07.740> you're

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
is always great to adjust when you're

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.160 
is always great to adjust when you're
shooting<00:01:08.549> portraits<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.330> giving

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170

sort of thing I do I'm editing portrait
so<00:02:39.189> I<00:02:39.730> usually<00:02:41.790> go<00:02:42.790> through<00:02:42.939> this<00:02:43.180> first<00:02:43.450> the

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
so I usually go through this first the

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.479 
so I usually go through this first the
Spot<00:02:43.900> Healing<00:02:43.930> Brush<00:02:44.909> and<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:47.530> tend<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.099> after

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
that do a bit of airbrushing and which

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.559 
that do a bit of airbrushing and which
I'll<00:02:50.889> do<00:02:51.069> a<00:02:51.099> separate<00:02:51.519> tutorial<00:02:51.669> on<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:52.419> the

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
I'll do a separate tutorial on in the

I'll do a separate tutorial on in the
near<00:02:52.719> future<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.519> then<00:02:54.519> after<00:02:54.849> that<00:02:54.939> I<00:02:55.000> just

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
near future and then after that I just

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.170 
near future and then after that I just
the<00:02:55.540> curves<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.230> get<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.439> exposure<00:02:56.769> right

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the curves to get the exposure right

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.189 
the curves to get the exposure right
then<00:02:58.180> I<00:02:58.209> go<00:02:58.659> through<00:02:58.930> and<00:03:00.510> kind<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.629> just<00:03:01.989> add

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:02.199 
then I go through and kind of just add

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.929 
then I go through and kind of just add
bits<00:03:02.949> and<00:03:03.129> pieces<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.579> want<00:03:03.760> for<00:03:03.879> example

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:03.939
