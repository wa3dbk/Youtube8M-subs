00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.270
 you have to keep in mind that in these in 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.270
 these definitions where 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.020
 in the locality it is important 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.310
 We know that the importance of playing a 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.790
 match of 180 minutes in which 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:21.280
 we are not going to change our idea 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.800
 of they played our positions for 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.529
 face to face you and of 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.500
 tomorrow he still has the collections 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.660
 necessary for a shooting team that 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.360
 has very good players that is a 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.760
 team that works very well but good 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.970
 not losing sight of what we usually 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.180
 do not be us 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.640
 I said it before the Guarani party 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.340
 that is when we went to forge and we did not 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.870
 we usually take precautions but not 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.790
 we usually get into situations that 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.800
 we do not know how to stop about 30 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.230
 meters back and play near 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.880
 our area or in certain 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.070
 moments of the game can reach 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.530
 happen because the rival team submits you 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.530
 to that but we will try not to 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.140
 happen and if it happens to be very very 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.650
 very close together, very compact 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.840
 and good with the premise of attacking and 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.350
 try to win the game because I think 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.049
 me that 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.000
 if we're good we can win the game 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.979
 tomorrow I think the two teams are 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.490
 Respect beyond what you can 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.330
 get to generate outside and the environment that 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.040
 sometimes it is generated will happen to us 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.520
 We also in Buenos Aires as 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.020
 spent in mexico here in Monterrey 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.409
 but 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.420
 being realistic that there are two very 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.820
 good teams that will face 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.649
 that for something they have arrived at this stay 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.310
 I think the two of the best teams 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.550
 of this cup liberators without any 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.350
 place to doubt and good 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.500
 we will have to play a very good match 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.150
 so as not to be suffering 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.940
 We also believe that the party 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.340
 morning 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.240
 it will not end up being decisive of 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.250
 everything is very mentalized in this 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.700
 in this goal that was one of the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:22.190
 main objectives the challenge that the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:25.700
 club has been coming for a long time 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.530
 the fan normally wants to win the 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.120
 liberators and today we are facing a 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.260
 privileged situation that the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.230
 players know perfectly what 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.700
 that they are going to have the opportunity to 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.250
 power 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.709
 play to win this competition and 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.920
 stay in the club's big story in 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.629
 the memory of all his fans and that 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.379
 that is not a small thing, that is, it is not necessary 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.930
 that one says or goes a long time 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.610
 further back to to try to reflect 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.870
 what one has lived but what is being 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.019
 living now very strong and we 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.030
 we have in that it is already really me what 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.069
 I take it very calm knowing if 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.410
 is being aware of what is not 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.690
 are playing and transmitting to 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.430
 players the same thing or that's for something 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.970
 they are here for something it took is cost 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.910
 A lot was an effort of a whole 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.860
 semester that began there by the month 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.780
 February 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.880
 having the possibility to play a 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.580
 Cup after so many years for the club 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.550
 and good many effort what is 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.440
 he did and they are very involved in what 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.940
 in what is this final 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.430
 beyond him 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.730
 the logical nervousness how good that 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.070
 exist of those desires of wanting to play 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.610
 that adrenaline that happens to you before 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.170
 play the game I think we 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.390
 beyond all that we are a team that 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.900
 Has known 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:57.190
 respond very well to these situations and 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.040
 that's an advantage and I think it's a 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.510
 important advantage not to waste 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.060
 will not have a mature team that 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.310
 understands what the moments are and this 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.010
 It is a moment of great importance 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.230
 because it is at stake no more or less than 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.970
 a 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.280
 that a cup shape liberators say 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.030
 live very strong emotions in that 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.310
 then he was very young he was very small and 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.110
 now totally different from another place 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.970
 Many many years passed and I am already 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.480
 living a unique experience in the 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.280
 place 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.920
 in the place that I want in the place that 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.560
 I love being that has me like 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.170
 very expectant but the same at the same 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.150
 quiet time trying to reflect you 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.130
 are the players that tranquility that 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.230
 it is necessary prior to the great 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.940
 event that will be tomorrow and that 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.520
 will be repeated on Wednesday that 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.620
 come good social airs there are many 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.620
 games but we're fine all 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.370
 clubs there is a very tempting situation 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.690
 for everyone river that is that everything 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.910
 the world imagines a match with the 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.460
 barcelona in December you could give 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.790
 that luxury of thinking about that or just points 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.790
 of the final 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.050
 no yes no 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.669
 objective with a good signal that 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.529
 presentiment you have now what do I do 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.839
 now we go to the session 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:19.789
 well I had a good sign in that 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:22.069
 moment means that if we are each 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.769
 time for that fence has been for that signal 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.610
 but but for having supported us 

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:29.250
 little bit 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.879
 in those things that sometimes arise 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.580
 that you can grab us this 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:37.510
 result of having tied that match 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.760
 what 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.450
 almost in more than 80 minutes it was not 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.040
 outside the cup he made 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.720
 these situations are what you 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.700
 strengthen and ultimately are those that 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.950
 they were holding oceans 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.720
 if this easy the first phase and we 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.830
 we have strengthened based on that or 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:01.760
 when we classify 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:05.780
 with the help of if we want to say it like that 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:08.270
 of tires winning in Peru we are 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.950
 talking about a normal thing that should 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.590
 happen normally a team that goes to 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.010
 win 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.380
 and he did he behaved professionally 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:20.110
 speak speaks well of his spirit of 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.520
 competition and we had to win 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:26.790
 ours to be able to enter and then 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.790
 we started 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.720
 to cross with the rivals more 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.330
 powerful and we had to do our 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.039
 That's good work and highlight what 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.770
 if today we are here it is because 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:43.340
 We knew how to take advantage of those opportunities 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.210
 a cup that we have been perceiving thus 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.969
 It's making us dodge 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.590
 many years and today we are in 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:50.569
 position again to play a final 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.020
 after the position of that time or 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.219
 that will be a new a new challenge 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.830
 for this campus that is coming 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:07:00.199
 demonstrating good things throughout 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.750
 all this year I always see the benefit 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:04.550
 what I believe for the team 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.129
 living that we are more 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.990
 dangerous when we attack that when 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:10.639
 we defend ourselves then, although there is 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.490
 defend because this is about 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:17.580
 defend the defense and attack game 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:21.530
 we try to be able 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.530
 have those two tools 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:27.700
 as a weapon that stands out in this 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:31.290
 team because honestly here in everything 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:34.290
 the world attacks when it has to attack and 

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.290
 defend
