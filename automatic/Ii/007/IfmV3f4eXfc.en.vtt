right now using its robotic arm to dig
down<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.180> water<00:01:41.510> ice<00:01:41.750> thought<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.290> be

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
down to the water ice thought to be

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.650 
down to the water ice thought to be
below<00:01:42.880> one<00:01:43.880> of<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.060> interesting<00:01:44.450> things

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
below one of the interesting things

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.930 
below one of the interesting things
about<00:01:44.780> Phoenix<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.530> doesn't<00:01:45.830> have<00:01:45.980> wheels<00:01:46.220> so

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
about Phoenix it doesn't have wheels so

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.790 
about Phoenix it doesn't have wheels so
it<00:01:47.060> doesn't<00:01:47.360> move<00:01:47.480> around<00:01:47.660> but<00:01:48.260> that<00:01:48.290> doesn't

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
it doesn't move around but that doesn't

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.440 
it doesn't move around but that doesn't
mean<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.130> not<00:01:49.220> exploring<00:01:49.910> it<00:01:50.030> actually<00:01:50.360> is

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
mean it's not exploring it actually is

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.040 
mean it's not exploring it actually is
going<00:01:50.720> down<00:01:51.310> instead<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.460> laterally<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:53.360> we

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
going down instead of laterally so we

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.540 
going down instead of laterally so we
think<00:01:54.260> of<00:01:54.380> it<00:01:54.500> as<00:01:54.590> kind<00:01:54.770> of<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:55.010> rover<00:01:55.400> that's

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
think of it as kind of a rover that's

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.530 
think of it as kind of a rover that's
doing<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.120> vertical<00:01:57.040> exploration<00:01:58.300> water<00:01:59.300> ice

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540
