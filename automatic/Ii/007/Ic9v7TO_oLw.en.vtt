00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
really well I think really the only

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.080

mistake<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.340> made<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.520> should<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:26.939> checked

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
mistake I made I should have checked

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
mistake I made I should have checked
that<00:01:27.240> term<00:01:27.509> back<00:01:27.810> when<00:01:28.320> he<00:01:28.409> called<00:01:28.590> me<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
that term back when he called me on the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.870 
that term back when he called me on the
flop<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.570> thought<00:01:31.110> he<00:01:31.170> had<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.320> jack<00:01:31.590> though

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
flop I I thought he had a jack though

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.340 
flop I I thought he had a jack though
money<00:01:32.880> he<00:01:33.000> almost<00:01:33.240> folders<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> Kings<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.110> I

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
money he almost folders the Kings so I

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.080 
money he almost folders the Kings so I
mean<00:01:34.829> maybe<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.310> hindsight<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.729> wasn't<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
mean maybe in hindsight it wasn't the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.830 
mean maybe in hindsight it wasn't the
worst<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.650> I<00:01:38.000> mean<00:01:39.000> every<00:01:39.180> time<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.420> three-bet

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
worst but I mean every time I three-bet

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.020 
worst but I mean every time I three-bet
him<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.020> had<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.829> picked<00:01:41.340> my<00:01:41.460> spots<00:01:41.759> I

never except for that last hand i don't

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.270

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
think i ever got it in from behind like

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.639

one<00:01:50.520> hand<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.000> six<00:01:51.630> days<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.140> tournament

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
one hand and six days in a tournament

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.280 
one hand and six days in a tournament
that<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.729> much<00:01:53.939> about<00:01:54.149> suck<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.570> out<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.020> I

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that is so much about suck it out so I

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.889 
that is so much about suck it out so I
mean<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.070> played<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:57.060> coin<00:01:57.360> flips<00:01:57.659> in
