character there's two versions of deanna

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.410 
character there's two versions of deanna
troi<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.410> course<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.970> for<00:00:17.970> me<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.119> more

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
troi this of course is for me the more

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.200 
troi this of course is for me the more
iconic<00:00:18.810> version<00:00:19.380> where<00:00:19.830> she's<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.210> gray

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
iconic version where she's in a gray

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.279 
iconic version where she's in a gray
with<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> little<00:00:22.439> purple<00:00:22.830> stripe<00:00:23.689> outfit<00:00:24.689> I'm

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
with a little purple stripe outfit I'm

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.929 
with a little purple stripe outfit I'm
sure<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.130> quite<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> bit<00:00:26.730> throughout

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
sure what this quite a bit throughout

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.509 
sure what this quite a bit throughout
the<00:00:27.119> show<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.710> me<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.830> think<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.310> is

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
the show and so for me I think this is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.299 
the show and so for me I think this is
the<00:00:29.670> more<00:00:30.349> kind<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.470> accurate<00:00:31.830> one<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.189> in

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the more kind of accurate one to have in

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.220 
the more kind of accurate one to have in
the<00:00:32.399> collection<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the collection but this is the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.780 
the collection but this is the

entertainment earth exclusive and is a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.369 
entertainment earth exclusive and is a
little<00:00:39.239> bit<00:00:39.360> harder<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.660> find<00:00:39.989> than<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> other
