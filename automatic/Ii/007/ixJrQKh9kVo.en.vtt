00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
about animals in my time my policy is to

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.990 
about animals in my time my policy is to
believe<00:00:16.680> them<00:00:16.830> all<00:00:16.980> because<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.340> grew<00:00:17.730> up<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.940> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
believe them all because I grew up in a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.210 
believe them all because I grew up in a
city<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.480> animals<00:00:19.080> are<00:00:19.199> terrifying<00:00:19.710> aliens

city and animals are terrifying aliens

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.890 
city and animals are terrifying aliens
to<00:00:20.369> me<00:00:20.520> but<00:00:20.880> that's<00:00:21.029> kind<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.330> bad<00:00:21.480> policy

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
to me but that's kind of a bad policy

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.150 
to me but that's kind of a bad policy
because<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> lot<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> stuff<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.890> hear<00:00:23.039> is

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
because a lot of the stuff you hear is

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
well how about throwing rice at weddings

well how about throwing rice at weddings
I<00:00:53.219> heard<00:00:53.699> birds<00:00:54.000> will<00:00:54.180> eat<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
I heard birds will eat it and then it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.150 
I heard birds will eat it and then it
will<00:00:54.899> expand<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.440> their<00:00:55.530> stomachs<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.010> then

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
will expand in their stomachs and then

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.350 
will expand in their stomachs and then
they'll<00:00:56.309> explode<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.030> then<00:00:57.120> we're<00:00:57.239> all

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
they'll explode and then we're all

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.979 
they'll explode and then we're all
horrible<00:00:58.109> people<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> mean<00:00:59.489> rice<00:01:00.449> happens

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
horrible people but I mean rice happens

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.110 
horrible people but I mean rice happens
in<00:01:01.199> nature<00:01:01.379> outside<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.190> weddings<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.879> don't

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
in nature outside of weddings and don't

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.780 
in nature outside of weddings and don't
birds<00:01:03.449> eat<00:01:03.809> rights<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.409> nature<00:01:04.769> yes<00:01:05.250> totally

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
birds eat rights in nature yes totally

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.120 
birds eat rights in nature yes totally
in<00:01:06.180> some<00:01:06.540> areas<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:07.020> eat<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.500> much<00:01:07.650> rice<00:01:07.890> that

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
in some areas they eat so much rice that

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.520 
in some areas they eat so much rice that
they<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.280> serious<00:01:08.939> damage<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.390> crop<00:01:09.720> yields<00:01:10.140> so

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
they do serious damage to crop yields so

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.170 
they do serious damage to crop yields so
throw<00:01:10.860> all<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> rice<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.220> want<00:01:11.580> love<00:01:11.939> birds

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
throw all the rice you want love birds

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.780 
throw all the rice you want love birds
real<00:01:12.659> birds<00:01:12.689> are<00:01:13.290> totally<00:01:13.710> fine<00:01:13.920> how<00:01:14.610> about

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
real birds are totally fine how about
