00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.330
 product of curiosity and wanting to occupy the time that for so many years 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.749
 that he dedicated to the mariña 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:17.570
 roberto ramírez decided to undertake a project as ingenious as innovative 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.300
 t3 microenterprise 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.609
 I think it's one of the few in Argentina 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.390
 even because 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.079
 the head of the philosophy that with so much pact for that we are going to be grass 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.910
 the joke metropolis what we are doing here 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.910
 it's a system of resentful plants 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.500
 using this method 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.330
 people can grow in the city 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.450
 all kinds of vegetables whenever it's just starting 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.580
 this is so 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.690
 the cabinet will special 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.710
 you do not have to be heated a perennial spring 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.820
 this technique 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.990
 It is a simple clean and low cost way 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.679
 to produce fast growing vegetables 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.680
 the time of the mante 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.660
 d duration 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.050
 PS the seed was left 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.990
 until he has removed the eta seed with the product it takes more or less eight 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.480
 days it was stopped it by bora 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.310
 so when shalit 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.740
 You came back in at the time and you have it if you do not have the outbreak is leaving the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.950
 pib with an agenda 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.140
 it may seem like a utopia 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.090
 but the incombultura hydrophone and field is a reality in between rivers 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.900
 but as for my animals 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.410
 I have sold too 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.560
 the time of the evening 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.420
 in the face of drought they also have 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.820
 percent and I tell you it's very weird from here 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.820
 people see this as a little 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.150
 ebadí or 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.150
 percent even though animals eat it 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.119
 a method designed for those who opt for organic farming 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.180
 renewable and if you feel and with excellent future prospects 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:18.399
 in this country it has become an object country 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.709
 basically you do not have meat quality either 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.149
 by the way we are taking 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.049
 here there is no field for animals 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.389
 but the animal is assured an adaptation 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:32.889
 feeding 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.429
 that there is good by how much 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:37.639
 not have any kind of 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.129
 Addictive that may disturb 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.129
 we are far from all age fan 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.640
 innovative entrepreneur 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.949
 dynamic I started lario 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.709
 roberto ramírez 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.099
 an ingenious technique was encouraged 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:59.480
 how is to grow plants without soil and gender an interesting alternative 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.080
