00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.160 
we got the lead we got up 13 or 10 and
then<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.189> thought<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.850> we<00:01:57.119> played<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.719> made<00:01:57.899> some

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
then I thought we we played we made some

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.020 
then I thought we we played we made some
some<00:01:58.680> poor<00:01:58.890> shot<00:01:59.100> selection<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.700> didn't<00:01:59.909> go

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
some poor shot selection we didn't go

not there on the catch and he gets his
rhythm<00:03:07.760> going<00:03:07.970> you're<00:03:08.750> in<00:03:08.840> trouble<00:03:08.959> but<00:03:09.319> not

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
rhythm going you're in trouble but not

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:10.840 
rhythm going you're in trouble but not
only<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.100> they<00:03:10.220> started<00:03:10.489> getting<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.790> the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
only that they started getting in the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.949 
only that they started getting in the
lane<00:03:11.000> because<00:03:11.150> they<00:03:11.329> had<00:03:11.480> us<00:03:11.630> like<00:03:11.780> well<00:03:11.930> I

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
lane because they had us like well I

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.140 
lane because they had us like well I
can't<00:03:12.230> help<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.470> long<00:03:12.829> so<00:03:13.130> that's<00:03:13.850> what

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
can't help that long so that's what

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.910 
can't help that long so that's what
poses<00:03:14.360> more<00:03:14.720> problems<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.320> think<00:03:15.530> for<00:03:15.709> any

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
poses more problems I think for any

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.500 
poses more problems I think for any
defense<00:03:16.310> is<00:03:16.459> that<00:03:16.579> stretch<00:03:16.880> for<00:03:17.120> on<00:03:17.299> ball

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
defense is that stretch for on ball

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.750 
defense is that stretch for on ball
screen<00:03:17.810> action<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:18.350> he's<00:03:18.829> been<00:03:19.040> on<00:03:19.250> fire<00:03:19.549> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
screen action and he's been on fire the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.300 
screen action and he's been on fire the
last<00:03:19.970> three<00:03:20.720> games<00:03:20.750> now<00:03:21.079> I<00:03:21.170> think<00:03:21.380> he's<00:03:21.620> he's

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
last three games now I think he's he's

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.569 
last three games now I think he's he's
torching<00:03:22.670> it<00:03:23.500> Tony<00:03:24.500> Anthony<00:03:25.220> went<00:03:25.400> through<00:03:25.549> a

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
torching it Tony Anthony went through a

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.190 
torching it Tony Anthony went through a
stretch<00:03:25.910> this<00:03:26.209> season<00:03:26.420> where<00:03:26.720> he<00:03:26.750> seemed<00:03:27.079> a

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
stretch this season where he seemed a

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.289 
stretch this season where he seemed a
little<00:03:27.380> bit<00:03:27.560> at<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.799> synch<00:03:28.370> offensively<00:03:28.519> the

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
little bit at a synch offensively the

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.699 
little bit at a synch offensively the
last<00:03:29.329> couple<00:03:29.900> games<00:03:30.049> he's<00:03:30.350> been<00:03:30.560> very

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
last couple games he's been very

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.880 
last couple games he's been very
efficient<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.519> effect<00:03:31.850> of<00:03:32.000> what's<00:03:32.180> he<00:03:32.299> doing

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
efficient that effect of what's he doing

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.890 
efficient that effect of what's he doing
what's<00:03:33.890> he<00:03:34.040> been<00:03:34.250> doing<00:03:34.579> recently<00:03:35.060> that<00:03:35.540> maybe

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
what's he been doing recently that maybe

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.990 
what's he been doing recently that maybe
he<00:03:36.019> wasn't<00:03:36.230> doing<00:03:36.410> for<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.680> while<00:03:36.790> one<00:03:37.790> we're

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
he wasn't doing for a while one we're

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.310 
he wasn't doing for a while one we're
getting<00:03:38.209> him<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.390> ball<00:03:38.420> in<00:03:38.600> good<00:03:38.840> spots<00:03:39.140> and

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
getting him the ball in good spots and

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.479 
getting him the ball in good spots and
he's<00:03:39.410> just<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.769> know<00:03:39.799> he's<00:03:40.010> turning<00:03:40.370> in

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
he's just you know he's turning in

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.180 
he's just you know he's turning in
facing<00:03:41.000> he's<00:03:41.209> he's<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:42.290> know<00:03:42.410> driving<00:03:42.829> hard

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
facing he's he's you know driving hard

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.500 
facing he's he's you know driving hard
and<00:03:43.400> he's<00:03:43.489> been<00:03:43.640> making<00:03:43.820> some<00:03:44.060> good<00:03:44.239> decisions

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
and he's been making some good decisions

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.680 
and he's been making some good decisions
and<00:03:44.780> finishing<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.280> think<00:03:46.519> he's<00:03:46.700> hard

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
and finishing and I think he's hard

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.420 
and finishing and I think he's hard
because<00:03:47.840> he<00:03:48.049> really<00:03:48.560> as<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:48.829> said<00:03:49.010> he<00:03:49.100> likes<00:03:49.340> to

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
because he really as I said he likes to

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.699 
because he really as I said he likes to
initiate<00:03:49.970> contact<00:03:50.299> or<00:03:50.630> he<00:03:50.690> likes<00:03:50.870> he<00:03:51.019> he<00:03:51.410> draws

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
initiate contact or he likes he he draws

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.610 
initiate contact or he likes he he draws
fouls<00:03:52.209> he<00:03:53.209> puts<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.660> little<00:03:53.959> bit<00:03:54.109> at<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.260> spot

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
fouls he puts you a little bit at a spot

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.440 
fouls he puts you a little bit at a spot
where<00:03:54.650> you<00:03:55.010> know<00:03:55.130> it<00:03:55.250> in<00:03:55.880> a<00:03:55.970> different<00:03:56.150> way<00:03:56.390> but

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
where you know it in a different way but

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.300

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
that puts pressure on the defense and

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.559

games<00:04:55.260> what<00:04:56.160> do<00:04:56.220> you<00:04:56.250> think<00:04:56.340> going<00:04:56.639> forward<00:04:56.729> I

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
games what do you think going forward I

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.879 
games what do you think going forward I
think<00:04:57.870> we<00:04:57.960> have<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.110> continue<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.590> look<00:04:58.710> inside

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
think we have to continue to look inside

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.980 
think we have to continue to look inside
I<00:04:59.130> think<00:04:59.610> you<00:04:59.729> have<00:04:59.880> to<00:04:59.910> take<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.270> shots<00:05:00.690> in

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
I think you have to take the shots in

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.500 
I think you have to take the shots in
the<00:05:01.590> offense<00:05:02.070> that<00:05:02.430> are<00:05:02.610> there<00:05:02.790> from<00:05:03.090> three<00:05:03.389> it

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
the offense that are there from three it

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.150 
the offense that are there from three it
doesn't<00:05:03.810> maybe<00:05:03.930> have<00:05:04.139> to<00:05:04.290> be<00:05:04.380> quick<00:05:04.650> and<00:05:04.800> early

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
doesn't maybe have to be quick and early

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.640 
doesn't maybe have to be quick and early
and<00:05:05.850> I<00:05:05.940> thought<00:05:06.120> again<00:05:06.389> where<00:05:06.570> we<00:05:06.690> times<00:05:07.350> we

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
and I thought again where we times we

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.530 
and I thought again where we times we
got<00:05:07.830> that<00:05:08.040> lead<00:05:08.190> we<00:05:08.370> had<00:05:08.520> some<00:05:08.760> poor<00:05:09.000> shot

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
got that lead we had some poor shot

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.140 
got that lead we had some poor shot
discernment<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.260> I<00:05:10.710> think<00:05:11.010> you<00:05:11.430> gotta<00:05:11.639> si<00:05:12.090> you

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
discernment and I think you gotta si you

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.490 
discernment and I think you gotta si you
gotta<00:05:12.330> know<00:05:12.419> who<00:05:12.540> you<00:05:12.690> are<00:05:12.780> alright<00:05:13.139> we're<00:05:13.320> not

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
gotta know who you are alright we're not

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.640 
gotta know who you are alright we're not
um<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:14.910> know<00:05:15.000> setting<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:16.169> records<00:05:16.530> for

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
um you know setting the the records for

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.170 
um you know setting the the records for
three-point<00:05:17.070> percentage<00:05:17.340> she's<00:05:17.640> last<00:05:17.850> couple

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
three-point percentage she's last couple

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.000 
three-point percentage she's last couple
games<00:05:18.270> so<00:05:18.479> let's<00:05:18.690> get<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:18.990> move<00:05:19.169> attack<00:05:19.830> the

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
games so let's get it move attack the

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.650 
games so let's get it move attack the
paint<00:05:20.190> throw<00:05:20.520> it<00:05:20.580> inside<00:05:20.760> but<00:05:21.180> if<00:05:21.300> it's<00:05:21.450> in

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
paint throw it inside but if it's in

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.840 
paint throw it inside but if it's in
room<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.020> rhythm<00:05:22.500> absolutely<00:05:23.460> take<00:05:23.669> it

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
room and rhythm absolutely take it

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.130 
room and rhythm absolutely take it
because<00:05:23.940> Malcolm<00:05:24.270> and<00:05:24.570> London<00:05:24.840> can<00:05:24.960> shoot

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
because Malcolm and London can shoot

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.340 
because Malcolm and London can shoot
that<00:05:25.320> London<00:05:25.710> can<00:05:25.890> shoot<00:05:26.130> it<00:05:26.250> and<00:05:27.240> you<00:05:28.229> know

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
that London can shoot it and you know

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.900 
that London can shoot it and you know
but<00:05:28.500> it<00:05:28.590> can't<00:05:28.740> we<00:05:28.950> can't<00:05:29.130> live<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.520> die<00:05:29.640> by<00:05:29.669> it

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
but it can't we can't live and die by it

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.770 
but it can't we can't live and die by it
that's<00:05:30.120> not<00:05:30.240> who<00:05:30.479> we<00:05:30.510> are<00:05:32.690> absolutely<00:05:33.690> and

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
that's not who we are absolutely and

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.529 
that's not who we are absolutely and
that's<00:05:33.870> why<00:05:34.020> Evan<00:05:34.229> was<00:05:34.380> big<00:05:34.560> I<00:05:34.770> you<00:05:34.979> know<00:05:35.100> I<00:05:35.130> I

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
that's why Evan was big I you know I I

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.029 
that's why Evan was big I you know I I
thought<00:05:36.539> Malcolm<00:05:36.810> maybe<00:05:37.169> took<00:05:37.500> one<00:05:37.770> or<00:05:37.890> two

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
thought Malcolm maybe took one or two

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.140 
thought Malcolm maybe took one or two
that<00:05:38.250> he<00:05:38.340> you<00:05:38.490> know<00:05:38.610> was<00:05:38.760> at<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:38.940> end<00:05:39.000> of<00:05:39.060> the

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
that he you know was at the end of the

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.950 
that he you know was at the end of the
shot<00:05:39.330> clocks<00:05:39.630> way<00:05:39.810> to<00:05:39.870> take<00:05:40.140> some<00:05:40.410> most<00:05:41.220> of

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
shot clocks way to take some most of

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.600 
shot clocks way to take some most of
London's<00:05:42.960> were<00:05:43.140> great<00:05:43.560> shots<00:05:43.860> I<00:05:44.160> mean<00:05:44.520> they

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610

that and now we're being forced kind of

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.050 
that and now we're being forced kind of
back<00:06:04.110> to<00:06:04.260> what<00:06:04.380> you<00:06:04.470> originally<00:06:04.680> saw<00:06:05.070> we<00:06:05.700> got

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
back to what you originally saw we got

back to what you originally saw we got
away<00:06:06.180> from<00:06:06.300> in<00:06:06.510> the<00:06:06.570> first<00:06:06.780> half<00:06:06.960> we<00:06:07.169> got<00:06:07.320> to<00:06:07.530> it

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
away from in the first half we got to it

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.870 
away from in the first half we got to it
in<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:07.770> first<00:06:07.979> 10<00:06:08.130> minutes<00:06:08.310> the<00:06:08.460> second<00:06:08.700> hand

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
in the first 10 minutes the second hand

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.010 
in the first 10 minutes the second hand
we<00:06:08.940> got<00:06:09.060> away<00:06:09.240> from<00:06:09.300> it<00:06:09.510> at<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:09.750> end<00:06:09.840> of<00:06:09.960> the

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
we got away from it at the end of the

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.370 
we got away from it at the end of the
game<00:06:10.050> it's<00:06:10.380> a<00:06:10.530> where<00:06:11.100> I<00:06:11.580> guess<00:06:12.510> inside

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
game it's a where I guess inside

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.529 
game it's a where I guess inside
amnesiacs<00:06:14.130> we<00:06:14.280> forget<00:06:14.610> that<00:06:14.789> you<00:06:15.090> got<00:06:15.120> to<00:06:15.419> go

amnesiacs we forget that you got to go

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.750 
amnesiacs we forget that you got to go
through<00:06:15.870> the<00:06:16.440> post<00:06:16.680> you<00:06:16.919> got<00:06:17.070> to<00:06:17.220> touch<00:06:17.400> inside

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
through the post you got to touch inside

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.370 
through the post you got to touch inside
when<00:06:18.270> you're<00:06:18.390> doing<00:06:18.630> when<00:06:18.750> you're<00:06:18.840> scoring

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
when you're doing when you're scoring

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.350 
when you're doing when you're scoring
you<00:06:19.530> know<00:06:19.620> I<00:06:19.650> mean<00:06:19.830> or<00:06:20.099> even<00:06:20.580> touching<00:06:21.090> inside

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
you know I mean or even touching inside

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.520 
you know I mean or even touching inside
if<00:06:21.630> he's<00:06:22.110> off<00:06:22.289> the<00:06:22.500> lane<00:06:22.710> and

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
if he's off the lane and

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.140 
if he's off the lane and
that's<00:06:24.530> an<00:06:24.740> important<00:06:25.130> part<00:06:25.310> of<00:06:25.370> any<00:06:25.520> offense

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
that's an important part of any offense

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.940 
that's an important part of any offense
going<00:06:26.360> inside<00:06:26.840> out<00:06:27.140> and<00:06:27.290> playing<00:06:27.560> through<00:06:27.920> it

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
going inside out and playing through it

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.580 
going inside out and playing through it
and<00:06:28.360> again<00:06:29.360> when<00:06:29.960> Mike's<00:06:30.170> in<00:06:30.350> there<00:06:30.470> we

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
and again when Mike's in there we

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.930 
and again when Mike's in there we
certainly<00:06:30.860> want<00:06:31.070> to<00:06:31.160> go<00:06:31.250> to<00:06:31.310> him<00:06:31.520> there's<00:06:31.760> just

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
certainly want to go to him there's just

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.520 
certainly want to go to him there's just
some<00:06:32.060> hard<00:06:32.270> matchups<00:06:32.660> on<00:06:32.810> the<00:06:32.930> other<00:06:33.080> end<00:06:33.290> so

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
some hard matchups on the other end so

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.080 
some hard matchups on the other end so
yeah<00:06:33.860> we'll<00:06:34.010> always<00:06:34.220> keep<00:06:34.370> looking<00:06:34.580> at<00:06:34.940> that

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
yeah we'll always keep looking at that

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.910 
yeah we'll always keep looking at that
and<00:06:35.330> keep<00:06:35.930> trying<00:06:36.080> to<00:06:36.260> find<00:06:36.440> ways<00:06:36.590> to<00:06:36.800> be<00:06:36.890> more

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
and keep trying to find ways to be more

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.440 
and keep trying to find ways to be more
efficient<00:06:37.430> but<00:06:37.580> you<00:06:37.670> also<00:06:37.820> can<00:06:38.060> get<00:06:38.180> there<00:06:38.330> off

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450 
efficient but you also can get there off

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.000 
efficient but you also can get there off
the<00:06:38.480> bounce<00:06:38.840> and<00:06:39.110> get<00:06:39.290> to<00:06:39.410> the<00:06:39.440> paint<00:06:39.710> that's

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
the bounce and get to the paint that's

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.470 
the bounce and get to the paint that's
there's<00:06:40.400> different<00:06:40.700> ways<00:06:40.790> to<00:06:41.060> touch<00:06:41.240> the

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480 
there's different ways to touch the

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.180 
there's different ways to touch the
paint<00:06:41.690> and<00:06:41.840> go<00:06:41.930> inside<00:06:42.080> and<00:06:42.410> we<00:06:42.500> have<00:06:42.620> to<00:06:42.770> keep

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
paint and go inside and we have to keep

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.430 
paint and go inside and we have to keep
exploring<00:06:43.640> that<00:06:43.910> and<00:06:44.120> yep<00:06:44.690> not<00:06:44.960> live<00:06:45.200> and<00:06:45.350> die

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
exploring that and yep not live and die

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.410 
exploring that and yep not live and die
by<00:06:45.470> the<00:06:45.680> three<00:06:45.860> and<00:06:46.100> I<00:06:46.250> mean<00:06:46.640> at<00:06:46.760> twelve<00:06:47.090> threes

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:47.420 
by the three and I mean at twelve threes

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.590 
by the three and I mean at twelve threes
probably<00:06:48.260> a<00:06:48.290> couple<00:06:48.470> too<00:06:48.770> many<00:06:48.800> but<00:06:49.510> what<00:06:50.510> you

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600 
probably a couple too many but what you

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.200 
probably a couple too many but what you
got<00:06:50.720> to<00:06:50.810> take<00:06:50.930> some
