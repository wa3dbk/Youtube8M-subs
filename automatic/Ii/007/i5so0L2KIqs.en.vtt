00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
like like that object over there that

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.020 
like like that object over there that
object<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:42.190> I'll<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.340> go<00:02:42.640> over<00:02:42.730> here<00:02:42.970> and

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
object so I'll just go over here and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.979 
object so I'll just go over here and
demonstrate<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:45.540> obviously<00:02:46.540> terrain

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
demonstrate it obviously terrain

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:55.860 
demonstrate it obviously terrain
collision<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:52.799> so<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:55.209> that<00:02:55.540> works

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
collision is this so that that works

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.030 
collision is this so that that works
good<00:02:56.170> like<00:02:57.000> Dunder<00:02:58.000> dungeons<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:59.049> pierre

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
good like Dunder dungeons and pierre

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.990 
good like Dunder dungeons and pierre
battlegrounds<00:03:00.780> wmo<00:03:01.780> collision<00:03:02.379> is<00:03:03.000> like

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
battlegrounds wmo collision is like

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.970 
battlegrounds wmo collision is like
going<00:03:04.629> through<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:05.109> stuff<00:03:05.409> so<00:03:05.769> that's

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
going through this stuff so that's
