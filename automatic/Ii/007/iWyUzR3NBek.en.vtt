if it's still in so
that's<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.900> reason<00:00:57.200> I<00:00:57.470> mean<00:00:57.710> I<00:00:58.040> guess<00:00:58.460> the

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
that's the reason I mean I guess the

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.020 
that's the reason I mean I guess the
most<00:00:58.760> people<00:00:59.090> have<00:00:59.420> black<00:00:59.750> ops<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:01.610> know<00:01:01.730> I

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
most people have black ops so you know I

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.020 
most people have black ops so you know I
recommend<00:01:03.020> you<00:01:03.080> to<00:01:03.230> do<00:01:03.350> this<00:01:03.470> on<00:01:03.620> black<00:01:03.800> ops

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
recommend you to do this on black ops

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.820 
recommend you to do this on black ops
because<00:01:05.030> on<00:01:05.570> black<00:01:05.840> ops<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.290> can<00:01:06.440> sit<00:01:06.650> on<00:01:06.680> a

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
because on black ops you can sit on a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.560 
because on black ops you can sit on a
certain<00:01:07.280> spot<00:01:07.610> where<00:01:07.820> it's<00:01:07.970> always<00:01:08.120> cannot

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
certain spot where it's always cannot

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.050 
certain spot where it's always cannot
hit<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:08.870> but<00:01:09.710> overall<00:01:10.010> that<00:01:10.160> were<00:01:10.340> that<00:01:10.700> spot

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
hit you but overall that were that spot

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.170 
hit you but overall that were that spot
isn't<00:01:11.500> pretty<00:01:12.500> much<00:01:12.619> visible<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:13.940> they<00:01:14.030> can

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
isn't pretty much visible so they can

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.270 
isn't pretty much visible so they can
still<00:01:14.390> hit<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:14.660> that's<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.680> reason<00:01:15.830> why<00:01:16.100> I'm

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
still hit you that's the reason why I'm

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.910 
still hit you that's the reason why I'm
using<00:01:16.310> got<00:01:16.820> mode<00:01:17.030> only<00:01:17.360> for<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:17.720> once<00:01:17.930> now

this<00:01:43.490> will<00:01:43.640> happen<00:01:43.820> I'm<00:01:44.390> not<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.080> hang<00:01:45.229> of

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
this will happen I'm not in the hang of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.740 
this will happen I'm not in the hang of
it<00:01:45.470> now<00:01:45.610> but<00:01:46.610> on<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.880> computer<00:01:47.390> it's<00:01:47.539> much

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
it now but on the computer it's much

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.240 
it now but on the computer it's much
easier<00:01:48.170> because<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:49.430> know<00:01:49.550> you<00:01:50.119> have<00:01:50.360> your

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
easier because you know you have your

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.040 
easier because you know you have your
mouse<00:01:52.250> as<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.610> sensitivity<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:53.509> it's<00:01:53.690> not<00:01:53.810> hard

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
mouse as a sensitivity so it's not hard

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.590 
mouse as a sensitivity so it's not hard
to<00:01:54.140> do<00:01:54.340> but<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:55.399> know<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.759> just<00:01:56.030> see<00:01:56.240> me<00:01:56.390> keep

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
to do but you know you just see me keep

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.800 
to do but you know you just see me keep
on<00:01:56.780> trying<00:01:57.140> because<00:01:58.130> normally<00:01:58.700> yeah<00:01:59.570> there

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
on trying because normally yeah there

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.070 
on trying because normally yeah there
you<00:01:59.899> go

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
you go

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.070 
you go
Oh<00:02:00.259> fill<00:02:00.920> up<00:02:01.039> see<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.330> don't<00:02:02.479> want<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.780> go<00:02:02.869> on
