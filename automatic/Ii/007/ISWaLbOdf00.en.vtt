Anson I believe cufflinks it's not just
about<00:00:53.219> cost<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.660> as<00:00:54.870> something<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.320> do

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
about cost it's just as something to do

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.630 
about cost it's just as something to do
with<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> style<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> twenties<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
with the style in the twenties and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.540 
with the style in the twenties and
thirties<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.329> forties<00:00:58.250> even<00:00:59.250> earlier

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
thirties and forties even earlier

actually<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.060> hole<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
actually a hole it's not just the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.160 
actually a hole it's not just the
quality<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.890> tie<00:01:47.220> you'll<00:01:48.000> actually<00:01:48.180> find<00:01:48.570> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
quality of tie you'll actually find a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.340 
quality of tie you'll actually find a
satin<00:01:50.130> weave<00:01:50.570> which<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.750> often<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.140> lot<00:01:52.320> of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
satin weave which is often a lot of

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.429 
satin weave which is often a lot of
solid<00:01:53.009> ties<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.880> satin<00:01:54.240> they'll<00:01:55.140> pull

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
solid ties or just a satin they'll pull

yes and also mainly the synthetic ties
or<00:01:57.960> synthetic<00:01:58.439> blends<00:01:58.680> yeah<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.490> an<00:01:59.610> all

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729

silk<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.420> believe<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> little<00:02:00.960> bit<00:02:01.170> of

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
silk with I believe a little bit of

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.459 
silk with I believe a little bit of
rayon<00:02:01.530> which<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.579> actually<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.469> reconstituted

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
rayon which is actually a reconstituted

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.770 
rayon which is actually a reconstituted
natural<00:02:04.829> fiber<00:02:05.040> now<00:02:05.310> what<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.520> tend<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.909> do<00:02:06.119> I'll

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
natural fiber now what I tend to do I'll

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.809 
natural fiber now what I tend to do I'll
actually<00:02:06.960> show<00:02:07.350> my<00:02:07.560> own<00:02:07.590> close-up<00:02:08.099> it's

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
actually show my own close-up it's

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.400 
actually show my own close-up it's
fairly<00:02:09.030> sharp<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.899> old

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
fairly sharp it is old

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.690 
fairly sharp it is old
there's<00:02:11.250> no<00:02:11.370> terribly<00:02:11.819> like<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.270> game

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
there's no terribly like in game

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.619 
there's no terribly like in game

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.350 
actually on the right spot in the center
and<00:02:22.780> about<00:02:23.019> just<00:02:23.860> about<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.910> heart<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.239> my

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
and about just about the heart of my

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.660 
and about just about the heart of my
heart<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.930> little<00:02:26.769> bit<00:02:26.920> lower<00:02:27.160> than<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.459> heart

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
heart a little bit lower than the heart

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.000 
heart a little bit lower than the heart
a<00:02:27.970> little<00:02:28.360> bit<00:02:28.540> higher<00:02:28.750> than<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.080> heart<00:02:29.260> but

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
a little bit higher than the heart but

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.740 
a little bit higher than the heart but
because<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.310> wear<00:02:30.459> this<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.090> suspenders<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.630> lot

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
because I wear this and suspenders a lot

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.600 
because I wear this and suspenders a lot
I<00:02:31.780> think<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.140> just<00:02:32.319> actually<00:02:32.530> looks<00:02:33.340> about

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
I think it just actually looks about

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.580 
I think it just actually looks about
right<00:02:33.849> for<00:02:34.090> me<00:02:34.239> now<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.700> push<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.030> in<00:02:37.180> I

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
right for me now and so I push it in I

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.210 
right for me now and so I push it in I
actually<00:02:39.090> spin<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:41.560> goes<00:02:41.769> straight<00:02:42.010> for<00:02:42.160> it

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
actually spin that goes straight for it

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.460 
actually spin that goes straight for it
beautifully<00:02:42.870> that's<00:02:43.870> if<00:02:43.959> it's<00:02:44.110> nice<00:02:44.260> and

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
beautifully that's if it's nice and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.650 
beautifully that's if it's nice and
sharp<00:02:44.730> but<00:02:45.730> what<00:02:45.880> happens<00:02:46.239> when<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.510> actually

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
sharp but what happens when you actually

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.870 
sharp but what happens when you actually
spin<00:02:47.170> instead<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.010> piercing<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.640> fiber

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
spin instead of piercing the fiber

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.420 
spin instead of piercing the fiber
you're<00:02:49.750> actually<00:02:50.049> pushing<00:02:50.290> fibers<00:02:50.950> apart<00:02:51.040> and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
you're actually pushing fibers apart and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.850 
you're actually pushing fibers apart and
going<00:02:51.730> through<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.450> actual<00:02:52.750> fabric<00:02:53.019> not

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
going through the actual fabric not

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.580 
going through the actual fabric not
actually<00:02:54.250> making<00:02:54.489> a<00:02:54.910> real<00:02:55.150> mark<00:02:55.930> into<00:02:56.500> the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
actually making a real mark into the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.400 
actually making a real mark into the
actual<00:02:56.950> fabric<00:02:57.130> it's<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.510> safest<00:02:58.840> way<00:02:58.959> after

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
actual fabric it's the safest way after

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.600 
actual fabric it's the safest way after
using<00:02:59.620> fabrics<00:03:00.069> for<00:03:00.160> many<00:03:00.310> years<00:03:00.489> in

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
using fabrics for many years in

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.759 
using fabrics for many years in
different<00:03:00.849> ways<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.959> know<00:03:02.049> putting<00:03:02.290> pins<00:03:02.530> in

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
different ways you know putting pins in

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:03.960 
different ways you know putting pins in
needles<00:03:03.099> and<00:03:03.250> stuff<00:03:03.459> like<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.790> there<00:03:03.940> is

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
needles and stuff like that there is

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.120 
needles and stuff like that there is
certain<00:03:04.360> tricks<00:03:04.599> like<00:03:04.750> that<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:05.500> apply<00:03:05.829> now

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
certain tricks like that that apply now

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.069 
certain tricks like that that apply now
unfortunately<00:03:06.910> this<00:03:07.329> one<00:03:07.480> doesn't<00:03:07.660> have<00:03:07.870> a

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
unfortunately this one doesn't have a

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.229 
unfortunately this one doesn't have a
it'll<00:03:08.980> catch<00:03:09.160> off<00:03:09.340> on<00:03:09.489> his<00:03:09.610> little<00:03:09.880> catch<00:03:10.030> that

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
it'll catch off on his little catch that

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.479 
it'll catch off on his little catch that
goes<00:03:10.450> into<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.810> bottom<00:03:11.019> hole<00:03:11.190> but<00:03:12.190> in<00:03:12.370> this

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
goes into the bottom hole but in this

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.809 
goes into the bottom hole but in this
case<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:15.069> I<00:03:15.099> don't<00:03:15.130> have<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.519> now<00:03:15.549> I<00:03:15.640> could

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
case so I don't have it now I could

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.729 
case so I don't have it now I could
actually<00:03:15.910> find<00:03:16.239> one<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.540> attach<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:16.989> i<00:03:17.170> pierce

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
actually find one and attach it i pierce

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.009 
actually find one and attach it i pierce
it<00:03:17.889> through<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.130> back<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.400> tie<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.780> then

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
it through the back of the tie and then

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.360 
it through the back of the tie and then
actually<00:03:20.380> pierce<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.739> for<00:03:20.889> the<00:03:20.950> shirt<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.280> I

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
actually pierce it for the shirt and I

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.580 
actually pierce it for the shirt and I
find<00:03:21.609> that<00:03:21.670> actually<00:03:22.090> works<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.690> best<00:03:22.930> for<00:03:23.049> me

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.960 

well<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.709> little<00:03:26.829> catch<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.310> chain<00:03:27.639> is

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
well that little catch and chain is

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.660 
well that little catch and chain is
great<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.750> find<00:03:29.470> it<00:03:29.709> just<00:03:29.739> gives<00:03:30.220> me<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.519> little

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
great I find it just gives me a little

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.780 
great I find it just gives me a little
bit<00:03:30.850> too<00:03:31.150> much<00:03:31.329> room<00:03:31.660> for<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:31.959> move

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
bit too much room for it to move

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.530 
bit too much room for it to move
hopefully<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:33.940> looks<00:03:34.030> all<00:03:34.239> right<00:03:34.269> and

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
hopefully that looks all right and

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.360 
hopefully that looks all right and
centered<00:03:34.870> but<00:03:35.650> that's<00:03:35.859> all<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.010> wanted<00:03:36.250> to

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
centered but that's all I wanted to

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.430 
centered but that's all I wanted to
share<00:03:36.609> is<00:03:36.880> that<00:03:37.120> actually<00:03:37.480> they<00:03:38.109> don't<00:03:38.290> have

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
share is that actually they don't have

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.640 
share is that actually they don't have
to<00:03:38.590> be<00:03:38.709> huge<00:03:39.280> or<00:03:39.700> anything<00:03:40.079> distinctive<00:03:41.079> or

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
to be huge or anything distinctive or

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.680 
to be huge or anything distinctive or
you<00:03:42.370> can<00:03:42.489> see<00:03:42.579> that's<00:03:42.760> just<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:43.000> plain<00:03:43.239> gold

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
you can see that's just a plain gold

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.370 
you can see that's just a plain gold
fake<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.470> pearl<00:03:44.650> shape<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:46.139> find<00:03:47.139> the<00:03:47.230> bigger

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
fake the pearl shape I find the bigger

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.460 
fake the pearl shape I find the bigger
they<00:03:47.530> are<00:03:47.790> they're<00:03:48.790> more<00:03:48.819> gaudy<00:03:49.630> it<00:03:49.930> can<00:03:50.079> look

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
they are they're more gaudy it can look

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.979 
they are they're more gaudy it can look
and<00:03:51.250> that's<00:03:51.400> why<00:03:51.549> I<00:03:51.579> sort<00:03:51.850> of<00:03:51.910> just<00:03:52.510> keep<00:03:52.840> it

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
and that's why I sort of just keep it

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.319 
and that's why I sort of just keep it
simple<00:03:53.260> is<00:03:53.709> actually<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.489> kiss<00:03:54.700> theory<00:03:55.180> is

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
simple is actually the kiss theory is

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.970 
simple is actually the kiss theory is
