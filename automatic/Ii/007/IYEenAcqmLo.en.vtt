 robot in these cases all directly 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.389
 in the robot and five minutes to knead

 until you get a homogeneous paste 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:58.190
 we have our flour our yeast

 baker dehydrated our sugar and we

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.399
 as soon as you have a nice homogeneous dough 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.619
 we will come 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.850
 hop out there on our work plan 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.369
 and here we will work it by hand 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.770
 knead it so that's the technique 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.869

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.670
 no longer here it's a dough that's not 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.579
 too sticky concludes, here we are crushing 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.780
 we raise is crushed and we will do that 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.500
 until you get a paste that is 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.500
 really lice 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.300

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.370
 we are going to make a flap so it's up to 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.560
 that we take all of our sides were the 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.679
 put on the underside we have a very smooth side 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.630

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.290
 wet linen over and we leave to 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.330
 room temperature for two hours 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.620
 or two and a half hours at 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.680

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.220
 story of chasing the air we see 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.840
