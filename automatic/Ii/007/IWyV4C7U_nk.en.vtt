I think it's important that I add some

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.000 
I think it's important that I add some
additional<00:00:10.049> whiteboard<00:00:11.049> footage<00:00:11.530> of<00:00:11.799> the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
counters that teams will try to use

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.420 
counters that teams will try to use
against<00:00:15.580> you<00:00:15.790> and<00:00:16.029> how<00:00:16.750> to<00:00:16.810> act<00:00:17.430> accurately

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
and efficiently match it so that we get

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.139 
and efficiently match it so that we get

nobody will feel fast enough and so the

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.360 
nobody will feel fast enough and so the

five<00:02:09.610> has<00:02:09.909> stepped<00:02:10.330> up<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:10.869> so<00:02:11.349> that<00:02:11.379> pass<00:02:11.980> is

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
five has stepped up and so that pass is

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.699 
five has stepped up and so that pass is
no<00:02:12.430> longer<00:02:12.849> open<00:02:13.120> they<00:02:13.780> have<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:14.079> recognize

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
no longer open they have to recognize

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.059 
no longer open they have to recognize
that<00:02:15.099> four<00:02:15.819> stepped<00:02:16.180> over<00:02:16.419> so<00:02:17.079> two<00:02:17.169> steps<00:02:17.769> down

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
that four stepped over so two steps down

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.990 
that four stepped over so two steps down
and<00:02:18.400> now<00:02:19.060> we're<00:02:19.659> in

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
and now we're in

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.220 
and now we're in
hom<00:02:20.210> Y<00:02:20.810> position<00:02:21.230> as<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.400> dribble<00:02:22.910> gets<00:02:23.690> to

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
hom Y position as the dribble gets to

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.280 
hom Y position as the dribble gets to
its<00:02:24.410> second<00:02:24.950> spot<00:02:25.390> then<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.630> help<00:02:26.840> double

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
its second spot then the help double

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.360 
its second spot then the help double
occurs<00:02:27.680> with<00:02:28.640> three<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.150> four<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:30.370> then

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
occurs with three and four and then

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.440 
occurs with three and four and then
we've<00:02:31.580> got<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.970> option<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.690> release<00:02:33.650> middle

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
we've got the option to release middle

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.949 
we've got the option to release middle
or<00:02:35.450> we've<00:02:35.720> got<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.170> option<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:38.240> release<00:02:38.630> in

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
the top and I left out the position over

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.670 
the top and I left out the position over
here<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.300> other<00:02:44.420> words<00:02:44.720> if<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:45.170> look<00:02:45.410> back

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
at the circle video three would release

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.580 
at the circle video three would release
to<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.760> top<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.360> one<00:02:50.540> would<00:02:50.750> release<00:02:51.110> across

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
to the top and one would release across

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.820 
to the top and one would release across
if<00:02:51.950> you're<00:02:52.670> using<00:02:53.030> middle<00:02:53.570> release<00:02:53.930> three

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
if you're using middle release three

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.440 
if you're using middle release three
would<00:02:55.070> release<00:02:55.430> here<00:02:55.820> and<00:02:56.000> five<00:02:56.239> would

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
would release here and five would

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.190 
would release here and five would
release<00:02:56.840> out<00:02:57.110> or<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:58.640> would<00:02:58.850> leave<00:02:59.120> five<00:02:59.750> here

release out or you would leave five here
the<00:03:00.530> third<00:03:00.800> option<00:03:01.070> is<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:01.820> run<00:03:02.330> three<00:03:03.489> all<00:03:04.489> the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
to come out of the middle again it

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.650 
to come out of the middle again it
depends<00:03:09.170> on<00:03:09.380> your<00:03:09.590> personnel<00:03:10.250> what<00:03:11.239> I<00:03:11.270> have

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
if we recognize that that's what the

then as you can see over here that
doesn't<00:03:53.870> become<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.680> problem<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.519> we<00:03:56.000> get<00:03:56.239> the

switch three going all the way through

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.060 
switch three going all the way through
which<00:04:09.500> is<00:04:09.709> the<00:04:09.860> middle<00:04:10.220> release<00:04:11.650> run<00:04:12.650> through

which is the middle release run through

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.280 
which is the middle release run through
is<00:04:13.549> what<00:04:13.760> week<00:04:13.940> that's<00:04:14.180> what<00:04:14.360> I<00:04:14.390> call<00:04:14.780> it<00:04:14.989> or

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
is what week that's what I call it or

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.310 
is what week that's what I call it or
think<00:04:16.130> you<00:04:16.310> can<00:04:16.519> go<00:04:16.700> back<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.180> your<00:04:17.329> old<00:04:17.479> circle

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
think you can go back to your old circle

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.229 
think you can go back to your old circle
will<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.650> circle<00:04:19.130> release<00:04:19.640> leave<00:04:19.910> five

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
will the circle release leave five

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.600 
will the circle release leave five
they're<00:04:20.570> three<00:04:21.140> to<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.380> top<00:04:21.620> one<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.520> side

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
they're three to the top one to the side

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.180 
they're three to the top one to the side
so<00:04:23.270> again<00:04:23.720> goes<00:04:23.960> back<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.200> what<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.860> talked

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
so again goes back to what I talked

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.490 
so again goes back to what I talked
about<00:04:25.310> earlier<00:04:25.600> coach's<00:04:26.600> choices<00:04:27.200> on<00:04:27.380> the

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
about earlier coach's choices on the

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.860 
about earlier coach's choices on the
release<00:04:27.800> which<00:04:28.430> makes<00:04:28.700> best<00:04:29.270> use<00:04:29.599> of<00:04:29.630> your

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
release which makes best use of your

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.340 
release which makes best use of your
personnel<00:04:30.470> but<00:04:31.160> this<00:04:31.580> strategy<00:04:32.289> doesn't<00:04:33.289> hurt

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
personnel but this strategy doesn't hurt

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.350 
personnel but this strategy doesn't hurt
when<00:04:34.770> they<00:04:34.919> clear<00:04:35.220> out<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.580> low<00:04:35.729> block<00:04:36.030> if

when they clear out the low block if
we're<00:04:36.840> smart<00:04:37.110> enough<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.500> recognize<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:38.460> and

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
we're smart enough to recognize it and

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.510 
we're smart enough to recognize it and
fill<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.240> triangle<00:04:39.780> as<00:04:40.470> your<00:04:40.770> players<00:04:41.039> play
