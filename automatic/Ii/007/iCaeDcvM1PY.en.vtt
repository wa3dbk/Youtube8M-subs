a good recipe to make protein pancakes I

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.490 
a good recipe to make protein pancakes I
really<00:00:20.519> struggled<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.240> googled<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.900> looked<00:00:22.320> at

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
really struggled to googled it looked at

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.380 
really struggled to googled it looked at
YouTube<00:00:22.859> videos<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:23.730> couldn't<00:00:24.029> really<00:00:24.119> find

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
YouTube videos but couldn't really find

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.560 
YouTube videos but couldn't really find
the<00:00:24.509> right<00:00:24.539> quantities<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.650> I've<00:00:26.550> come<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
the right quantities so I've come to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.509 
the right quantities so I've come to
what<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.750> think<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.259> a<00:00:28.500> good<00:00:28.710> recipe<00:00:29.039> with

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
what I think is that a good recipe with

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.279 
what I think is that a good recipe with
a<00:00:29.550> bit<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.789> trial<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.179> error<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.449> my<00:00:30.750> part<00:00:30.779> had

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
a bit of trial and error on my part had

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.260 
a bit of trial and error on my part had
quite<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> few<00:00:31.740> disasters<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:32.970> think<00:00:33.180> I'm

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
quite a few disasters but I think I'm

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.930 
quite a few disasters but I think I'm
finally<00:00:33.300> sorted<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.260> out<00:00:34.410> now<00:00:34.650> so<00:00:35.070> here's<00:00:35.730> how

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
finally sorted it out now so here's how

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.140 
finally sorted it out now so here's how
I<00:00:35.970> make<00:00:36.360> them<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.400> terms<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.850> ingredients

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
I make them so in terms of ingredients

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.990 
I make them so in terms of ingredients
and<00:00:39.690> quantities<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.620> found<00:00:41.070> about<00:00:41.250> three<00:00:41.640> egg

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
and quantities I found about three egg

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.320 
and quantities I found about three egg
whites<00:00:42.030> works<00:00:42.990> for<00:00:43.410> about<00:00:43.500> 40<00:00:44.040> grams<00:00:44.310> of<00:00:44.760> oats

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
whites works for about 40 grams of oats

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.480 
whites works for about 40 grams of oats
and<00:00:45.630> then<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.590> add<00:00:46.710> what<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.040> like<00:00:47.220> to

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
and then you can add what you like to

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.540 
and then you can add what you like to
that<00:00:47.640> mixture<00:00:48.060> but<00:00:48.390> that's<00:00:48.540> my<00:00:48.750> basic

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
that mixture but that's my basic

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.160 
that mixture but that's my basic
starting<00:00:50.550> mounts<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.330> obviously<00:00:51.810> it<00:00:51.900> depends

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
starting mounts and obviously it depends

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.620 
starting mounts and obviously it depends
with<00:00:52.470> your<00:00:52.620> male-female<00:00:53.580> are<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.210> training

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
with your male-female are your training

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.040 
with your male-female are your training
requirements<00:00:55.500> your<00:00:56.130> calorie<00:00:56.730> needs<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.690> so

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
requirements your calorie needs and so

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.930 
requirements your calorie needs and so
on<00:00:58.290> as<00:00:58.470> to<00:00:58.650> how<00:00:59.010> many<00:00:59.190> egg<00:00:59.310> whites<00:00:59.580> you<00:00:59.820> would

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
on as to how many egg whites you would

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.910 
on as to how many egg whites you would
work<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.240> but<00:01:00.900> for<00:01:01.050> myself<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.560> thought<00:01:01.710> that

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
work with but for myself I thought that

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.560 
work with but for myself I thought that
three<00:01:02.160> egg<00:01:02.280> whites<00:01:02.310> work<00:01:02.880> from<00:01:03.090> about<00:01:03.180> 40

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
three egg whites work from about 40

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.310 
three egg whites work from about 40
grams<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:04.049> oats<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> today<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.200> show

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
grams of oats so today I'm going to show

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.109 
grams of oats so today I'm going to show
you<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.500> version<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.979> add<00:01:08.219> blueberries<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the mix so you have three egg whites 40

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.660 
the mix so you have three egg whites 40
grams<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.479> oats<00:01:12.929> along<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:13.979> couple<00:01:14.399> handfuls

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
you were soft peak stage that you would

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.340 
you were soft peak stage that you would
use<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.729> you're<00:01:56.850> making<00:01:57.030> around<00:02:00.229> once<00:02:01.229> you've

a spray oil two or three sprays in a
small<00:02:52.940> saucepan<00:02:53.180> like<00:02:53.570> so<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.400> use<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> nonstick

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
small saucepan like so I use a nonstick

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.340 
small saucepan like so I use a nonstick
pan<00:02:55.940> as<00:02:56.390> well<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:56.930> makes<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.290> little

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
pan as well so that makes it a little

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.590 
pan as well so that makes it a little
bit<00:02:57.530> easier<00:02:57.920> heat<00:02:58.790> up<00:02:58.970> your<00:02:59.120> pan<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.510> medium

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
bit easier heat up your pan on a medium

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.720 
bit easier heat up your pan on a medium
flame<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.740> then<00:03:00.860> you're<00:03:01.010> ready<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.430> add<00:03:01.700> your

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730

pancake<00:03:02.330> mixture<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:02.990> pan

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:29.320 

you

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.820 

so<00:03:30.330> once<00:03:30.480> you've<00:03:30.630> put<00:03:30.840> your<00:03:30.870> pancake<00:03:31.080> on<00:03:31.620> both

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
so once you've put your pancake on both

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.860 
so once you've put your pancake on both
sides<00:03:32.190> take<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.850> out<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.270> plan<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.690> there
