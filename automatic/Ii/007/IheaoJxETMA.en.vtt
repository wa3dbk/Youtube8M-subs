we<00:04:39.310> tried<00:04:39.580> similar<00:04:39.970> several<00:04:40.509> variations<00:04:40.810> this

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
we tried similar several variations this

we tried similar several variations this
one<00:04:41.770> is<00:04:41.860> fun<00:04:42.069> but<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.030> just<00:04:43.210> doesn't<00:04:43.539> give<00:04:43.660> us

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
one is fun but it just doesn't give us

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.689

the<00:04:43.930> look<00:04:44.050> we<00:04:44.259> need<00:04:44.410> they<00:04:45.069> are<00:04:45.160> just<00:04:45.370> too<00:04:45.520> low

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
the look we need they are just too low

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.029 
the look we need they are just too low
for<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.060> port<00:04:46.300> so<00:04:47.139> we<00:04:47.169> made<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.440> shelf<00:04:47.770> out<00:04:47.979> of

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
for the port so we made a shelf out of

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:49.980 
for the port so we made a shelf out of
scraps<00:04:48.400> from<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.610> bench<00:04:48.880> project<00:04:49.509> and

it<00:04:52.449> gave<00:04:52.690> us<00:04:52.720> height<00:04:53.110> but<00:04:53.440> still<00:04:53.770> didn't<00:04:54.069> look

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
it gave us height but still didn't look

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.790 
it gave us height but still didn't look
quite<00:04:54.430> right<00:04:54.630> so<00:04:55.630> we<00:04:55.780> group<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.199> containers

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
quite right so we group the containers

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.980 
quite right so we group the containers
together<00:04:57.250> which<00:04:57.669> gave<00:04:57.910> us<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.210> lot<00:04:58.449> better<00:04:58.720> look

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
together which gave us a lot better look

not<00:05:01.810> go<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.110> pots<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:03.460> we<00:05:03.610> purchased<00:05:04.090> some<00:05:04.270> very

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
not go to pots so we purchased some very
