00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.520
 nature outside in the courtyard we tunic 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.750

 portable table for hand-made well 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.010

 women he's heavy enough 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.840
 so go out with him wherever 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.870
 the walls of my studio i don't care 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.670
 chosen in general my advice to you is not 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.560
 bother buying easel if 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.209
 this is the only thing missing for 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.239
 get started my first easel to me 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.180
 served as an old chair with a back on which 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:50.350
 I put the canvas and she settled herself 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.640
 next to the stool and next to the same 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.480
 has attached 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.870
 for palette for brushes for everything 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.319
 the rest of course afterwards I 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.230
 other easels appeared 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:11.450
 self-made one purchase tripod these 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:15.050
 vodnik and so on but still the most 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.800
 often used construction is 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:22.250
 the most ordinary homemade easel 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.250
 which is made of scary curves about 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.160
 strugan sticks with all sorts of cracks and 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.290
 over time, I painted it in 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.130
 white color and I got quite 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.920
 such vintage room decoration 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.780
