00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.050
 it's about the great performance of it 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.450
 This is about efficiency and it works 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.070
 this area especially around the 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.070
 economical use of energy 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.440
 We have ours with the money

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.150
 strongly reminiscent of the geotrac 124 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.270
 technically, the new top model but in 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.270
 all areas gained more power 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.880
 more gears more comfort but less 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.220
 fuel consumption so you could 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.220
