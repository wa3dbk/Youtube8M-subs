00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello people, welcome to the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.069
 our free s course or else I 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.410
 I will start this video already going 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.400
 to the point I'm not going to talk, it's going to roll 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.349
 I'll do 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.360
 Mimi, no, I want to get right to the point. 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.119
 because I promised that course would be 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.010
 100% practical ie I will not have there and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.480
 there will not be anything very little theory 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.070
 theory only in this first class 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.080
 here to understand what it is if the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.470
 what are the main factors 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.529
 ranking 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.270
 but I want you to know that too 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.579
 It's 100% 99 9% Practical Okay, so I 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.989
 I will show what happens in practice to 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.239
 people are able to position a site that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.890
 I see that this is too is I think the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.780
 greater difficulty of the people who are 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.579
 beginning difficult work and even 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.800
 some people who already work with 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.489
 This comes from a lot of theory, we see 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.960
 courses on the Internet even more good courses 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.960
 that they focus a lot on the theoretical part 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.329
 so I want to pass on to you a 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.680
 bit of the practical part with you see from 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.059
 fact that what we have to do 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.739
 to do what we have to do 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.629
 where do we put the links? 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.960
 where do we write people? 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.630
 in the title so I'll show you 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.150
 exactly what to do there is what the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.320
 My projects I work with s or more 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.210
 about 45 tá I have a blog are 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.799
 paulo.com br point that is exactly this 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.619
 are you if you are not selling the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.560
 youtube and I have several other blogs 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.299
 who came running me passively and these 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.159
 blogs they come from different niches 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.400
 Nettheim of early May growth 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.490
 at the makeup level is health 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.860
 finally there are several niches that the act with 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.890
 several blogs and these blogs they are 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.380
 optimized to generate traffic for them and 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.140
 I can monetize by working with 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.960
 an affiliate then it no longer speaks in 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.299
 front but I want to say something about the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.759
 is this or not what it means to be 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.670
 So if we put it on google 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.270
 we will see that this is the acronym 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.670
 what does it mean to be chen jin optimization 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.500
 beauty and means roughly 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.200
 translated into Portuguese is to optimize 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.220
 action to the search engine ok what 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.630
 means means a job 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.370
 strategic tactical work and 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.140
 that you will do in your 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.840
 site on your customer's site 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.490
 to get you good positions in the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.440
 google is then when the person types 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.070
 Something on google she will find 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.320
 then your site did not write here that there 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.660
 google content 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.280
 we are going to have to ignite the digital and 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.170
 will have to have a website on my blog that 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.330
 It was always a point with a br 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.180
 ie I made a optimization work 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.920
 to appear here is to rank content 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.840
 beauty and has other key words and 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.430
 that I will not show to not deliver 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.590
 the cake cherry 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.910
 so what are we going to learn? 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.730
 in this course we will learn to 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.330
 use our search engines 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.670
 favor 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.370
 We're going to make the site of 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.500
 people are optimized to teach you 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.050
 structure well on site part of dock 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.490
 internal with part of link thousand and I will 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.980
 explain each of these parts 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.230
 in detail and better than you 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.990
 the practical part pa and something else too 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.140
 which today does a lot 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.010
 weighs a lot to google it are the signs 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.130
 social 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.290
 so if you have a website you are not 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.290
 on facebook you do not share the 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.610
 facebook twitter and retuíte does not have an account 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.220
 on google plus that's too much and then you 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.810
 you're missing out on a large 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.790
 market is losing a lot of relevance 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.209
 because google gives a lot of importance 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.370
 for these types of sites in these 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.560
 platforms that are social networks 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.080
 So that's all we'll talk about here. 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.239
 but I want to start by saying that some 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.560
 points some factors that I consider 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.600
 important in my opinion are the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.470
 factors that are most important to 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.580
 content 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.410
 the first is an optimization work 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.760
 internal site is then if we live 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.420
 here on my site 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.640
 is me because I wanted to in my this 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.220
 my page to here as either the 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.620
 content of that person pointed out that there 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.420
 content she would find a website and how 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.980
 I did it then, just for us. 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.750
 see it over 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.970
 I put the key word with which the 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.620
 content here in title 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.419
 here also has what 's inside the 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.849
 my content has a few words here 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.050
 and this is part of the optimization 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.419
 so this is the first 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.460
 the point that I consider important that 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.110
 internal optimization're 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.220
 and something else that is very important 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:40.340
 It is also the piece of air links and even then 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.750
 Let's go there again through the site and if 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:49.280
 people see that we see the foot at 14 and the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.800
 of 1910 means the authori- 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.289
 means domain authority or 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.030
 my domain on a scale of 0 to 100 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:58.639
 he has authority 19 which is a good 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.530
 number and after 10 years already 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.650
 I consider a good number as of 2011 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.930
 consider a great number then the paa 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.080
 authority of the page on that page that 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.330
 then the domain authority Sunday 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.270
 the domain as a whole 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.039
 specific page authority that 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.800
 another thing that I consider highly 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.960
 important are the links both to 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.139
 number of links such as the quality of 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.030
 links then if you have high websites 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.909
 relevance pointing to your website this 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.400
 account very common to many people say 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:34.069
 that this will not work anytime soon 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:38.449
 but until today until the year 2015 it works 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:40.159
 okay so if you have links pointing to 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.710
 your site these links are high 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:44.630
 relevance for example imagine the site there 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.159
 of the globe pointing to your site so he 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.349
 it's happening she likes to see the text 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:49.729
 for you because the site of the globe has a 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.250
 very strong force 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.590
 and for you to understand better basically 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.110
 you get a big name from your market 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.500
 and the great guru indicated his work 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.080
 to another person then face man 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.210
 the digital marketing market me 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.699
 to indicate their services to the 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.349
 his clients for some people 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.940
 then this would be highly relevant to 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.889
 I 'll be passing authority to 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.529
 I'm something like that works 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:18.020
 your website the link authority for you and 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:20.840
 He will pass authority on to you. 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.129
 then these are some points that 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.779
 considers important 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:26.840
 another point as I have already said are 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:29.300
 social signals is that the networks 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.860
 social and play with your site 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.279
 while social interactions the site 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.740
 will have as share retuites 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:39.199
 Finally and also another point that today until 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.639
 novelty is google in our 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.669
 updates on the last laps 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:46.129
 the actions he did put this as 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:50.900
 put a greater weight on what is the ctr 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:53.719
 is that it is the luizense the click rate 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.460
 your site will receive here in the search then 

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:58.039
 let's say the person searched for 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.499
 block content and she thought the site 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:03.409
 of digital edition I think I liked it and yes 

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:06.080
 so but the site master of the portal 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:07.999
 her income then she was attracted to 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.379
 any of these headings the problem in these 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:12.860
 descriptions then let's see that she 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:14.689
 You clicked on mine because it takes 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.520
 publish content but it was not 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:19.729
 first choice of tricolor to second 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.680
 that is, my ctr will be larger than 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:23.270
 from the first position I the quantity 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.909
 of clicks and click rate on the site 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:28.759
 receives here in search of then how much 

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:31.550
 higher click-through rate of your search 

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:34.699
 website will also gain relevance 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:37.789
 all this until the subject soon then both 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:39.919
 is that I made a video just talking about cité 

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:42.229
 how to increase ctr because this is a 

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:45.080
 The factor that I gave from 2015 goes 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:46.219
 influence your very much on your 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.599
 beauty placement 

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:54.379
 so that's basically what I want 

00:07:49.599 --> 00:07:57.409
 talk a little about each subject I'm going to 

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:58.909
 talk about linkage I'll talk about the link 

00:07:57.409 --> 00:08:02.330
 link building I'm going to talk about 

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:05.449
 structuring and that of your page 

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:08.270
 So it's this initial video that was just 

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:09.979
 for you understood that the s or so has 

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.139
 several factors that influence you are 

00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:15.889
 well ranked on google and I will show 

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:18.289
 now each factor of that step by step 

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:20.770
 well, that 's what I see in the next 

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.770
 video
