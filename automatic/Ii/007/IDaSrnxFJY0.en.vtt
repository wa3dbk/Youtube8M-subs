00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.910 
I do this is compressing the bottom of
the<00:02:34.830> platter

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.580 

it<00:02:40.459> also<00:02:40.610> flattens<00:02:41.120> out<00:02:41.300> just<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.959> tad<00:02:42.170> more<00:02:42.440> and

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
it also flattens out just a tad more and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.110 
it also flattens out just a tad more and
brings<00:02:42.800> out<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.010> little<00:02:43.280> bit<00:02:43.490> more<00:02:43.610> play<00:02:43.880> if<00:02:44.000> I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
brings out a little bit more play if I

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.910 
brings out a little bit more play if I
want<00:02:44.390> to

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.740 

you<00:02:52.459> guys<00:02:52.580> want<00:02:52.849> to<00:02:52.880> leave<00:02:53.000> quite<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.360> bit<00:02:53.510> play

on the bottom of platter especially if

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.780 
on the bottom of platter especially if
it's<00:02:55.700> this<00:02:55.910> large<00:02:57.220> because<00:02:58.220> when<00:02:58.459> you<00:02:58.550> go<00:02:58.730> to

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
it's this large because when you go to

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.380 
it's this large because when you go to
cut<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.150> with<00:02:59.300> a<00:02:59.330> wire<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:01.819> wire<00:03:02.000> always

cut it with a wire the wire always

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.440 
cut it with a wire the wire always
arches<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.190> further<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.610> wire<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:05.060> apart

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
arches so the further the wire is apart

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.930 
arches so the further the wire is apart
the<00:03:05.810> higher<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.260> arch<00:03:09.459> so<00:03:10.459> with<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.700> platter

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
the higher the arch so with the platter

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.309 
the higher the arch so with the platter
because<00:03:11.330> you're<00:03:11.450> going<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.600> be<00:03:11.720> very<00:03:11.900> far

I'm going to pull a little bit more play
over<00:04:35.759> here<00:04:35.819> to<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.240> side

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.680 

now<00:04:55.440> right<00:04:55.740> where<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.070> lip<00:04:56.340> arches<00:04:56.910> you<00:04:57.480> want

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
now right where the lip arches you want

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.410 
now right where the lip arches you want
to<00:04:57.750> leave<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:57.930> little<00:04:58.260> bit<00:04:58.440> more<00:04:58.650> clay<00:04:59.420> because

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
to leave a little bit more clay because

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.700 
to leave a little bit more clay because
there's<00:05:00.630> going<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:00.810> be<00:05:00.900> some<00:05:01.170> weight<00:05:01.350> on<00:05:01.470> there

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
there's going to be some weight on there

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.140 
there's going to be some weight on there
from<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.580> rim<00:05:02.790> itself

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.420 

and<00:05:06.600> again<00:05:07.050> like<00:05:07.560> what<00:05:07.800> I<00:05:07.830> said<00:05:08.070> in<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.250> bowl

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
and again like what I said in the bowl

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.040 
and again like what I said in the bowl
you<00:05:08.460> want<00:05:08.760> to<00:05:08.820> make<00:05:08.940> sure<00:05:08.970> that<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.510> lip<00:05:09.750> is<00:05:10.020> a

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
you want to make sure that the lip is a

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.230 
you want to make sure that the lip is a
little<00:05:10.500> thicker<00:05:10.710> that<00:05:11.490> way<00:05:11.639> it's<00:05:11.790> not<00:05:11.970> getting

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
little thicker that way it's not getting

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:35.100 
little thicker that way it's not getting
knocked<00:05:12.419> around<00:05:12.630> or<00:05:12.900> chipped

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.910 

all<00:05:35.590> right<00:05:36.130> that's<00:05:37.000> my<00:05:37.180> bladder<00:05:37.560> I'll<00:05:38.560> just<00:05:38.740> go

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
all right that's my bladder I'll just go

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.900 
all right that's my bladder I'll just go
ahead<00:05:39.010> and<00:05:39.190> clean<00:05:39.400> it<00:05:39.430> up<00:05:39.670> from<00:05:39.910> here<00:05:40.150> and<00:05:41.910> I'm

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
ahead and clean it up from here and I'm

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.520 
ahead and clean it up from here and I'm
pretty<00:05:43.210> much<00:05:43.330> done<00:05:43.660> plates<00:05:44.020> are<00:05:44.140> pretty<00:05:44.380> much

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
pretty much done plates are pretty much

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.170 
pretty much done plates are pretty much
done<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:44.950> same<00:05:45.190> way<00:05:45.400> except<00:05:45.850> in<00:05:45.970> a<00:05:46.030> much

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
done the same way except in a much

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.050 
done the same way except in a much
smaller<00:05:46.390> scale<00:05:46.780> and<00:05:47.200> I'll<00:05:47.950> do<00:05:48.880> another

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
smaller scale and I'll do another

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.510 
smaller scale and I'll do another
videotape<00:05:49.480> for<00:05:49.990> plate<00:05:50.230> so<00:05:50.770> this<00:05:51.070> platter<00:05:51.370> is

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
videotape for plate so this platter is

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.610 
videotape for plate so this platter is
probably<00:05:52.420> about<00:05:52.680> 16<00:05:53.680> 17<00:05:54.220> inches<00:05:55.170> and<00:05:56.170> plates

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
probably about 16 17 inches and plates

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.020 
probably about 16 17 inches and plates
are<00:05:56.770> usually<00:05:57.040> about<00:05:57.160> 12<00:05:57.490> so<00:05:57.760> there<00:05:57.910> is<00:05:58.000> a

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
are usually about 12 so there is a

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.960 
are usually about 12 so there is a
little<00:05:58.390> bit<00:05:58.480> of<00:05:58.570> a<00:05:58.630> difference<00:05:58.960> but<00:05:59.140> not<00:05:59.290> much

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
little bit of a difference but not much

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.650 
little bit of a difference but not much
good<00:06:00.970> luck<00:06:01.180> and<00:06:01.360> you're<00:06:01.450> throwing<00:06:01.660> adventure
