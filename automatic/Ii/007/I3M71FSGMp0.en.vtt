00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.449 
a mini opera yeah but on a very delicate
level<00:02:22.280> are<00:02:22.459> they<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.930> same<00:02:24.110> idea<00:02:24.560> if<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.220> could

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
level are they the same idea if I could

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.280 
level are they the same idea if I could
say<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.730> like<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.570> piano<00:02:26.810> concertos

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
say that like in the piano concertos

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.540 
say that like in the piano concertos
it's<00:02:27.530> it's<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:28.390> material<00:02:29.390> which<00:02:29.959> is<00:02:30.140> always<00:02:30.550> in

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
it's it's a material which is always in

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.420 
it's it's a material which is always in
variations<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.450> every<00:02:33.140> note<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.680> kind<00:02:33.950> of<00:02:34.130> in

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
variations and every note is kind of in

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.840 
variations and every note is kind of in
a<00:02:34.520> in<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.120> program<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.570> being<00:02:36.260> stable<00:02:36.739> so<00:02:37.310> the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
a in a program of being stable so the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.910 
a in a program of being stable so the
thing<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.330> like<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.959> lose<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.260> orientation

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
thing is like you lose the orientation

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.010 
thing is like you lose the orientation
in<00:02:40.580> through<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.180> which<00:02:41.300> instrument<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:41.900> in

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
in through and which instrument is in

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.540 
in through and which instrument is in
which<00:02:42.200> instrument<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:43.100> are<00:02:43.130> playing<00:02:43.430> around

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
which instrument you are playing around

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.650 
which instrument you are playing around
with<00:02:44.000> little<00:02:45.160> fragments<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.280> gestures<00:02:46.790> on<00:02:47.510> the

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
with little fragments of gestures on the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.690 
with little fragments of gestures on the
one<00:02:47.810> hand<00:02:47.930> on<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.080> other<00:02:48.170> hand<00:02:48.440> like

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
one hand on the other hand like

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:58.510 
one hand on the other hand like
soundscapes<00:02:49.700> which<00:02:49.940> you<00:02:50.120> move<00:02:50.300> in<00:02:50.690> itself

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.850 

it's<00:02:59.520> interesting<00:02:59.760> to<00:03:00.060> have<00:03:00.180> like<00:03:00.870> two

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
it's interesting to have like two

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.610 
it's interesting to have like two
versions<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.519> similar<00:03:03.269> idea<00:03:03.569> but<00:03:04.440> it

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
versions of a similar idea but it

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.740 
versions of a similar idea but it
doesn't<00:03:05.069> sound<00:03:05.250> like<00:03:05.519> actually<00:03:06.239> but<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.540> mean

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
doesn't sound like actually but I mean

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.900 
doesn't sound like actually but I mean
in<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.260> background<00:03:07.620> my<00:03:07.739> compositional<00:03:08.459> idea

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
in the background my compositional idea

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:26.260 
in the background my compositional idea
was<00:03:09.150> very<00:03:09.180> similar

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.330 

you
