00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:29.170 

Oh

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.130 

there's<00:00:30.180> different<00:00:30.510> variations<00:00:31.020> on<00:00:31.110> that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
there's different variations on that

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.220 
there's different variations on that
ending<00:00:31.529> part<00:00:35.690> think<00:00:36.690> that's<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.989> did<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
ending part think that's what I did the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:47.560 
ending part think that's what I did the
first

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:58.960 

I

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.020 

okay<00:00:59.970> so<00:01:00.030> slowly<00:01:00.600> that's<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.970> actually<00:01:02.970> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
okay so slowly that's just actually I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.370 
okay so slowly that's just actually I
think<00:01:03.060> I<00:01:03.240> might<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.420> hammering<00:01:03.810> on<00:01:03.960> from<00:01:04.140> open

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.380 
think I might be hammering on from open

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.470 
think I might be hammering on from open
Usos<00:01:06.800> opening<00:01:07.800> and<00:01:08.130> hammer<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> gym<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
Usos opening and hammer on the gym and

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.230 
Usos opening and hammer on the gym and
then<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:10.040> D<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.360> it's<00:01:12.360> slide<00:01:13.880> into<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.000> D

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
then be D and it's slide into this D

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.360 
then be D and it's slide into this D
minor<00:01:15.570> shape<00:01:16.070> which<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.220> actually

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
minor shape which is actually

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.640 
minor shape which is actually
functioning<00:01:17.940> as<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> machine<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.900> okay

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
functioning as a machine I on this okay

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.900 
functioning as a machine I on this okay
so<00:01:19.710> we've<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:21.410> booms<00:01:22.410> line<00:01:22.979> into<00:01:23.280> then<00:01:23.460> d<00:01:23.670> on

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
so we've got booms line into then d on

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.969 
so we've got booms line into then d on
the<00:01:24.000> fifth<00:01:24.270> string<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.840> then<00:01:24.960> from<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the fifth string and then from the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.580 
the fifth string and then from the
fourth<00:01:26.250> string<00:01:27.890> it's<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.040> those<00:01:29.250> notes

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
fourth string it's like those notes

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.770 
fourth string it's like those notes
sympathetically<00:01:31.590> ring<00:01:32.340> together<00:01:35.660> let<00:01:36.660> me

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
sympathetically ring together let me

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.230 
sympathetically ring together let me
have<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.490> g9<00:01:38.490> shape<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:41.520> ring<00:01:41.729> onto<00:01:41.940> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
have this g9 shape and ring onto the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.960 
have this g9 shape and ring onto the
seventh<00:01:42.630> here<00:01:42.810> from<00:01:42.990> deep

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.899 

third<00:01:47.540> string

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
third string

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.819 
third string
the<00:01:50.240> third<00:01:50.509> sucks

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:05.420 

so<00:01:54.829> that's<00:01:54.979> open<00:01:55.340> D

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.990 

we're<00:02:06.430> sliding<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:06.940> list

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.899 

which<00:02:11.000> is<00:02:14.620> GNA<00:02:15.620> we're<00:02:15.890> starting<00:02:16.220> from<00:02:16.340> GTA<00:02:16.670> on

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
which is GNA we're starting from GTA on

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.910 
which is GNA we're starting from GTA on
the<00:02:17.000> for<00:02:17.180> trouble<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:18.409> got<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.830> third<00:02:19.790> string

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
the for trouble and got a third string

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.570 
the for trouble and got a third string
and<00:02:21.920> open<00:02:22.430> D<00:02:22.580> string

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.990 

so<00:02:29.580> that<00:02:29.730> ends<00:02:30.060> up<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.750> g<00:02:31.020> section<00:02:31.860> here<00:02:35.000> and

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
so that ends up the g section here and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.449 
so that ends up the g section here and
then<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.209> going<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.569> see

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.830 

the<00:02:45.459> sea<00:02:45.730> shake<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> same<00:02:46.360> way<00:02:46.480> we<00:02:46.599> did<00:02:46.720> with

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
the sea shake the same way we did with

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.710 
the sea shake the same way we did with
the<00:02:46.900> G<00:02:47.200> at<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.440> beginning<00:02:47.769> of<00:02:47.830> that

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.770 

overnight<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.020> see<00:02:52.580> me<00:02:53.580> on<00:02:53.610> 4th<00:02:54.120> string<00:02:54.480> a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
overnight and see me on 4th string a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.309 
overnight and see me on 4th string a
second<00:02:55.350> from<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.590> g

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.780 

then<00:03:01.319> we're<00:03:01.469> going<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.950> sort<00:03:02.159> of<00:03:02.250> G<00:03:02.459> minor

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
then we're going to the sort of G minor

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.179 
then we're going to the sort of G minor
shape<00:03:03.269> but<00:03:03.659> it's<00:03:04.319> actually<00:03:04.409> functioning<00:03:05.040> as<00:03:05.159> a

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
shape but it's actually functioning as a

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.670 
shape but it's actually functioning as a
c9<00:03:06.060> here<00:03:08.780> we're<00:03:09.780> going<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.959> hammer<00:03:10.140> on<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.530> that

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
c9 here we're going to hammer on to that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.890 
c9 here we're going to hammer on to that
from<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:10.980> open<00:03:11.310> D<00:03:11.459> string<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.150> G<00:03:12.510> note<00:03:12.719> on

we're<00:03:27.050> going<00:03:27.290> into<00:03:27.500> this<00:03:27.650> c7<00:03:28.580> shape<00:03:28.849> here<00:03:29.500> we

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
we're going into this c7 shape here we

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.360 
we're going into this c7 shape here we
have<00:03:30.680> be<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:32.540> third<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.769> third<00:03:34.010> string

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
have be the third of the third string

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.839 
have be the third of the third string
and<00:03:34.640> then<00:03:35.620> see<00:03:36.620> here<00:03:37.099> on<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.250> first<00:03:37.550> fret<00:03:37.790> of

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
and then see here on the first fret of

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.610 
and then see here on the first fret of

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
the B string remember onto that b-flat

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.740 
the B string remember onto that b-flat
achoo<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:45.530> scheana<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.580> then<00:03:46.760> he

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.390

hey

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.140 
hey
and<00:03:52.640> then<00:03:52.790> we<00:03:52.970> do<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.239> third<00:03:53.480> string<00:03:55.150> second

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
and then we do the third string second

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:09.490 
and then we do the third string second
string<00:03:56.439> and<00:03:57.439> then<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.709> third<00:03:57.739> string<00:03:58.159> open

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500

finally<00:04:10.070> we're<00:04:10.220> going<00:04:10.310> into<00:04:10.550> this<00:04:10.730> D<00:04:11.030> part

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.189 

which<00:04:18.150> is<00:04:18.269> pretty<00:04:18.449> similar<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.870> what<00:04:19.049> we<00:04:19.169> did

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
which is pretty similar to what we did

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.939 
which is pretty similar to what we did
in<00:04:19.470> C<00:04:19.709> accept<00:04:20.220> them<00:04:21.379> we're<00:04:22.379> hammering<00:04:22.590> into

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
in C accept them we're hammering into

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.839 
in C accept them we're hammering into
this<00:04:23.189> d7<00:04:23.909> shaken<00:04:25.189> from<00:04:26.189> the<00:04:26.340> fifth<00:04:26.580> string

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
this d7 shaken from the fifth string

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:35.830 
this d7 shaken from the fifth string
open<00:04:28.520> so<00:04:29.520> it's<00:04:29.699> 0<00:04:30.689> in<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:30.990> fifth<00:04:31.169> string<00:04:32.210> 5d

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.920 

put<00:04:36.840> those<00:04:36.990> notes<00:04:37.259> ring<00:04:37.469> together<00:04:38.750> then<00:04:39.750> we're

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
put those notes ring together then we're
