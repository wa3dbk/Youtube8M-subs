00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
insufferable I I I have to say I did

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.240 
insufferable I I I have to say I did

you mean it sort of is insufferable
but<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.220> found<00:01:50.430> it's<00:01:50.640> insufferable<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.299> apart

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
but I found it's insufferable it apart

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.600 
but I found it's insufferable it apart
of<00:01:51.869> its<00:01:52.020> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.740> comic<00:01:53.070> effect<00:01:53.189> although

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
it's sort of absurd you've got these two

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.090

the<00:02:04.740> prospect<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.280> them<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.640> pit<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.969> did

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
the prospect of them in this pit I did

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.609 
the prospect of them in this pit I did
think<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.329> was<00:02:06.420> quite<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> funny<00:02:06.840> spot<00:02:06.990> some<00:02:07.530> of

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
think it was quite a funny spot some of

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.529 
think it was quite a funny spot some of

obviously<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.080> do<00:02:18.260> know<00:02:18.500> I'm<00:02:19.070> not<00:02:19.220> quite<00:02:19.550> sure

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
obviously I do know I'm not quite sure

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.070 
obviously I do know I'm not quite sure
that<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:19.970> agree<00:02:20.150> is<00:02:20.240> saying<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.540> they<00:02:20.630> had<00:02:20.780> no

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
that I agree is saying that they had no

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.020 
that I agree is saying that they had no
images<00:02:21.650> at<00:02:21.770> all<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.310> countryside<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.880> don't

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
images at all of the countryside I don't

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.130 
images at all of the countryside I don't
think<00:02:23.180> that's<00:02:23.300> quite<00:02:23.480> true<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:23.780> think<00:02:24.020> there

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
think that's quite true I think there

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.140 
think that's quite true I think there
were<00:02:24.290> some<00:02:24.560> interesting<00:02:24.680> images<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.430> kind<00:02:26.060> of

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
were some interesting images of kind of

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.700 
were some interesting images of kind of
wilderness<00:02:26.360> or<00:02:26.720> semi<00:02:26.960> urban<00:02:27.050> wilderness<00:02:27.410> I

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
wilderness or semi urban wilderness I

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.470 
wilderness or semi urban wilderness I
think<00:02:27.920> there<00:02:28.040> were<00:02:28.190> some<00:02:28.580> probably<00:02:29.300> not

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
think there were some probably not

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.700 
think there were some probably not
perhaps<00:02:29.630> not<00:02:29.900> enough<00:02:30.080> but<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.320> think<00:02:30.620> there

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
perhaps not enough but I think there

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.370 
perhaps not enough but I think there
were<00:02:30.800> some<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.580> think<00:02:32.090> it's<00:02:32.240> it's<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.600> very<00:02:32.630> bf5

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
were some I think it's it's a very bf5

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.750 
were some I think it's it's a very bf5
field<00:02:33.680> what<00:02:33.770> made<00:02:33.950> me<00:02:34.040> laugh<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.460> realized

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
field what made me laugh is I realized

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.860

is fairly familiar from comedy programs
on<00:03:23.209> television<00:03:23.660> in<00:03:23.750> fact<00:03:23.930> but<00:03:24.470> they<00:03:24.620> would

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
on television in fact but they would

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.620 
on television in fact but they would
always<00:03:24.920> want<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.640> find<00:03:25.940> out<00:03:26.209> something

something<00:03:58.610> absurd<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.540> kind<00:04:00.170> of<00:04:00.260> funny<00:04:00.500> about

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
something absurd and kind of funny about

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.360 
something absurd and kind of funny about
it<00:04:00.980> I<00:04:01.330> have<00:04:02.330> to<00:04:02.360> say<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.720> it's<00:04:03.290> too<00:04:03.560> long<00:04:03.799> I<00:04:04.040> mean

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
it I have to say it it's too long I mean

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.710 
it I have to say it it's too long I mean
it<00:04:04.489> is<00:04:04.610> too<00:04:04.820> long<00:04:04.970> there's<00:04:05.180> no<00:04:05.299> doubt<00:04:05.480> about<00:04:05.540> it

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
it is too long there's no doubt about it

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.410 
it is too long there's no doubt about it
and<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.019> is<00:04:06.080> it<00:04:06.980> is<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.220> real<00:04:07.580> vanity<00:04:08.000> project

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420

but<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.780> think<00:04:09.110> that<00:04:09.290> it<00:04:09.769> is<00:04:09.980> quite<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.370> quite<00:04:10.730> a

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
but I think that it is quite a quite a

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.710 
but I think that it is quite a quite a
funny<00:04:10.970> spectacle
