in sk 4400 and I like this case because

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.090 
in sk 4400 and I like this case because
an<00:01:11.420> tape<00:01:11.690> case<00:01:11.930> is<00:01:12.110> in<00:01:12.229> gentle<00:01:12.649> they're<00:01:12.800> pretty

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
an tape case is in gentle they're pretty

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.859 
an tape case is in gentle they're pretty
quiet<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.840> pretty<00:01:14.840> energy-efficient<00:01:15.800> cases

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
quiet and pretty energy-efficient cases

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.150 
quiet and pretty energy-efficient cases

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
one case to this case are not really

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.310 
one case to this case are not really
worth<00:01:37.550> writing<00:01:38.060> home<00:01:38.210> about<00:01:38.360> it's<00:01:38.960> actually<00:01:39.110> a

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
worth writing home about it's actually a

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.070 
worth writing home about it's actually a
whole<00:01:39.649> computer<00:01:40.070> but<00:01:40.250> it<00:01:41.240> serves<00:01:41.540> on<00:01:41.810> some

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
whole computer but it serves on some

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.870 
whole computer but it serves on some
important<00:01:42.560> purposes<00:01:42.979> in<00:01:43.159> terms<00:01:43.490> of<00:01:43.640> some<00:01:43.820> of

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
important purposes in terms of some of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.990 
important purposes in terms of some of
the<00:01:44.030> software<00:01:44.360> applications<00:01:45.080> that<00:01:45.490> i<00:01:46.490> use

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
what prompted me to do this project

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.450 
what prompted me to do this project
anyway<00:02:00.560> was<00:02:00.830> the<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:02.119> power<00:02:02.960> supply<00:02:03.290> fan<00:02:03.890> went

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
anyway was the the power supply fan went

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.139 
anyway was the the power supply fan went
and<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:05.659> system<00:02:06.409> was<00:02:06.680> pretty<00:02:06.950> much<00:02:07.070> you<00:02:08.030> know

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
and the system was pretty much you know

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.900 
and the system was pretty much you know
it<00:02:08.329> would<00:02:08.509> turn<00:02:09.259> on<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:09.769> know<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.220> then<00:02:10.399> run

it would turn on you know and then run

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.699 
it would turn on you know and then run
until<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.329> thing<00:02:11.780> got<00:02:11.959> hot<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.380> had<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.560> take

until the thing got hot I had to take
everything<00:02:12.980> off<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.459> keep<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:13.760> cool<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.780> even

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
everything off to keep it cool to even

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.840 
everything off to keep it cool to even
get<00:02:15.079> it<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.290> run<00:02:15.440> but<00:02:15.709> yeah<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.160> fan<00:02:16.340> is<00:02:16.579> seized

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
get it to run but yeah the fan is seized

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.259 
get it to run but yeah the fan is seized
and<00:02:17.470> you<00:02:18.470> know<00:02:18.590> it's<00:02:18.739> this<00:02:19.430> part<00:02:19.730> they<00:02:20.060> all

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
and you know it's this part they all

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.170 
and you know it's this part they all
that's<00:02:20.510> pretty<00:02:21.019> old<00:02:21.079> stuff<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:22.160> still<00:02:22.459> we<00:02:23.030> can

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
that's pretty old stuff but still we can

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.240 
that's pretty old stuff but still we can
still<00:02:23.329> get<00:02:23.480> some<00:02:23.660> good<00:02:24.019> years<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.799> use<00:02:24.950> out<00:02:25.190> of

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
still get some good years of use out of

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.449 
still get some good years of use out of
it<00:02:25.780> considering<00:02:26.780> now<00:02:27.290> what<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:27.920> specs<00:02:28.220> are

to<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:21.610> ga<00:03:22.610> dash<00:03:23.060> 7<00:03:23.450> 1<00:03:23.629> XE<00:03:24.019> board<00:03:25.209> pretty<00:03:26.209> much

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
to a ga dash 7 1 XE board pretty much

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.630 
to a ga dash 7 1 XE board pretty much
I've<00:03:26.750> studied<00:03:27.379> this<00:03:27.620> board<00:03:27.920> figured<00:03:28.310> out<00:03:28.430> what

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
I've studied this board figured out what

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.490 
I've studied this board figured out what
all<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:29.000> wire<00:03:29.150> connections<00:03:29.720> are<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:30.200> that<00:03:30.379> in

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
all the wire connections are is that in

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.740 
all the wire connections are is that in
the<00:03:30.560> other<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:32.120> now<00:03:32.150> we're<00:03:32.480> going<00:03:32.569> to<00:03:32.629> get

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
the other so now we're going to get

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.390 
the other so now we're going to get
started<00:03:32.989> on<00:03:33.140> this<00:03:33.260> project<00:03:33.319> and<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.190> first

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
started on this project and the first

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.280 
started on this project and the first
thing<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:35.060> eliminate<00:03:35.750> some<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.080> clutter

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
thing to eliminate some of the clutter

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.000 
thing to eliminate some of the clutter
in<00:03:36.500> this<00:03:36.620> box<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.129> make<00:03:37.750> access<00:03:38.750> easier<00:03:39.500> I'm

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
in this box and make access easier I'm

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.110 
in this box and make access easier I'm
going<00:03:40.099> to<00:03:40.159> remove<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.430> power<00:03:40.790> supply<00:03:41.060> unit

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
going to remove the power supply unit

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.940 
going to remove the power supply unit
okay

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.000 

okay<00:03:47.790> with<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.209> power<00:03:48.750> supply<00:03:48.959> removed<00:03:49.470> and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
okay with the power supply removed and

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.240 
okay with the power supply removed and
all<00:03:50.340> its<00:03:50.610> wires<00:03:51.000> disconnected<00:03:51.890> you<00:03:52.890> could<00:03:53.069> see

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
all its wires disconnected you could see

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.199 
all its wires disconnected you could see
that<00:03:53.459> it's<00:03:53.670> pretty<00:03:53.879> much<00:03:55.099> you<00:03:56.099> know<00:03:56.250> looks<00:03:57.090> a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
that it's pretty much you know looks a

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.259 
that it's pretty much you know looks a
little<00:03:57.420> bit<00:03:57.599> less<00:03:57.780> cluttered<00:03:58.170> now<00:03:58.950> as<00:03:59.819> far<00:04:00.209> as

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
little bit less cluttered now as far as

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.880 
little bit less cluttered now as far as
when<00:04:00.690> we<00:04:00.780> get<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.019> motherboard<00:04:01.470> into<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.769> new

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
when we get the motherboard into the new

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.080 
when we get the motherboard into the new
case<00:04:02.420> we<00:04:03.420> only<00:04:03.450> have<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.830> I<00:04:05.160> guess<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.370> 24

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
case we only have the I guess the 24
