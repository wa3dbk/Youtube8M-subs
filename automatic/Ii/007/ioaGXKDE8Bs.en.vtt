 of the month the key is the mailbox and you see the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.390

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.199
 you know if you hear some noise from 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.060
 background is the worker that I carry here all 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.090
 keeping record and it's impossible 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.560
 said look of lost to the river I'm going to 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.430
 record whatever it is so if there 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.880
 a lot of noise 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.399
 I'm sorry, the first thing I see is 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.500
 this sample of the march of the anise is 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.420
 a baby is raising the state watching 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.710
 a lot of bloggers here in America that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.170
 they are using it now it 's a baby 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.789
 horsehair that comes as in compact comes 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.770
 with this sponge that is acquiring 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.210
 all this with your sponge you are giving and 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.309
 You are taking a quantity of product 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.899
 that comes out in cream and you can touch it in 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.879
 the face all the good that comes to you is 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.219
 it can be carried in the bag 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.620
 time wanting to approve but was not 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.000
 very safe without vat liked it so it's 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.360
 the moment 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.730
 I get here in three 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.520
 tonalities the unit and the 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.180
 sponge so you can use it on 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.970
 both products and good is a live and 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.090
 think you have five factors in one 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.240
 helps to illuminate protect has factor 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.800
 of protection 50 helps hydrate the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.990
 skin and leave the refrescantes the 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.380
 word does not come pretty well helps 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.290
 Prevent the subject of shine to sebum 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.540
 that we usually general and above all is a 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.070
 make-up foundation an ere cream what in 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.110
 the stylish that I do not like to endure 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.820
 pretty good for coverage I os 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.229
 is this so you're looking for a lot 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.790
 information because I was very interested 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.550
 in trying the product but I have not arrived 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.640
 to buy it so happy to be able to 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.160
 try it now and well let's see the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.250
 little bag that comes together I'm watching is from 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.009
 pineapples and we have summer pineapple bag 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.080
 and well this bag has been designed by 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.700
 cardigan marin with this girl has done 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.190
 some beautiful bags all the way 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.890
 The world has them are 200 dollars of stock market 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.940
 they are a pass and I went for the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.070
 economic 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.690
 for the reply but well I think that 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.460
 you had to see this type of bag 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.870
 because everybody takes it but I 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.150
 I went for the replica they were 30 dollars 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.880
 much cheaper than the 200 and good 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.360
 we go to the bag what is not style of 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.030
 the aniseed cream is separate or extra 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.520
 well first we have is the postcard 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.170
 You see this is the preseason is that 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.390
 is the little one to connect the south 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.160
 and from behind as always I tell you a little 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.050
 the issue of how to publish it on the internet 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.840
 so that people see it as typical 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.750
 social networks and good inside the first 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.330
 product that we have is a mask of 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.390
 eyelashes of via bones he I do not like 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.680
 this more this mark this already look that no 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.090
 take a little ipsi bags 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.690
 but I do not like anything the brand had 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.820
 a seal when you do then you can see 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.750
 the internet and you can say to see if you 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.110
 you liked product if you did not like it 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.400
 if you want another tonality I will say 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.520
 that I do not want more of the brand should 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.280
 begin is that you do not call me anything 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.070
 I do not like it, it 's a mask 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.240
 simple eyelashes the brochita is the most 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.430
 simple that you can see 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.400
 and I do not know if I'll try it for 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.410
 try it but do not know why I'm not 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.940
 very comfortable with these types of products 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.290
 which he has also drunk to spare 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.350
 I have it there in the drawer but I do not 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.420
 like nothing good the other product that 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.120
 we have is a product for hair 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.860
 is from the brand marc anthony professional 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.740
 marc anthony has products for the 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.020
 good hair this is the dream ways 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.780
 beats spray and good is a spray of these 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.340
 of texture and without being told that it is a 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.200
 spray to give it a little more texture 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.580
 hair mostly I think if 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.650
 you have the prioritized you have the hair 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.710
 straight as a child that is completely 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.440
 smooth I always have to use a little 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.750
 tenacilla so as to be something of 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.360
 volume or change of hair and good 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.530
 this is what we have to do is 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.360
 supposedly because I have another one 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.760
 brand is to vaporize when we have the 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.610
 wet hair and then we can leave him and 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.040
 she's going to leave her hair like a little 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.410
 sticky but you will notice the peru 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.970
 in some spots a bit harder and 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.950
 it's going to give it some texture that's why 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.320
 they are texture experts and a 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.250
 little hair texture the only thing 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.220
 he has never tried 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.650
 and Marc Anthony so I'll tell you if I 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.680
 like it or not 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.130
 the other thing I have is a shimmer eyeliner 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.580
 eyeliner of the brand niké ni kaká 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.169
 of this I have a mask a nail polish 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.419
 that I also received from them about 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.160
 months and the truth that I loved and good 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.789
 is the color meter finger yes I like 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.060
 it's a blue super me a beautiful he's a 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:54.350
 shimmer eyeliner but I do not know the tonality 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:54.350
 blue have been very simple blue and good 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.729
 the applicator is typical eyeliner and the 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:04.520
 color is gorgeous or whether I love it 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.470
 shining the light that I have the only thing 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.990
 that with this DNA alone I do not do it 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.630
 because I'm a denial and I do not get it right 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.430
 but adding a point over then 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.930
 keep with black and adding a little 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.919
 point above I think you have to give 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.440
 also very nice 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:21.050
 in the bottom line and I love the 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.340
 color is very bright 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.500
 I'm going to leave it a little bit let's see what 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.350
 such endures how long it takes to dry 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.260
 if what is missing and good the last 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.410
 product so counting the brand the 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.550
 anise came as part of the products and 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.229
 good the last product this yes that 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.240
 I knew he was coming because they sent a 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.770
 mail at the end of last month saying 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.790
 that this month everyone was going to have 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.350
 a mix toilet gloss 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.300
 and then this one did know what 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.830
 They did not know the tonality there has touched me 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:53.980
 in the tone apple strudel is a tone 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:57.130
 also very beautiful coral I love is 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.660
 Since they are coral lions, I like them a lot 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.330
 the sweet tooth I have two more I have here 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.360
 because they are the ones that we are going to use and 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.370
 I have in the tone they think I blew and pits and 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.690
 green and I really like everything I do not know if 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.960
 you have tried us, you have to take them for 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.670
 They are super creamy they bring a color not 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.000
 it's a super high pigmentation but 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.380
 They bring a good color to the lips and 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.820
 now for the summer I think it's a 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.460
 very good gloss 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.560
 yes, the last one does paint 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.050
 pretty good mine is pete shangri 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.790
 this one does have more pigmentation but 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.400
 this the truth that I really like the 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.660
 tonality apple strudel and nothing I hope 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.130
