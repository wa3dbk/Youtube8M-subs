would<00:02:21.700> also<00:02:21.910> point<00:02:22.330> out<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.960> this<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.290> one<00:02:23.950> of

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
would also point out that this is one of

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.880 
would also point out that this is one of
the<00:02:24.160> earliest<00:02:24.580> examples<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.930> proper

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
the earliest examples of a proper

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.870 
the earliest examples of a proper
survival<00:02:27.460> horror<00:02:27.640> game<00:02:28.030> because<00:02:29.100> it's<00:02:30.100> unique

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
survival horror game because it's unique

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.630 
survival horror game because it's unique
in<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.780> sense<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.170> unlike<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:32.950> lot<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.340> other

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
in the sense that unlike a lot of other

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.790 
in the sense that unlike a lot of other
survival<00:02:34.420> horror<00:02:34.570> games<00:02:34.960> like<00:02:35.170> even<00:02:35.470> even

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
survival horror games like even even

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.080 
survival horror games like even even
resident<00:02:36.310> evil<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.640> thumb<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:36.940> he'll

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
resident evil and thumb and he'll

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.400 
resident evil and thumb and he'll
there's<00:02:37.840> no<00:02:37.900> combat<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:39.760> this<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.420> game<00:02:40.690> so

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
there's no combat in this this game so

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.530 
there's no combat in this this game so
it's<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.650> lot<00:02:41.770> closer<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.370> like<00:02:42.550> maybe<00:02:43.060> silent

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
it's a lot closer to like maybe silent

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.220 
it's a lot closer to like maybe silent
hill<00:02:43.630> shattered<00:02:43.660> Memories<00:02:44.670> um<00:02:45.670> or<00:02:46.080> even<00:02:47.080> more

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
hill shattered Memories um or even more

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.080 
hill shattered Memories um or even more
so<00:02:47.410> I<00:02:47.440> would<00:02:47.680> argue<00:02:47.830> it's<00:02:48.100> more<00:02:48.340> like<00:02:48.550> penumbra

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
so I would argue it's more like penumbra

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.810 
so I would argue it's more like penumbra
or<00:02:49.300> amnesia<00:02:49.900> for<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.440> pc<00:02:50.890> if<00:02:51.550> you<00:02:51.640> play

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
or amnesia for the pc if you play

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.640 
or amnesia for the pc if you play
neither<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.120> those<00:02:52.240> games<00:02:52.450> where<00:02:52.720> there's<00:02:53.560> no

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
neither of those games where there's no

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.320 
neither of those games where there's no
combat<00:02:54.040> really<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.550> don't<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.850> don't<00:02:54.940> fight

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
combat really you don't you don't fight

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330 
combat really you don't you don't fight
anything<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.410> run<00:02:56.740> from<00:02:57.070> from

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
anything you you run from from

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.130 
anything you you run from from
everything<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:58.180> case<00:02:58.420> it's<00:02:58.900> just

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
everything and in this case it's just

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.790 
everything and in this case it's just
one<00:02:59.530> basically<00:03:00.130> this<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.880> one<00:03:01.210> serial<00:03:01.720> killer

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
one basically this is one serial killer

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
one basically this is one serial killer
scissor<00:03:02.800> man<00:03:03.100> um<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.100> run<00:03:06.370> from<00:03:06.580> him

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
scissor man um and and you run from him

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.760 
scissor man um and and you run from him
and<00:03:06.970> that's<00:03:07.330> that's<00:03:07.750> what<00:03:07.960> you<00:03:08.050> do<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.470> know

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
and that's that's what you do you know

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.350 
and that's that's what you do you know
it's<00:03:09.130> about<00:03:09.220> survival<00:03:09.880> it's<00:03:10.030> not<00:03:10.150> about

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
it's about survival it's not about

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.590 
it's about survival it's not about
fighting<00:03:10.660> at<00:03:11.020> all<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:13.120> either<00:03:13.360> they're

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
fighting at all and it's either they're

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.570 
fighting at all and it's either they're
opposed<00:03:14.110> solve<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.710> items<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.100> collect<00:03:15.280> it

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
opposed solve and items to collect it

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.910 
opposed solve and items to collect it
feels<00:03:16.240> a<00:03:16.420> lot<00:03:16.600> like<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:16.840> classic<00:03:17.200> survival

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
feels a lot like a classic survival

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.780 
feels a lot like a classic survival
horror<00:03:18.100> experience<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:20.190> thus<00:03:21.190> I<00:03:21.430> would<00:03:21.640> say

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
horror experience and thus I would say

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.030 
horror experience and thus I would say
this<00:03:21.940> is<00:03:22.090> an<00:03:22.210> early<00:03:22.510> example<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:22.960> that<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.200> think

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
this is an early example of that I think

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.400 
this is an early example of that I think
that<00:03:24.310> there<00:03:24.460> were<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:24.610> few<00:03:25.000> other<00:03:25.390> games<00:03:26.200> on<00:03:26.320> the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
that there were a few other games on the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.830 
that there were a few other games on the
pc<00:03:26.710> that<00:03:27.100> we're<00:03:27.370> out<00:03:27.520> for<00:03:28.030> this<00:03:28.240> one<00:03:28.510> but<00:03:28.810> this

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
pc that we're out for this one but this

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.240 
pc that we're out for this one but this
is<00:03:29.080> the<00:03:29.170> first<00:03:29.200> nipple<00:03:29.770> i<00:03:29.860> can<00:03:30.040> think<00:03:30.160> of

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
is the first nipple i can think of

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.040 
is the first nipple i can think of
Licata<00:03:30.640> console<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.330> considering<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.750> only

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
Licata console and considering the only

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.280 
Licata console and considering the only
like<00:03:32.530> proper<00:03:33.490> horror<00:03:33.910> games<00:03:34.300> i<00:03:34.480> can<00:03:34.690> think<00:03:35.020> of

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
like proper horror games i can think of
