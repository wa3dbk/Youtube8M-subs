00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.019
 winter hello today i'm nothing what 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.400
 no recipe as just a small video 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.940
 you know what it has to do with me 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.220
 that everyone knows fine about sanctions on 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.810
 relation to Russia about the fact that we have 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.359
 now do not deliver 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.180
 foreign products have at least 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.609
 from Europe and we are generally victims 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.880
 of this policy, the victims were including 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.000
 the culinary specialist I suffer the most if 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.320
 honestly from the fact that Parmesan was gone i'm not 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.320
 I know you are suffering 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.120
 but I personally liked Parmesan cheese very well 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.070
 like so far i love trying by 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.700
 opportunities someone travels to europe please 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.980
 so as not to be brought and they bring me by the way 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.020
 here but something needs to be done when there is no 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.579
 Parmesan wants something exactly Parmesan 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.360
 no need to take any 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.309
 actions at me I thought that but many 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.620
 wrote there like dude what do you think 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.100
 about the parmesan alternative and I honestly 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.619
 saying not sure yet I am yet 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.680
 haven't tried these cheeses what alternatives 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.049
 no parmesan is the most delicious solid 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.600
 son but no less today to poke in 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.140
 store for 2 cheeses 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.850
 one parmesan argentina 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.360
 John Field Argentina 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.110
 and the second Parmesan is also cow's cheese 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.680
 Parmesan milk semolina 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.500
 Uruguay here and there are rumors that principle 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.490
 it is more or less cheese and which can 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.740
 replace real parmigiano reggiano well 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.850
 and legrand served at least cheese which 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.070
 similar in taste 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.810
 I'm not sure what it is 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.930
 when you want to try and say my 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.380
 opinion did we find replaced us 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.049
 argentinian uruguayans parmesan or not 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.329
 could make it two cheeses worth 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.600
 about the same here one is 1500 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.439
 94 rubles per kilogram and the second 1560 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.899
 rubles per kilogram 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.210
 I have two such small pieces 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.670
 I want to try for the first time I swear 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.520
 The first time I try these cheeses right when 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.480
 I will do this for you here at first I want 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.069
 try here it looks the way 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.920
 Argentinian looks more like 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.389
 real parmesan 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.129
 Vrubai sky is a little less similar to 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:23.010
 real parmesan just looks like 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.609
 some dried hard cheese interesting 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.739
 what to taste let's try first 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:33.510
 then yes uruguay manka and gourmet 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:41.510
 let me try what he does 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:47.250
 represents well basically 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:49.730
 Perhaps this cheese can be replaced by this 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.709
 cheese can be replaced by Uruguayan 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.019
 Parmesan that's only in the dishes that is 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.010
 Parmesan than good is what I personally 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:00.629
 I can eat it separately 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.430
 cut parmesan 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.199
 that is the principle Parmesan is tasty itself 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.699
 on its own, this cheese basically has 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:10.739
 similar exhalation aftertaste know 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:14.299
 when here I am sorry of course for that 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.639
 comparison but feeling not fresh 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.530
 feeling not fresh in the mouth which you 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:23.599
 under this Parmesan goes but no 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.340
 learn this here how to say here 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.889
 brittleness there is no brittleness that is real 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.560
 Parmesan he should 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:33.870
 crumble here thefts from that wall and this 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.109
 what is just hard cheese 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.479
 but itâ€™s delicious 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.989
 add really carbonara 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:45.389
 some macaroons or line tishchenko 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.400
 let me try 2 cheese is 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:50.849
 Argentinian Parmesan they are like this 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.699
 called 12 months of exposure by the way a 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.259
 here it is not clear how many excerpts here 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.540
 12 months but it looks fair 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:04:00.000
 speaking more convincingly even 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.250
 some sort of crumbs like a real 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.390
 Parmesan 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.490
 try even to break it off dad well 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:16.609
 Crumble by the way better let's 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:18.739
 try to listen but Argentinian 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.670
 Parmesan even more 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:26.630
 can be a substitute in general of course these 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.700
 two cheeses this is not parmesan and not parmesan 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.660
 they are far from real Italian 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.150
 cheese but for use in dishes very 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.640
 it is quite an Argentine one 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.610
 there is still no Uruguayan parmesan 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.830
 probably not this extreme in the extreme 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.680
 case with it by the way argentinian also 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.680
 cheaper in general, that's all I wanted 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.410
 say just to tell you about what 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.120
 whether or not we have things in the world 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.620
 alternative to real italian 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.230
 Parmesan y is only relevant for 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.800
 Russians, the rest of the country is not 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.350
 suffer bans them it's all for sale 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.180
 calmly we already have even in moscow big 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.979
 the problem with real parmesan here and there 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:13.040
 so I probably will put a booklet 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.780
 a zagashnikah in the knowledge that it is possible 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.590
 use Argentine Parmesan 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.790
 Uruguayan and buy probably will not 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.800
