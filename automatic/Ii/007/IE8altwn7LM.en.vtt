we're<00:01:59.500> going<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.650> utilize<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.460> bowline<00:02:00.790> knot

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
we're going to utilize the bowline knot

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.060 
we're going to utilize the bowline knot
but<00:02:01.990> it's<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.170> little<00:02:02.290> bit<00:02:02.380> modified<00:02:02.710> because

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
but it's a little bit modified because

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.770 
but it's a little bit modified because
you're<00:02:03.250> using<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.670> bowline<00:02:03.910> knot<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.180> tie<00:02:04.390> the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
you're using the bowline knot to tie the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.780 
you're using the bowline knot to tie the
leaf<00:02:04.960> line<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.530> solid<00:02:05.830> object<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.670> object

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
leaf line to a solid object the object

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.669 
leaf line to a solid object the object
being<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.330> boom<00:02:07.479> itself<00:02:07.780> as<00:02:08.020> opposed<00:02:08.590> to

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
being the boom itself as opposed to

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.080 
being the boom itself as opposed to
tying<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:09.009> bowline<00:02:09.280> knot<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.580> just<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.910> line

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
tying a bowline knot to just the line

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.199 
tying a bowline knot to just the line
itself<00:02:11.100> so<00:02:12.100> like<00:02:12.250> any<00:02:12.430> bowline<00:02:12.730> knot<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.060> have

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
itself so like any bowline knot you have

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.630 
itself so like any bowline knot you have
your<00:02:13.360> six<00:02:14.010> we're<00:02:15.010> going<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.190> have<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.340> end<00:02:15.490> of

your six we're going to have the end of

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.520 
your six we're going to have the end of
it<00:02:15.730> laying<00:02:16.209> on<00:02:16.360> top<00:02:16.510> just<00:02:17.380> like<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:20.440> to

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
it laying on top just like that going to

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.790 
it laying on top just like that going to
hold<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.800> six<00:02:21.190> cross<00:02:21.430> right<00:02:21.670> there<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:22.800> like

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
hold that six cross right there I like

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.030 
hold that six cross right there I like
to<00:02:23.950> have<00:02:24.420> my<00:02:25.420> standing<00:02:25.840> line<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.739> then<00:02:26.920> also

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
to have my standing line and then also

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.310 
to have my standing line and then also
you<00:02:27.190> have<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.400> hang<00:02:27.640> line<00:02:27.880> below<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:29.260> have

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
you have a hang line below that you have

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.170 
you have a hang line below that you have
your<00:02:29.410> six<00:02:29.770> give<00:02:30.310> your<00:02:30.459> tail<00:02:30.670> pointing<00:02:31.090> away

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
your six give your tail pointing away

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.440 
your six give your tail pointing away
from<00:02:31.239> you<00:02:31.860> we're<00:02:32.860> going<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.070> go<00:02:33.190> first<00:02:33.820> around

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
from you we're going to go first around

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.470 
from you we're going to go first around
the<00:02:34.600> standing<00:02:34.959> line<00:02:35.940> up<00:02:36.940> through<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.330> bottom

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.980 
the standing line up through the bottom
of<00:02:37.690> your<00:02:37.750> loop

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
of your loop

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.640 
of your loop
underneath<00:02:39.740> your<00:02:40.370> hanging<00:02:40.550> wine<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:42.470> then

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
underneath your hanging wine and then

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.080 
underneath your hanging wine and then
back<00:02:42.830> through<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.130> top<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.370> your<00:02:43.520> loop<00:02:43.700> and

back through the top of your loop and
you're<00:02:44.420> going<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:44.600> take<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.930> end<00:02:45.110> of<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.830> reef

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
you're going to take the end of the reef

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.520 
you're going to take the end of the reef
line<00:02:46.250> here<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.810> part<00:02:48.020> that's<00:02:48.200> parallel

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
line here and the part that's parallel

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.830 
line here and the part that's parallel
to<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:48.980> then<00:02:49.460> the<00:02:49.550> opposite<00:02:49.940> line<00:02:50.150> you're

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
to it and then the opposite line you're

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.530 
to it and then the opposite line you're
going<00:02:50.990> to<00:02:51.050> pull<00:02:51.260> those<00:02:51.470> as<00:02:51.740> you<00:02:52.490> can<00:02:52.610> see<00:02:52.790> you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
going to pull those as you can see you

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.400 
going to pull those as you can see you
make<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.750> loop<00:02:54.050> as<00:02:54.260> well<00:02:55.070> as<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.340> bowline<00:02:55.640> knot

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
make a loop as well as the bowline knot

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.310 
make a loop as well as the bowline knot
Estrin<00:02:57.730> after<00:02:58.730> that's<00:02:58.880> done<00:02:59.170> I'm<00:03:00.170> going<00:03:00.200> to

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
Estrin after that's done I'm going to

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.290 
Estrin after that's done I'm going to
take<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.590> slack<00:03:00.770> out<00:03:00.980> now<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.790> can<00:03:01.970> see<00:03:02.120> the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
take the slack out now you can see the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.300 
take the slack out now you can see the
reef<00:03:02.450> line<00:03:02.630> is<00:03:02.960> attached<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.500> boom<00:03:03.590> and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
reef line is attached to the boom and

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.890 
reef line is attached to the boom and
it's<00:03:04.610> behind<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:05.000> canvas<00:03:05.210> strap<00:03:05.540> that<00:03:05.720> way

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
it's behind this canvas strap that way

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.670 
it's behind this canvas strap that way
it<00:03:06.440> won't<00:03:06.590> slide<00:03:06.860> forward<00:03:08.260> once<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.440> Sun

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
it won't slide forward once that Sun

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.870 
it won't slide forward once that Sun
that's<00:03:09.950> iterations<00:03:10.400> going<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.580> go<00:03:10.670> ahead<00:03:10.730> and

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
that's iterations going to go ahead and

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.570 
that's iterations going to go ahead and
drop<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.980> now<00:03:12.980> you<00:03:13.040> have<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.250> reef<00:03:13.400> line

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
drop it and now you have a reef line

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.040 
drop it and now you have a reef line
attached<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.910> boom<00:03:14.060> all<00:03:14.390> set<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.810> go<00:03:14.930> with

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
attached to the boom all set you go with

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.140 
attached to the boom all set you go with
that
