once<00:00:10.240> you've<00:00:10.390> created<00:00:10.690> an<00:00:11.020> outcome<00:00:11.470> the

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
once you've created an outcome the

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.760 
once you've created an outcome the

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
outcome box itself on the canvas has

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.580 
outcome box itself on the canvas has
more<00:00:15.760> functions<00:00:16.240> on<00:00:16.480> it<00:00:16.630> there<00:00:17.200> there<00:00:17.470> are

more functions on it there there are

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.269 
more functions on it there there are

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
don't see them ordinarily but when you

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.269 
don't see them ordinarily but when you
roll<00:00:25.540> over<00:00:25.570> them<00:00:26.110> with<00:00:26.290> the<00:00:26.380> cursor<00:00:26.770> that's

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
way inside the box of the outcome that

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.440 
way inside the box of the outcome that
you<00:01:18.010> want<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.340> connect<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.850> precondition<00:01:19.420> to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
there's a multiple object move function

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.940 
there's a multiple object move function
that's<00:01:45.160> for<00:01:45.730> only<00:01:46.120> four<00:01:46.840> outcomes<00:01:47.260> themselves

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
that's for only four outcomes themselves

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.590 
that's for only four outcomes themselves
if<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.160> want<00:01:48.370> to<00:01:48.490> move<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.820> group<00:01:49.030> of<00:01:49.150> outcomes

if you want to move a group of outcomes

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.290 
if you want to move a group of outcomes
the<00:01:50.170> way<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.440> do<00:01:50.650> that<00:01:50.830> is<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.190> hold<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.120> shift

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
the way to do that is to hold the shift

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.570 
the way to do that is to hold the shift
key<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.840> select<00:01:52.870> all<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.920> ones<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.250> want<00:01:54.430> to
