have the 64 gigabyte SanDisk and again
there's<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.610> thing<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.820> says<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.299> cut

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
there's a little thing that says to cut

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.380 
there's a little thing that says to cut
along<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.780> line<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.950> I'm<00:01:50.250> going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:50.939> that

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.520 

and<00:01:58.070> see<00:01:59.070> if<00:01:59.160> it<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.720> does<00:02:00.840> come<00:02:01.080> open<00:02:01.230> right

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and see if it so it does come open right

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.420 
and see if it so it does come open right
there<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:02.760> we<00:02:02.940> reach<00:02:03.360> down<00:02:03.690> inside<00:02:04.430> there's

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
there so if we reach down inside there's

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.560 
there so if we reach down inside there's
a<00:02:05.640> plastic

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
a plastic

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:23.330 
a plastic
oh<00:02:09.320> it<00:02:10.320> just<00:02:15.470> squeeze<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:17.630> come<00:02:18.630> out<00:02:21.770> so<00:02:22.770> here

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
oh it just squeeze it come out so here

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.750 
oh it just squeeze it come out so here
it<00:02:23.970> has<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.970> card<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.260> adapter<00:02:29.100> inside

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
it has the card and the adapter inside

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.170 
it has the card and the adapter inside
of<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.060> little<00:02:30.270> carrying<00:02:30.810> case<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.790> that's<00:02:32.790> oh

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
of a little carrying case so that's oh

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.510 
of a little carrying case so that's oh
don't<00:02:33.840> want<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.020> pop<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.320> card<00:02:34.470> out<00:02:34.650> that's

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
don't want to pop the card out that's

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.280 
don't want to pop the card out that's
what<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.940> looks<00:02:36.120> like<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:37.580> let's<00:02:39.290> compare

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
what that looks like so let's compare

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.190 
what that looks like so let's compare
I'm<00:02:40.890> gonna<00:02:41.070> put<00:02:41.520> this<00:02:41.670> back<00:02:41.910> inside<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.390> case

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.020 

all<00:02:49.200> right<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:49.770> if<00:02:50.280> we<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.520> look<00:02:50.730> at<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
all right so now if we just look at the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.390 
all right so now if we just look at the
boxes<00:02:51.540> we<00:02:51.840> can<00:02:51.870> compare<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.800> read<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.280> write

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
boxes we can compare the read and write

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.870 
boxes we can compare the read and write
speed

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
speed

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.910 
speed
so<00:02:54.390> obviously<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.170> sizes<00:02:55.680> are<00:02:55.800> different

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
so obviously the sizes are different

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
code that you can scan on there so then

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.140 
code that you can scan on there so then
if<00:03:42.570> we<00:03:42.690> look<00:03:42.840> at<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.019> back<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.410> says

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
if we look at the back it says

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.250

recommended application it's just a

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.380 
recommended application it's just a
little<00:03:46.350> bunch<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.620> stuff<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.040> then<00:03:47.390> jumbo

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
little bunch of stuff and then jumbo

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.030 
little bunch of stuff and then jumbo
Gumble<00:03:49.730> now<00:03:50.730> if<00:03:51.120> we<00:03:51.690> look<00:03:51.930> at<00:03:52.110> this<00:03:52.320> one<00:03:52.560> also

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
Gumble now if we look at this one also

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.610 
Gumble now if we look at this one also
the<00:03:53.489> Sony<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:55.110> let's<00:03:55.410> look<00:03:55.470> at<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.829> it's<00:03:56.820> a

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
the Sony is a let's look at the it's a

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.610 
the Sony is a let's look at the it's a
UHS<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:59.280> if<00:03:59.610> we<00:03:59.970> look<00:04:00.150> here<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:01.140> little<00:04:01.320> one

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
UHS so if we look here the little one

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.650 
UHS so if we look here the little one
right<00:04:01.829> there<00:04:02.040> that's<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.760> little<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.299> one

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
right there that's the little you one

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.270 
right there that's the little you one
that's<00:04:04.110> UHS<00:04:05.099> and<00:04:05.370> that<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.599> considered

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
that's UHS and that that is considered

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.630 
that's UHS and that that is considered
the<00:04:07.370> highest<00:04:07.640> class<00:04:08.120> of<00:04:09.100> writing<00:04:10.100> and<00:04:10.340> reading

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
the highest class of writing and reading

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.620 
the highest class of writing and reading
speed<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:11.630> both<00:04:12.290> of<00:04:12.319> the<00:04:12.740> SanDisk<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.630> the

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
speed so both of the SanDisk and the

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.979 
speed so both of the SanDisk and the
Sony<00:04:15.170> or<00:04:15.700> UHS<00:04:17.260> so<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.320> see<00:04:18.590> on<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:19.989> SanDisk

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
Sony or UHS so you see on the SanDisk

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.810 
Sony or UHS so you see on the SanDisk
yeah<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:21.590> see<00:04:21.769> if<00:04:21.859> they<00:04:21.980> little<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.490> one

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
yeah you see if they little you one

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.379 
yeah you see if they little you one
right<00:04:23.030> there

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
right there

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.290 
right there
so<00:04:23.870> both<00:04:24.200> of<00:04:24.230> them<00:04:24.500> are<00:04:24.560> you<00:04:24.830> a<00:04:24.860> just<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:25.490> both

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
so both of them are you a just and both

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.260 
so both of them are you a just and both
of<00:04:26.330> them<00:04:26.660> are<00:04:26.810> the<00:04:26.900> same<00:04:27.639> so<00:04:28.639> if<00:04:28.760> we<00:04:28.940> look<00:04:29.120> at

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
of them are the same so if we look at

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.230 
of them are the same so if we look at
the<00:04:29.480> just<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:30.710> compare<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.430> let's<00:04:31.940> compare

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
the just to compare the let's compare

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.670 
the just to compare the let's compare
the<00:04:32.360> SD<00:04:32.630> cards<00:04:32.930> first<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:33.550> this<00:04:34.550> one<00:04:34.820> looks

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
the SD cards first so this one looks

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.060 
the SD cards first so this one looks
upside<00:04:36.680> down

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
upside down

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.030 
upside down
this<00:04:37.880> one<00:04:38.060> looks<00:04:38.300> Sony<00:04:39.050> like<00:04:39.380> so<00:04:39.740> this<00:04:39.860> is<00:04:39.919> a

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
this one looks Sony like so this is a

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.490 
this one looks Sony like so this is a
Sony<00:04:40.310> one<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.880> then<00:04:41.540> this<00:04:41.630> one's<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.990> sandesh

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
Sony one and then this one's a sandesh

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.230 
Sony one and then this one's a sandesh
so<00:04:42.890> this<00:04:43.040> has<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.930> this<00:04:44.930> has<00:04:45.140> the<00:04:45.410> the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
so this has the this has the the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.909 
so this has the this has the the
whatever<00:04:47.240> you<00:04:47.419> call<00:04:47.480> it<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:48.110> traditional

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
whatever you call it the traditional

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:55.110 
whatever you call it the traditional
SanDisk<00:04:49.880> look<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:51.580> so<00:04:52.870> this<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:54.470> SanDisk

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
SanDisk look to it so this the SanDisk

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.690 
SanDisk look to it so this the SanDisk
on<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.510> back<00:04:56.690> of<00:04:56.900> it<00:04:58.690> it<00:04:59.690> says<00:04:59.720> that<00:05:00.229> its<00:05:00.700> water

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
on the back of it it says that its water

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.200 
on the back of it it says that its water
proof<00:05:02.260> temperature<00:05:03.260> proof<00:05:03.669> shockproof<00:05:04.669> and

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
proof temperature proof shockproof and

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.520 
proof temperature proof shockproof and
x-ray<00:05:05.660> proof<00:05:05.900> and<00:05:06.680> let's<00:05:07.280> look<00:05:07.520> here<00:05:08.410> in<00:05:09.410> the

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
x-ray proof and let's look here in the

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.040 
x-ray proof and let's look here in the
back<00:05:09.680> of<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.919> Sony<00:05:10.220> it<00:05:10.490> says<00:05:10.729> that<00:05:10.940> its<00:05:11.120> water

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
back of the Sony it says that its water

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.140 
back of the Sony it says that its water
proof<00:05:12.169> temperature<00:05:12.530> proof<00:05:12.770> all<00:05:13.250> that<00:05:13.580> stuff

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
proof temperature proof all that stuff

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.170 
proof temperature proof all that stuff
inside<00:05:15.140> of<00:05:15.320> it<00:05:15.440> so<00:05:16.130> they're<00:05:16.700> pretty<00:05:16.910> much<00:05:17.060> like

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
inside of it so they're pretty much like

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.030 
inside of it so they're pretty much like
read<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:18.200> write<00:05:18.320> speeds<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:18.770> everything

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
read and write speeds and everything

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.190 
read and write speeds and everything
they're<00:05:19.190> identical<00:05:19.550> just<00:05:20.360> that<00:05:20.540> the<00:05:20.690> SanDisk

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
they're identical just that the SanDisk
