but with all the games and we've planned

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.030 
but with all the games and we've planned
our<00:03:31.579> first<00:03:31.819> six<00:03:32.410> which<00:03:33.410> is<00:03:33.440> weird<00:03:33.739> for<00:03:33.799> me<00:03:33.980> an

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
our first six which is weird for me an

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.229 
our first six which is weird for me an
actually<00:03:34.250> have<00:03:34.340> plans<00:03:34.579> but<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:34.910> was<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.090> good

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
actually have plans but it was a good

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.569 
actually have plans but it was a good
idea<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.510> plan<00:03:35.720> stuff<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.200> don't<00:03:36.650> think<00:03:37.100> any<00:03:37.400> of

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
idea to plan stuff I don't think any of

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.970 
idea to plan stuff I don't think any of
them<00:03:37.910> maybe<00:03:38.480> one<00:03:38.810> or<00:03:38.989> two<00:03:39.019> main<00:03:39.500> o'clock<00:03:39.799> over

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
them maybe one or two main o'clock over

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.979 
them maybe one or two main o'clock over
two<00:03:40.250> hours<00:03:40.579> I<00:03:40.700> like<00:03:40.880> making<00:03:41.090> sure<00:03:41.450> interesting

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
two hours I like making sure interesting

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.059 
two hours I like making sure interesting
experimental<00:03:42.380> games<00:03:42.680> that's<00:03:42.829> what<00:03:42.950> we're

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
experimental games that's what we're

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.830 
experimental games that's what we're
going<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.250> be<00:03:43.310> doing<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.329> think<00:03:44.600> this<00:03:44.690> is<00:03:44.810> a

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
going to be doing and I think this is a

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.870 
going to be doing and I think this is a
great<00:03:45.109> policy<00:03:45.650> because<00:03:46.340> this<00:03:46.519> gives<00:03:46.730> the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
great policy because this gives the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.569 
great policy because this gives the
consumer<00:03:47.090> one<00:03:47.989> protection<00:03:48.530> but<00:03:48.889> -<00:03:49.069> lets<00:03:49.370> them

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
consumer one protection but - lets them

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.819 
consumer one protection but - lets them
take<00:03:49.730> risk<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.540> if<00:03:50.900> you<00:03:50.989> let<00:03:51.170> consumer<00:03:51.650> take

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
take risk and if you let consumer take

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.170 
take risk and if you let consumer take
risk<00:03:52.010> Darren<00:03:52.220> Storr<00:03:52.370> go<00:03:52.519> look<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:52.760> can<00:03:53.060> buy

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
you and a few of them yeah a few of them

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.810 
you and a few of them yeah a few of them
may<00:04:27.650> return<00:04:27.980> it<00:04:28.160> if<00:04:28.280> you<00:04:28.370> have<00:04:28.460> them<00:04:28.550> make<00:04:28.700> it

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
round with half of that but eventually

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.190 
round with half of that but eventually
they'll<00:04:31.520> be<00:04:31.880> stopped<00:04:32.300> from<00:04:32.480> returning<00:04:32.870> stuff

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
they'll be stopped from returning stuff

I think it's a good thing we finally
consumer<00:04:37.790> protection<00:04:38.330> is<00:04:38.480> a<00:04:38.510> good<00:04:38.900> thing<00:04:39.260> not

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
consumer protection is a good thing not
