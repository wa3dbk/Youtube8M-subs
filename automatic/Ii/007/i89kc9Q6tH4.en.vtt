00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.750
 hello how are we going to do something today 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.880
 very very cool we are going to need a 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.410
 canvas and as I do not have or I do not 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.269
 I want to buy I will use a cardboard 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.330
 and a fabric that I have left over to cut 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.250
 some curtains to cover the cardboard I'll 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.780
 to use as you see this fabric leaving it 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.000
 a little bit longer so we can 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.160
 fold from behind in the long run 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.230
 that the cardboard I want to say and with tail 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.600
 normal white with that of painter or with 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.400
 of the glue school that you have the 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.129
 We will place on our cardboard 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.839
 This card is from a box but you can 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.989
 also use cereal boxes if 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:41.629
 you want to put two or three cartons together 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.400
 it is convenient that it be a rigid base 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.560
 to hold the weight of the paint 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.480
 now you see from the back what 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.530
 I'm going to do is paste the excess fabric 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.790
 so that it is well folded 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.720
 with the same glue stretched well 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.610
 and I'm hitting 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.960
 It also serves a mother and is for 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.430
 example or as I tell you if you have 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.800
 bought a canvas you have a start 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.480
 bought with phenomenal frame if what 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.490
 do on paper serves this 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.000
 handicraft or this drawing because despite 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.910
 the painting now you will see why 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.470
 Well, you see double the little tips and what 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.550
 I put it behind I'm going to put a little 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.650
 more than glue dissolved in water so that it 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.660
 hold on to our case 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.770
 you can do it the size you want 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.520
 I'm doing it a little bit more 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.520
 big than a folio 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.829
 I say I give a tail capita with a 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.170
 little diluted with water so that it sticks 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.890
 well and I'm going to let it dry 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.080
 minutitos 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.540
 before painting it white to have 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.580
 a good base my web was a little 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.280
 transparent if you have a pretty cloth 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.990
 thicker then maybe we would need and 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.150
 with white acrylic paint as you see 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.500
 I'll give a few cÃ¡pitas up 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.860
 that I see that he has the white that I 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.860
 I want 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.350
 let it dry again 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.050
 and here I have curved a little bit 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.300
 so I'm going to put another cardboard base 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.990
 below to make it stiffer and I 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.090
 stay straight 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.010
 I'm going to do with silicone 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.840
 As you can see I am also leaving a 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.099
 little cardboard on the outside because then 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.980
 I will add a frame that we will see 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.069
 at the end totally home and spending what 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.319
 minimum possible 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.959
 cut the excess leaving that little bit of 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.349
 cardboard and I have already prepared my canvas or 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.349
 frame 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.120
 Well, we are going to use crayons 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.100
 plastidecor paintings waxes as 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.750
 you want to call are you in my box 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.370
 come 24 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.800
 It is advisable that you use a minimum minimum 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.620
 16 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.300
 and I'm going to take the pieces of paper 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.790
 you can leave also if you want if you 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.079
 like 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.079
 I am going to remove them 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.560
 there are boxes of 32 colors I thought of 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.230
 36 use the ones you want now you go to 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.549
 see how it is and you already choose depending 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.280
 how big you want to make the picture 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.940
 or buy two and so you put two of each 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.940
 I'm going to order them 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.680
 like a rainbow or whatever else you like and 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.810
 I'm going to see so they're focused on 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.060
 thousand and I'm going to start hitting the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.569
 central paint as you see with silicone 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.180
 hot again with the gun 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.340
 I'm pasting the paintings in the part 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.530
 top of the canvas with the tip towards 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.840
 down 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.640
 he stuck them together well against each other 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.080
 it seems to me that to be centered 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.780
 it's best to start with the painting 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.750
 central 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.990
 go placing the gradient on both sides 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.990
 color 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.250
 As I tell you , I choose to do it in 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.920
 rainbow but you can choose the order of 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.810
 the paintings that you like the most and 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.510
 I have here well pegaditos veis centered 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.340
 in a thousand and enzo and now it's totally 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.840
 optional I will draw a picture since the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.790
 paint is going to fall down like a 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.010
 rain I'm going to make a kitten a 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.810
 silhouette of a cat that is going to get wet by 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.260
 the rain but you can make a couple 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.420
 with an umbrella whatever you want, I'm going to 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.980
 do in black so that contrast with the 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.900
 color of the paintings falling is a 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.420
 rain of colors 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.769
 I'm coloring with black acrylic what 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.760
 you can also do with a marker 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.760
 permanent black 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.440
 as I tell you totally optional this 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.140
 picture is also very good 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.620
 simply with the paintings with a 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.750
 marker I'm going to make you little mustaches and 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.800
 here I have the basis to start 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.930
 make it more fun 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.430
 and here I have daniela and a friend who 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.740
 I promised them I would let them do it 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.069
 them as you see daniela has a dryer 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.669
 of hair and consists of heating the dinners 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:49.060
 or paints with the dryer that is very 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.800
 hot 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.120
 and do it in the bottom part let's say 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.450
 that half of the painting towards 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.450
 down 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.370
 and in this way they are going to melt and 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.310
 the paint is going to slide you see here 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.940
 the first drops are already beginning to fall 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.610
 For our paper or canvas or fabric 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.330
 important to look here I was 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.270
 directing the air to the sides 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.230
 then the paint goes sideways 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.150
 important is to warm up a little and 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.710
 then direct the dryer downwards if 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.450
 you want the paint to come out as 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.450
 trickles down like a rain 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.710
 also if it has two speeds your 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.889
 dryer it is best to put it in speed 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.419
 slowly but the most heat is going 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.919
 going down and with the air and you go 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.880
 directing the jets to where 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.770
 you want 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.139
 of age that falls to the same amount of 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.659
 painting on one side than on the other 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.610
 and here as you like and you can stop 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.409
 when you want when you have the 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.289
 amount of melted paint that we 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:50.550
 fancy for your pictures 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.550
 it tells me as well as with the painting 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.910
 is already falling a lot red is going 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.680
 mixing let's go more to the side 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.600
 from the blue 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.710
 it's very funny and the children have 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.710
 delighted to do it the truth 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.520
 Be careful to spot the ones that also 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.260
 some paint splashes also puts 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.790
 on the table if you want some role of 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.040
 newspaper to not stain though it's 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.570
 true that when this wax dries is 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.570
 very easy to take off and remove 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.900
 We are doing our little square and you see 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.960
 how the colors are mixed is very 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.639
 nice for my taste 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.020
 and then what we will do we will place it 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.020
 out there somewhere in the house 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.250
 the dark part seems to have been shot 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.250
 less 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:40.009
 and well here we have it already finished what 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:42.180
 you let it dry and no longer stain anything 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.860
 it would be totally hard 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.389
 You see the kitten seems to be 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.130
 wetting with the rain and now what I'm going 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:50.030
 to do is add a frame simply 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.030
 with brown cardboard 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:55.610
 I'm going to cut some strips 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.470
 and I'm going to stick it with silicone in the 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.750
 part of the cardboard that was seen 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.400
 side of our link you see up and down 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.930
 and since I do not have longer paper 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.140
 I will have to do in two pieces the 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.090
 longer sides but it does not matter 

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.920
 simply by putting a little more 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.480
 nice if you really like it and what 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.070
 want to take to mark somewhere with 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.900
 wood and a truly perfect frame 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.340
 but I think that simply for the 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.650
 drawings we make at home and with 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.620
 children you can do perfectly with a 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:24.020
 little bit of cardboard we signed it and now 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.660
 we would have ready to hang or place 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.010
 where you want from behind simply if 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.440
 you want to hang it on a wall you put it 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.690
 here a hook and I would be ready to 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.430
 hang take into account that the hook 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.530
 what you put has to support the weight of 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.690
 the paintings you can not paste with zeal 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.220
 for example to the wall and as always 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.620
