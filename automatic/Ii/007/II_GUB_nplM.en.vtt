windows<00:03:35.010> work<00:03:35.190> nicely

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.300 

okay<00:03:40.920> this<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:41.909> like<00:03:42.120> because<00:03:42.709> it<00:03:43.709> still<00:03:44.010> has<00:03:44.280> a

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
okay this I like because it still has a

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.009 
okay this I like because it still has a
reverse<00:03:44.730> lockout<00:03:45.150> in<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:45.690> can't<00:03:45.900> get

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
reverse lockout in it and you can't get

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.369 
reverse lockout in it and you can't get
the<00:03:46.170> key<00:03:46.379> out<00:03:46.409> without<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.549> beam<00:03:47.879> in<00:03:48.150> Reverse

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
the key out without a beam in Reverse

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.410 
the key out without a beam in Reverse
that<00:03:49.769> was<00:03:49.890> anti-theft<00:03:50.310> feature<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.299> again

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
that was anti-theft feature and again

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.300 
that was anti-theft feature and again
another<00:03:51.840> part<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.290> takes<00:03:52.409> a<00:03:52.620> lot<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:53.040> work<00:03:53.190> to

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
another part that takes a lot of work to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.619 
another part that takes a lot of work to
get<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.610> whole<00:03:53.760> mechanical<00:03:54.269> since<00:03:54.510> we're

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
get that whole mechanical since we're

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.899 
get that whole mechanical since we're
working<00:03:54.980> thirty<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.129> forty<00:03:56.280> years<00:03:56.579> later

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
effort that goes into it it's got a

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.470 
effort that goes into it it's got a
subwoofer<00:04:11.489> in<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.819> back<00:04:11.970> back<00:04:12.150> here<00:04:12.390> that's

this<00:04:24.930> is<00:04:25.139> a<00:04:25.169> car<00:04:25.650> that<00:04:25.680> was<00:04:25.979> an<00:04:26.100> original<00:04:26.190> 80

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
this is a car that was an original 80

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.840 
this is a car that was an original 80
car<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.120> compressors<00:04:27.570> not<00:04:27.750> there<00:04:28.669> but<00:04:29.669> looks

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
car the compressors not there but looks

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.400 
car the compressors not there but looks
to<00:04:29.970> be<00:04:30.090> everything<00:04:30.600> else<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.990> there

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
to be everything else is there

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.260 
to be everything else is there
including<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.039> controls<00:04:32.400> here<00:04:32.789> and<00:04:33.000> the

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
including the controls here and the

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.390 
including the controls here and the
boxes<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:33.720> stuff<00:04:33.780> like<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.260> so<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.949> don't

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
boxes and stuff like that so I don't

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.650 
boxes and stuff like that so I don't
think<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.639> would<00:04:35.760> be<00:04:35.820> a<00:04:35.850> big<00:04:36.030> deal<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.240> make<00:04:36.479> it

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
think it would be a big deal to make it

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.110 
think it would be a big deal to make it
that<00:04:36.930> AC<00:04:37.470> again<00:04:37.949> so<00:04:38.220> I<00:04:38.250> said<00:04:38.520> in<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.699> video<00:04:38.789> the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
that AC again so I said in the video the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.200 
that AC again so I said in the video the
beginning<00:04:39.419> that<00:04:39.539> it<00:04:39.630> was<00:04:39.810> an<00:04:40.169> AC<00:04:40.620> car<00:04:41.100> or<00:04:42.060> air

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
beginning that it was an AC car or air

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.909 
beginning that it was an AC car or air
conditioned<00:04:42.690> meaning<00:04:43.050> that<00:04:43.169> it<00:04:43.350> is<00:04:43.380> original

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
conditioned meaning that it is original

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.800 
conditioned meaning that it is original
factory<00:04:44.520> air<00:04:44.669> conditioned<00:04:45.060> car<00:04:45.090> is<00:04:45.330> proven<00:04:45.720> by

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
factory air conditioned car is proven by

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.589 
factory air conditioned car is proven by
here<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.229> stuff<00:04:46.950> like<00:04:47.039> that<00:04:47.250> so<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.610> couple

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
here and stuff like that so a couple

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.000 
here and stuff like that so a couple
other<00:04:48.720> things<00:04:48.840> too<00:04:49.289> don't<00:04:49.590> forget<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.979> have

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
other things too don't forget you have

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.070 
other things too don't forget you have
power<00:04:50.310> four-wheel<00:04:50.849> disc<00:04:51.030> brakes

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
power four-wheel disc brakes

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.390 
power four-wheel disc brakes
which<00:04:52.410> is<00:04:52.560> really<00:04:52.800> nice<00:04:52.979> it's<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.250> pretty

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
which is really nice it's a pretty

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.339 
which is really nice it's a pretty
expensive<00:04:53.729> option<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.450> add<00:04:54.599> to<00:04:54.870> cars<00:04:55.110> that

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
expensive option to add to cars that

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.110 
expensive option to add to cars that
didn't<00:04:56.250> come<00:04:56.370> with<00:04:56.520> this<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.760> Corvette's

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
didn't come with this the Corvette's

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.430 
didn't come with this the Corvette's
came<00:04:57.270> standard<00:04:57.510> with<00:04:57.660> that<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:58.080> always

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
came standard with that I always

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.230 
came standard with that I always
thinking<00:04:58.800> with<00:04:58.919> disc<00:04:59.610> brakes<00:04:59.669> this<00:05:00.000> comes

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
thinking with disc brakes this comes

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.029 
thinking with disc brakes this comes
with<00:05:00.419> a<00:05:00.479> powerful<00:05:01.020> with<00:05:01.349> this<00:05:01.500> brakes<00:05:01.770> there's

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
with a powerful with this brakes there's

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.589 
with a powerful with this brakes there's
also<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.310> power<00:05:02.580> steering<00:05:03.090> which<00:05:03.210> is<00:05:03.360> really

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
also a power steering which is really

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.830 
also a power steering which is really
nice<00:05:04.820> what<00:05:05.820> else<00:05:05.970> oh<00:05:06.060> we<00:05:06.150> talked<00:05:06.389> about<00:05:06.510> power

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
nice what else oh we talked about power

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.170 
nice what else oh we talked about power
