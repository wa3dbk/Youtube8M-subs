00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
nice see the end if you it wasn't nice

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.190 
nice see the end if you it wasn't nice
you'd<00:01:05.390> have<00:01:05.480> to<00:01:05.600> pry<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:05.840> up<00:01:05.960> with<00:01:06.110> a

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
you'd have to pry it up with a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.170 
you'd have to pry it up with a
screwdriver<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.830> do<00:01:07.040> this<00:01:07.130> go<00:01:07.700> in<00:01:07.850> there<00:01:07.970> nice

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
screwdriver and do this go in there nice

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.780 
screwdriver and do this go in there nice
they'll<00:01:08.720> just<00:01:08.900> catch<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.350> edge<00:01:09.730> you<00:01:10.730> just

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
they'll just catch the edge you just

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.819 
they'll just catch the edge you just
take<00:01:11.180> this<00:01:11.420> thing

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.819 

you're<00:01:15.340> going<00:01:15.490> to<00:01:15.549> twist<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:16.320> until<00:01:17.320> that<00:01:17.590> ring
