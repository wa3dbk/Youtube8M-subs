a<00:00:40.559> little<00:00:41.540> little<00:00:42.540> starting<00:00:43.020> guide<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
a little little starting guide to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.150 
a little little starting guide to
installing<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.309> we'll<00:00:44.850> need<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:46.860> device

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
installing it we'll need that the device

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.569 
installing it we'll need that the device
itself<00:00:47.960> we<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:50.210> remote<00:00:52.399> comes<00:00:53.399> with<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
itself we have a remote comes with a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.689 
itself we have a remote comes with a
remote<00:00:53.789> that's<00:00:53.969> kind<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.210> cool<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:55.280> velcro<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
remote that's kind of cool and velcro I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.049 
remote that's kind of cool and velcro I
guess<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.660> put<00:00:58.170> somewhere<00:01:00.379> we've<00:01:01.379> got<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:02.070> kind

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
guess to put somewhere we've got a kind

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.000 
guess to put somewhere we've got a kind
of<00:01:03.769> wire<00:01:05.900> any<00:01:06.900> further<00:01:07.080> maybe<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> remote

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
of wire any further maybe for the remote

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.550 
of wire any further maybe for the remote
maybe<00:01:08.430> looks<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.150> has<00:01:09.240> an<00:01:09.360> infrared<00:01:09.659> bulb

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
maybe looks like it has an infrared bulb

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.240 
maybe looks like it has an infrared bulb
right<00:01:10.799> there

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
right there

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
right there
the<00:01:11.939> other<00:01:12.060> piece<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.450> velcro<00:01:12.659> so

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the other piece of the velcro so

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.490 
the other piece of the velcro so
attaches<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.369> I'm<00:01:14.909> guessing<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.810> attach<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
attaches so I'm guessing to attach the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.160 
attaches so I'm guessing to attach the
device<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:17.310> something<00:01:17.729> or<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.390> remote<00:01:18.689> I'm

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
device to something or the remote I'm

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.539 
device to something or the remote I'm
not<00:01:19.380> really<00:01:19.500> sure<00:01:20.540> comes<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.689> its<00:01:21.840> own

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
not really sure comes with its own

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.940 
not really sure comes with its own
triple-a<00:01:23.549> batteries<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.420> remote<00:01:24.680> we<00:01:25.680> get

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
triple-a batteries for the remote we get

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.200 
triple-a batteries for the remote we get
an<00:01:26.070> HDMI<00:01:26.880> cable<00:01:27.470> which<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:29.930> pretty<00:01:30.930> cool<00:01:32.210> we

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
an HDMI cable which is pretty cool we

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.539 
an HDMI cable which is pretty cool we
get<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:35.150> cable<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:39.020> coaxial<00:01:40.020> cable<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:41.130> for

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
get a cable a coaxial cable I think for

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.770 
get a cable a coaxial cable I think for
cable<00:01:42.030> cable<00:01:42.210> cable<00:01:43.020> cable<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.060> AC

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
cable cable cable cable and the AC

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.760 
cable cable cable cable and the AC
adapter<00:01:47.930> pretty<00:01:48.930> simple<00:01:49.229> stuff

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.460 

looking<00:01:52.770> at<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> adapter<00:01:53.430> itself<00:01:53.820> it's

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
looking at the adapter itself it's

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.420 
looking at the adapter itself it's
pretty<00:01:55.470> obvious<00:01:55.770> way<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:55.979> is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
pretty obvious way it is

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
pretty obvious way it is
we<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.469> mmm<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.850> your<00:02:00.000> cable<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
we have mmm we have your cable in to the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.999 
we have mmm we have your cable in to the
TV<00:02:01.649> or<00:02:02.000> HDMI<00:02:03.000> I'll<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.509> using<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.869> HDMI<00:02:04.009> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
TV or HDMI I'll be using the HDMI you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.310 
TV or HDMI I'll be using the HDMI you
have<00:02:05.189> your<00:02:05.369> channel<00:02:05.880> switcher<00:02:06.329> three<00:02:07.020> or<00:02:07.110> four

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
have your channel switcher three or four

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.609 
have your channel switcher three or four
you<00:02:08.009> have<00:02:08.039> your<00:02:08.399> IR<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.470> would

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
you have your IR in so that would

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.030 
you have your IR in so that would
probably<00:02:11.129> be<00:02:11.459> for<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.239> remote

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
probably be for the remote

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.789 
probably be for the remote
is<00:02:13.489> what<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.790> was<00:02:13.849> for<00:02:14.260> have<00:02:15.260> an<00:02:15.409> adapter<00:02:15.769> for

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
is what it was for have an adapter for

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.819 
is what it was for have an adapter for
that<00:02:16.069> and<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.060> power<00:02:17.359> source<00:02:17.659> it's<00:02:18.590> pretty

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
that and the power source it's pretty

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.399 
that and the power source it's pretty
cool<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.519> on<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.209> bottom<00:02:20.569> we<00:02:20.599> just<00:02:20.989> have<00:02:21.170> some

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
cool and on the bottom we just have some

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.500 
cool and on the bottom we just have some
serial<00:02:21.709> numbers<00:02:21.769> unit<00:02:22.310> numbers<00:02:22.609> and<00:02:22.969> MAC

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
serial numbers unit numbers and MAC

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.349 
serial numbers unit numbers and MAC
address<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:23.900> such<00:02:24.319> so<00:02:25.219> next<00:02:25.879> we're<00:02:26.180> just

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
address and such so next we're just

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.520 
address and such so next we're just
gonna<00:02:26.510> set<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.959> up<00:02:28.599> alright<00:02:29.599> I<00:02:29.659> set<00:02:30.140> up<00:02:30.170> the
