00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.750
 and faithful friend of cable visions cox us here with virginia lady 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.939
 night 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.389
 He opened us very nicely the doors of his house to show what is his 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:12.520
 birth sra 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.249
 what the outside is that messi min 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.840
 then the end in the walk of the Virgin Mary 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.410
 when more looking for this little bit of welcome while the houses for the nine 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.730
 months that's why they are 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.489
 nine months of pregnancy 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.489
 and it's eight days 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.489
 I wanted to find where to get to have Jesus 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.420
 despite this I think that the main reason for the birth 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.850
 Jesus birth 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.110
 since when you have the pressure to put what your birth already has 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.360
 like 38 years since my little daughters 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.850
 always before they were born I put it but he was born my children 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.960
 I have always put my birth 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.810
 I was also commenting 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.740
 so the lady was not commenting that this tradition also 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.130
 his children have been placed, he points out that what he thinks of what 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.110
 lately already it has already lost holes for example to my children always them 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.060
 inculcate 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.280
 that they put their birth before the little tree birth 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.440
 because it's a tradition that we have from Spain until my grandchildren put it 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.650
 because I have also been inculcated 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.700
 that they put their birth 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.000
 and see 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.420
 like this on 24 that some day of the child and put it at birth 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.979
 10 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.970
 I think the birth is the most beautiful 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.290
 in this case 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.690
 here what Christmas means 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.650
 for me it is the time when families must be more united 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.640
 he said that together we look for the legal way 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.520
 to be a little bit more happy to forget about our problems of 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.380
 make the dinner 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.380
 to thank God for a year more than ever 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.900
 he argues that he wants Christmas that our friends sent us disintegrates 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.190
 traditions 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.120
 I wish we could all and even be young 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.660
 make a seed of help one that is my son's girlfriend 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.260
 He's been helping me to put the birth and my grandchildren for four years 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.259
 we even made inns here 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.849
 when the children were kids making us between the 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.319
 neighbors the inns but turkey the three have 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.299
 we do not have a well 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.379
 nothing evil is the one that always wants to be 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.909
 chocano 'against the wind' acts why we put it in the parental corner foto 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.639
 ap the evil 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.799
 is that in this case in this birth 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.859
 in how you can see it 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.829
 we have what the representation of satan a thing that is good is 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.829
 really amazing to see the birth in 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.739
 no no 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.639
 in the representation of the birth of Jesus at Christmas 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.440
 as well as with the birth 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.499
