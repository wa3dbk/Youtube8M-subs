00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
wheel centered you just make sure that

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.330 
wheel centered you just make sure that
all<00:00:24.890> four<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:26.710> spaces<00:00:27.710> around<00:00:27.740> it<00:00:28.070> are<00:00:28.220> the

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
all four the spaces around it are the

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.300 
all four the spaces around it are the
right<00:00:28.460> are<00:00:29.029> exactly<00:00:29.540> the<00:00:29.720> same<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.619> I'm<00:00:31.160> gonna

and that way when I do this stem it'll
be<00:01:49.299> kind<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.630> shaded

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.470

bleed<00:02:20.570> in<00:02:20.870> there<00:02:21.080> so<00:02:21.320> I<00:02:21.350> want<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.770> dry<00:02:21.980> first

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.590 

one<00:02:28.280> nice<00:02:28.430> thing<00:02:28.640> about<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:28.940> water<00:02:29.210> as<00:02:29.450> it

one nice thing about this water as it
dries<00:02:29.810> pretty<00:02:30.020> fast

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.180 

but<00:02:44.989> I'm<00:02:45.080> not<00:02:45.230> in<00:02:45.349> a<00:02:45.379> real<00:02:45.530> hurry<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.890> put<00:02:46.069> the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.990 

this<00:03:15.230> is<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.440> part<00:03:15.650> where<00:03:15.860> you<00:03:16.070> even<00:03:16.820> if<00:03:16.910> you

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
this is the part where you even if you

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
this is the part where you even if you
don't<00:03:17.180> know<00:03:17.270> what<00:03:17.390> you're<00:03:17.540> doing<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.840> have<00:03:17.930> to

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
don't know what you're doing you have to

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.690 
don't know what you're doing you have to
pretend<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.410> know<00:03:18.530> what<00:03:18.560> you're<00:03:18.830> doing<00:03:19.040> and

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
pretend you know what you're doing and

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:58.260 
pretend you know what you're doing and
do<00:03:19.880> it<00:03:20.000> with<00:03:20.120> confidence

so<00:03:59.270> I<00:03:59.300> think<00:03:59.420> that's<00:03:59.720> done<00:03:59.990> I<00:04:00.020> don't<00:04:00.290> think<00:04:00.620> I'm

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
so I think that's done I don't think I'm

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.970 
so I think that's done I don't think I'm
gonna<00:04:00.860> put<00:04:01.130> any<00:04:01.310> more<00:04:01.520> on<00:04:01.760> that<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:03.650> just<00:04:03.680> dry

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
gonna put any more on that and just dry

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.440 
gonna put any more on that and just dry
enough<00:04:04.190> for<00:04:04.250> me<00:04:04.460> to<00:04:04.580> stand<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:05.000> up<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.300> throw

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
enough for me to stand it up and throw

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.560 
enough for me to stand it up and throw
it<00:04:05.540> to<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.750> without<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.680> running<00:04:07.360> one<00:04:08.360> thing<00:04:08.510> I
