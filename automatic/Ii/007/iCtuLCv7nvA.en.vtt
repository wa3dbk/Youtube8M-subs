looks at your profile that's what
they'll<00:00:31.710> see<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.160> at<00:00:32.279> first<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.640> was<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> little

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
they'll see so at first it was a little

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.220 
they'll see so at first it was a little
underwhelming<00:00:33.180> because<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.719> thought<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.079> is

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
underwhelming because I thought this is

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.389 
underwhelming because I thought this is
going<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.649> something<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.250> could

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
going to be something that we could

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.520 
going to be something that we could
change<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.880> game<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.570> okay<00:00:37.170> if<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.350> want

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
change in game it's like okay if I want

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.770 
change in game it's like okay if I want
to<00:00:37.559> play<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.100> new<00:00:38.340> Russian<00:00:39.059> support<00:00:39.300> guy<00:00:39.600> I

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
to play as the new Russian support guy I

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.900 
to play as the new Russian support guy I
can<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.260> now<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.370> purely

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
there is going to be a lot of building

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.090 
there is going to be a lot of building
fighting<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.030> lot<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.420> outdoor<00:01:21.990> long<00:01:22.500> lines<00:01:22.890> of

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
fighting a lot of outdoor long lines of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.499 
fighting a lot of outdoor long lines of
sight<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.549> then<00:01:23.700> when<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.090> inside<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
sight but then when you get inside the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.090 
sight but then when you get inside the
buildings<00:01:24.869> when<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:25.229> inside<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> I

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
buildings when you get inside like the I

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.160 
buildings when you get inside like the I
guess<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.150> would<00:01:27.270> call<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.600> courtyard

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
guess you would call like courtyard

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.359 
guess you would call like courtyard
stuff<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.950> mean<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> think

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
stuff like that I mean if you think

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.789 
stuff like that I mean if you think
about<00:01:29.579> strike<00:01:30.150> at<00:01:30.299> karkand<00:01:30.780> one<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
about strike at karkand one of the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.399 
about strike at karkand one of the
incomes<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.549> placed<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.970> think<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
incomes it's placed I think it's on the

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.690 
incomes it's placed I think it's on the
second<00:01:34.409> set<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.650> incomes<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.250> kind<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.520> by

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
second set of incomes it's kind of by

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.219 
second set of incomes it's kind of by
that<00:01:35.850> fountain<00:01:36.119> you're<00:01:36.689> gonna<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> lot<00:01:37.200> of

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
that fountain you're gonna have a lot of

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.690 
that fountain you're gonna have a lot of
areas<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.100> you'll<00:01:38.220> see<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.549> in

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
areas like that and you'll see that in

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.550 
areas like that and you'll see that in
some<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.030> footage<00:01:39.240> here<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:40.320> piece

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
some of this footage here and this piece

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.990 
some of this footage here and this piece
we're<00:01:40.770> actually<00:01:40.920> starting<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.579> here<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:41.909> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
we're actually starting with here it's a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.789 
we're actually starting with here it's a
long<00:01:42.270> corridor<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.049> there<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
long corridor so there is going to be a

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.289 
long corridor so there is going to be a
lot<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.130> corridor<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.670> much<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:45.060> Grand

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
lot of corridor as much like Grand

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.910 
lot of corridor as much like Grand
Bazaar<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.899> lot<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.259> car<00:01:46.470> cane<00:01:46.680> maps

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
Bazaar and a lot of the car cane maps

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.319 
Bazaar and a lot of the car cane maps
but<00:01:47.100> i'm<00:01:47.189> slowing<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.640> piece<00:01:47.880> down<00:01:48.060> right

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
but i'm slowing this piece down right

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.060 
but i'm slowing this piece down right
here<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.200> see<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> sea<00:01:49.649> flag<00:01:49.890> is

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
here you can see the sea flag is

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.800 
here you can see the sea flag is
actually<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.000> these<00:01:51.090> areas<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.720> i'm

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
actually on one of these areas that i'm

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.780 
actually on one of these areas that i'm
talking<00:01:52.200> about<00:01:52.259> car<00:01:52.680> cane<00:01:52.860> was<00:01:53.040> famous<00:01:53.610> for

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
talking about car cane was famous for

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.240 
talking about car cane was famous for
having<00:01:53.970> flags<00:01:54.479> there<00:01:55.079> are<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> center

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
having flags there are in like a center

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.590 
having flags there are in like a center
of<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.460> bunch<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.790> buildings<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.450> see

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
of a bunch of buildings and you can see

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.990 
of a bunch of buildings and you can see
a<00:01:57.630> lot<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.079> modified<00:01:58.500> vehicle<00:01:58.950> warfare<00:01:59.399> we

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
a lot of the modified vehicle warfare we

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.700 
a lot of the modified vehicle warfare we
can<00:02:00.240> see<00:02:00.479> some<00:02:00.689> Scout<00:02:00.930> chopper<00:02:01.229> stuff<00:02:01.560> and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
can see some Scout chopper stuff and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.200 
can see some Scout chopper stuff and
I'll<00:02:01.770> replay<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:02.969> another

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
I'll replay here so you can get another

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.090 
I'll replay here so you can get another
look<00:02:03.420> at<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:03.899> i<00:02:04.110> think<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.560> modified

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
look at it but i think the modified

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.440 
look at it but i think the modified
vehicle<00:02:05.460> warfare<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:05.939> going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.210> one<00:02:06.420> of

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
vehicle warfare is going to be one of

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.690 
vehicle warfare is going to be one of
the<00:02:06.540> coolest<00:02:06.960> parts<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.740> aftermath<00:02:08.069> dlc

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the coolest parts of the aftermath dlc

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.130 
the coolest parts of the aftermath dlc
and<00:02:08.879> it's<00:02:08.970> what's<00:02:09.209> got<00:02:09.390> me<00:02:09.539> really<00:02:09.690> exciting

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and it's what's got me really exciting

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.780 
and it's what's got me really exciting
oh<00:02:10.229> look<00:02:10.440> at<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.590> right<00:02:10.950> there<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.670> our

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
oh look at that right there this is our

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.360 
oh look at that right there this is our
first<00:02:12.060> glimpse<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.780> new<00:02:12.810> men

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
first glimpse of the new men

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.800 
first glimpse of the new men
machine<00:02:13.879> gun<00:02:14.120> that's<00:02:14.360> going<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.629> be<00:02:14.720> an

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
machine gun that's going to be an

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.960 
machine gun that's going to be an
aftermath<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.620> is<00:02:15.739> actually<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:16.069> 7-6<00:02:16.730> two

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
aftermath and this is actually a 7-6 two

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.759 
aftermath and this is actually a 7-6 two
chambered<00:02:17.420> round<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:18.140> I'm<00:02:18.230> guessing<00:02:18.530> that

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
chambered round so I'm guessing that

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.559 
chambered round so I'm guessing that
this<00:02:19.069> might<00:02:19.340> actually<00:02:19.549> end<00:02:19.790> up<00:02:20.030> doing<00:02:20.360> damage

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
this might actually end up doing damage

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.449 
this might actually end up doing damage
to<00:02:20.720> vehicles<00:02:21.319> as<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.620> can<00:02:21.739> see<00:02:21.920> he's<00:02:22.099> shooting

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
to vehicles as you can see he's shooting

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.530 
to vehicles as you can see he's shooting
at<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.640> vehicle<00:02:22.849> in<00:02:23.030> front<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.330> him<00:02:23.450> and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
at the vehicle in front of him and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.210 
at the vehicle in front of him and
actually<00:02:23.900> getting<00:02:24.080> hit<00:02:24.200> markers<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:25.159> I'm

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
actually getting hit markers so I'm

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.309 
actually getting hit markers so I'm
really<00:02:25.489> can<00:02:25.790> kind<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.569> intrigued<00:02:27.110> by<00:02:27.290> that

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
really can kind of intrigued by that

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.839 
really can kind of intrigued by that
because<00:02:27.769> it<00:02:27.890> appears<00:02:28.220> that<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.400> lot<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
because it appears that a lot of the

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.699 
because it appears that a lot of the
light<00:02:29.060> machine<00:02:29.390> guns<00:02:29.599> are<00:02:29.780> going<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:30.440> be<00:02:30.560> able

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
light machine guns are going to be able

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.640 
light machine guns are going to be able
to<00:02:31.010> do<00:02:31.310> damage<00:02:31.849> to<00:02:31.879> some<00:02:32.180> of<00:02:32.299> these<00:02:32.650> heavily

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
to do damage to some of these heavily

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.030 
to do damage to some of these heavily
modified<00:02:34.010> civilian<00:02:34.790> vehicles<00:02:35.269> which<00:02:36.040> could

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
modified civilian vehicles which could

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.589 
modified civilian vehicles which could
just<00:02:37.250> be<00:02:37.340> cars<00:02:37.610> with<00:02:37.849> armor<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.269> them<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.480> know

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
just be cars with armor on them you know

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.449 
shows the awesomeness of these cracked
out<00:02:57.319> buildings<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.769> know<00:02:57.890> they've<00:02:58.280> obviously

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
out buildings you know they've obviously

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.819 
out buildings you know they've obviously
just<00:02:58.970> been<00:02:59.150> destroyed<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.109> heavily<00:03:00.500> from

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
just been destroyed so heavily from

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.380 
just been destroyed so heavily from
these<00:03:01.010> earthquakes<00:03:01.220> but<00:03:01.700> then<00:03:01.849> you<00:03:01.940> look<00:03:02.120> out

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
these earthquakes but then you look out

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.119 
these earthquakes but then you look out
and<00:03:02.690> you've<00:03:03.019> got<00:03:03.140> these<00:03:03.319> wide-open<00:03:03.709> expanses

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
and you've got these wide-open expanses

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.339 
and you've got these wide-open expanses
you've<00:03:04.730> got<00:03:04.879> these<00:03:05.030> people<00:03:05.390> rushing<00:03:05.720> up<00:03:06.049> into

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
you've got these people rushing up into

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.960 
you've got these people rushing up into
the<00:03:06.470> buildings<00:03:06.859> and<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.400> think<00:03:07.579> this<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:07.730> going

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
the buildings and I think this is going

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.789 
the buildings and I think this is going
to<00:03:08.120> be<00:03:08.209> one<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.540> most<00:03:08.720> awesome<00:03:08.959> aspects<00:03:09.680> of

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.080 
to be one of the most awesome aspects of
the<00:03:09.890> game<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.129> think<00:03:10.459> one<00:03:10.700> thing<00:03:10.730> they've<00:03:11.060> done

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
of the the last two DLCs have been very

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.369 
of the the last two DLCs have been very
polarizing<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.720> know<00:03:35.840> we<00:03:35.959> got<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.200> close

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
quarters DLC which in my eyes catered to

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.479 
quarters DLC which in my eyes catered to
writing<00:03:39.379> Gunners<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:39.919> you<00:03:39.980> got<00:03:40.129> the<00:03:40.160> armored

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
writing Gunners and you got the armored

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.479 
writing Gunners and you got the armored
kill<00:03:40.669> dlc<00:03:40.879> that<00:03:41.329> kind<00:03:41.569> of<00:03:41.660> catered<00:03:42.019> to<00:03:42.290> the

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
kill dlc that kind of catered to the

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.129 
kill dlc that kind of catered to the
vehicle<00:03:43.489> guy<00:03:43.669> because<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.359> really<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:44.900> could

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
vehicle guy because it really you could

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.780 
vehicle guy because it really you could
not<00:03:45.349> be<00:03:45.500> successful<00:03:46.069> in<00:03:46.129> those<00:03:46.250> maps<00:03:46.459> without

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
not be successful in those maps without

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.879 
not be successful in those maps without
driving<00:03:47.209> around<00:03:47.510> in<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:48.079> vehicles<00:03:48.500> thus<00:03:48.739> the

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
driving around in the vehicles thus the

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.170 
driving around in the vehicles thus the
name<00:03:49.040> armored<00:03:49.340> kill<00:03:49.549> so<00:03:49.730> I<00:03:49.790> think<00:03:49.970> with<00:03:50.060> this

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
name armored kill so I think with this

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.490 
name armored kill so I think with this
DLC<00:03:50.569> it's<00:03:50.690> going<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.930> be<00:03:50.989> a<00:03:51.019> little<00:03:51.169> bit<00:03:51.319> for

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
DLC it's going to be a little bit for

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.930 
DLC it's going to be a little bit for
everyone<00:03:51.859> if<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.040> like<00:03:52.280> vehicles<00:03:52.699> there's

consider<00:03:58.310> yourself<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.849> infantry<00:03:59.329> man<00:03:59.510> who

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
consider yourself a infantry man who

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.059 
consider yourself a infantry man who
likes<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.109> play<00:04:00.290> assault<00:04:00.620> there's<00:04:00.859> going<00:04:01.010> to

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
likes to play assault there's going to

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.559 
likes to play assault there's going to
be<00:04:01.129> plenty<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.549> options<00:04:01.790> for<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.239> if<00:04:02.449> your

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
be plenty of options for that if your

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.089 
be plenty of options for that if your
support<00:04:02.959> guy<00:04:03.109> going<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.349> be<00:04:03.410> plenty<00:04:03.709> option<00:04:04.010> to

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
support guy going to be plenty option to

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.349 
support guy going to be plenty option to
that<00:04:04.250> so<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:04.459> think<00:04:04.669> it's<00:04:04.760> going<00:04:04.849> to<00:04:04.970> be<00:04:05.060> really

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
that so I think it's going to be really

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:06.550 
that so I think it's going to be really
balanced<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.019> that's<00:04:06.169> one<00:04:06.349> of<00:04:06.379> the<00:04:06.470> things

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
balanced and that's one of the things

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.650 
balanced and that's one of the things
that's<00:04:06.799> got<00:04:07.010> me<00:04:07.160> most<00:04:07.370> excited<00:04:07.519> for<00:04:07.849> so

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
that's got me most excited for so

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.930 
that's got me most excited for so
although<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.260> content<00:04:10.040> drop<00:04:10.310> was<00:04:10.549> a<00:04:10.579> tad

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
although the content drop was a tad

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.819 
although the content drop was a tad
underwhelming<00:04:11.239> I<00:04:11.690> did<00:04:11.900> enjoy<00:04:12.260> some<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.620> the

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
underwhelming I did enjoy some of the

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.409 
underwhelming I did enjoy some of the
new<00:04:12.980> wallpapers<00:04:13.639> that<00:04:13.819> I<00:04:13.879> can<00:04:14.060> now<00:04:14.150> use

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
new wallpapers that I can now use

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:15.640 
new wallpapers that I can now use
because<00:04:14.599> I<00:04:14.720> was<00:04:14.930> due<00:04:15.169> to<00:04:15.319> upgrade<00:04:15.620> my

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
because I was due to upgrade my

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.770 
because I was due to upgrade my
wallpaper<00:04:16.220> and<00:04:17.090> it<00:04:17.180> was<00:04:17.269> much<00:04:17.449> better<00:04:17.479> than

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
wallpaper and it was much better than

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.089 
wallpaper and it was much better than
the<00:04:17.959> art<00:04:18.109> booklet<00:04:18.500> at<00:04:18.620> least<00:04:18.739> in<00:04:18.889> my<00:04:19.010> opinion

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
the art booklet at least in my opinion

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.129 
the art booklet at least in my opinion
at<00:04:19.489> least<00:04:19.519> this<00:04:19.789> gave<00:04:20.060> us<00:04:20.209> something<00:04:20.449> cosmetic

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
at least this gave us something cosmetic

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.080 
at least this gave us something cosmetic
that<00:04:21.289> we'd<00:04:21.409> go<00:04:21.620> in<00:04:21.829> and<00:04:22.010> kind<00:04:22.159> of<00:04:22.280> kind<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.760> swag

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090
