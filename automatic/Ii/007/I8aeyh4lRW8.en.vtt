00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.850
 I'm here with one more health Wilson 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.520
 It's every twelve people here. 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.200

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.629
 I end here pod here I released there 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.160
 here the net player net got 75 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.739
 casualties with the gun 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.899
 here too the festive mood that an item 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.120
 that I won here when I bought the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.620
 Bonus when I bought my lap 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.649
 chile and also gurizada here 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.739
 here in the annexes is it I was 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.729
 using reddot here but I took the net 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.460
 dot got here I think I got better 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.260
 when because I had read the red dot 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.240
 so you put the muffler here 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.520
 It was one of the parts I played in 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.740
 play with silencer in the house of Ze as 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.770
 it is customary to place here a 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.810
 area silencer and here grip 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.220
 front that will improve your accuracy ok 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.259
 here in lethal secondary 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.530
 Do not put anything like I already told you in 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.549
 other videos I do not like using 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.159
 neither lethal nor tactical 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.970
 here in the parks guys here you go 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.210
 put here for you is to check 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.030
 faster recharge of your weapon, right? 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.880
 The sleight of hand, too, will they 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.280
 put here the marathon of the harvested area 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.000
 unlimited and I can only run and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.680
 tired and here too on the way people 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.899
 while they are running if they can 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.390
 avoid staying in your weapon without losing 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.520
 Speed also will put you here 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.580
 quick serve people who will be 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.500
 You will look faster more accurately. 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.380
 and ends up improving a lot 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.320
 You get a little piece here. 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.370
 quick serve for stable aim win I 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.580
 I use one of these two always okay but today 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.070
 I'm going to put the same fast serve here. 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.010
 and here too the resistance is needed 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.770
 put the focus always use the focus that the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.020
 Class oscillation will reduce water 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.700
 while you look right and you will have the lowest 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.500
 retreat when you are hit beauty and 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.110
 here you will put betting 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.350
 that every time you do respond 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.150
 You 'll win a random park right? 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.230
 guys or you'll win that silence 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.940
 mortal 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.310
 finally you will always win a reason 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.790
 from here random then always goes 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.390
 add a point 11 because the more is when 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.230
 you give the main focus on packages 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.520
 of attack 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.970
 I will not show why I 'm using 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.440
 here the simple same before 8 years I 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.970
 I'm spending platoon points.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.330
