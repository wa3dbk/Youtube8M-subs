00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.900
[Intro music]

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.900
Hi! Today I’m going to show you how to make

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.619
a knife pleated skirt with a hidden zipper.
So let’s begin!

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.939
So, the first thing you need to do is to take
your waist measurement just below the smallest

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.560
part of your waist, or where ever you want
your skirt to sit.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.410
My waist measurement is 30 inches. Multiply
this measurement by three add two inches to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.050
either side for the zipper and the seam allowance
and this will be the width of your fabric.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.150
The length will be however long you want your
skirt to be. Mine is 17 inches.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.500
Cut a piece of fabric out to this size.
Start making your measurements from 1 inch

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.530
in. This will allow you to insert a hidden
zipper later on. Make a mark along the fabric

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.030
every 3 inches until you reach the end of
your fabric. Your marks will go in a repeating

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.030
pattern. One, two, three, one, two, three.
Put a pin in every "one" mark.

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.460
To make a pleat, pinch the fabric at "one",
fold it over to "three", and remove the pin

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.799
from "one" and pin it in place.
Here’s how it looks from the opposite angle,

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.590
which might make this clearer. Pinch the fabric
at "one", fold it over to "three", remove the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.409
pin from "one", pin it in place. Continue doing
this all the way along your skirt.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.409
Once it’s all pinned up like this, sew using
a straight stitch in the opposite direction

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.780
from where you pleated it. This will make
sure that you won’t bunch up the pleats

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.780
on the other side of the fabric.
Then (and this is optional) you can sew down

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.020
each pleat, one or two inches.
On the bottom of the skirt (the edge without

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.619
the pleats) make a hem by folding this raw
edge up twice, and using a straight stitch,

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.679
stitch over the top. This is called a rolled
hem.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.310
Now, I should have ironed my skirt before
sewing it, but it doesn’t really matter.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.640
You can iron your pleats flat here too. Basically
though when in doubt, IRON EVERYTHING! :D

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.960
One last little thing is remember that 1 inch
you left free for the hidden zipper? Pin this

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.650
bit down out of the way so it won’t get
caught up when you sew on your waist band

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.370
and we’ll come back to this bit later.
Cut out another rectangle of fabric whose

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.310
dimensions are the same as the width of your
pleated skirt. So mine is 32 inches, and whose

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.560
height is about double the thickness that
you want your waist band to be. Fold this

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.000
in half length-ways, right sides together.
Then you ‘re going to do a straight stitch

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
right down the length like this, and then
turn the tube inside out when you are done,

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.569
and it’s a good idea to iron this flat.
Then place the waist band on top of the skirt

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.650
right sides together. Pin it on so it’s
lined to the top raw edge of the pleats. Attach

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.650
it to the skirt using a straight stitch, and
go slowly while you’re sewing here.

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:11.269
And that’s your waistband done!
Fold your skirt over rights sides together

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.060
so that the end with the raw edge hidden under
the pleat (that bit that you pinned out of

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.670
the way earlier) meets up with the raw edge
at the other end of the skirt.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.610
Pin these two together all the way down that
length. Match up the zipper next to the skirt,

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.819
and make a mark where the zipper ends. So
you would do a proper back-tack straight stitch

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.340
down this part of the skirt to attach these
two ends of the skirt together, but above

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.219
the mark you would just do a very long basting
stitch, which is a loose temporary stitch

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:47.969
to hold the fabrics together.
Press this seam open and place your zipper

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:54.860
face down on top of the seam. Line the zipper
teeth up with the seam, and pin it on one

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:01.860
side only. Then sew down the side that doesn’t
have the pins on it. When you get to the bottom,

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.239
remove the pins, and sew back up the other
side. So once you’ve sewn the zipper on,

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.909
the right side of your fabric skirt will look
like this. Bust the zipper out of there by

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:19.909
ripping apart the basting stitch that you
made before, and there’s your hidden zipper!

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.420
So you could add buttons in this step, but
I’m going to use press studs because they’re

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.900
really easy to add to a garment.
[Annotation: I also finished off the raw edges

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.460
of the waistband by folding them underneath,
and sewing across]

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.660
I’m going to figure out where I want my
press studs to go on the waistband so it will

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.100
close up the hidden zipper, and then I just
attach them using a needle and a thread.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.100
And so now my skirt closes up, awesome! And
this is the finished result.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.360
So that’s all there is to it, and if this
video helped you out then please give me a

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.100

see you guys in my next video.
