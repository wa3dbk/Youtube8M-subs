00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
actually turns on the dx6i to the buddy

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.500 
actually turns on the dx6i to the buddy
selection<00:04:10.310> okay<00:04:11.660> and<00:04:12.660> then<00:04:12.780> we<00:04:12.870> take<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:15.209> cord

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510

and plug it into the backs back of the
dx8<00:04:19.220> okay<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.780> turns<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.200> on

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.880 

and<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.700> says<00:04:26.940> slave<00:04:27.660> there<00:04:30.530> if<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:31.620> turn<00:04:31.770> the

and it says slave there if you turn the
power<00:04:32.040> on<00:04:32.190> now<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:33.210> becomes<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.690> master<00:04:35.090> so<00:04:36.090> we

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
power on now it becomes the master so we

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.420 
power on now it becomes the master so we
have<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.480> master<00:04:36.720> radio<00:04:37.050> here<00:04:37.650> on<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.980> dx8

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
have the master radio here on the dx8

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.780 
have the master radio here on the dx8
and<00:04:40.520> power<00:04:41.520> on<00:04:41.850> on<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:43.320> dx6i<00:04:43.770> that'll<00:04:44.640> be<00:04:44.700> the

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
and power on on the dx6i that'll be the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.540 
and power on on the dx6i that'll be the
slavery<00:04:45.470> so<00:04:47.270> we<00:04:48.270> actually<00:04:49.080> have<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.650> dx8

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
slavery so we actually have the dx8

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.490 
slavery so we actually have the dx8
programmed<00:04:51.120> or<00:04:52.020> be<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.440> bound<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:54.470> rch

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.190 
that thing just go rifling across my
garage<00:05:14.850> that'd<00:05:15.630> be<00:05:15.870> funny<00:05:16.110> one<00:05:16.320> time<00:05:17.030> so<00:05:18.200> with

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
garage that'd be funny one time so with

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.050 
garage that'd be funny one time so with
the<00:05:19.440> dx8<00:05:20.280> as<00:05:21.170> as<00:05:22.170> the<00:05:22.860> master<00:05:23.280> see<00:05:23.760> that<00:05:23.910> right

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
the dx8 as as the master see that right

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.600 
the dx8 as as the master see that right
there

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
there

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.720 
there
obviously<00:05:26.610> we<00:05:26.730> have<00:05:28.250> we<00:05:29.250> have<00:05:29.340> control<00:05:29.700> over

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
obviously we have we have control over

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:36.280 
obviously we have we have control over
everything<00:05:30.740> okay<00:05:33.440> so<00:05:34.440> that's<00:05:35.100> good<00:05:35.370> now<00:05:35.910> and

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
everything okay so that's good now and

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.000 
everything okay so that's good now and
you<00:05:37.290> see<00:05:37.470> with<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:38.100> slave<00:05:38.820> radio<00:05:39.210> I<00:05:39.510> mean<00:05:40.320> that

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
you see with the slave radio I mean that

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.140 
you see with the slave radio I mean that
does<00:05:41.220> nothing<00:05:41.419> okay<00:05:42.419> so<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.620> dx8<00:05:44.160> has<00:05:44.520> the

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
does nothing okay so the dx8 has the

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.690 
does nothing okay so the dx8 has the
trainer<00:05:45.590> that's<00:05:46.590> actually<00:05:46.950> a<00:05:46.980> button<00:05:47.280> up<00:05:47.520> here

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
trainer that's actually a button up here

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.730 
trainer that's actually a button up here
I<00:05:47.880> really<00:05:48.300> wish<00:05:48.480> that<00:05:48.510> this<00:05:48.810> was<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:49.050> switch

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
I really wish that this was a switch

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.130 
I really wish that this was a switch
like<00:05:50.580> on<00:05:50.730> the<00:05:50.820> dx6i<00:05:51.270> but<00:05:51.900> it's<00:05:52.440> not<00:05:54.140> been

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
like on the dx6i but it's not been

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.020 
like on the dx6i but it's not been
sitting<00:05:55.410> on<00:05:55.470> something<00:05:55.919> but<00:05:56.040> yeah<00:05:56.160> the<00:05:56.340> DXA<00:05:56.820> is

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
sitting on something but yeah the DXA is

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.909 
sitting on something but yeah the DXA is
a<00:05:57.390> push<00:05:57.750> button<00:05:57.780> I<00:05:58.230> think<00:05:58.590> that<00:05:58.740> was<00:05:58.890> a

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
a push button I think that was a

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.700 
a push button I think that was a
downfall<00:05:59.400> to<00:05:59.910> this<00:05:59.940> radio<00:06:00.270> but<00:06:00.720> you<00:06:01.320> know<00:06:01.410> if

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
downfall to this radio but you know if

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.290 
downfall to this radio but you know if
that<00:06:02.370> is<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.640> only<00:06:02.669> thing<00:06:02.940> I've<00:06:03.060> got<00:06:03.090> to

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.680 
that is the only thing I've got to
complain<00:06:03.600> about<00:06:03.750> I'll<00:06:04.200> just<00:06:04.260> shut<00:06:04.650> up<00:06:05.630> okay<00:06:06.630> so
