00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.250
 an image now an ecological image with the construction in a 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.420
 boat in the department of the Var yes reconcile ecology and navigation 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.380
 internet this is the goal that has set and controls a boat to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.290
 hybrid propulsion that is currently being manufactured career 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.290
 polished stone report of ideye franck cerutti 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.340
 At first glance 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.310
 the controls looks like another ship in its class at first glance 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.400
 only because on this 12-meter aluminum prologue 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.039
 able to navigate around the world all the materials were chosen in 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.060
 function of 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.520
 r very strict 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.420
 for example 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.740
 the cork that we took advantage of 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.900
 the binder 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.020
 which is used to hold the cork italy will talk about it again 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.960
 plywood he uses school which are they logical 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.060
 biodegradable 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.059
 and see it 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.269
 plywood 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.350
 after a traceability 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.450
 in the open sea the controls advance with a sail of case and surf both 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.670
 six-car engines 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.179
 at the harbor at anchor in the canals 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.350
 only the electric propulsion will be powered 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.010
 the generator 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.010
 is driven by the engine when it is in thermal mode 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.560
 like a dynamo that will recharge 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.140
 the departure of vatry 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.130
 there is more 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.290
 on the roof 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.350
 solar panels that will be used to reload by the crisis weirdly 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.840
 for 50 years with the advent of plastics for the industry 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.799
 nautical it is very little concerned with recycling issues 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.770
 in this area the controls i would like to show the way the c1 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.329
 we can as a designer manufacturer 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.049
 builder a thinker of broom boats in that sense 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.480
 but to make a 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.590
 maximum boats in front with the ecology and recyclability% and 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.670
 respect for the environment 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.140
 launching at the end of March controls then going to Greenland for 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.650
 a scientific mission 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.140
 on board of tanit 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.520
 four people 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.549
 and that's the end of a 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.279
 of this edition as every evening we will remember the main title
