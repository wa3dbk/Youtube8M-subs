00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.540
 Good morning, my name is gleison sou 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.690
 biology teacher in the last class to 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.689
 people talked about some types of 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.140
 passive transports and in today's class 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.090
 People are going to talk about the most 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.340
 before talking about celebrities 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.380
 it is important to discuss the concept of 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.760
 concentration of a solution 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.239
 what comes to be concentration 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 concentration 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.860
 is nothing more than a relationship he 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.980
 number of solutions and the quantity of 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.149
 absolute solvent is what is being 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.870
 developed in a solvent solution 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.719
 it is what is dissolving in terms 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.989
 of solvent biology for us always 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.170
 be the water there is no other solvent 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.080
 present in the human body based on 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.110
 amount of solvent solutions 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.549
 we can have two types of e-mail 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.390
 notice the following in this first figure 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:21.540
 in pink dots here we have 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.750
 represented our mourning in this 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.350
 first case the concentration and solute 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.479
 is much higher outside the cell 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.710
 we have a medium called the emperor tonic 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:41.130
 in the second case we have an amount 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:45.119
 dissolute within the cell 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.840
 as a few means the mourning we say 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.740
 that we say that this means is a means 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.640
 hypotonic now knowing the concepts 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.100
 let's understand what it is with the moles used 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.390
 this bigger figure here 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.540
 here I represent the quantities 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.979
 dissolved in rose and solvent in 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:14.210
 the inside and outside the cell 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:18.270
 please note the following quantities 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:22.440
 dissolute are the same within the cell 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.680
 inside and outside the amounts of solvent 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.210
 in turn are larger 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:34.040
 out of the cell, so what kind of 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.270
 I mean, I have out of my cell. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.560
 considering that I have a larger 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:44.780
 amount of solvents outside the cell 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.680
 we can say that it is a means and 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.500
 single potosi 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.450
 I have an amount in solvent the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.390
 implies that the concentration of this 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.260
 medium will be lower 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:01.160
 what is the tendency of 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:05.670
 movement of these solvent particles 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.489
 the trend is that she spoke as will the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.630
 region where there is more 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:16.709
 solvent to the region where the lowest 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.450
 amount of solvent or 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:27.290
 passage of the solvent particle 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:32.580
 will always occur in the sense of the medium - 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:36.230
 concentrated to the more concentrated medium 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.870
 This is the basic definition of osmosis. 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.780
 party tickets with the area solvent 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.040
 - concentrated to the most 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.160
 concentrated 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.780
 is a process of diffusion 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.430
 only in this case instead of the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.390
 mourning 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:58.260
 we have other solvent particles 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.560
 important point for us to know here is 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.320
 this here what will happen with a cell 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.299
 when I put her and photonic mail and the 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.500
 that will occur with the cell when I 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:13.560
 I put a year and a half hypersonic always 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:17.959
 that we put a jungle and a half 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:22.200
 hypotonic it tends to absorb the 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.160
 because the greater amount of water outside 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.420
 her 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:31.070
 whenever the cell was placed and half 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:35.400
 hypersonic the tendency to lose water 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.220
 here in the hypotonic environment is 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.410
 important to highlight animal cells or 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.310
 whether they have only the membrane 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.620
 plasma as an external wrap is 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.970
 absorb in large quantities of water 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.550
 may have their membrane ruptured 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.970
 plant cell in turn has a 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:01.740
 very rigid structure called a wall 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:04.950
 that protects this cell from 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:09.000
 rupture by more water to that absurd 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:10.070
 Osmosis Cellular Device Retains Cell 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.470
 inter 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.660
 these concepts are quite essential 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.550
 we will see that two basic examples of 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.310
 osmosis 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.740
 if you take a salad if you prepare 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.470
 a salad of lettuce and time to temper 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.470
 this salad at lunchtime but it will only 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.770
 eat this salad for dinner 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.770
 How do you get the lettuce leaf? 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.740
 she gets wilted because when you 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.290
 put salt vinegar olive oil 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.820
 you're making a medium out of 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:48.180
 very concentrated lettuce cell 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.580
 in these cases what happens if it has been 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.650
 placed and half per ton it loses 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.720
 right water 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:01.170
 now if you take that same sheet of paper 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.230
 lettuce and put it in pure water 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:08.070
 You'll be putting her in the middle. 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:10.410
 and toniko in that case the cell comes back 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.940
 absorb the water and returns to its 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.090
 initial 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:18.860
 Next class, let's talk about 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.860
 transport do not lose by 1 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:41.880
 The good of football show and welcome back 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.880
 to talk to soul world league
