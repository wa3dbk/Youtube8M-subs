00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
is to increase cheap vital energy chi

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.650 
is to increase cheap vital energy chi
Chi<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:42.130> best<00:03:42.310> way<00:03:42.519> we<00:03:42.730> can<00:03:42.910> translate

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
Chi that the best way we can translate

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.650 
Chi that the best way we can translate
that<00:03:43.900> is<00:03:44.139> vital<00:03:44.620> energy<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.730> force<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.389> life

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
that is vital energy the force of life

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.720 
that is vital energy the force of life
but<00:03:46.959> of<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.260> life<00:03:47.439> force

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
but of the life force

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.670 
but of the life force
so<00:03:49.239> that's<00:03:49.420> what<00:03:49.569> they<00:03:49.690> say<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.050> done<00:03:50.319> will

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
so that's what they say this done will

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.699 
so that's what they say this done will

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
don't think so bill I've tried it this

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.570 
don't think so bill I've tried it this
is<00:03:58.870> what<00:03:59.049> we'll<00:04:00.690> look<00:04:01.690> at<00:04:01.870> that<00:04:02.040> got<00:04:03.040> what's
