00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello everyone today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.510
 use editing with good what you have to 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.280
 do is download the file that lg in 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.280
 the link in the video section 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.120
 hello explains where 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.760
 download goat 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.540
 once loaded 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.540
 open the file the folder 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.940
 faith just like the side knows that I 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.100
 the desk is better 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.519
 archive 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.230
 but very well now we extract the 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.230
 files of the sierra 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:55.500
 here he works klÃ©ber already com 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.720
 Here where you say account we open it 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.120
 to jump that can not be opened that's 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.620
 because we have the antivirus activated what 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.260
 we have to activate because it detects the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.700
 antivirus as per the type of files 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.000
 but really nothing I always 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.020
 I did never pass now 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.609
 in my case the old age of 2012 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.609
 we deactivate that asset like this 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.649
 Once this is done we reread the 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.649
 file of the same 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.980
 then we open and there you are going to leave 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.720
 everything happens and now what we have to 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.980
 follow 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.980
 open the useful carlos 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.560
 very 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.030
 the first thing we have to do 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.030
 is to breed in a year 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.370
 profile 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.520
 do not 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.450
 accept box 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.450
 and we open it 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.210
 but not 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.360
 we look at the version that 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.640
 general to 1.5 can be set although here 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.470
 He says 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.580
 if they are set down to the right of the game 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.580
 tells you the version 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.020
 1.7 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.830
 we would do 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.400
 what we have to do now with 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.400
 14.7 and always 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.510
 you do not want to close but it does not matter 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.700
 as the both 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.210
 missing too much 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.239
 why 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.239
 my house is but it costs me is first 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.709
 but it has to be exactly the same 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.709
 I will have executed it 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.300
 and good, exactly the same 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.020
 let's go to the game 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.020
 a file 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.250
 and it opens 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.640
 and there 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.550
 let's open the game again though 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.550
 at 24 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.650
 you 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.880
 very well now the only thing that is missing from 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.370
 get to create the class and that would be 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.150
 all thank you very much 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.150
 see you
