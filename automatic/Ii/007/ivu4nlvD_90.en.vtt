00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.979 

we<00:00:02.490> think<00:00:02.730> of<00:00:02.909> water<00:00:03.150> is<00:00:03.420> an<00:00:03.570> ordinary

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:03.989 
we think of water is an ordinary

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:05.900 
we think of water is an ordinary
substance

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
substance

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.870 
substance
but<00:00:06.450> it's<00:00:06.899> anything<00:00:07.290> but<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:08.340> surprising

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
but it's anything but the surprising

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.789 
but it's anything but the surprising
truth<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.750> abundant<00:00:10.290> compound

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:10.799 
truth is that this abundant compound

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.940 
truth is that this abundant compound
doesn't<00:00:11.190> behave<00:00:11.490> clear<00:00:11.850> most<00:00:12.120> substances<00:00:12.950> and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
doesn't behave clear most substances and

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.770 
doesn't behave clear most substances and
its<00:00:14.160> chemical<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.730> physical<00:00:14.849> oddities<00:00:15.540> are

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
its chemical and physical oddities are

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.170 
its chemical and physical oddities are
the<00:00:16.379> key<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.800> its<00:00:16.950> role<00:00:17.220> as<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.490> matrix<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the key to its role as the matrix of

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.040 
the key to its role as the matrix of
life

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.480 

we<00:00:23.050> think<00:00:23.230> nothing<00:00:23.589> of<00:00:23.710> the<00:00:23.800> fact<00:00:23.980> that<00:00:24.250> ice

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
we think nothing of the fact that ice

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.589 
we think nothing of the fact that ice
floats<00:00:25.029> on<00:00:25.269> the<00:00:25.300> surface<00:00:25.599> of<00:00:25.869> water<00:00:27.599> that

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
floats on the surface of water that

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.540 
floats on the surface of water that
happens<00:00:29.019> because<00:00:29.349> water<00:00:29.619> expands<00:00:30.220> when<00:00:30.489> it

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
happens because water expands when it

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.049 
happens because water expands when it
freezes<00:00:31.349> increasing<00:00:32.349> its<00:00:32.470> volume<00:00:32.649> by<00:00:32.920> 9%<00:00:33.610> and

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
freezes increasing its volume by 9% and

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.560 
freezes increasing its volume by 9% and
becoming<00:00:34.690> less<00:00:34.930> dense<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.730> is<00:00:37.030> just<00:00:37.269> one<00:00:37.540> of

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
becoming less dense this is just one of

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.780 
becoming less dense this is just one of
waters<00:00:38.050> properties<00:00:38.559> that<00:00:38.890> sets<00:00:39.190> it<00:00:39.309> apart<00:00:39.430> as

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
waters properties that sets it apart as

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.130 
waters properties that sets it apart as
an<00:00:40.000> oddball<00:00:41.489> most<00:00:42.489> substances<00:00:43.000> unlike<00:00:43.809> water

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
an oddball most substances unlike water

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.520 
an oddball most substances unlike water
are<00:00:44.530> much<00:00:45.159> more<00:00:45.430> dense<00:00:45.790> in<00:00:46.120> their<00:00:46.420> solid<00:00:47.229> form

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
are much more dense in their solid form

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.399 
are much more dense in their solid form
than<00:00:47.890> in<00:00:48.100> their<00:00:48.309> liquid<00:00:48.550> form<00:00:49.079> glacial<00:00:50.079> acetic

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
than in their liquid form glacial acetic

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.549 
than in their liquid form glacial acetic
acid<00:00:51.129> is<00:00:51.309> an<00:00:51.550> example<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.269> that<00:00:52.479> here<00:00:53.140> we<00:00:53.350> have

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
acid is an example of that here we have

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.910 
acid is an example of that here we have
a<00:00:53.590> sample<00:00:54.190> of<00:00:54.309> its<00:00:54.940> solid<00:00:55.269> form<00:00:55.870> and<00:00:56.109> in<00:00:56.679> these

a sample of its solid form and in these

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.189 
a sample of its solid form and in these
beakers<00:00:57.489> we<00:00:58.000> have<00:00:58.179> a<00:00:58.210> sample<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:58.840> its<00:00:59.019> liquid

acts<00:01:04.390> very<00:01:05.019> differently<00:01:05.920> than<00:01:06.479> water<00:01:07.479> does

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
acts very differently than water does

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.969 
acts very differently than water does
yes<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.720> is<00:01:10.899> how<00:01:11.080> so-called<00:01:11.649> normal

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
yes this is how so-called normal

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.149 
yes this is how so-called normal
compounds<00:01:12.700> behave

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
compounds behave

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.080 
compounds behave
and<00:01:14.899> if<00:01:15.899> order<00:01:16.170> wasn't<00:01:16.380> such<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> rebel<00:01:17.090> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and if order wasn't such a rebel the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.920 
and if order wasn't such a rebel the
consequences<00:01:18.780> would<00:01:18.899> be<00:01:18.960> catastrophic<00:01:20.930> if

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
consequences would be catastrophic if

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.069 
consequences would be catastrophic if
water<00:01:22.259> behaved<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.950> most<00:01:23.250> substances<00:01:24.079> if

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
water behaved like most substances if

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.230 
water behaved like most substances if
frozen<00:01:25.470> water<00:01:25.979> were<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.579> dense<00:01:26.880> than<00:01:27.179> liquid

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
frozen water were more dense than liquid

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.649 
frozen water were more dense than liquid
water<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.320> every<00:01:28.890> year<00:01:29.310> when<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> pond<00:01:30.119> froze

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
water then every year when a pond froze

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.840 
water then every year when a pond froze
over<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.470> wouldn't<00:01:31.829> freeze<00:01:32.130> over<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.729> would

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
over it wouldn't freeze over it would

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.359 
over it wouldn't freeze over it would
freeze<00:01:33.179> under<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.530> ice<00:01:34.679> would<00:01:34.950> sink<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
freeze under and the ice would sink to

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.340 
freeze under and the ice would sink to
the<00:01:35.490> bottom<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> pond<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.569> then<00:01:37.020> build

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the bottom of the pond and then build

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.050 
the bottom of the pond and then build
its<00:01:37.560> way<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.979> from<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> bottom<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> top

its way up from the bottom to the top

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.760 
its way up from the bottom to the top

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
instead of from the top to the bottom

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.370 
instead of from the top to the bottom
all<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.729> life<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.450> pond<00:01:42.780> would<00:01:43.140> die

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
all the life in that pond would die

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.710 
all the life in that pond would die
because<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.490> wouldn't<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.850> any<00:01:45.270> liquid

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
because it wouldn't have any liquid

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.279 
because it wouldn't have any liquid
water<00:01:45.750> available<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.709> it<00:01:47.899> nothing<00:01:48.899> could

water available to it nothing could
survive<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.259> fact<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.679> ice<00:01:53.099> is<00:01:53.549> less

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.719 
survive so the fact that ice is less
dense<00:01:53.970> than<00:01:54.720> liquid<00:01:54.780> water<00:01:55.310> enables<00:01:56.310> life<00:01:56.520> to
