00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
raw honey I'm using raw but if you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.660 
raw honey I'm using raw but if you
really<00:01:31.650> wanted<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.189> could<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.400> try

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
really wanted to you could you try

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.580 
really wanted to you could you try
killer<00:01:32.909> honey<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:33.869> we're<00:01:34.020> using<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.470> I

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
killer honey and then we're using like I

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.469 
killer honey and then we're using like I
guess<00:01:34.799> half<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.250> teaspoon<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.790> honey<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.299> just

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
guess half a teaspoon of honey and just

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.910 
guess half a teaspoon of honey and just
putting<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.869> into<00:01:37.049> my<00:01:37.200> mixture<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.829> then

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
putting this into my mixture and then

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.100 
putting this into my mixture and then
mixing<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.600> then<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.869> should<00:01:40.020> get

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
mixing it so then you should get

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.770 
mixing it so then you should get

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
it listed on their blog and I thought

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.340 
it listed on their blog and I thought
this<00:03:06.670> was<00:03:06.820> an<00:03:06.970> awesome<00:03:07.180> idea<00:03:07.480> basically<00:03:07.989> the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
this was an awesome idea basically the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.220 
this was an awesome idea basically the
aspirin<00:03:08.830> is<00:03:09.010> good<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.489> get<00:03:09.970> rid<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.209> acne<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.110> if

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
aspirin is good to get rid of acne so if

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.690 
aspirin is good to get rid of acne so if
you<00:03:11.290> guys<00:03:11.410> have<00:03:11.620> acne<00:03:11.920> prone<00:03:12.100> skin<00:03:12.220> this<00:03:12.580> is

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
you guys have acne prone skin this is

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.699 
you guys have acne prone skin this is
going<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:12.910> be<00:03:13.000> one<00:03:13.270> of<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.420> macs<00:03:13.620> masks<00:03:14.620> that

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
going to be one of the macs masks that

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.220 
going to be one of the macs masks that
is<00:03:14.980> really<00:03:15.340> good<00:03:15.489> for<00:03:15.790> your<00:03:16.000> skin<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.810> this<00:03:17.110> is

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
is really good for your skin and this is

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.930 
is really good for your skin and this is
better<00:03:17.470> than<00:03:17.560> using<00:03:17.860> just<00:03:18.160> water<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.580> aspirin

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
better than using just water and aspirin

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.790 
better than using just water and aspirin
since<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.390> can<00:03:19.540> be<00:03:19.690> harsh<00:03:19.989> on<00:03:20.170> your<00:03:20.320> skin<00:03:20.380> and

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
since that can be harsh on your skin and

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.620 
since that can be harsh on your skin and
that's<00:03:20.950> why<00:03:21.130> we<00:03:21.340> substituted<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.180> with<00:03:22.330> green

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
that's why we substituted it with green

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.600 
that's why we substituted it with green
