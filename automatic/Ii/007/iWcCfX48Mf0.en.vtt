I'm going to show you one common problem
that<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.350> see<00:00:07.649> very<00:00:08.010> often<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.580> guitar<00:00:08.910> players

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
that I see very often in guitar players

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.180 
that I see very often in guitar players
picking<00:00:09.719> hand<00:00:09.900> that<00:00:10.530> prevents<00:00:10.980> them<00:00:11.130> from

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
picking hand that prevents them from

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.129 
picking hand that prevents them from
improving<00:00:12.059> their<00:00:12.179> picking<00:00:12.480> technique<00:00:12.840> and

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
improving their picking technique and

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.709 
improving their picking technique and
building<00:00:13.920> speed<00:00:14.160> specifically<00:00:14.790> I'm<00:00:15.450> going<00:00:15.509> to

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719

and instantly improve your guitar

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.900 
and instantly improve your guitar
playing<00:00:22.529> after<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.310> few<00:00:23.340> weeks<00:00:23.670> of

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
playing after just a few weeks of

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.700 
playing after just a few weeks of
implementing<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.539> new<00:00:25.080> solution<00:00:25.529> into<00:00:25.680> your

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
implementing the new solution into your

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.640 
implementing the new solution into your
playing<00:00:26.510> the<00:00:27.510> problem<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.050> caused<00:00:28.289> by<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
playing the problem is caused by the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.769 
playing the problem is caused by the
lack<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.189> economy<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.910> motion<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> picking

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
lack of economy of motion in the picking

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.049 
lack of economy of motion in the picking
hand<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.199> specifically<00:00:32.130> it's<00:00:32.489> caused<00:00:32.730> during

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
hand and specifically it's caused during

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.299 
hand and specifically it's caused during
the<00:00:33.300> fall<00:00:33.570> through<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.290> happens<00:00:34.649> after<00:00:35.130> each

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the fall through that happens after each

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.819 
the fall through that happens after each
note<00:00:35.750> what's<00:00:36.750> supposed<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.230> happen<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
note what's supposed to happen is that

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.900 
note what's supposed to happen is that
after<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.489> play<00:00:38.700> let's<00:00:39.030> say<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> Down<00:00:39.510> stroke

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
after you play let's say a Down stroke

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.610 
after you play let's say a Down stroke
the<00:00:41.910> pig<00:00:42.120> simply<00:00:42.510> moves<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.290> straight<00:00:43.590> line

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the pig simply moves in a straight line

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.000 
the pig simply moves in a straight line
down<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.969> now<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.420> between<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.870> low<00:00:46.469> E<00:00:46.500> and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
down and is now in between the low E and

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.220 
down and is now in between the low E and
the<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> strings<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.450> ready<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.020> either

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the a strings and it's ready to either

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.470 
the a strings and it's ready to either
go<00:00:49.590> back<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.070> play<00:00:50.190> an<00:00:50.309> upstroke<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> low

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
go back and play an upstroke on the low

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.750 
go back and play an upstroke on the low
E<00:00:51.510> string<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.680> continue<00:00:53.160> playing<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
E string or to continue playing on the a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.970 
E string or to continue playing on the a
string<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.360> then<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.199> same<00:00:55.410> thing<00:00:55.440> happens

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
string and then the same thing happens

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.920 
string and then the same thing happens
when<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.190> play<00:00:56.370> an<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.270> pic<00:00:57.480> moves<00:00:57.750> in

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
when you play an up so the pic moves in

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.910 
when you play an up so the pic moves in
a<00:00:57.989> straight<00:00:58.230> line<00:00:58.260> up<00:01:00.079> but<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.230> problem<00:01:01.739> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
a straight line up but the problem is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.579 
a straight line up but the problem is
when<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> pig<00:01:03.300> does<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:03.840> move<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> straight

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
when the pig does not move in a straight

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
when the pig does not move in a straight
line<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.129> instead<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.000> bounces<00:01:06.570> away<00:01:06.689> from

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
line and instead it bounces away from

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.520 
line and instead it bounces away from
the<00:01:07.110> strings<00:01:07.409> something<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:09.530> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the strings something like this and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.350 
the strings something like this and
therefore<00:01:10.680> an<00:01:10.890> upstroke<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.729> this

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
therefore an upstroke it's like this

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.140 
therefore an upstroke it's like this
and<00:01:14.260> now<00:01:14.440> if<00:01:14.620> you<00:01:14.890> expand<00:01:15.490> this<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:15.910> try<00:01:16.090> to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
and now if you expand this and try to

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.780 
and now if you expand this and try to
apply<00:01:16.690> this<00:01:17.020> sloppy<00:01:17.530> inefficient<00:01:18.190> motion<00:01:18.580> to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
apply this sloppy inefficient motion to

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.760 
apply this sloppy inefficient motion to
playing<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.330> scale<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:20.140> picking<00:01:20.440> hand<00:01:20.560> will

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
playing a scale the picking hand will

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:34.470 
playing a scale the picking hand will
look<00:01:20.920> something<00:01:21.130> like<00:01:21.250> this<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.940> now<00:01:34.090> compare

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
look something like this and now compare

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.270 
look something like this and now compare
that<00:01:34.510> with<00:01:35.020> much<00:01:35.260> more<00:01:35.500> efficient<00:01:36.040> picking

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
that with much more efficient picking

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.520 
that with much more efficient picking
hand<00:01:36.430> motion<00:01:36.880> where<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.810> pic<00:01:38.020> moves<00:01:38.260> in<00:01:38.440> a

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
the issue at hand when you train your

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.380 
the issue at hand when you train your
picking<00:02:09.800> hand<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.310> move<00:02:10.490> in<00:02:10.760> this<00:02:10.940> much<00:02:11.180> more

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
picking hand to move in this much more

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.480 
picking hand to move in this much more
efficient<00:02:11.810> way<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.110> having<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.740> pick<00:02:12.920> move<00:02:13.190> in

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
efficient way of having the pick move in

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.090 
efficient way of having the pick move in
a<00:02:13.790> straight<00:02:14.090> path<00:02:14.360> instead<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.380> bouncing<00:02:16.010> away

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
a straight path instead of bouncing away

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.190 
a straight path instead of bouncing away
from<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.430> strings<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:17.570> will<00:02:17.810> be<00:02:17.900> very

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
from the strings it will be very

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.570 
from the strings it will be very
beneficial<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.770> your<00:02:18.920> playing<00:02:19.190> for<00:02:19.430> two

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
beneficial to your playing for two

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.610 
beneficial to your playing for two
reasons<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.720> first<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.230> most<00:02:21.350> obvious

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
reasons the first and the most obvious

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.950 
reasons the first and the most obvious
reason<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.370> it's<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:23.150> much<00:02:23.360> easier<00:02:23.780> to

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
reason is that it's so much easier to

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.870 
reason is that it's so much easier to
build<00:02:24.110> speed<00:02:24.500> where<00:02:25.070> your<00:02:25.250> pig<00:02:25.460> doesn't<00:02:25.790> have

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
build speed where your pig doesn't have

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.760 
build speed where your pig doesn't have
to<00:02:26.000> travel<00:02:26.360> nearly<00:02:26.600> as<00:02:26.870> much<00:02:27.080> for<00:02:27.350> each<00:02:27.470> note

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
to travel nearly as much for each note

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:37.130 
to travel nearly as much for each note
to<00:02:28.040> produce<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.520> same<00:02:28.700> sound

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.840 

and<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.290> second<00:02:38.620> reason<00:02:38.740> is<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.430> if<00:02:39.700> your

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
and the second reason is that if your

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.520 
and the second reason is that if your
pig<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.090> bouncing<00:02:40.780> away<00:02:40.960> from<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.290> strings

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
pig is bouncing away from the strings

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.520 
pig is bouncing away from the strings
like<00:02:41.680> this<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:46.690> going<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:46.990> much<00:02:47.230> more

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
like this it's going to be much more

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.020 
like this it's going to be much more
difficult<00:02:47.800> for<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.430> keep<00:02:48.580> your<00:02:48.760> plane

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
difficult for you to keep your plane

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.390 
difficult for you to keep your plane
clean<00:02:49.480> since<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.320> pig<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.710> moving<00:02:51.130> away<00:02:51.220> from

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
clean since the pig is moving away from

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.910 
clean since the pig is moving away from
the<00:02:51.700> strings<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.330> between<00:02:52.720> notes<00:02:52.960> leaving<00:02:53.800> the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
the strings in between notes leaving the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.040 
the strings in between notes leaving the
strings<00:02:54.220> more<00:02:54.640> exposed<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.420> free<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.810> wring

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
strings more exposed and free to wring

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.590 
strings more exposed and free to wring
out<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:57.520> solution<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:57.940> this<00:02:58.120> issue<00:02:58.330> is

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
out and the solution to this issue is

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.780 
out and the solution to this issue is
actually<00:02:58.960> quite<00:02:59.200> simple<00:02:59.470> all<00:03:00.100> you<00:03:00.340> have<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.640> do

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
actually quite simple all you have to do

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.670 
actually quite simple all you have to do
if<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.270> have<00:03:01.480> this<00:03:01.660> problem<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.470> tape

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
if you have this problem of the tape

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.010 
if you have this problem of the tape
bouncing<00:03:03.280> away<00:03:03.400> from<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.760> strings<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.270> number

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
bouncing away from the strings is number

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.770 
bouncing away from the strings is number
one<00:03:05.230> become<00:03:05.830> aware<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.490> by<00:03:06.880> looking<00:03:07.660> at

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
one become aware of it by looking at

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.360 
one become aware of it by looking at
your<00:03:07.900> picking<00:03:08.170> hand<00:03:08.230> when<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.710> practice<00:03:09.220> and

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
your picking hand when you practice and

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.580 
your picking hand when you practice and
observing<00:03:09.820> what's<00:03:10.000> happening<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.690> number

observing what's happening and number

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.980 
observing what's happening and number
two<00:03:11.830> simply<00:03:12.580> train<00:03:12.910> your<00:03:13.180> picking<00:03:13.480> hand<00:03:13.660> to

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
two simply train your picking hand to

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.770 
two simply train your picking hand to
not<00:03:14.320> do<00:03:14.740> this<00:03:14.950> motion<00:03:15.250> from<00:03:15.520> now<00:03:15.730> on<00:03:16.000> instead

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
not do this motion from now on instead

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.720 
not do this motion from now on instead

practice making the pick motions in a

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.380 
practice making the pick motions in a
more<00:03:23.260> straight<00:03:23.650> downward<00:03:24.430> path<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.060> upward

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
more straight downward path and upward

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.630 
more straight downward path and upward
path<00:03:25.570> when<00:03:25.870> playing<00:03:26.170> up<00:03:26.350> strokes<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.920> if<00:03:27.520> you

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
path when playing up strokes and if you

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.070 
path when playing up strokes and if you
do<00:03:27.760> this<00:03:27.880> over<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.150> course<00:03:28.360> of<00:03:28.540> several<00:03:28.750> weeks

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
do this over the course of several weeks

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.080 
do this over the course of several weeks
and<00:03:29.350> multiple<00:03:29.710> practice<00:03:30.160> sessions<00:03:30.550> you<00:03:30.970> will

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
and multiple practice sessions you will

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.520 
and multiple practice sessions you will
notice<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.600> your<00:03:31.690> playing<00:03:31.990> is<00:03:32.170> going<00:03:32.290> to

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
notice that your playing is going to

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.710 
notice that your playing is going to
start<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.040> feel<00:03:33.250> much<00:03:33.460> easier<00:03:33.970> than<00:03:34.120> before

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
start to feel much easier than before

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.210 
start to feel much easier than before
it<00:03:34.960> will<00:03:35.080> be<00:03:35.200> cleaner<00:03:35.530> it'll<00:03:35.950> be<00:03:36.010> more

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
it will be cleaner it'll be more

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.130 
it will be cleaner it'll be more
accurate<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:36.910> your<00:03:37.180> speed<00:03:37.510> is<00:03:37.690> going<00:03:37.900> to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
accurate and your speed is going to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.680 
accurate and your speed is going to
increase<00:03:38.710> as<00:03:38.890> well<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:40.150> that's<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.480> for<00:03:40.600> this

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
increase as well so that's it for this

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.600 
increase as well so that's it for this
