00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
everything we can here to not only take

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.469 
everything we can here to not only take
care<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> soil<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.250> build<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
care of the soil but to build on it and

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.620

to<00:01:09.600> create<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.049> whole<00:01:10.439> world<00:01:10.799> underground<00:01:11.630> one

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
to create a whole world underground one

to create a whole world underground one
of<00:01:12.719> the<00:01:12.810> new<00:01:12.990> things<00:01:13.319> you've<00:01:13.530> got<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.979> think

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
of the new things you've got I think

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:15.950 
of the new things you've got I think
involves<00:01:14.909> woodchips<00:01:15.299> because<00:01:15.479> that's<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.749> huge

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
involves woodchips because that's a huge

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.480 
involves woodchips because that's a huge
piles<00:01:16.319> up<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.710> tell<00:01:16.920> me<00:01:16.950> how<00:01:17.219> you're

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
piles up and tell me how you're

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.419 
piles up and tell me how you're
incorporating<00:01:17.850> those<00:01:18.299> there's<00:01:19.109> a<00:01:19.200> cool<00:01:20.130> new

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
incorporating those there's a cool new

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.719 
incorporating those there's a cool new
system<00:01:20.939> based<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.869> mushroom<00:01:22.499> and<00:01:22.770> fungi<00:01:23.310> now

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
system based on mushroom and fungi now

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.349 
system based on mushroom and fungi now
of<00:01:23.909> course

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:24.359 
of course

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.529 
of course
mushrooms<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.170> new<00:01:25.469> but<00:01:26.340> we've<00:01:27.209> learned

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
mushrooms are not new but we've learned

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.279 
mushrooms are not new but we've learned
to<00:01:27.899> appreciate<00:01:28.649> and<00:01:29.039> to<00:01:29.179> kind<00:01:30.179> of<00:01:30.240> harvest<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
to appreciate and to kind of harvest the

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.039 
to appreciate and to kind of harvest the
power<00:01:31.499> of<00:01:31.829> mushrooms<00:01:32.399> so<00:01:33.090> what<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.420> do<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.749> lay

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
power of mushrooms so what we do is lay

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.940 
power of mushrooms so what we do is lay
out<00:01:34.189> thick<00:01:35.189> layers<00:01:35.609> of<00:01:35.850> woodchips<00:01:36.539> and<00:01:37.079> those

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
out thick layers of woodchips and those

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.309 
out thick layers of woodchips and those
wood<00:01:38.189> chips<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.609> are<00:01:38.819> inoculated<00:01:39.319> with

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
wood chips that are inoculated with

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.980 
wood chips that are inoculated with
spawn<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.429> different<00:01:42.029> mushrooms<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.869> we're

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
spawn of different mushrooms and we're

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.069 
spawn of different mushrooms and we're
using<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.380> native<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.069> those<00:01:44.939> mushrooms<00:01:45.779> over

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
using a native one those mushrooms over

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.769 
using a native one those mushrooms over
the<00:01:46.289> course<00:01:46.529> of<00:01:46.709> 18<00:01:47.130> months<00:01:47.279> to<00:01:47.520> two<00:01:47.700> years

the course of 18 months to two years

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:51.379 
the course of 18 months to two years
basically<00:01:48.779> eat<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.859> woodchips<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.729> leave<00:01:51.149> us

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:51.389 
basically eat the woodchips and leave us

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:53.419 
basically eat the woodchips and leave us
with<00:01:51.779> about<00:01:51.929> an<00:01:52.229> inch<00:01:52.409> layer<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.950> this

cover crops are something that are

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.870 
cover crops are something that are
really<00:01:57.810> becoming<00:01:58.439> more<00:01:58.740> important<00:01:59.249> and<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.639> see

really becoming more important and I see

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.370 
really becoming more important and I see
a<00:01:59.909> variety<00:02:00.179> some<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.990> which<00:02:01.109> are<00:02:01.229> pretty

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
a variety some of which are pretty

we use parsley and turnips orange cosmos
there's<00:02:16.019> a<00:02:16.079> whole<00:02:16.439> lot<00:02:16.769> of<00:02:16.890> new<00:02:17.040> research<00:02:17.250> like

there's a whole lot of new research like

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.460 
there's a whole lot of new research like
a<00:02:17.970> lot<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.269> this<00:02:18.390> came<00:02:18.569> from<00:02:18.720> Clemson<00:02:19.019> that

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
a lot of this came from Clemson that

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.949 
a lot of this came from Clemson that
shows<00:02:20.069> that<00:02:20.420> turnips

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
shows that turnips

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.170 
shows that turnips
Swiss<00:02:22.680> chard<00:02:23.040> all<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.670> things<00:02:23.939> in<00:02:24.150> that

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
Swiss chard all the things in that

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.229 
Swiss chard all the things in that
family<00:02:24.959> actually<00:02:25.620> produce<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.400> gas<00:02:26.700> from<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
family actually produce a gas from the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.440 
family actually produce a gas from the
roots<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.900> inhibit<00:02:28.530> nematodes<00:02:29.189> so<00:02:30.090> not<00:02:30.299> only

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
roots that inhibit nematodes so not only

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.229 
roots that inhibit nematodes so not only
are<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.810> kind<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.349> cleaning<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:32.040> soil<00:02:32.370> but

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
are we kind of cleaning the soil but

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.259 
are we kind of cleaning the soil but
when<00:02:33.540> those<00:02:33.689> crops<00:02:34.079> are<00:02:34.370> dying<00:02:35.370> then<00:02:35.849> we<00:02:36.090> just

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
when those crops are dying then we just

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.119 
when those crops are dying then we just
chop<00:02:36.569> them<00:02:36.720> up<00:02:36.840> on-site<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.560> they<00:02:37.620> become

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
chop them up on-site and they become

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.640 
chop them up on-site and they become
what<00:02:38.400> we<00:02:38.430> call<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.909> chop<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.329> drop<00:02:39.450> mulch<00:02:39.870> all

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
what we call it chop and drop mulch all

what we call it chop and drop mulch all
this<00:02:41.040> work<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.519> being<00:02:41.819> doing<00:02:41.970> primarily<00:02:42.629> for

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
this work is being doing primarily for

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.880 
this work is being doing primarily for
one<00:02:44.150> beautiful<00:02:45.150> plant<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.840> has<00:02:46.230> existed<00:02:46.590> in

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
one beautiful plant that has existed in

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.619 
one beautiful plant that has existed in
gardens<00:02:47.220> for<00:02:47.370> generations<00:02:47.939> when<00:02:48.359> did<00:02:48.540> you

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
gardens for generations when did you

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.500 
gardens for generations when did you
first<00:02:48.870> encounter<00:02:49.079> crimes<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.280> what<00:02:51.120> got<00:02:51.299> you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
first encounter crimes and what got you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.699 
first encounter crimes and what got you
so<00:02:51.689> fascinated<00:02:52.230> by<00:02:52.260> them

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
so fascinated by them

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.809 
so fascinated by them
my<00:02:52.890> first<00:02:53.310> crinum<00:02:53.879> I<00:02:54.980> acquired<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.340> guess<00:02:56.549> when

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
my first crinum I acquired I guess when

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.720 
my first crinum I acquired I guess when
we<00:02:56.849> moved<00:02:57.239> here<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.870> early<00:02:58.019> 70s<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.519> now

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
we moved here in the early 70s and I now

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.849 
we moved here in the early 70s and I now
know<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.329> had<00:03:00.480> been<00:03:00.690> here<00:03:01.049> about<00:03:01.379> 50

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
know that it had been here about 50

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.250 
know that it had been here about 50
years<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.730> maybe<00:03:02.909> in<00:03:03.090> flower<00:03:03.299> today<00:03:03.599> Amanda

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
years and maybe in flower today Amanda

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.349 
years and maybe in flower today Amanda
so<00:03:04.409> that<00:03:04.560> means<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.069> bulb<00:03:05.609> that<00:03:06.090> one

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
so that means that that bulb that one

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.259 
so that means that that bulb that one
crinum<00:03:06.870> lily<00:03:07.109> bulb<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.709> over<00:03:08.370> 80<00:03:08.609> years<00:03:09.060> old

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
crinum lily bulb is over 80 years old

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.750 
crinum lily bulb is over 80 years old
there's<00:03:10.139> something<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:11.010> me<00:03:11.189> that's<00:03:11.489> I'm

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
there's something to me that's I'm

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.839 
there's something to me that's I'm
really<00:03:12.299> beautiful<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.849> sustainable

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
really beautiful and and sustainable

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.089 
really beautiful and and sustainable
about<00:03:15.420> something<00:03:15.959> that<00:03:16.139> can<00:03:16.409> live<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.189> long

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
about something that can live so long

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.530 
about something that can live so long
have<00:03:20.099> such<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.400> massive<00:03:21.120> underground

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
have such a massive underground

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.309 
have such a massive underground
structure<00:03:22.470> go<00:03:23.340> away<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.359> winter<00:03:24.389> time<00:03:24.900> and

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
structure go away in the winter time and

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.020 
structure go away in the winter time and
then<00:03:25.530> come<00:03:25.799> back<00:03:25.829> up<00:03:26.010> with<00:03:26.459> this<00:03:26.639> like

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
then come back up with this like

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.689 
then come back up with this like
ephemeral<00:03:27.959> kind<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.530> fragile<00:03:28.769> beauty<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.579> the

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
ephemeral kind of fragile beauty in the

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:30.470 
ephemeral kind of fragile beauty in the
summer<00:03:29.970> time

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
summer time

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.750 
summer time
and<00:03:30.569> one<00:03:31.319> thing<00:03:31.590> about<00:03:31.739> crichton's<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.519> think

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
and one thing about crichton's I think

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.629 
and one thing about crichton's I think
that<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.150> they're<00:03:33.480> very<00:03:33.510> pest<00:03:34.230> resistant<00:03:35.220> have

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
that is they're very pest resistant have

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.550 
that is they're very pest resistant have
very<00:03:35.879> few<00:03:36.090> diseases<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.780> in<00:03:37.169> all<00:03:37.349> of<00:03:37.379> your

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
very few diseases and in all of your

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.110 
very few diseases and in all of your
gardens<00:03:38.129> that<00:03:38.280> sounds<00:03:38.609> like<00:03:38.760> sustainability

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
gardens that sounds like sustainability

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.289 
gardens that sounds like sustainability
do<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.900> try<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.889> design<00:03:41.400> gardens<00:03:41.909> that<00:03:42.090> can

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
do you try to design gardens that can

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.689 
do you try to design gardens that can
exist<00:03:42.780> with<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.620> least<00:03:43.859> amount<00:03:44.159> of<00:03:44.310> input

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
exist with the least amount of input

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.580 
exist with the least amount of input
after<00:03:45.030> they're<00:03:45.150> established<00:03:45.690> oh<00:03:45.959> yeah<00:03:46.560> I

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
after they're established oh yeah I

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.229 
after they're established oh yeah I
think<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:47.010> critical<00:03:47.519> I<00:03:47.639> think<00:03:47.849> our<00:03:48.000> whole

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
think it's critical I think our whole

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.659 
think it's critical I think our whole
landscape<00:03:48.959> industry<00:03:49.530> is<00:03:49.769> moving<00:03:50.040> toward<00:03:50.579> that

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
landscape industry is moving toward that

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.819 
landscape industry is moving toward that
and<00:03:50.909> has<00:03:51.449> to<00:03:51.629> move<00:03:51.840> toward<00:03:52.139> that<00:03:52.199> and<00:03:52.620> that's

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
and has to move toward that and that's

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.670 
and has to move toward that and that's
um<00:03:53.129> that's<00:03:53.430> what<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:54.359> get<00:03:54.419> to<00:03:54.629> use<00:03:54.989> this<00:03:55.319> place

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
um that's what I get to use this place

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.159 
um that's what I get to use this place
as<00:03:56.010> kind<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.579> laboratory<00:03:56.819> so<00:03:57.449> I<00:03:57.479> try<00:03:57.900> all

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
as kind of a laboratory so I try all

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.379 
as kind of a laboratory so I try all
different<00:03:58.349> things<00:03:58.739> here<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.489> then<00:04:00.060> when<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.269> do

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
different things here and then when I do

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.979 
different things here and then when I do
a<00:04:00.510> garden<00:04:01.019> design<00:04:01.440> either<00:04:02.400> public<00:04:03.000> or<00:04:03.030> for<00:04:03.959> a

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
a garden design either public or for a

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.890 
a garden design either public or for a

have they're one of the few things that

have they're one of the few things that
you<00:04:37.680> see<00:04:37.889> left<00:04:38.130> over<00:04:38.490> on<00:04:38.610> old<00:04:38.820> farms<00:04:39.389> and

the<00:04:43.169> challenge<00:04:43.650> is<00:04:43.770> just<00:04:43.830> physical<00:04:44.610> you<00:04:44.940> know

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
the challenge is just physical you know

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.700 
the challenge is just physical you know
because<00:04:45.330> these<00:04:45.479> are<00:04:45.660> massive<00:04:45.930> things<00:04:46.470> that

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
because these are massive things that

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.390 
because these are massive things that
can<00:04:46.889> weigh<00:04:47.010> hundreds<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.550> pounds<00:04:48.979> but<00:04:49.979> we<00:04:50.190> do

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
can weigh hundreds of pounds but we do

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.500 
can weigh hundreds of pounds but we do
it<00:04:50.520> all<00:04:50.729> year-round

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
it all year-round

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.530 
it all year-round
now<00:04:51.780> that's<00:04:51.990> our<00:04:52.380> climate<00:04:52.889> is<00:04:53.010> on<00:04:53.280> 8<00:04:53.580> B<00:04:54.150> so

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
now that's our climate is on 8 B so

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.600 
now that's our climate is on 8 B so
we're<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.780> warm<00:04:55.110> climate<00:04:55.380> our<00:04:55.800> soil<00:04:56.100> is<00:04:56.280> always

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
we're a warm climate our soil is always

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.020 
we're a warm climate our soil is always
fairly<00:04:56.940> warm<00:04:57.500> so<00:04:58.500> we<00:04:58.530> just<00:04:58.919> dig<00:04:59.550> them<00:04:59.729> we<00:04:59.910> would

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
fairly warm so we just dig them we would

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.240 
fairly warm so we just dig them we would
dig<00:05:00.210> a<00:05:00.240> clump<00:05:00.570> like<00:05:00.780> this<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.320> there'll<00:05:02.220> be

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
dig a clump like this and there'll be

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.790 
dig a clump like this and there'll be
multiple<00:05:02.639> bulbs<00:05:03.479> like<00:05:03.720> a<00:05:03.750> bunch<00:05:04.320> of<00:05:04.500> grapes

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
multiple bulbs like a bunch of grapes

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.070 
multiple bulbs like a bunch of grapes
almost<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:05.639> we<00:05:05.790> just<00:05:06.000> pull<00:05:06.360> those<00:05:06.600> different

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
almost and we just pull those different

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.120 
almost and we just pull those different
bulbs<00:05:07.320> off<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:08.150> take<00:05:09.150> them<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.360> friends<00:05:09.750> or
