00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 part to the search for the missing malaysian 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.090
 plane to the missing malaysian 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.690
 plane in all all confuses though now 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.650
 already many things they are absolutely obvious 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.810
 that is, there is like a snowstorm u 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.090
 Cope I pray now many things 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.369
 You can tell if I was an investigator 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.550
 who is dealing with missing this 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.039
 the aircraft in which the pile was filling I 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.109
 I mean 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.700
 alarm and here he is gone all this 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.559
 someone turned off the stuffing 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.660
 for clarity allowing 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.960
 performance of course yes that is 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.270
 it is clear that the check cheat evil actions 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.809
 reasonable actions that is, some are not 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.480
 some kind of irresistible force which if 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.219
 would be mapping yah if we assume 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.620
 there saying there took some 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.620
 aliens there he flew there in 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.350
 some kind of continuum issues 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.300
 no such surely happens i really don't 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.549
 Thank God not to face up happens 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:10.710
 and then the question is who turned off in the belly 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:13.430
 with currency recognition system and why 7 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.830
 hours the engine still worked if 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.500
 rolls-royce reported that information 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.540
 from the satellite received from them so what 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.930
 the engines worked for another seven hours 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.320
 the plane was seen flying over 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.299
 Maldives 7 hours worked on the engine 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.119
 7 hours was fuel 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.460
 there is a look at the map where god 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.880
 fly out of prayer there in australia looking 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.400
 in afghanistan on crazy addition 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.340
 Afghanistan could fly there is 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.040
 troops a whole bunch of system then all 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.840
 viewed here in the Persian Gulf 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.830
 the American fleet which can 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.630
 to identify 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.840
 the plane as a large object sense as 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.720
 missile carrier 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.490
 and on the approaches it already break because 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.130
 so why the carrier group 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.750
 some kind of rocket wears which is coming to 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.840
 him and they will not be 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.940
 identify as a civilian aircraft 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.370
 You know, but flew somewhere else 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.920
 the map is still good to see 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.020
 most likely all this is Somali 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.080
 not everyone could play world question 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.980
 capital 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.520
 why the question citizens did not give a signal 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.160
 Well, of course everyone has telephones there 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.920
 there are some gadgets and here they are 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:38.290
 be sure to call necessarily 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.150
 200 means special was not 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.180
 no trace and the phones are tracking 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.470
 now how was lephone turned out and 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:51.220
 all were included for a long time they already 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.880
 slept of course they were more likely all 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.880
 unable to call those people who 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.530
 track so to speak the route of the plane 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.230
 at least initially 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.830
 they report to get dressed start up 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.170
 heights are almost 15 kilometers and not 13 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.070
 the limit that is, he is speeding there 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.340
 chose well 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.100
 jump out and then fell out already 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.650
 went to Neva to pass for what 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.600
 climb to well understand why it 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.840
 the only explanation is to 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.500
 open as it produce again 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.390
 sealing the passenger compartment that 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.580
 there was a blast of compression 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.220
 respectively, the death of all the passenger here 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.650
 In general, unfortunately most likely it is here 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.080
 such a scenario was that is, passengers are not 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.660
 need eat passengers don't need why 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:48.130
 Smolin steal so to walk to 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:51.130
 trade there passengers well yes not they 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.910
 not uttered already told called to sell 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:58.570
 why can't people 777 be so healthy 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:02.440
 new good airplane so yes and here 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.900
 there is a question which is very 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.290
 monstrous course answer i mean we 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.800
 remember well there any of these 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.080
 Khans there these ditches which are atomic 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.690
 bombs produced for olivia for 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.900
 north korea and iran game pakistan 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.880
 and so on then for so to speak as 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.600
 carrier you will be currency does not need it 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.030
 small 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.750
 Well there she is in big suitcases and you can 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.030
 shove theoretically such a bomb and at 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.640
 thermonuclear charge and the suitcase will not thrust 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.470
 how do you remember when you did thermonuclear 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:45.450
 arms on knees in nature bikini what 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.450
 make the first explosion 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:49.539
 let's have this weapon built a house 3 in 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.690
 floor 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:55.419
 actually a three-story building if you 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.330
 remember russian 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.210
 Soviet or rather thermonuclear bomb 1 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.639
 low-power ie stronghold puff 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.580
 sugar she was not very big then in 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.370
 the plane is like a year to cut everything 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.400
 to stick in more and more powerful 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.690
 charges there half an aircraft cut off to 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.449
 hang this bomb 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.900
 that is, when the technology was still 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:23.020
 weak needed big objects here I am 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.940
 I think that the plane is necessary as an object 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.090
 in order to stuff it 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.300
 Well, God forbid, of course, thermonuclear 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.770
 weapons that is to make the system 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.289
 thermonuclear inside the aircraft itself 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.940
 turn a plane into a bomb or fill it up 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.009
 his chemical weapons of another 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.139
 I have no explanation for anything because 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.710
 any other weapons you can get 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:48.099
 completely different way for this is not needed 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:52.479
 777 blood survey 777 then the main aircraft 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:54.580
 many airlines with delirium can 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.740
 repaint can change the system 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:02.710
 alerts you can land your pilot 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:05.740
 yes she is another airline well i mean u 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.289
 there are for sure people and replace in 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.690
 the process of flying one plane to another 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:13.210
 what is very easy to do as you understand 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.669
 the pilot will be a suicide by sight 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.219
 one plane to remove and the second will fly 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.169
 instead of him to any city in the world but i dont 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:23.590
 I think that he will fly to Moscow at all 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.990
 In Russia, I think that the target will be others 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.259
 how was the town 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:33.880
 but what 's the only thing like borgo 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:37.360
 raising to a logical explanation why everything 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.000
 it is necessary to eat of course during the flight 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.819
 after the motive he just did not fall into the ocean and 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.349
 did not die because there are several thousand 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:48.590
 no one will ever find there 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:52.290
 this lie and not 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:55.370
 I think this situation may be a question 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.370
 where devices
