procedure there are always risks the

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.070 
procedure there are always risks the
probably<00:04:49.849> most<00:04:49.880> common<00:04:50.539> risk<00:04:50.780> of<00:04:50.960> any

the<00:04:54.840> risks<00:04:55.710> can<00:04:55.949> be<00:04:55.979> minimized<00:04:56.639> by<00:04:57.000> use<00:04:57.240> of

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
the risks can be minimized by use of

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.330 
the risks can be minimized by use of
certain<00:04:58.229> medications<00:04:58.830> or<00:04:59.039> use<00:04:59.190> of
