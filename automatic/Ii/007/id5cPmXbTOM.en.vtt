years and this is our newly debuting
dicing<00:00:15.750> attachment<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:17.250> look<00:00:17.580> at<00:00:17.760> that

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
dicing attachment so look at that

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.540 
dicing attachment so look at that
beautiful<00:00:18.300> dice<00:00:18.720> there<00:00:19.170> David<00:00:19.650> do<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.130> see

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
beautiful dice there David do you see

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.689 
beautiful dice there David do you see
now<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.600> engineering<00:00:22.410> behind<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.400> order

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
now the engineering behind this in order

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.890 
now the engineering behind this in order
to<00:00:23.850> get<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.930> perfect<00:00:25.650> dice<00:00:26.420> took<00:00:27.420> years

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
to get that perfect dice took years

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.140 
to get that perfect dice took years
because<00:00:28.650> they<00:00:28.800> had<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.130> get<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.429> timing<00:00:29.760> of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
because they had to get the timing of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.130 
because they had to get the timing of
the<00:00:30.510> blade<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.740> drop<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.430> food

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
the blade and the drop of the food

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.770 
the blade and the drop of the food
exactly<00:00:34.140> precisely<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:35.280> sync<00:00:35.940> with<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.270> mixer

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
exactly precisely in sync with the mixer

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.740 
exactly precisely in sync with the mixer
itself<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.620> again<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> beautiful<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
itself so again that is a beautiful and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.010 
itself so again that is a beautiful and

than 900 of these to go around the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
than 900 of these to go around the
reason<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.890> asked<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.159> question<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.640> any

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
reason I asked that question because any

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.910 
reason I asked that question because any
of<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.689> own<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> KitchenAid<00:01:07.380> stand<00:01:07.500> mixer

of you that own a KitchenAid stand mixer

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.469 
of you that own a KitchenAid stand mixer
whether<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.460> bowl<00:01:08.670> lift<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> tilting

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
whether it's a bowl lift or a tilting

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.530 
whether it's a bowl lift or a tilting
back<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:10.229> will<00:01:10.710> work<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.850> stand<00:01:12.210> mixer

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
back this will work on that stand mixer

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.510 
back this will work on that stand mixer

time then why not go ahead and pick up
this<00:01:25.590> attachment<00:01:25.920> then<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.880> put<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
this attachment then just put it on the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.240 
this attachment then just put it on the
machine<00:01:27.630> when<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.110> need<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.920> all<00:01:29.070> your

machine when you need it do all your
food<00:01:29.400> processing<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.450> clean<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:31.079> store

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
food processing then clean it up store

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.140 
food processing then clean it up store
it<00:01:31.530> away<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.400> mixer<00:01:32.610> stays<00:01:32.820> out<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it away and your mixer stays out on the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
it away and your mixer stays out on the
counter<00:01:33.299> because<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.229> instance

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
counter because in this in this instance

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.580 
counter because in this in this instance
the<00:01:35.130> mixer<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> power<00:01:36.119> source<00:01:36.479> exactly<00:01:37.320> so

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the mixer is the power source exactly so

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.640 
the mixer is the power source exactly so
it's<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> 300<00:01:38.939> watt<00:01:39.180> food<00:01:39.900> processor<00:01:40.530> it's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
it's now a 300 watt food processor it's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.120 
it's now a 300 watt food processor it's
great<00:01:40.950> now<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.090> our<00:01:43.130> stand-alone

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
great now just like on our stand-alone

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.730 
great now just like on our stand-alone
food<00:01:44.460> processors<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.600> also<00:01:46.020> has<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> slicing

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
food processors this also has a slicing

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.219 
food processors this also has a slicing
attachment<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.479> change<00:01:48.810> this

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
attachment that you can change this

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.889 
attachment that you can change this
blade<00:01:49.649> into<00:01:50.399> six<00:01:50.759> different<00:01:51.030> slicing

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
blade into six different slicing

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.380 
blade into six different slicing
opportunities<00:01:52.710> David<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.520> blade<00:01:53.850> six

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
opportunities David one blade six

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.630 
opportunities David one blade six
different<00:01:54.600> slicing<00:01:55.229> opportunities<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.369> right

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
different slicing opportunities so right

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.520 
different slicing opportunities so right
now<00:01:56.820> I'm<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.689> ahead<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.110> put<00:01:58.350> this

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
now I'm going to go ahead and put this

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.530 
now I'm going to go ahead and put this
over<00:01:58.799> at<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> thickest<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.329> that

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
over at the thickest and do you see that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.420 
over at the thickest and do you see that
icon<00:02:00.719> there<00:02:01.200> that's<00:02:01.619> what's<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> tell

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
icon there that's what's going to tell

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.469 
icon there that's what's going to tell
me<00:02:02.640> how

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
me how

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.600 
me how
that<00:02:03.659> end<00:02:03.899> slice<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.159> so

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
that end slice is going to be and so

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.789 
that end slice is going to be and so
here<00:02:05.820> we<00:02:05.939> go<00:02:06.149> we're<00:02:06.899> going<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.079> slice<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.770> some

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
here we go we're going to slice up some

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.520 
here we go we're going to slice up some
Tomatoes<00:02:08.610> or<00:02:08.819> how<00:02:09.269> about<00:02:09.509> how<00:02:10.050> about<00:02:10.080> just

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
Tomatoes or how about how about just

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.259 
Tomatoes or how about how about just
some<00:02:10.739> peppers<00:02:11.190> if<00:02:11.400> we're<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> some

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
some peppers if we're going to do a some

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:12.860 
some peppers if we're going to do a some
pepper

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870

pepper
let<00:02:13.200> me<00:02:13.290> just<00:02:13.470> slice<00:02:13.830> those<00:02:14.160> through<00:02:14.610> we<00:02:15.180> do<00:02:15.360> a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
let me just slice those through we do a

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.330 
let me just slice those through we do a
couple<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.900> things<00:02:16.140> here<00:02:16.410> how<00:02:16.860> about<00:02:17.069> if<00:02:17.190> I

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
couple of things here how about if I

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.660 
couple of things here how about if I
have<00:02:17.550> something<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:18.269> is<00:02:18.810> narrow<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:20.459> need

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
have something that is narrow and I need

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.880 
have something that is narrow and I need
to<00:02:20.910> do<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> perfect<00:02:21.780> slice<00:02:22.170> on<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.739> let's

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
to do a perfect slice on that and let's

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.640 
to do a perfect slice on that and let's
just<00:02:23.069> change<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.870> midstream<00:02:24.870> we'll<00:02:25.440> bring

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
just change this midstream we'll bring

just change this midstream we'll bring
this<00:02:25.830> all<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.280> way<00:02:26.430> over<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.180> finest

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
this all the way over to the finest

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.089 
this all the way over to the finest
slicing<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.160> here<00:02:29.940> celery<00:02:30.390> slices<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:31.860> that

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
slicing and here celery slices just that

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.520 
slicing and here celery slices just that
quickly<00:02:32.519> let<00:02:32.700> me<00:02:32.730> get<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.150> now<00:02:33.510> notice<00:02:33.810> with

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
quickly let me get this now notice with

mixer<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.609> have<00:03:08.849> whether<00:03:09.359> it's<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.629> bolus

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
mixer that you have whether it's a bolus

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.190 
mixer that you have whether it's a bolus
October<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:11.099> through<00:03:11.549> that<00:03:11.780> slice<00:03:12.780> off<00:03:13.049> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
October it's through that slice off the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.589 
October it's through that slice off the
table<00:03:13.530> okay<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.340> look<00:03:14.549> at<00:03:14.639> that<00:03:14.819> perfectly

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
table okay so look at that perfectly

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.979 
table okay so look at that perfectly
sliced<00:03:16.139> but<00:03:16.889> then<00:03:17.129> again<00:03:17.280> look<00:03:17.909> at<00:03:18.030> how<00:03:18.090> thin<00:03:18.659> I

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
sliced but then again look at how thin I

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.159 
sliced but then again look at how thin I
was<00:03:19.379> able<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.739> do<00:03:20.069> that<00:03:20.280> celery<00:03:20.790> perfect<00:03:21.599> every

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
was able to do that celery perfect every

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.349 
was able to do that celery perfect every
single<00:03:22.200> Condit<00:03:23.010> absolutely<00:03:23.519> show<00:03:24.000> them<00:03:24.209> what

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
single Condit absolutely show them what

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.640 
single Condit absolutely show them what
they're<00:03:24.510> going<00:03:24.629> to<00:03:24.689> get<00:03:24.870> sure<00:03:25.139> let's<00:03:25.409> do<00:03:25.500> that

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
they're going to get sure let's do that

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.520 
they're going to get sure let's do that
okay<00:03:25.889> so<00:03:26.189> if<00:03:26.639> you<00:03:26.760> move<00:03:26.939> down<00:03:27.150> here<00:03:27.569> these<00:03:28.230> are

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
okay so if you move down here these are

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.140 
okay so if you move down here these are
all<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.950> discs<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.430> are<00:03:29.639> going<00:03:29.819> to<00:03:29.909> come

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
all the discs that are going to come

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.569 
all the discs that are going to come
with<00:03:30.299> your<00:03:30.510> unit<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.379> there<00:03:31.620> is<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.829> shredding

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
with your unit so there is a shredding

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.940 
with your unit so there is a shredding
disc<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.120> that's<00:03:33.480> reversible<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.409> one<00:03:34.680> side

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
disc and that's reversible so one side

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.640 
disc and that's reversible so one side
is<00:03:35.099> fine<00:03:35.370> or<00:03:35.879> inside<00:03:36.239> his<00:03:36.419> course<00:03:36.719> then<00:03:37.319> here's

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
is fine or inside his course then here's

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.039 
is fine or inside his course then here's
your<00:03:37.829> julienne<00:03:38.370> blade<00:03:38.419> so<00:03:39.419> that<00:03:39.599> you're<00:03:39.780> able

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
your julienne blade so that you're able

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.289 
your julienne blade so that you're able
to<00:03:40.079> do<00:03:40.379> those<00:03:40.799> julienne<00:03:41.400> potatoes<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.239> you

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
to do those julienne potatoes that you

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.809 
to do those julienne potatoes that you
love<00:03:42.629> so<00:03:42.840> much<00:03:42.900> or<00:03:43.230> how<00:03:43.889> about<00:03:44.099> maybe<00:03:44.700> a
