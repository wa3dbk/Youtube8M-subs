00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.199 
know 1911 1987 I believe 85 yeah
nineteen<00:02:06.929> eighty<00:02:07.079> seven<00:02:07.439> ish<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.490> I<00:02:09.030> just

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
nineteen eighty seven ish and I just

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.330 
nineteen eighty seven ish and I just
think<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.509> interesting<00:02:09.690> because

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
think it's interesting because

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.280 
think it's interesting because
it's<00:02:10.580> such<00:02:10.910> an<00:02:11.090> old<00:02:11.239> design<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.019> still

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
it's such an old design and it still

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.540 
it's such an old design and it still
translates<00:02:12.890> very<00:02:13.040> well<00:02:13.310> on<00:02:13.459> court<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.349> as<00:02:15.550> you

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
translates very well on court so as you

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.309 
translates very well on court so as you
can<00:02:16.640> see<00:02:16.790> they've<00:02:17.000> got<00:02:17.239> battle<00:02:17.780> wounds<00:02:17.989> and

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
can see they've got battle wounds and

can see they've got battle wounds and
all<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.040> kind<00:02:19.280> of<00:02:19.310> good<00:02:19.370> stuff<00:02:19.519> but<00:02:20.230> yeah<00:02:21.230> I
