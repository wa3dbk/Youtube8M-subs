00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
though right here that looks really nice

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.390 
though right here that looks really nice
some<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.840> problems<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.530> lack<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.740> blue

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
some of the problems is the lack of blue

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.130 
some of the problems is the lack of blue
honestly<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.090> figure<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.509> needs<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.990> lot

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140

honestly this figure just needs a lot
more<00:01:28.170> blue<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.829> these<00:01:29.189> are<00:01:29.250> pieces

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
more blue I think these are pieces

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.649 
more blue I think these are pieces
should<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:29.970> been<00:01:30.090> blue<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.540> should

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
should have been blue and there should

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
back but I'm sure if you really wanted

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.310 
back but I'm sure if you really wanted
to<00:01:50.640> it'd<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:51.000> pretty<00:01:51.210> easy<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.750> figure<00:01:51.990> out<00:01:52.140> how

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
to make that attach onto the back so

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.880 
to make that attach onto the back so
overall<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:54.780> Captain<00:01:55.259> America<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890
