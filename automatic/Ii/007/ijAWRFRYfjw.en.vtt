all about it backtrack is basically just

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.670 
all about it backtrack is basically just
a<00:00:48.430> small<00:00:49.430> sort<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:49.850> personal<00:00:50.330> recorder<00:00:50.870> that

here<00:00:57.790> backtrack<00:00:58.790> is<00:00:59.440> designed<00:01:00.440> to<00:01:00.650> go<00:01:00.860> in<00:01:01.309> your

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
here backtrack is designed to go in your

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.219 
here backtrack is designed to go in your
signal<00:01:02.030> chain<00:01:02.269> coming<00:01:02.600> from<00:01:02.870> your<00:01:03.080> guitar

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
signal chain coming from your guitar

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.560 
signal chain coming from your guitar
into<00:01:04.129> your<00:01:04.250> amplifier<00:01:04.729> or<00:01:04.970> whatever<00:01:05.420> you're

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
into your amplifier or whatever you're

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.300 
into your amplifier or whatever you're
playing<00:01:05.840> into<00:01:06.370> it<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.229> completely<00:01:09.830> analog

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
playing into it is a completely analog

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.420 
playing into it is a completely analog
through<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:11.900> you<00:01:11.960> you're<00:01:12.890> not<00:01:13.010> hitting<00:01:13.220> any

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
through so you you're not hitting any

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.070 
through so you you're not hitting any
converters<00:01:13.909> or<00:01:14.030> anything<00:01:14.390> before<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.810> go<00:01:15.020> to

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
converters or anything before you go to

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.230 
converters or anything before you go to
your<00:01:15.200> amplifier<00:01:15.740> but<00:01:16.370> what<00:01:16.520> basically<00:01:16.820> it's

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
your amplifier but what basically it's

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.750 
your amplifier but what basically it's
doing<00:01:17.570> is<00:01:17.690> it's<00:01:17.840> always<00:01:18.049> recording<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.190> it's

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
doing is it's always recording and it's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.140 
doing is it's always recording and it's
it's<00:01:20.330> senses<00:01:20.870> when<00:01:21.320> you've<00:01:21.500> stopped<00:01:22.220> an<00:01:22.549> idea

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
it's senses when you've stopped an idea

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.660 
it's senses when you've stopped an idea
where<00:01:23.420> there's<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.630> pause<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.370> and<00:01:25.370> when<00:01:25.549> you

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
where there's a pause and and when you

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.270 
where there's a pause and and when you
begin<00:01:26.270> another<00:01:26.570> idea<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.229> it<00:01:27.680> creates

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
begin another idea and it creates

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.580 
begin another idea and it creates
different<00:01:28.850> wav<00:01:29.000> files<00:01:29.360> for<00:01:30.170> each<00:01:30.290> of<00:01:30.440> those

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
different wav files for each of those

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.350 
different wav files for each of those
ideas<00:01:30.799> it's<00:01:31.190> basically<00:01:31.460> always<00:01:31.670> slicing<00:01:32.180> WAV

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
ideas it's basically always slicing WAV

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.980 
ideas it's basically always slicing WAV
files<00:01:33.700> so<00:01:34.700> basically<00:01:35.120> you<00:01:35.210> should<00:01:35.480> be<00:01:35.720> able<00:01:35.840> to

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
files so basically you should be able to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.710 
files so basically you should be able to
plug<00:01:36.410> into<00:01:36.620> it<00:01:36.980> forget<00:01:37.700> about<00:01:37.730> it<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.270> it's

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
plug into it forget about it and it's

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.810 
plug into it forget about it and it's
just<00:01:38.960> always<00:01:39.520> capturing<00:01:40.520> what<00:01:40.640> you're

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
just always capturing what you're

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.160 
just always capturing what you're
playing<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:41.330> if<00:01:41.420> I'm<00:01:41.540> sitting<00:01:41.720> here<00:01:41.990> playing

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
playing so if I'm sitting here playing

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.160 
playing so if I'm sitting here playing

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
so I can then go back hit play

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.460 
so I can then go back hit play
that's<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.330> last<00:02:23.480> thing<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.810> played<00:02:24.110> I<00:02:24.140> could

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
that's the last thing I played I could

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.830 
that's the last thing I played I could
go<00:02:24.620> back<00:02:24.830> before<00:02:25.040> that

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
not getting rid of anything you're not

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.059 
not getting rid of anything you're not
gonna<00:03:00.420> lose<00:03:00.690> anything<00:03:01.050> if<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.410> don't<00:03:01.530> mark<00:03:01.950> it

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
gonna lose anything if you don't mark it

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.380 
gonna lose anything if you don't mark it
you<00:03:02.190> can<00:03:02.280> always<00:03:02.370> go<00:03:02.489> back<00:03:02.610> through<00:03:03.150> and

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
you can always go back through and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.900 
you can always go back through and
decide<00:03:03.780> what<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.080> like<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:05.220> then<00:03:05.280> basically

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
decide what you like and then basically

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.759 
decide what you like and then basically
since<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:06.570> recording<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.260> dry<00:03:07.590> guitar

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
since it's recording just dry guitar

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.140 
since it's recording just dry guitar
it's<00:03:10.769> just<00:03:10.890> gonna<00:03:10.980> sound<00:03:11.220> like<00:03:11.430> any<00:03:11.610> amp<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:11.970> run

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
it's just gonna sound like any amp I run

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.800 
it's just gonna sound like any amp I run
it<00:03:12.239> into<00:03:12.620> or<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.709> can<00:03:14.040> take<00:03:14.310> it

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
it into or I can take it

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.199 
it into or I can take it
USB<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:16.200> into<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:16.950> computer<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.730> opens<00:03:18.060> up

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
USB it into a computer it opens up

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.090 
USB it into a computer it opens up
essentially<00:03:18.690> as<00:03:18.780> another<00:03:18.989> Drive<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.950> then<00:03:20.070> I

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
essentially as another Drive and then I

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.640 
essentially as another Drive and then I
can<00:03:20.280> go<00:03:20.370> into<00:03:20.640> those<00:03:20.760> folders<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.540> grab<00:03:22.350> those

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
can go into those folders and grab those

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.400 
can go into those folders and grab those
files<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.209> can<00:03:24.450> then<00:03:24.480> take<00:03:24.810> anything<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.380> I

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
files so I can then take anything that I

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.150 
files so I can then take anything that I
really<00:03:25.769> liked<00:03:26.269> drag<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.450> into<00:03:27.630> some<00:03:28.410> recording

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
really liked drag it into some recording

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.540 
really liked drag it into some recording
software<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.360> open<00:03:30.660> up<00:03:30.810> an<00:03:31.550> amp

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
software and then open up an amp

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.060 
software and then open up an amp
modeling<00:03:32.970> plugin<00:03:33.450> like<00:03:33.720> save<00:03:33.989> pod<00:03:34.170> farm<00:03:34.410> be

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
modeling plugin like save pod farm be

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.170 
modeling plugin like save pod farm be
good<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:37.200> take<00:03:37.920> those<00:03:38.190> ideas<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:38.940> I

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
good and and take those ideas that I

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.960 
good and and take those ideas that I
came<00:03:39.480> up<00:03:39.690> with<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.220> chop<00:03:41.220> them<00:03:41.400> up<00:03:41.459> paste<00:03:41.760> them

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
came up with and chop them up paste them

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.610 
came up with and chop them up paste them
and<00:03:42.060> create<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.660> song<00:03:42.900> out<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.230> if<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.440> like

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
and create a song out of it if I like

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.650 
and create a song out of it if I like
and<00:03:44.340> there's<00:03:44.700> enough<00:03:44.910> memory<00:03:45.299> in<00:03:45.390> there<00:03:45.540> to

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
and there's enough memory in there to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.090 
and there's enough memory in there to
hold<00:03:45.840> water<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.140> three<00:03:46.470> hours<00:03:46.739> of<00:03:46.769> playing

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
hold water in three hours of playing

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.880 
hold water in three hours of playing
there's<00:03:47.790> two<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.209> BACtrack<00:03:49.019> model<00:03:49.769> without

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
there's two the BACtrack model without

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.850 
there's two the BACtrack model without
the<00:03:50.070> mic<00:03:50.430> because<00:03:51.120> I<00:03:51.720> think<00:03:51.989> it's<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.290> gig<00:03:52.560> it'll

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
the mic because I think it's a gig it'll

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.120 
the mic because I think it's a gig it'll
do<00:03:53.010> three<00:03:53.640> hours<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.390> think<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.989> at<00:03:55.680> sixteen

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
do three hours I think of at sixteen

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.900 
do three hours I think of at sixteen
forty<00:03:56.519> four<00:03:56.670> one<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:58.230> then<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:59.280> backtrack

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
forty four one and then the backtrack

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.630 
forty four one and then the backtrack
plus<00:04:00.150> mic<00:04:00.480> has<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.930> think<00:04:00.959> two<00:04:01.320> gig<00:04:01.590> through<00:04:02.340> six

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
plus mic has I think two gig through six

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.690 
plus mic has I think two gig through six
hours

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
hours

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.880 
hours
so<00:04:04.300> anything<00:04:04.510> that's<00:04:04.720> knocked<00:04:05.110> mark<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.770> be

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
so anything that's knocked mark to be

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.830 
so anything that's knocked mark to be
kept<00:04:06.160> eventually<00:04:07.030> would<00:04:07.180> fall<00:04:07.450> off<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.750> end

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
kept eventually would fall off the end

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.510 
kept eventually would fall off the end
of<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.110> memory<00:04:08.440> as<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:08.680> gets<00:04:08.860> pushed<00:04:09.069> out<00:04:09.250> so

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
of the memory as it gets pushed out so

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.370 
of the memory as it gets pushed out so
after<00:04:09.880> three<00:04:10.030> hours<00:04:10.060> you<00:04:10.810> lose<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.110> older

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
after three hours you lose the older

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.660 
after three hours you lose the older
material<00:04:11.830> yes<00:04:12.069> yes<00:04:14.400> astonishingly<00:04:15.400> little

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
material yes yes astonishingly little

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.580 
material yes yes astonishingly little
piece<00:04:15.760> of<00:04:15.910> kits<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.329> presumably<00:04:16.930> runs<00:04:17.440> on

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
piece of kits and presumably runs on

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.710 
piece of kits and presumably runs on
batteries<00:04:17.919> yeah<00:04:18.790> it<00:04:18.940> has<00:04:19.120> an<00:04:19.329> internal

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
batteries yeah it has an internal

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.599 
batteries yeah it has an internal
battery<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.200> recharges<00:04:20.590> when<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.160> plug<00:04:21.489> it

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
battery that recharges when you plug it

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.700 
battery that recharges when you plug it
USB<00:04:22.060> into<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.389> computer<00:04:22.870> or<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.380> could<00:04:23.560> use

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
USB into the computer or you could use

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.050 
USB into the computer or you could use
any<00:04:23.889> phone<00:04:24.160> charger<00:04:24.639> that<00:04:24.669> charges<00:04:25.740> USB<00:04:27.060> and

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
any phone charger that charges USB and

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.030 
any phone charger that charges USB and
obviously<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.840> microphone<00:04:29.380> works<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.860> same

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
obviously the microphone works the same

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.290 
obviously the microphone works the same
way<00:04:30.280> as<00:04:30.430> I've<00:04:30.580> just<00:04:30.700> showed<00:04:30.910> you<00:04:30.940> with<00:04:31.180> the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
way as I've just showed you with the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.060 
way as I've just showed you with the

idea you can just capture everything so
what's<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.669> price<00:04:42.820> going<00:04:42.970> to<00:04:43.180> be<00:04:43.270> on<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.450> two

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
what's the price going to be on the two

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.159 
what's the price going to be on the two
models<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.470> BACtrack<00:04:45.100> maps<00:04:45.460> at<00:04:45.700> $99<00:04:46.690> yeah<00:04:46.990> and

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
models the BACtrack maps at $99 yeah and

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.360 
models the BACtrack maps at $99 yeah and
the<00:04:47.590> backtrack<00:04:48.040> plus<00:04:48.310> mic<00:04:48.550> is<00:04:48.760> 149<00:04:50.370> implicit

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
the backtrack plus mic is 149 implicit

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.100 
the backtrack plus mic is 149 implicit
opener<00:04:51.700> should<00:04:51.880> have<00:04:52.030> one<00:04:52.180> yeah<00:04:52.479> sounds<00:04:52.990> like
