is just ridiculous i think he's one of
the<00:02:03.690> team<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.080> year<00:02:04.140> cars<00:02:04.410> again<00:02:04.650> 89<00:02:05.190> rated

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
the team of the year cars again 89 rated

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.830

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
or something like that and he seems to

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.530 
or something like that and he seems to
be<00:02:06.930> crazy<00:02:07.260> but<00:02:07.560> black<00:02:08.190> ball<00:02:08.460> not<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.180> mr.<00:02:09.450> we

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.320 
which is 10 of those I think that is
pretty<00:02:49.980> much<00:02:50.130> like<00:02:50.190> fitness<00:02:50.580> cards<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:50.970> then

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
pretty much like fitness cards and then

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.570 
pretty much like fitness cards and then
we<00:02:51.390> got<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> UEFA<00:02:52.020> Team<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.709> age<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.520> I'm

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
we got a UEFA Team of the age and so I'm

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.310 
we got a UEFA Team of the age and so I'm
guessing<00:02:53.760> that's<00:02:53.910> just<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.180> one<00:02:54.360> player<00:02:54.630> I'll<00:02:55.140> i

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
guessing that's just a one player I'll i

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.570 
guessing that's just a one player I'll i
don't<00:02:55.470> know<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.620> it's<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.800> set<00:02:56.010> play<00:02:56.250> out<00:02:56.370> with

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
don't know if it's a set play out with

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.180 
don't know if it's a set play out with
just<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.820> random<00:02:57.239> one<00:02:57.360> i'm<00:02:57.600> guessing<00:02:58.380> i<00:02:58.920> don't

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
just a random one i'm guessing i don't

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.100 
just a random one i'm guessing i don't
know<00:02:59.250> if<00:02:59.340> that's<00:02:59.459> not<00:02:59.550> going<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.940> my<00:03:00.630> agents<00:03:01.050> or
