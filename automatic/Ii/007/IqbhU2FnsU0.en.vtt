 josue gonçalves 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.339
 the word of the Lord 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.820
 in the second Gospel he wrote Matthew 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.560
 in chapter one piece from 29 to 31 10 as well and leaving them of the synagogue ferret 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.980

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.899

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.779
 the mother-in-law 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.520
 look over the present here in the will 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.800
 Simon's mother-in-law was bedridden. 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.829
 with fever 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.440
 and then tell him about her then approaching took by the hand and the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.730
 fever left him 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.970
 passing it 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.410
 to serve them 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.090
 What I find interesting in this text is the presence of the mother-in- 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.670
 apostle 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.440

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.730
 the way 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.059
 the couple 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.189
 treat the family of origin all or 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:04.690
 can 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.280
 determine success 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.680
 or failed 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.660
 of marriage 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.670
 Did you know that when 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.830
 a youngster 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.460
 marry with a 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.710
 Young man, he does not marry her alone. 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.310
 he marries her parents marries her brothers marries his family 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.360
 her 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.850
 I have always tried to make this very clear when I make a wedding 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.619
 or when I advise couples 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.660
 What are you getting married to look at? 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.660
 You're not going to marry only her. 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.500
 You're going to marry her family too. You're not going to marry just 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.070
 He's going to marry his family with his family too. 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.690

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.140

 There's a son who's getting married and I've told him. 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.730
 Valeria will not only be a new 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.979

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.500
 which will be integrated into our family 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.140
 my son will not be just a raul engineer of Valeria's family 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:18.019
 he should hit the figueirense with a keyboard in her family 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.499
 when it is able to arrive 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.920
 in the relationship with the family of origin 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.460
 what happens 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.719
 it's a community 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.389

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.879

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.879
 treats 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.819
 father of the present woman 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.359
 How do you handle the woman's term? 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.369
 How do you treat? 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:50.280
 There's a lot that the husband 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.560
 How did you treat? 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.929
 Your husband's father will not be there. 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.060

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.759

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.450
 Is it not that it is not covered? 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.579
 the ps through which the devil is entering 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.220
 and destroying the family relationship 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.929
 I learned early 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:11.799
 when I treat you 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.670
 my wife's parents with respect I am investing in the heart of my 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:17.829
 woman 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.999
 My wife knows that when she treats my family, my mother 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.449
 She is investing in my heart. 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.189
 and at the heart of one's own marriage 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.679
 think about this and today I want to pray for the mother in law 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:35.130

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.869

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:42.769
 Do you believe that god can overthrow this fortress? 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.860
 the enmity raised within many families because of 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.770
 lack of understanding 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.619

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:03.469
 earth port belt 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:04.750

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.739
 with the family of origin of the cobra gi joe 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.340
 with the family of origin of the own husband the wife fell by land 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.530
 and all that the name be glorified and that acts father establishes itself 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.349
 the name of Jesus I think it is so 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.669
 argued 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.479
 remember no success justifies failures of a family of one 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.490
 marriage 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.110
