00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.310
 then we continue with these 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.410
 simulations and today touches from the camp 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.740
 nou but not the one in Spain but 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:15.070
 whoever is here in mexico is the 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.860
 super leader goes against the eighth of the 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.840
 table what I mean is the cross 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.630
 blue against the lion of the eternal favorite 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.490
 and the champion acts or is not eternally true 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.130
 is the current champion of 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.689
 concachampions and then know what 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.920
 performance will have in these rooms of 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.190
 final of the league 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.409
 mx that goes against a lion that then 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.379
 he saw difficult to enter the 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:44.409
 Quarterfinals and it will now try to 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.250
 earn a place besides is also 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:50.979
 recent champion of this tournament and 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.120
 he has good players and several of them 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:56.880
 They will be in 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.880
 in the league of the Mexican national team is 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.220
 I think so but that will be after 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.750
 so so while we'll have this 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.910
 small preview of what you can do 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.220
 this party that also gives the 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.220
 Wednesday so we start votes 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.170
 Y 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.240
 it opens if it can be an opportunity 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.240
 to lose 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.950
 the land and be alone agreement 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.890
 it's history 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.860
 what good 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.870
 it opens if it can be an opportunity 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.630
 to see if it is first the maximum of 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.720
 know you open space and it can be a 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.510
 opportunity hit him in an implicated to 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.940
 end of the first 45 minutes auto 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.970
 the goal is missing 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.250
 have come to rest in barium and I do not 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.430
 I do not believe that we have existed 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.470
 enough opportunities directly to 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.470
 start of the second half 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.930
 crosses the archer who comes out to cut the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.180
 center when turning but there's no reason 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.370
 worry opens its way and it can be a 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.370
 good opportunity for good 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.610
 and the technician will be 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.180
 the truth 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.680
 approaches when shooting with put the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.940
 bags on the court 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.620
 you are 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.620
 the physical car bayly by 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.780
 and this ball that will be novices ends 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.990
 our simulation and apparently the one that 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.130
 the one who played badly in the group and 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:07.190
 which was added at the last minute clear 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.700
 better the lion could be a favorite 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.090
 to beat the leader but good 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.330
 our result is from 1 to 0 please lion 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.820
 you can not be that see the surprise this 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.610
 party but good tell us what is your 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.590
