here are imported from the Philippines
and<00:01:17.050> one<00:01:18.050> interesting<00:01:18.560> thing<00:01:18.590> about<00:01:18.860> buying

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
and one interesting thing about buying

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.310 
and one interesting thing about buying
bananas<00:01:19.850> here<00:01:20.360> in<00:01:20.480> Japan<00:01:20.870> is<00:01:21.050> that<00:01:21.200> they

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
bananas here in Japan is that they

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.850 
bananas here in Japan is that they
always<00:01:21.560> wrap<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.340> bananas<00:01:22.850> in<00:01:23.090> plastic<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.050> I

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
always wrap the bananas in plastic and I

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.730 
always wrap the bananas in plastic and I
think<00:01:25.159> they<00:01:25.280> do<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.790> for<00:01:26.060> two<00:01:26.360> reasons<00:01:26.740> one

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
think they do that for two reasons one

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.250 
think they do that for two reasons one
is<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.070> keep<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.640> bananas<00:01:29.090> clean<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.840> the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
is to keep the bananas clean and the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.880 
is to keep the bananas clean and the
other<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.860> more<00:01:31.159> important<00:01:31.670> reason<00:01:32.060> is<00:01:32.890> to

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
other the more important reason is to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.190 
other the more important reason is to
prevent<00:01:34.280> people<00:01:34.790> from<00:01:34.820> taking<00:01:35.240> bananas<00:01:35.960> off

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
prevent people from taking bananas off

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:46.940
