pushing down on them for a while kind of

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.000 
pushing down on them for a while kind of
like<00:03:51.180> dabbing<00:03:52.019> them<00:03:52.379> and<00:03:52.620> making<00:03:52.739> all<00:03:52.920> the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
like dabbing them and making all the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.400 
like dabbing them and making all the
bristles<00:03:53.310> spread<00:03:53.579> out<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:54.360> get<00:03:54.510> more<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:55.019> this

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
bristles spread out you get more of this

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.470 
bristles spread out you get more of this
shape<00:03:57.200> it's<00:03:58.200> more<00:03:58.470> spread<00:03:59.040> out<00:03:59.120> and<00:04:00.120> kind<00:04:00.390> of

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
shape it's more spread out and kind of

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.220 
shape it's more spread out and kind of
like<00:04:00.690> vanish<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.890> guess<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.989> bristles<00:04:03.989> on<00:04:04.110> the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
like vanish I guess the bristles on the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.319 
like vanish I guess the bristles on the
top<00:04:04.410> aren't<00:04:04.950> bumps<00:04:05.129> together<00:04:05.340> they're<00:04:05.700> spread

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
top aren't bumps together they're spread

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.089 
top aren't bumps together they're spread
out<00:04:06.360> more<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.870> that's<00:04:07.410> what<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:07.680> want<00:04:07.890> for<00:04:08.069> a

part just go where we go around the

part just go where we go around the
edges

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:11.080 

just<00:05:02.620> go<00:05:02.740> with<00:05:02.979> it

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.969 

so<00:05:12.090> yeah<00:05:12.599> and<00:05:12.930> then<00:05:13.169> you<00:05:13.289> can<00:05:13.500> sort<00:05:13.710> of<00:05:13.740> see<00:05:13.860> how

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
so yeah and then you can sort of see how

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.110 
so yeah and then you can sort of see how
it's<00:05:14.129> getting<00:05:14.220> this<00:05:14.430> basic<00:05:14.819> coat<00:05:15.000> around

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
it's getting this basic coat around

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.409 
it's getting this basic coat around
there<00:05:15.419> now<00:05:16.080> if<00:05:16.800> you<00:05:17.039> want<00:05:17.220> to<00:05:17.340> make<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.180> edges

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
there now if you want to make the edges

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.110 
there now if you want to make the edges
more<00:05:18.810> dynamic<00:05:19.470> and<00:05:19.620> make<00:05:20.159> it<00:05:20.310> less<00:05:20.550> worn<00:05:20.940> out

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
more dynamic and make it less worn out

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.719 
more dynamic and make it less worn out
like<00:05:21.419> the<00:05:21.569> Zaku<00:05:21.960> i<00:05:22.050> showed<00:05:22.319> you<00:05:22.460> just<00:05:23.460> going<00:05:23.639> to

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
like the Zaku i showed you just going to

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.719 
like the Zaku i showed you just going to
basically<00:05:23.960> roll<00:05:24.960> some<00:05:25.830> rubbing<00:05:26.099> alcohol<00:05:26.190> into

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
basically roll some rubbing alcohol into

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:33.230 
basically roll some rubbing alcohol into
a<00:05:26.759> q-tip<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:27.500> then<00:05:28.500> go<00:05:28.740> in<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.669> areas<00:05:32.030> like<00:05:33.030> in

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
a q-tip and then go in the areas like in

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.839 
a q-tip and then go in the areas like in
the<00:05:33.330> center<00:05:33.659> here<00:05:37.009> I'm<00:05:38.009> wiping<00:05:38.370> away<00:05:38.490> a<00:05:38.610> little

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
the center here I'm wiping away a little

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.950 
the center here I'm wiping away a little
bit

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.390 

and<00:05:44.960> just<00:05:45.110> kind<00:05:45.289> of<00:05:45.319> go<00:05:45.439> around<00:05:45.740> so<00:05:45.979> the<00:05:46.099> edges

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
and just kind of go around so the edges

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.439 
and just kind of go around so the edges
are<00:05:46.520> more<00:05:46.699> highlighted<00:05:47.300> than<00:05:47.479> the<00:05:47.689> actual

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
are more highlighted than the actual

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:55.019 
are more highlighted than the actual
piece

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:55.029 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:58.059 

so<00:05:56.029> yeah<00:05:56.210> that's<00:05:56.779> basically<00:05:57.259> how<00:05:57.619> you<00:05:57.740> dry

00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:58.069 
so yeah that's basically how you dry

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.369 
so yeah that's basically how you dry
brush<00:05:58.339> and<00:05:59.059> again<00:05:59.300> maybe<00:05:59.899> this<00:06:00.050> wasn't<00:06:00.229> the

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379 
brush and again maybe this wasn't the

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:05.769 
brush and again maybe this wasn't the
best<00:06:00.909> example<00:06:01.909> for<00:06:01.939> it<00:06:02.499> but<00:06:04.180> white<00:06:05.180> works

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:05.779 
best example for it but white works

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.609 
best example for it but white works
really<00:06:06.050> well<00:06:06.169> this<00:06:06.860> stuff<00:06:07.129> works<00:06:07.369> really<00:06:07.550> well

00:06:08.609 --> 00:06:08.619 
really well this stuff works really well

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:10.899 
really well this stuff works really well
gunmetal<00:06:09.619> white<00:06:10.009> metal<00:06:10.399> stuff<00:06:10.729> like<00:06:10.879> that

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:10.909 
gunmetal white metal stuff like that

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:14.079 
gunmetal white metal stuff like that
works<00:06:11.270> really<00:06:11.449> well<00:06:11.569> and<00:06:12.369> again<00:06:13.369> the<00:06:13.669> silver

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:14.089 
works really well and again the silver

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:17.589 
works really well and again the silver
is<00:06:14.330> on<00:06:14.689> my<00:06:14.839> quanta<00:06:15.229> here<00:06:16.149> she<00:06:17.149> thinking<00:06:17.509> about

not too sure and again some of you
probably<00:06:23.839> bitch<00:06:24.229> oh<00:06:24.439> why<00:06:25.369> would<00:06:25.430> you<00:06:25.639> ruin<00:06:25.789> a

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:25.969 
probably bitch oh why would you ruin a

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.850 
probably bitch oh why would you ruin a
figure<00:06:26.270> like<00:06:26.300> that<00:06:26.599> well<00:06:26.839> I<00:06:27.080> don't<00:06:27.499> know<00:06:27.649> I

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
figure like that well I don't know I

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.379 
figure like that well I don't know I
wait<00:06:28.099> to<00:06:28.189> put<00:06:28.339> my<00:06:28.369> personal<00:06:28.819> touch<00:06:29.029> on<00:06:29.149> a<00:06:29.209> lot

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:29.389 
wait to put my personal touch on a lot

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.420 
wait to put my personal touch on a lot
of<00:06:29.509> things<00:06:29.659> and<00:06:29.959> again<00:06:30.409> this<00:06:30.649> technique<00:06:31.279> is

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
of things and again this technique is

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.549 
of things and again this technique is
just<00:06:31.729> really<00:06:32.029> really<00:06:32.779> fun<00:06:33.080> but<00:06:33.349> a<00:06:33.379> lot<00:06:33.529> of

00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:33.559

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 
people are asking me about it so i

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:40.329 
people are asking me about it so i
figured<00:06:36.319> i<00:06:36.589> would<00:06:36.919> share<00:06:37.459> my<00:06:37.789> wisdom<00:06:38.059> on<00:06:38.659> it<00:06:39.339> so

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:40.339 
figured i would share my wisdom on it so

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:41.260 
figured i would share my wisdom on it so
let's<00:06:40.459> take<00:06:40.580> a<00:06:40.639> look<00:06:40.849> at<00:06:40.969> some<00:06:41.059> of<00:06:41.119> the<00:06:41.240> other

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
let's take a look at some of the other

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:54.480 
let's take a look at some of the other
figures<00:06:41.779> that<00:06:41.990> you<00:06:42.020> can<00:06:42.229> a<00:06:42.369> dry<00:06:43.369> brush

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.590

dry brushing can be applied to a
