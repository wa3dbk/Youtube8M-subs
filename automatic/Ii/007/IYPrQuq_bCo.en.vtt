ebay fairly cheap then next is the

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.649 
ebay fairly cheap then next is the
Rubik's<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.340> bed<00:02:46.519> oh<00:02:46.549> this<00:02:47.329> is<00:02:47.510> like<00:02:47.629> really

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
Rubik's to bed oh this is like really

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:52.240 
Rubik's to bed oh this is like really
small<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:49.540> mine<00:02:50.540> actually<00:02:50.780> broke<00:02:51.410> let's<00:02:52.010> see

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
small and mine actually broke let's see

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.059 
small and mine actually broke let's see
here<00:02:52.720> there<00:02:53.720> we<00:02:53.810> go<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:54.260> piece<00:02:54.530> snapped<00:02:54.890> off

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
here there we go that piece snapped off

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.210 
here there we go that piece snapped off
it's<00:02:55.400> supposed<00:02:55.579> to<00:02:55.730> be<00:02:55.849> like<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:57.220> but

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
it's supposed to be like that but

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.479 
it's supposed to be like that but
luckily<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.609> have<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.079> issuing<00:03:00.079> Dubai<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.530> very

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
luckily I have a issuing Dubai to very

luckily I have a issuing Dubai to very
smooth<00:03:01.909> very<00:03:02.359> like<00:03:04.720> like<00:03:05.720> it's<00:03:05.900> bigger<00:03:06.290> so

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
smooth very like like it's bigger so

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.440 
smooth very like like it's bigger so
it's<00:03:06.739> like<00:03:06.859> easier<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.459> hold<00:03:07.670> very<00:03:08.239> like

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
it's like easier to hold very like

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.020 
it's like easier to hold very like
handle<00:03:10.420> then<00:03:11.420> next<00:03:11.720> up<00:03:12.019> is<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:13.030> Rubik's

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
handle then next up is the Rubik's

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.789 
handle then next up is the Rubik's
teaching<00:03:15.040> it's<00:03:16.040> very<00:03:16.340> small<00:03:16.760> kind<00:03:17.480> of<00:03:17.540> hard

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
teaching it's very small kind of hard

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.659 
teaching it's very small kind of hard
knocks<00:03:18.799> up<00:03:19.099> a<00:03:19.220> lot<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:21.560> key<00:03:21.919> chain<00:03:22.220> gets<00:03:22.400> in<00:03:22.609> a

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
knocks up a lot the key chain gets in a

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.610 
knocks up a lot the key chain gets in a
lot<00:03:22.880> a<00:03:23.000> lot<00:03:23.209> in<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.480> way<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:23.840> lot<00:03:24.109> so<00:03:24.440> that's

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
lot a lot in the way a lot so that's

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.940 
lot a lot in the way a lot so that's
really<00:03:24.889> annoying<00:03:26.620> then<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:28.130> Rubik's<00:03:28.700> snake

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
really annoying then the Rubik's snake

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.190 
really annoying then the Rubik's snake
like<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:31.099> more<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.489> a<00:03:31.549> twisty<00:03:32.090> puzzle<00:03:32.540> than<00:03:32.930> just

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
like a more of a twisty puzzle than just

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.879 
like a more of a twisty puzzle than just
a<00:03:34.540> like<00:03:35.540> something<00:03:36.230> they<00:03:36.290> actually<00:03:36.709> have<00:03:36.829> to

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
a like something they actually have to

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.659 
a like something they actually have to
like<00:03:37.099> learn<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.419> takes<00:03:38.720> while<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.139> learn<00:03:39.290> and

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
like learn and takes while to learn and

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.000 
like learn and takes while to learn and
then<00:03:40.750> that's<00:03:41.750> all<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.200> cubes<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.590> I<00:03:42.799> have

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
then that's all the cubes that I have

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.550 
then that's all the cubes that I have
and<00:03:43.819> then<00:03:44.060> there<00:03:44.239> is<00:03:44.359> this<00:03:44.540> Kate<00:03:45.019> eight<00:03:45.260> ball

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
and then there is this Kate eight ball

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.400 
and then there is this Kate eight ball
it's<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.910> exact<00:03:47.299> same<00:03:47.329> thing<00:03:47.780> as<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.959> two<00:03:48.260> by

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
it's the exact same thing as a two by

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.319 
it's the exact same thing as a two by
two<00:03:50.859> somebody<00:03:51.859> actually<00:03:52.190> let<00:03:52.579> me<00:03:52.699> borrow<00:03:52.940> this

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
two somebody actually let me borrow this

probably also going to get a megaminx a

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:16.180 
probably also going to get a megaminx a
pyraminx<00:04:12.970> ice<00:04:13.970> cube<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.959> cube<00:04:15.500> ultimate<00:04:15.949> soon

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
pyraminx ice cube and cube ultimate soon

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.080 
pyraminx ice cube and cube ultimate soon
but<00:04:17.180> I<00:04:17.690> haven't<00:04:18.079> ordered<00:04:18.320> them<00:04:18.590> yet<00:04:18.970> so<00:04:19.970> yeah
