00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
do it to make things easy is this this

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.639 
do it to make things easy is this this
tool<00:00:34.620> right<00:00:34.920> here<00:00:35.480> it's<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.690> socket<00:00:36.989> that's<00:00:37.440> got

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
tool right here it's a socket that's got

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.350 
tool right here it's a socket that's got
that<00:00:37.829> piece<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.250> metal<00:00:38.550> done<00:00:38.670> already<00:00:39.030> put<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that piece of metal done already put it

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420 
that piece of metal done already put it
in<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> other<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.410> think<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.980> right<00:00:41.190> here

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
in the other and I think this right here

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.160 
in the other and I think this right here
might<00:00:41.670> work<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.120> something<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> Briggs<00:00:42.960> &amp;

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
might work on something on a Briggs &amp;

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.279 
might work on something on a Briggs &amp;
Stratton<00:00:44.000> there<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.180> happens<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.899> snap

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
Stratton there this happens to be a snap

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.369 
Stratton there this happens to be a snap
off<00:00:46.590> they<00:00:47.460> don't<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.350> I

your advantage in the machine shop what
brought<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.470> mind<00:01:22.710> when<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.220> buy<00:01:23.580> this

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
brought that to mind when you buy this

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.760 
brought that to mind when you buy this
thing<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:24.509> now<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.170> right<00:01:25.439> there<00:01:25.470> is

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
thing right here now that right there is

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.580 
thing right here now that right there is
pretty<00:01:25.920> well<00:01:26.189> flat<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.990> I'm

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
pretty well flat but the one that I'm

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.330 
pretty well flat but the one that I'm
using<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:31.140> was<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> little<00:01:31.799> bit<00:01:32.009> oval

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
using here it it was a little bit oval

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.120 
using here it it was a little bit oval
shape<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.060> small<00:01:33.810> amount<00:01:33.990> few<00:01:34.590> thousands

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
shape just a small amount few thousands

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.050 
shape just a small amount few thousands
so<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.820> filed<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.720> flat<00:01:37.110> all<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.590> way<00:01:37.740> across

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
so I filed it flat all the way across

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.910 
so I filed it flat all the way across
and<00:01:39.060> when<00:01:39.299> you've<00:01:39.450> got<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.079> device<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and when you've got that in device and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160 
and when you've got that in device and
you're<00:01:41.189> looking<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.329> wave<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
you're looking at it the wave in a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.530 
you're looking at it the wave in a
sunlight<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.250> way<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> light<00:01:44.759> shines<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:45.329> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
sunlight the way the light shines on it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.230 
sunlight the way the light shines on it
you<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.290> actually<00:01:46.470> tell<00:01:47.130> if<00:01:47.399> you're<00:01:47.670> falling

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
you can actually tell if you're falling

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.149 
you can actually tell if you're falling
at<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.259> bevel<00:01:50.119> because<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:52.049> shadow<00:01:52.380> line<00:01:52.710> on

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
at a bevel because the shadow line on

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.749 
at a bevel because the shadow line on
that<00:01:53.579> end<00:01:53.939> will<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.299> longer<00:01:55.170> than<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.430> over

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
that end will be longer than it is over

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.420 
that end will be longer than it is over
here<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.509> main<00:01:58.020> objective<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.890> make<00:01:59.189> that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
here the main objective is to make that

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.810 
here the main objective is to make that
shadow<00:01:59.790> line<00:02:00.180> go<00:02:01.140> away<00:02:01.500> evenly<00:02:02.219> all<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.490> way

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
shadow line go away evenly all the way

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.510 
shadow line go away evenly all the way

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
ever on this before you put a

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.780 
ever on this before you put a
screwdriver<00:04:34.740> in<00:04:35.250> there<00:04:35.400> they've<00:04:35.640> already

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
screwdriver in there they've already

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.590 
screwdriver in there they've already
done<00:04:36.210> already<00:04:36.630> have<00:04:37.590> ruined<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.850> so<00:04:39.390> if<00:04:39.480> you

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
done already have ruined it so if you

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.040 
done already have ruined it so if you
can<00:04:39.810> save<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.370> but<00:04:41.370> anyways<00:04:42.330> these<00:04:42.750> things

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
can save it but anyways these things

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.870 
can save it but anyways these things
right<00:04:43.260> here<00:04:43.470> will<00:04:43.650> be<00:04:43.860> an<00:04:43.950> in<00:04:44.100> flywheel<00:04:44.580> so

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
right here will be an in flywheel so

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.270 
right here will be an in flywheel so
tight<00:04:45.180> that<00:04:45.600> sometimes<00:04:46.290> it's<00:04:46.560> better<00:04:46.770> just<00:04:46.920> to

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
tight that sometimes it's better just to

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.690 
tight that sometimes it's better just to
chisel<00:04:47.910> less<00:04:48.090> off<00:04:48.590> get<00:04:49.590> this<00:04:49.830> off<00:04:50.070> put<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.460> pair

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
chisel less off get this off put a pair

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.130 
chisel less off get this off put a pair
of<00:04:50.760> clamps<00:04:50.970> on<00:04:51.300> and<00:04:51.450> get<00:04:51.600> it<00:04:51.750> out<00:04:51.900> of<00:04:51.930> there

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
of clamps on and get it out of there

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.730 
of clamps on and get it out of there
drill<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.560> down

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
drill it down

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.950 
drill it down
do<00:04:52.890> what<00:04:53.070> you<00:04:53.160> got<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.370> do<00:04:53.610> just<00:04:53.880> don't<00:04:54.750> be

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
do what you got to do just don't be

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.570 
do what you got to do just don't be

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
fooling around whether they just get it

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.760 
fooling around whether they just get it
out<00:04:56.700> of<00:04:56.760> there<00:04:57.120> because<00:04:57.630> you<00:04:57.840> can<00:04:58.110> buy<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.440> all
