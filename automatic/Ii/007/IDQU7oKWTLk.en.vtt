00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.080 
set up the frame rates and then just
check<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.870> frame<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.530> my<00:02:13.800> drop<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:14.970> you

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
check on what frame is my drop so as you

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.270 
check on what frame is my drop so as you
can<00:02:15.180> see<00:02:15.420> here<00:02:15.599> in<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.780> intro<00:02:16.140> here's<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
can see here in this intro here's the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.210 
can see here in this intro here's the
second<00:02:17.670> rope<00:02:17.819> at<00:02:19.430> 157<00:02:20.430> frames<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:23.069> do<00:02:23.190> this

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
second rope at 157 frames so to do this

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.430 
second rope at 157 frames so to do this
I'm<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:25.459> 157<00:02:26.459> frames<00:02:26.760> put<00:02:27.270> there<00:02:27.480> no<00:02:28.110> no

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
I'm going on 157 frames put there no no

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.430 
I'm going on 157 frames put there no no
no<00:02:28.560> 10<00:02:28.860> frames<00:02:29.129> in<00:02:29.430> front<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.910> like<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:30.660> 147

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
no 10 frames in front of it like on 147

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.460 
no 10 frames in front of it like on 147
I'm<00:02:31.650> putting<00:02:31.920> frame<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.640> then<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:34.550> 157

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
I'm putting frame and then on 157

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.470 
I'm putting frame and then on 157
57-year<00:02:37.470> I'm<00:02:37.800> going<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.340> make<00:02:38.700> my<00:02:39.150> camera

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
57-year I'm going to make my camera

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.580 
57-year I'm going to make my camera
movement<00:02:39.840> something<00:02:40.110> like<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.379> maybe

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
movement something like this maybe

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.400 
movement something like this maybe
whatever<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:42.239> figure<00:02:42.959> some<00:02:43.560> stuff<00:02:43.590> out<00:02:44.360> so

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
whatever just figure some stuff out so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.759 
whatever just figure some stuff out so
what<00:02:46.410> we<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:46.680> did<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.160> we<00:02:47.760> sent<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.769> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
what we just did is we sent it to the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.420 
what we just did is we sent it to the
drop<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:51.540> also<00:02:51.720> synced<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.099> second

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
drop and we also synced it to the second

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.660 
drop and we also synced it to the second
drop<00:02:53.610> arm<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.349> make<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.680> quite<00:02:56.069> nicer<00:02:56.459> I

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
drop arm and to make this quite nicer I

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.990 
drop arm and to make this quite nicer I
have<00:02:56.940> one<00:02:57.750> small<00:02:58.019> tip<00:02:58.590> for<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.010> as<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.940> can

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
have one small tip for you as you can

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.460 
have one small tip for you as you can
see<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.300> camera<00:03:00.480> movement<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:00.959> going<00:03:01.319> like

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
see the camera movement is going like

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.410 
see the camera movement is going like
pretty<00:03:02.099> slow<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.430> at<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.849> drop<00:03:03.090> there's

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
pretty slow and at the drop there's

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.649 
pretty slow and at the drop there's
nothing<00:03:03.810> that's<00:03:04.200> not<00:03:04.379> it<00:03:04.590> nothing<00:03:04.950> special<00:03:05.310> to

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
nothing that's not it nothing special to

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.699 
nothing that's not it nothing special to
do<00:03:06.659> it<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.290> bit<00:03:07.620> different<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.250> can<00:03:08.459> go<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:08.940> like

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
do it a bit different you can go on like

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.190 
do it a bit different you can go on like
30<00:03:10.709> or<00:03:10.830> 40<00:03:11.280> frames<00:03:11.489> make<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.360> keyframe<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:13.080> your

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
30 or 40 frames make a keyframe in your

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.830 
30 or 40 frames make a keyframe in your
camera<00:03:13.530> movement<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.069> put<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.700> 10<00:03:15.060> frames<00:03:15.540> and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
camera movement and put a 10 frames and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.740 
camera movement and put a 10 frames and
front<00:03:16.110> off<00:03:16.260> your<00:03:16.650> drop<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:18.150> just<00:03:18.450> drag<00:03:18.720> it

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
front off your drop so just drag it

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.140 
front off your drop so just drag it
there<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.830> can<00:03:19.890> also<00:03:20.129> do<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.489> with<00:03:20.550> F<00:03:20.879> curve

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
there you can also do this with F curve

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.229 
there you can also do this with F curve
but<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.420> don't<00:03:21.659> like<00:03:22.050> this<00:03:22.230> as<00:03:22.440> much<00:03:22.470> as<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:23.239> so

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
but I don't like this as much as this so

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.270 
but I don't like this as much as this so
yeah<00:03:24.420> it's<00:03:24.659> going<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.959> be<00:03:25.019> super<00:03:25.349> slow<00:03:25.680> at<00:03:25.860> at

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
yeah it's going to be super slow at at

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.860 
yeah it's going to be super slow at at
the<00:03:26.340> beginning<00:03:26.879> and<00:03:27.030> then<00:03:27.239> at<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.480> drop<00:03:27.720> it's

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
the beginning and then at the drop it's

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.259 
the beginning and then at the drop it's
going<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.170> explode<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:29.069> this<00:03:29.879> is<00:03:30.000> what<00:03:30.239> I

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
going to explode and this is what I

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.160 
going to explode and this is what I
pretty<00:03:30.840> much<00:03:30.959> like<00:03:31.319> about<00:03:31.650> cinema<00:03:32.459> 4d<00:03:32.760> um<00:03:33.360> the

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
dynamic stuff it's like moving with the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.300 
dynamic stuff it's like moving with the
camera<00:03:37.200> it's<00:03:37.379> like<00:03:37.560> yeah<00:03:37.860> pretty<00:03:38.129> nice

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
just read the frames and with the same

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.360 
just read the frames and with the same
frame<00:03:48.299> rate<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.599> can<00:03:48.629> do<00:03:48.900> quite<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.980> same<00:03:50.190> in

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
frame rate you can do quite the same in

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
frame rate you can do quite the same in
cinema<00:03:50.640> 4d<00:03:50.670> so<00:03:51.799> just<00:03:52.799> remember<00:03:52.970> set<00:03:53.970> up<00:03:54.180> the

cinema 4d so just remember set up the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.690 
cinema 4d so just remember set up the
same<00:03:54.540> frame<00:03:54.840> rate<00:03:55.080> in<00:03:55.260> both<00:03:55.799> programs<00:03:56.220> cinema

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
same frame rate in both programs cinema

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.369 
same frame rate in both programs cinema
4d<00:03:56.909> and<00:03:57.090> after<00:03:57.510> effects<00:03:57.689> or<00:03:57.900> Sony<00:03:58.200> Vegas
