00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.710
 hey people and we come to a new one 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.750
 tutorial 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.130
 Today I introduce you the head client 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.620
 dynamic before so chosen as all 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.700
 first time on multiplayer now can 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.100
 we have a new account 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.470
 Log in besides also stands here 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.950
 our login status so I'm straight 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.570
 as a premium then to log the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.570
 best on any server 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:35.000
 if we are on it will be left too 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.690
 what version we catch 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.600
 we on 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.820
 first we express times that scan 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.100
 then come with our arrow keys 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.000
 this menu here is a window that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.979
 is called windows 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.290
 here we can now other windows 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.500
 we can come here to activate 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.450
 here for tail land so small hacks 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.350
 set which have disabled 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.100
 want to play player here so sprint 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.750
 step fly and you already have the below 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.720
 incident seen like the witch 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.440
 work that way then we have here 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.460
 a special feature is alstria 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.410
 I'll put that down here if you can 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.050
 So this one activates when the next one 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.560
 it stays bright even if it is bright 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.270
 knows press mother so now we see 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.340
 always what is behind us is the 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.680
 is of advantage if we are on a pvp 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.560
 servers are and we are from behind 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.420
 can be attacked 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.020
 let's turn off that again 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.520
 but are now here is the 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.980
 console you already have in the credits 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.640
 seen here we can eg freecom 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.770
 enter 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.770
 when in freak mode 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.440
 so shows off again and give the 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.200
 freak m 1 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.180
 so we disable that very well 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.660
 I always do away with the console 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.180
 fold back and away with the window 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.560
 Mr, here is another map we press 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:07.630
 that is also so pure, we see us there 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.490
 and of course the more space we do 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.370
 that's gone too, we have him there 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.130
 Youtube now no signal for it 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.820
 you need the friend manager here 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.850
 is already chosen anyway I believe 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.800
 that the programmer or something will be me 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.780
 unfortunately I have no friends at the moment 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.620
 server so I give my own 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.290
 name one 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.170
 we press here on the plus then 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.460
 there's auto az and remote viewer on us 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.530
 press on freimuth four on top signal 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:43.510
 and that's the miniature of 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:47.160
 So we do that on our big screen 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:52.510
 also gone again then we have settings 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.640
 values ​​then we also have astana range 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.290
 the diligence beat so how fast we 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.780
 I can also show a short fly 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:07.590
 if I have 14 here and flyers do 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:12.000
 at player you already see so mediocre 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:15.430
 value meat fry once more 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.390
 reactivated as you can see you are very 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:23.680
 I'll do it again soon 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:26.320
 so have two about here 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.600
 we keep stepping that means 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.340
 if you stay up here like this 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.710
 So how high does he go if he has a three 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.190
 blocks high wall is if we because there too 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.630
 goes up or if he just runs in front of it 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.700
 then I believe that myself 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.700
 explain how much the degrades and almost 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.040
 place how fast blocks set 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.020
 press return here on the bands can 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.710
 you adjust which tail on which 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.150
 button should be activated 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.610
 in the description are there too 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.800
 times the standards so I out so 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.450
 have found so my server it can 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.010
 just greased so I like in 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.040
 singleplayer wanted because the version is 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.480
 just too unstable so there we go 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.280
 the extra manager here you can 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.250
 Select blocks to be displayed 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.050
 should when the axway unfolds so 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.180
 For example, if I'm doing this now 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.250
 and cx will also depress the earth 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.740
 displayed is rather pointless 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:22.470
 because you only want the precious ones 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:24.030
 see raw materials because I hope so 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.070
