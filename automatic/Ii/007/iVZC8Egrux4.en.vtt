to do the quilting with the back the
back<00:00:13.469> king<00:00:14.219> on<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.400> top<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:15.599> want<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.900> use<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
back king on the top you want to use a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.769 
back king on the top you want to use a
walking<00:00:16.529> foot<00:00:16.949> it'll<00:00:17.789> allow<00:00:18.090> these<00:00:18.420> layers

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
walking foot it'll allow these layers

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.170 
walking foot it'll allow these layers
that<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.140> batting<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> back<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.970> feed

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
that have batting in the back to feed

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.109 
that have batting in the back to feed
together<00:00:21.600> easily<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:23.490> foot<00:00:23.699> I've<00:00:23.850> just

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
together easily the foot I've just

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.269 
together easily the foot I've just
snapped<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.199> interchangeable<00:00:25.980> dual

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
snapped on is the interchangeable dual

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.660 
snapped on is the interchangeable dual
feed<00:00:26.730> which<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.599> new<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.949> has<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.369> quarter

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
feed which is new and it has the quarter

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.340 
feed which is new and it has the quarter
inch<00:00:29.849> markings<00:00:30.449> right<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.500> foot<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:33.390> now<00:00:34.290> I

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
inch markings right on the foot so now I

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.110 
inch markings right on the foot so now I
have<00:00:34.770> two<00:00:35.130> fabrics<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:35.940> back<00:00:36.239> eat<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.809> back

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
have two fabrics with back eat with back

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:54.020 
have two fabrics with back eat with back
so<00:00:39.950> my<00:00:40.950> thread<00:00:41.250> cut<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> again<00:00:53.820> I'm<00:00:54.000> just

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
so my thread cut so again I'm just

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.470 
so my thread cut so again I'm just
guiding<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.260> allows<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.920> layers<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.670> be

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
guiding and it allows the layers to be

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.670 
guiding and it allows the layers to be
evenly

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.549 

essentially<00:01:02.520> Suze<00:01:03.060> it's<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.510> pink<00:01:04.320> peach

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
essentially Suze it's a pink peach

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.680 
essentially Suze it's a pink peach
working<00:01:05.070> instead<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.910> the<00:01:06.060> ones<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
working instead of just the ones on the

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.340 
working instead of just the ones on the
bottom<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.800> it<00:01:08.010> keeps<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.850> shifting<00:01:09.420> down<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
bottom so it keeps the shifting down to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.260 
bottom so it keeps the shifting down to
a<00:01:10.380> minimum

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
a minimum

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.990 
a minimum
so<00:01:12.270> after<00:01:13.200> you've<00:01:13.380> had<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:13.950> quilt<00:01:14.520> feast

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
so after you've had your quilt feast

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.090 
so after you've had your quilt feast
pinned<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.600> ready<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.960> go<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.470> next<00:01:16.500> thing<00:01:16.979> we

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
pinned and ready to go the next thing we

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.730 
pinned and ready to go the next thing we
likely<00:01:17.340> want<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.420> stitch<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.440> ditch

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
likely want to do is stitch in a ditch

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.880 
likely want to do is stitch in a ditch
before<00:01:20.160> we<00:01:20.640> begin<00:01:21.150> our<00:01:21.210> motifs<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.500> stitch<00:01:22.740> in

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
before we begin our motifs the stitch in

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.070 
before we begin our motifs the stitch in
the<00:01:23.010> ditch<00:01:23.040> foot<00:01:23.550> is<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:24.840> guide

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the ditch foot is the one with the guide

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.510 
the ditch foot is the one with the guide
in<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.680> middle<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:28.770> also<00:01:28.800> just

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
in the middle so that one also just

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.590 
in the middle so that one also just
snaps<00:01:29.820> right<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:31.880> there's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.000> little<00:01:33.090> bit<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.510> a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
snaps right on there's a little bit of a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.230 
snaps right on there's a little bit of a
magnet<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.290> back<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:34.890> foot<00:01:35.240> under

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
magnet to the back of the foot under

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.660 
magnet to the back of the foot under
there<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.140> get<00:01:37.290> my<00:01:37.410> threads<00:01:37.830> out<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.280> way

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.960 

this<00:01:41.670> time<00:01:42.030> I'm<00:01:42.300> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.630> place<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.970> braid

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
this time I'm going to place that braid

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.389 
this time I'm going to place that braid
right<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.979> middle<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.009> have

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
right in the middle and because I have

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.469 
right in the middle and because I have
the<00:01:50.640> blade<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:53.250> makes<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:53.759> easy<00:01:53.940> for<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.450> to

the blade it makes it easy for you to
stay<00:01:54.840> right<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.860> ditch<00:01:56.119> instead<00:01:57.119> of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
stay right in the ditch instead of

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.330 
stay right in the ditch instead of
trying<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.660> follow<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.619> an<00:01:58.770> open<00:01:59.130> toe

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
trying to follow it with an open toe

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.969 
trying to follow it with an open toe

tendency<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.510> shift<00:02:42.900> around<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:44.190> now<00:02:44.459> I'm

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579
