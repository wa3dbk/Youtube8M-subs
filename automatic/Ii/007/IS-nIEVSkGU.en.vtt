make a good little contact with with

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.610 
make a good little contact with with
these<00:02:18.250> batteries<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:19.030> probably<00:02:19.990> don't<00:02:20.170> need<00:02:20.410> on

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
these batteries I probably don't need on

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.699 
these batteries I probably don't need on
one<00:02:20.709> an<00:02:21.100> so<00:02:21.370> let's<00:02:21.610> come<00:02:21.819> up<00:02:21.850> here<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:22.709> a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
just quickly touch it and then I'm going

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.449 
just quickly touch it and then I'm going
to<00:02:33.400> do<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.900> I'm<00:02:34.900> going<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.170> shut<00:02:35.319> this<00:02:35.470> off<00:02:35.680> now

if you're going to really wrap we should
have<00:02:40.180> increased<00:02:40.450> our<00:02:40.840> voltage<00:02:41.319> a<00:02:41.470> little<00:02:41.709> bit

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
have increased our voltage a little bit

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.000 
have increased our voltage a little bit
by<00:02:42.580> running<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:42.910> good<00:02:43.090> charge<00:02:43.420> through<00:02:43.750> there

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
by running a good charge through there

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.259 
by running a good charge through there
there<00:02:45.010> we<00:02:45.160> go<00:02:45.310> with<00:02:45.519> just<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.820> little<00:02:46.060> bit<00:02:46.180> of

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269
