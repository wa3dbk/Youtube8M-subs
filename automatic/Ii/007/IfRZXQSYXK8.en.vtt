00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
I think different coaches of I've tried

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.320 
I think different coaches of I've tried
to<00:03:15.620> open<00:03:15.710> up<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.130> target<00:03:16.430> football<00:03:16.850> at<00:03:17.060> all<00:03:17.150> and

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
I think until I've been one of the ones

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.580 
I think until I've been one of the ones
just<00:03:18.590> try<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:18.890> embrace<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.460> philosophy

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
just try to embrace that philosophy
