00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.920
 Hi everyone, here we are with a new one 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.360
 video always aside to write in 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.969
 this new video we start well with a 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.099
 beautiful sunset in the background with a new one 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.499
 building that you haven't seen yet 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.740
 you'll wonder who knows what it is 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.750
 well we are always tutorial world 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.240
 and now I'll show you this new stuff 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.430
 meanwhile construction put day 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.200
 ok this setting tools 23 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.930
 meghni nothing asked for only two 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.849
 mob spiner because in this video and 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.250
 let's create how to create let's say one 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.140
 farm experience to do a 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.360
 experience that is very easy to do 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.820
 also in the servers you must first find 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.470
 but a dungeon 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.640
 here on 2 they throw in here a little 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.010
 get smaller or you can take if 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 sell liszt pauner to the shop of the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.729
 server 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.440
 you can build your own well 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:55.589
 let's see that everything to operate 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.659
 aesthetic and ugly to see two cubes in ho 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:01.559
 divided into two because there is a part 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:04.409
 cinematic spammers experience 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.479
 already done during the build one have 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.840
 done another is a normal world for 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.439
 to show how good we will now 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.439
 let's go in, kid, immediately the water goes 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.090
 well you are in our spiner once and 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.549
 therefore being able to silence 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.090
 I all the tribes who put the water is 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.670
 in one side so everything here is filled with 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.840
 seven questions the water covers this 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.500
 world 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.979
 then below are signs for a 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.869
 pound to water and what tennis 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.399
 like this or even fifth 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.530
 place don't shut up and then we are 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.920
 narrow because super-flat heart 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.049
 before giving 1.4 this I did well 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.380
 this one here I did it now let's move on 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:55.650
 to the one to be built well we take 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.260
 done right away 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.650
 positioning the cruise a 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.710
 water all here as I said before is 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:21.570
 so rich among pizza then everyone is here 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:23.550
 the holes dug we expire then yes 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:30.790
 it starts 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:34.330
 you understand this we are here and 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.740
 take the sign 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.480
 let's look at the water has rivals then for 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.650
 don't put them in absolute form, but maybe 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:49.010
 then our no 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:51.849
 6 place them with hair without being 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.849
 dragged away by the water 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:16.300
 well here it is in practice would be the 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:18.570
 prima facie digging the story 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.570
 local 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:31.970
 ok once you do this you think 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:37.340
 especially to see and see what 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:40.310
 it happens on the world scene because I want to 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.690
 remember that the building will be there 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.579
 an out of the squadron only if 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.470
 you're pretty close because then 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.299
 don't think of doing it for very little fishing 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.769
 so the noise does not happen 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.319
 automatically no because I don't know not 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.879
 we were there is you can be in two 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.129
 need one below that collects 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.799
 the other I know why they have to go out then though 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.599
 let's say with just a little bit of damp 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.830
 here avoid being the most 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.260
 rubbish dump 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.890
 in quantity and comfortable more than anything else for 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:10.190
 when they are for sale coop move them either 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.110
 place two or three next to the 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.630
 compare continuously but they are all 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:31.930
 well let's try our zombie 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:31.930
 dig a person fall 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:57.830
 in a server server without a world 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.920
 on the normal role that is not a world 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.720
 normal not super flat so we go out 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.720
 single player did it here 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.069
 here it is, let's put this in my mind 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.950
 he said it was the team I have 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:21.570
 found his net4 land uncovered 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.760
 our local land that is coffee as well 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.350
 we are 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.570
 I put all the buckets of water as I have 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.570
 called economic first 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.500
 here he climbed the program because the 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.480
 again remained pilato do so before 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.510
 to the historian 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.200
 here it is 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.510
 always skip 12 we put the signs 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:50.830
 and here it is still spoken one more in 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:53.530
 game the so the zombies come can 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.580
 be here in the street this morning 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.140
 expect 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.140
 then if you want you can do 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:25.170
 I take the steps down here people 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.560
 so 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:50.729
 in the four china he wants to before going up 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.729
 quite deep 

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:57.289
 well anyway we do ours 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:00.040
 destination trap as also made from here 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:02.590
 seven are the signs and fans 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.690
 no trap and maybe we can do it 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.000
 our home faction above the parties 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:11.820
 we are a passage with steps or with 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.410
 the stairs that practically go down 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.580
 they fall into the position we have chosen 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.580
 that is us 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.730
 not so 609 bis calini go up up 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.280
 to our house but I said this is 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.139
 all 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.270
 simple tutorial but useful because not 

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:29.280
 he knew is useful maybe for those who 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.470
 they did differently for things like that 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.010
 we do everything they threw themselves in the middle 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:37.710
 maybe skeletons 56 skeletons bam arrows 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:40.070
 everywhere the previous canon e 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:43.010
 private 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:46.320
 well they left with the sunset and 

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:48.889
 we end with a beautiful sunset I was wrong 

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.889
 to click 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.860
 we are going to complete a lot without world 

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.750
 because I paid it 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:00.039
 said this hello to everyone to the next 

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.039
 video from kraft writes
