 good to all welcome to solutions 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.470
 online computers in this new video 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.740
 I bring you the unboxing and the review of the bq 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.169
 edition 2 quad core in its version of 32 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.050
 gb here as you can see is the version of 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.849
 32 GB incorporates the Dolby system 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.589
 audio in the back you can see 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.400
 some features of the tablet 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:32.180
 10 point capacitive screen 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:37.280
 ips screen of 1280 x 800 pixels 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:40.460
 nacher ips hd the processor is a cpu 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.630
 cortex a9 the microsd bluetooth slot 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.540
 4.0 a lyon battery of 8,600 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.520
 milliamps connectivity wifi the 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.360
 cameras both the front with the back 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.090
 incorporated into the 2gb ram and 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.800
 4.2 Android operating system 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.800
 gy living let's open it 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.260
 You must bq 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.470
 and now I have open because I needed 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.320
 use it for college subjects had 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.560
 with this protector that is supposed to be 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.560
 mink 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.780
 and this is what comes like that in the box 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.980
 in the well padded here we have the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.630
 tablet that I will now teach 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.120
 here we have an instruction manual 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.890
 and the guarantee 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.890
 for instructions and warranty 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.140
 micro usb usb micro usb cable for 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:48.060
 connect it to the computer and to load it 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:51.510
 and the power cable the plug is worth 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.360
 to load it well there are accessories 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.980
 apart 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.730
 we get with the tablet 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.730
 and you have them 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.850
 here is the scholarship 45 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.569
 As you can see I am going to teach you 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.799
 very pretty 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.629
 here we can see two speakers you have to 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.849
 highlight that this here back is in 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.099
 aluminum the advantage of aluminum is that 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.079
 dissipates the heat better and the truth as 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.359
 I said I already used I did not have any 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.120
 problem with the heat in no time 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:34.189
 it has warmed up the least so 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.290
 I go because I think plastic 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.849
 quietly but they form aluminum 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.370
 then at the time of finishing and 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.670
 heat dissipation and as I said all 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.730
 well 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.930
 it is appreciated then here we have the camera 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.910
 which is 2 megapixels the cameras do not 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.340
 They are very good at the general level of 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.400
 no tablet the camera 2 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.310
 megapixels ok the screen 10 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.280
 inches of 10 with 1 inches worth in 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:06.480
 ips in hd I will tell you the resolution 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.580
 the resolution has 1280 x 800 of 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.040
 agreement on this side we have the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.660
 connections I hope you see we have 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.480
 here the entrance 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.660
 jack for the speakers an entry hdmi 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.410
 good mini hdmi to connect it to the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:26.220
 tele a tablet the microsd slot for 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.560
 a card and the slot is in micro 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.930
 usb to connect it to the computer and to 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.010
 upload it here we have a small 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.230
 building for the micro form 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.819
 for the part of here later we have 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.970
 the power button and the button 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.519
 volume up and volume down in this 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.040
 another side nothing at the bottom nothing 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.989
 not good as I told you the part 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.340
 back we've already seen this is the 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.230
 tablet 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.300
 I am very happy with her we are going to 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.390
 comment some memory characteristics 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.150
 internal 32gb really are not 32 gb 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.769
 because the operating system already occupies 6 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.860
 did not remember then we have a total 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:08.070
 of 26 gigabytes with something good almost 27 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.060
 okay let's go to the hardware of this 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.130
 device the processor is a cpu 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.760
 cortex a9 quad core ie four 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:21.329
 cores that go up to 1.6 gigahertz 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.300
 The gpu or graphic card is a mani 400 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.700
 that will be 600 megahertia the gpu 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.040
 It is also not a big pass 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.690
 it's no wonder but good yo 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.060
 I really do not want her to play or 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.790
 I love her more for topics of 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.810
 vital university so with this is 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.669
 more than enough the battery 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.480
 really the battery is 8000 600 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.590
 milliamps lasts in bq puts that last 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.390
 10 hours 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.490
 if it is not many it can last a day and 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.830
 half my mother a day and a half and if I 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.300
 you want quite well in eight hours 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.100
 melts the battery 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.320
 let's see a little this and for that 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:03.890
 what will the tablet bring the operating system 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.890
 it is android 4.2.2 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.350
 and levin 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.350
 and here is the snap bean 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.379
 and nothing we will see here applications already 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.599
 You see, it's very fluid, very fluid 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:22.409
 we have the application drawer the 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:25.259
 drawer of widgets and the truth that no 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:28.499
 problem with the tablet I'm quite 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.180
 happy therefore some inconveniences that 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:32.009
 are from my point of view are the 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.129
 cameras from my point of view not 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:37.110
 we need powerful cameras on tablets 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:40.169
 because it will not continue with the tablet is 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.169
 there that is great and good really 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.699
 It weighs 680 grams because either you're going 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.199
 there with the tablet is taking photos and 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.689
 expected to be with the tablet and took out a 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.039
 I think that to take pictures already 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:52.139
 are the phones that weigh a lot 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.689
 less and have better cameras or even 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:59.430
 in digital cameras those would be the 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:06:02.129
 slightly uncomfortable points of the tablet what 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:05.819
 good is that it has 32 gigs of memory 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:09.029
 internal we can use them completely 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:12.199
 let's teach it storage weights 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:14.610
 26 with a 94 is what I was saying 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.889
 comes with the tablet because it is 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:21.889
 operative 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:23.840
 occupies then that almost 5 gb android and then 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.379
 well here is shell available I have 25 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.030
 gb 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:31.710
 they see me from my balloon but good 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:35.790
 the battery here you see a day 13 hours then 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.980
 do not use it lately a lot 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.140
 we have it here in saving mode 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.270
 energy that this mode allows you 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.090
 It saves energy and reduces a bit 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.770
 the functions of the cpu and the gpu when 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.750
 we are not going to use it for example me of 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.850
 show you a 3d image this the 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.009
 shows equal in two of do and so on 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.960
 here to have the applications 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:56.460
 we can add users this is very 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.699
 well we can add several users 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:05.279
 price of this 32gb version cost me 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:08.069
 230 euros cost me and I have to emphasize 

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:11.039
 one thing that I thought was very good 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:14.639
 part of q and is the shipment requested the day 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:17.490
 December 30 at 5 in the afternoon and the 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:20.339
 December 31, that is, in less than 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.259
 24 hours at 12 noon and the 

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:24.839
 had at home was a super fast shipping 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:27.389
 not not use option fast shipping no 

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:29.819
 use it or send standard that we have 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:31.529
 standard to 72 hours the 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:33.599
 you have at home 

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:35.219
 and the truth that is super happy 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:38.999
 because I did not expect at all to have the 

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:41.399
 tablet in less than 24 hours so nothing 

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:42.659
 I hope you liked this video 

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:44.849
 if so, give it to there are favorites 

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:47.479
 subscribe and see you in the next 

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:47.479
 see you later
