with you I'm kind of a neat freak and I
love<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> Eugenia<00:01:02.340> does<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> camera

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
love what the Eugenia does a camera

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.969 
love what the Eugenia does a camera
mapping<00:01:03.570> technology<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.260> maps<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> ceiling

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
mapping technology it maps the ceiling

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.219 
mapping technology it maps the ceiling
so<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.060> covers<00:01:06.180> every<00:01:06.840> square

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
so I know that it covers every square

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.750 
so I know that it covers every square

inch of the house with one of the
earlier<00:01:08.970> products<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:11.070> random<00:01:11.430> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
earlier products it was very random and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.580 
earlier products it was very random and
very<00:01:12.030> sporadic<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.780> honestly<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.290> don't<00:01:13.350> think

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
very sporadic and honestly I don't think

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.960 
very sporadic and honestly I don't think
it<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.770> cleaning<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.280> whole<00:01:14.460> house<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.909> I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
it was cleaning the whole house and I

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
it was cleaning the whole house and I
was<00:01:15.060> upset<00:01:15.330> about<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.720> other<00:01:16.350> competitors

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
was upset about that other competitors

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.219 
was upset about that other competitors
out<00:01:17.250> there<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:18.090> don't<00:01:18.330> compare<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
out there just don't compare to the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.020 
out there just don't compare to the
Eugene<00:01:19.619> robot<00:01:20.420> they<00:01:21.420> are<00:01:21.540> too<00:01:21.780> loud

thing<00:02:05.190> it's<00:02:05.580> so<00:02:05.729> cool<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.750> using<00:02:07.080> device<00:02:07.350> is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
thing it's so cool the using device is

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.020 
thing it's so cool the using device is
very<00:02:07.800> very<00:02:08.009> good<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.399> me<00:02:08.519> very<00:02:08.729> conducive

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
very very good to me very conducive

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.600 
very very good to me very conducive
because<00:02:09.509> no<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.319> guys<00:02:10.470> over<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:11.310> use<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
because no have the guys over we use the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.520 
because no have the guys over we use the
mopping<00:02:11.910> device<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> UN<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:13.080> very<00:02:13.350> helpful

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
mopping device in the UN is very helpful

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.720 
mopping device in the UN is very helpful
so<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.800> don't<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.040> clean<00:02:14.220> up<00:02:14.310> after<00:02:14.519> those

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
so I don't have to clean up after those

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.790 
so I don't have to clean up after those
guys<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.569> Eugene<00:02:16.050> all<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.380> have<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.650> do

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
is put the pad on to the vacuum and it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.430 
is put the pad on to the vacuum and it
does<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.910> for<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.750> don't<00:02:21.840> have<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.290> get
