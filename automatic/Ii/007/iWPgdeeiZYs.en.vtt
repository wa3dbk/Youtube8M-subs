00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:18.050
 new combat program plays and is 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.029
 there in the specific name but 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.730
 doing balance and good not only that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.060
 they will have to jump alcoholic pin and 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.830
 kick a ball inside the bow on 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.830
 comes first to the three goals 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.800
 two for one winning the point team the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.680
 team 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.780
 if the red team wins on the day and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.579
 someone will tie here yes sir with a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.579
 golden goal to goal 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.850
 a safe area because they will be 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.379
 balancing the participants 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.719
 are going to be jumping then I can 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.969
 pass anything greater one by ones 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.820
 failures to define the fourth nominated 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.699
 it will be red it will be green 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.699
 this is very distant 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.400
 and there 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.229
 to see one kicks green 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.450
 and you have to stay bruno because it 's the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.450
 better this gesture no yes sir clear 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.980
 he hurt himself payos but he did not hurt himself asks 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.080
 assistance to stop that happens and that 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.850
 was when they fall you have to go back to 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.800
 started it came out but it helps someone to 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.590
 stop and say of course good very 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:50.039
 well perfect a goal for bruno then 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:53.590
 perhaps for them I did not know that I have 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:02:00.820
 a gentleman to see look look at you replay 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:02.679
 on the left it fell and skid clear no 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.229
 it's easy to walk up these tangos 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.929
 let alone try to run it 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:13.060
 in speed and failure fell and there 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:14.799
 he claimed this help to stand up and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.170
 take one and make a goal with 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.379
 quiet one for the green team 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.690
 then 0 for the roses the best dt no 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.930
 is not the best of three to three goals 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.130
 aires goals good very good well this is 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.130
 your yard 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.150
 we asked him to do the fourth nominated 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.099
 it will be green again or it will be red this time 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.609
 kick for everyone because this time they're 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.980
 pressure evenly matched and the role played 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:50.519
 nerves that did define fast and it 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.730
 were the two balls out sir 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.450
 we keep the result from 1 to 0 for the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.700
 green team here the team that wins 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.530
 If you win the green you win the day and you will have a 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.599
 red nominated if he wins red we'll have to 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.480
 tie here in this same game to goal 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:11.239
 from now kill or die we pluck this 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.239
 third time this is compatible 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.150
 the contract is back 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.870
 the participants like not to overcome 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.220
 by red 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.799
 of leg stick very well and defined the 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:33.830
 boy the red greet each other and we're going to 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:36.110
 be replay of having two of advantage 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.010
 for those who could if they ran fast 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.310
 in my yard good bruno one by one now 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.379
 gp if they kick the balls at the same time 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.549
 go inside the arch is worth the one that entered 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:53.980
 first one does not answer good one to one 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:57.129
 we go another rose more this is the fault of the 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.129
 fourth duel 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.230
 there is no record 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:13.230
 with him now 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.230
 and bruno kick three meters 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.590
 on the floor dejected because it fell to 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.920
 this city so that many parents 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.920
 Thank you 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.650
 They can help the team participant 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.650
 lower red says it is not 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:40.949
 and you have to hurry a little bit lose the 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.870
 balance is a gesture in fair play very 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.410
 well he runs to not disturb him 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.479
 bruno we must also highlight that and 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.360
 Bruno then kicks quietly knowing 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.090
 that was worth it was out of the game and 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.759
 the goal that puts him in advantage 2 to 1 for 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.160
 green is one goal away from winning the day 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.889
 the green team that separates the outside 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.720
 Of course there may be two people 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.039
 given team yes sir there are two people 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.960
 that are enabled for sweat to 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:11.240
 partner of the same team please 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.240
 be prepared perfect 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.220
 for all 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.590
 this is her fault 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:34.020
 for jumps jumps jumps has advantage 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:37.879
 what happens below it is accommodated to be 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.879
 and will suffer for taurus 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.729
 and 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.729
 and day for the team 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.250
 the power 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:12.450
 I approach because you will have to give the 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.450
 immunity for the first time this week
