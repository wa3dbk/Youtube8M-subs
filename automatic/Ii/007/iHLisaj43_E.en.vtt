00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.660
 and well my name is finally the day arrived 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:09.000
 of the day of wave today the government 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.060
 finally began to relax the trap 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.610
 exchange in the morning the chief cabinet 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.400
 jorge capitanich next to the owner of the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.410
 afip ricardo echegaray announced and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.810
 They made known how I was going to do this 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.789
 flexibilization formula of the trap if 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.560
 he wants we can go over a little 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.330
 remember that a 20 is destined 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.990
 percent of the situation income to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.480
 can allocate to the purchase of foreign currency 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.610
 with a maximum limit of 2 thousand dollars and what 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.360
 they will be able to make people who win 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.640
 more than 7 thousand 200 pesos in etÃ³n soles 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.980
 exactly and it was a day 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.750
 really quite moved a lot 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.360
 expectation but beyond what 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.550
 happens in the retail space with this 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.980
 debut of this partial relaxation 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.860
 The important thing happened also in 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.079
 the wholesale place where he said to see if 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.610
 It worked to full and how much it cost 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.800
 to the central bank the cap to 8 dollars 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.710
 to 8 pesos forgive the price of the dollar 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.570
 in that square and precisely at the close of 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.840
 the day Pablo had the news of 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.490
 that the central bank had sacrificed 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.290
 100 million dollars to keep it 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.300
 in that value if in a moment you thought or 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.100
 not if you talk that it could be be 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.050
 more apparently in quotation marks came out 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.150
 cheap is what they said a little in the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.340
 market 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.410
 let's remember today the peso this dollar saving 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.750
 dollar holding as he calls the government 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.940
 Soto as preferred to say dollar saving 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.160
 what happened with that dollar is not 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.360
 operated because banks because 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.650
 they received around 11 and a half 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.229
 in the morning the circular of the bank 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.360
 central and the circular says it has 72 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.700
 hours to adapt the system so that 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.619
 many would begin to leave just in 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.140
 tomorrow and if you do not have time 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.729
 even for only until Friday 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.290
 I mean many people who were 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.360
 in the morning we remember that the fib 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.660
 received in the first 10 minutes three 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.210
 thousand queries to buy 3,000 dollars 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.040
 enough consultations already averaging the 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.290
 late exceeded 30,000 queries 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.570
 a lot of those people went to banks and houses 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.580
 change and could not buy they said to him like 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.970
 the morning or the past you do not have to alert me 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.890
 ground 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.810
 when they are started with these systems 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.140
 but you have to wait a little longer for 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.970
 that's not a movement there is interesting 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.020
 de Pablo also highlight what happened in 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.840
 the parallel market 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.820
 really when one looked or analyzed 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.590
 this measure in general 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.530
 I bet 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.700
 pretended to notice that something was going to 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.620
 loosen the demand in the market 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.500
 parallel but perhaps as it was not 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.239
 full valid did not work and the dollar 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.160
 parallel closed above 12 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.930
 weights if it is stolen and what happened there is 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.340
 apparently that many who were going to 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.470
 Buy exclusively the purchase of 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.670
 parallel but what was very strong 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.410
 that was spoken in the caves is that 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.120
 compared to for example principle of 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.440
 last week the demand fell 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.660
 very much the caves were 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.090
 practically empty people went to 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.830
 see the same price went away did not sell the same 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.540
 what did the boys inflate in a 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.040
 little the price to not lose profits 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.780
 there is something in particular that is happening 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.489
 It's been a long time since people spoke of good 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.150
 is happening there is difference of up 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:08.390
 three pesos between buyer and seller what 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.970
 which had never exactly happened and 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.340
 It is also interesting to highlight the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.379
 strong rebound they had at the close 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.000
 of the day both the actions and 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.190
 Argentine bonds mainly 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.329
 then crystallized in the bag of 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.730
 New York values with actions 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.160
 both irpf and banks and 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.940
 also some electric companies without 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.069
 Right 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.680
 they had already come down a lot last week 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.810
 now they had a rebound 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.640
 very strong many consultations we are 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.739
 receiving to see that to see what it is that 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.250
 you have to do today with the money you 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.480
 you wanted to look when you analyze 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.500
 returns of Argentine papers 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.239
 as something of 2015 that men is calculated I read 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.360
 in a year and a half and before the 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.180
 presidential election 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.030
 and that renders this role very short 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.980
 term close to 13 14 percent in 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.020
 dollars is a pretty alternative 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.710
 interesting with such high performance and 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.720
 short term that hardly before 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:09.700
 a presidential election have 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.410
 problems in your payment and apart one tends 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.330
 to also think that this bonus is at 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.830
 Service action margin 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.260
 American is to say any case 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.900
 anything that happens with the 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.870
 holdouts widgets in the us east 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.270
 is vaccinated if you want to say against 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.130
 any type of charge or payments in the 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.410
 outside also another action that seems 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.419
 very attractive is the pf remember we are 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.700
 very low there are very high expectations 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.740
 put on the company and is to believe 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.090
 that it can go up a lot and the 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.990
 performance be more than interested in 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.790
 today in new york and perfection to be a 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.830
 $ 23.2 or so and had the 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.000
 close a phenomenal rise of 10 per 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.400
 one hundred dollars 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.960
 in a few minutes it was a jump of 10 by 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:56.350
 hundred logically he was 35 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.000
 that is, we agree that the market with 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.919
 a tremendous volatility risks 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.810
 tremendous so also to make it a 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.960
 both cautious because the prices go and 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.130
 they come with an impressive speed 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.680
 we must wait for the morning 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.860
 it envisions morning you can start 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.620
 move a little this dollar saving the 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.960
 caves in principle would keep the 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.789
 price even though they estimate them 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.680
 same that in the next days if 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.729
 saving starts to operate this 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.099
 mainly for savers 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.169
 lower the price should be deflated 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.000
 by a bit logic and shrink the gap 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.800
 with the official dollar well after the 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.289
 battles as always in these two cases 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.449
 of crisis and exchange rate runs are day 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.870
 a day so surely see what 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.870
 it will happen
