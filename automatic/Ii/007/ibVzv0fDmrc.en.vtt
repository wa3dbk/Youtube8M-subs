bought both of them in white okay and

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.010 
bought both of them in white okay and
I'll<00:00:13.170> start<00:00:13.650> off<00:00:13.950> by<00:00:14.820> reviewing<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> cubic

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
I'll start off by reviewing the cubic

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.090 
I'll start off by reviewing the cubic
one<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.789> cubic<00:00:18.270> one<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.750> like<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.350> oh<00:00:19.500> they

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
one so the cubic one I like it oh they

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.820 
one so the cubic one I like it oh they
are<00:00:20.160> more<00:00:20.430> better<00:00:20.880> than<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:22.199> pillow<00:00:22.560> one

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
are more better than the pillow one

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.720 
are more better than the pillow one

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
because with the pro I cannot like speed

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.679 
because with the pro I cannot like speed
cube<00:00:27.170> but<00:00:28.170> with<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:30.210> can<00:00:30.480> it's

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.030 
doesn't so um yes it corner cuts great
it<00:03:11.790> actually<00:03:12.030> turns<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:15.000> can<00:03:15.390> turn<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.320> little

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
it actually turns it can turn a little

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.060 
it actually turns it can turn a little
bit<00:03:17.430> better<00:03:17.850> than<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.480> cubic<00:03:20.120> but<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:22.070> didn't

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
bit better than the cubic but I didn't

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.640 
bit better than the cubic but I didn't
I'll<00:03:23.820> actually<00:03:24.269> my<00:03:24.450> record<00:03:24.959> was<00:03:24.989> with<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
I'll actually my record was with the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.850 
I'll actually my record was with the
cubic<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.310> with<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.269> one<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.900> got<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.620> little

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
cubic and with this one I got a little

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.449 
cubic and with this one I got a little
bit<00:03:29.100> close<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:30.380> actually<00:03:31.380> yeah<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.190> was

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
bit close to it actually yeah it was

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.789 
bit close to it actually yeah it was
close<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.090> because<00:03:33.480> some<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.049> cubic<00:03:34.500> my

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
close to it because some the cubic my

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.370 
close to it because some the cubic my
record<00:03:35.130> was<00:03:35.160> six<00:03:35.670> seconds<00:03:36.239> six<00:03:36.810> point<00:03:37.080> 33

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
record was six seconds six point 33

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.720 
record was six seconds six point 33
seconds<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.310> with<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:39.510> load<00:03:39.989> it<00:03:40.470> was<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.340> point

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
seconds and with the load it was a point

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.240 
seconds and with the load it was a point
29<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:44.010> yeah<00:03:44.190> I've<00:03:44.310> got<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:45.410> bit<00:03:46.410> closer<00:03:46.739> soon

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
29 so yeah I've got a bit closer soon

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.110 
29 so yeah I've got a bit closer soon
now<00:03:48.170> i'm<00:03:49.170> going<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.470> go<00:03:49.620> ahead<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.950> just<00:03:50.640> do<00:03:50.910> a

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
now i'm going to go ahead and just do a

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.750 
now i'm going to go ahead and just do a
solve<00:03:52.310> video

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
solve video
