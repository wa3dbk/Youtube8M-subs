 Y 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.520
 recognize the achievements push us all 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:34.020
 to move forward to recognize what we have done 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:36.300
 to take strength in the year 2012 the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.260
 result of the s can communication 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.440
 they achieved the level of 57 percent and 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.620
 our goal for 2013 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.680
 it was from 65 percent and I can 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.050
 say that the advances to the month of July 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.070
 that after applying the kit 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.070
 evaluation the result has been 65% 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.700
 in terms of mathematics according to the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.360
 results of the s in 2012 our 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.240
 result was 22.7 percent our 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.820
 proposed goals of our day 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.740
 can reach 28 percent and with 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.960
 I can tell you a lot of joy that later 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.950
 of the evaluation our students 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.500
 they are at level 2 in math in a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.300
 82% the achievement of each and every one of 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.900
 these girls is only possible because 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.360
 behind it there are many people 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.950
 working and working well all the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.100
 children have to have their own 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.140
 achievements and if any one is in 5 has to 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.990
 move to 10 if one is in 10 has to 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.450
 get to 20 if one is in 30 in wins 50 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.280
 the role of teachers the role of 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.530
 director the role of this system 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.450
 educational is that we worry about how 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.780
 says and that everyone can move forward 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.960
 because we have to get everyone 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.910
 all advance and all have achievements 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.390
 who are later and those who are 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.390
 further back
