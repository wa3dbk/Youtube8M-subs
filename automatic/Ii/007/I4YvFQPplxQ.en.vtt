00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
releases chances are they're not going

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.970 
releases chances are they're not going
to<00:02:42.090> be<00:02:42.360> impressing<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.200> with<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:43.560> one<00:02:43.770> and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
to be impressing you with this one and

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.940 
to be impressing you with this one and
if<00:02:44.310> they<00:02:44.460> have<00:02:44.790> been<00:02:44.820> impressing<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.020> guess

if they have been impressing you I guess

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.440 
if they have been impressing you I guess
the<00:02:46.980> question<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.580> how<00:02:47.640> long<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.090> they

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
the question is how long can they

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.330 
the question is how long can they
continue<00:02:48.810> doing<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.530> as<00:02:49.650> they<00:02:49.860> seem<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.310> just

continue doing it as they seem to just

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.150 
continue doing it as they seem to just
be<00:02:50.670> kind<00:02:51.240> of<00:02:51.360> repeating<00:02:51.900> themselves<00:02:52.620> for<00:02:53.070> me

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
surveillance or the song all I can grab

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.229 
surveillance or the song all I can grab
which<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.330> track<00:03:54.600> about<00:03:54.810> extreme<00:03:55.440> greed<00:03:55.890> or

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
which is a track about extreme greed or

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.940 
which is a track about extreme greed or
over<00:03:57.239> our<00:03:57.390> heads<00:03:57.750> which<00:03:58.080> seems<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.500> be<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.650> track

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
over our heads which seems to be a track

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.280 
over our heads which seems to be a track
about<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.340> imperialistic<00:04:00.239> wars<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:01.140> are

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
about the imperialistic wars that are

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.650 
about the imperialistic wars that are

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
being waged right now as I mentioned

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.330 
being waged right now as I mentioned
before<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:04.110> riffs<00:04:04.320> on<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:04.680> thing<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:04.920> lot<00:04:05.220> of

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
before the riffs on this thing a lot of

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.940 
before the riffs on this thing a lot of
power<00:04:05.550> chords<00:04:06.180> they're<00:04:06.690> pretty<00:04:06.989> speedy<00:04:07.500> every

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
power chords they're pretty speedy every

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.740 
power chords they're pretty speedy every
once<00:04:08.130> in<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.340> while<00:04:08.400> off<00:04:08.850> really<00:04:09.180> changes<00:04:09.630> up

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
once in a while off really changes up

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.690 
once in a while off really changes up
the<00:04:09.780> pace<00:04:10.050> by<00:04:10.320> doing<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.739> slower<00:04:11.100> riff

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
the pace by doing a slower riff

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.280 
the pace by doing a slower riff
maybe<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.150> break<00:04:12.450> down<00:04:12.660> something<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.170> bit

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
maybe you break down something a bit

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.530 
maybe you break down something a bit
heavier<00:04:13.740> a<00:04:13.770> bit<00:04:13.980> more<00:04:14.190> menacing<00:04:14.550> like<00:04:15.210> on<00:04:15.420> the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
heavier a bit more menacing like on the

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.509 
heavier a bit more menacing like on the
track<00:04:15.750> no<00:04:15.990> easy<00:04:16.229> escape<00:04:16.650> everyone

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
track no easy escape everyone

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.909 
track no easy escape everyone
while<00:04:17.819> there's<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.150> chaotic<00:04:18.599> guitar<00:04:19.079> solo<00:04:19.620> or<00:04:19.889> a

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
while there's a chaotic guitar solo or a

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.460 
while there's a chaotic guitar solo or a
bright<00:04:20.340> wailing<00:04:20.940> guitar<00:04:21.269> lead<00:04:21.509> so<00:04:22.019> yeah<00:04:22.289> there

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
bright wailing guitar lead so yeah there

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.980 
bright wailing guitar lead so yeah there
is<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.620> very<00:04:22.860> slight<00:04:23.280> degree<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.300> variety<00:04:24.840> on

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
is a very slight degree of variety on

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.469 
is a very slight degree of variety on
this<00:04:25.199> LP<00:04:25.379> but<00:04:25.860> it's<00:04:26.069> just<00:04:26.310> 23<00:04:27.060> minutes<00:04:27.360> of

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
this LP but it's just 23 minutes of

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.260 
this LP but it's just 23 minutes of
incredibly<00:04:27.960> fast<00:04:28.409> aggressive<00:04:29.270> socially

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
incredibly fast aggressive socially

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.839 
incredibly fast aggressive socially
aware<00:04:30.389> music<00:04:31.080> so<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.650> does<00:04:31.919> tend<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.550> run<00:04:32.819> a

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
aware music so it does tend to run a

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.360 
aware music so it does tend to run a
little<00:04:33.470> homogeneous<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.740> maybe<00:04:35.129> this

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
little homogeneous and maybe this

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.830 
little homogeneous and maybe this
becomes<00:04:35.759> more<00:04:35.970> apparent<00:04:36.090> when<00:04:36.479> some<00:04:36.690> of<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
becomes more apparent when some of the

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.300 
becomes more apparent when some of the
lyrics<00:04:37.050> on<00:04:37.409> these<00:04:37.590> tracks<00:04:37.860> aren't<00:04:38.220> that

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
lyrics on these tracks aren't that

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.129 
lyrics on these tracks aren't that
gripping<00:04:38.699> because<00:04:39.000> then<00:04:39.240> all<00:04:39.569> that<00:04:40.080> you

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
gripping because then all that you

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.230 
gripping because then all that you
really<00:04:40.500> have<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.860> ride<00:04:41.099> on<00:04:41.310> are<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:41.970> riffs

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
really have to ride on are the riffs

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.809 
really have to ride on are the riffs
which<00:04:42.599> tend<00:04:43.379> to<00:04:43.500> sound<00:04:44.009> similar<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.490> other

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
which tend to sound similar to other

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.480 
which tend to sound similar to other
riffs<00:04:45.150> on<00:04:45.360> this<00:04:45.569> very<00:04:45.900> album<00:04:46.409> like<00:04:46.650> Legion<00:04:47.370> of

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
riffs on this very album like Legion of

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.659 
riffs on this very album like Legion of
evil<00:04:47.729> or<00:04:48.180> wasted<00:04:49.169> years<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.889> title<00:04:50.220> track<00:04:50.460> on

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
evil or wasted years the title track on

evil or wasted years the title track on
this<00:04:50.789> thing<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.599> similarities<00:04:52.199> run<00:04:52.470> even

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
this thing and the similarities run even

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.559 
this thing and the similarities run even
deeper<00:04:53.220> when<00:04:53.370> comparing<00:04:53.849> these<00:04:53.970> tracks<00:04:54.330> to

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
deeper when comparing these tracks to

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.510

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
one way to skin this cat off is

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.749 
one way to skin this cat off is
certainly<00:05:01.080> not<00:05:01.289> interested<00:05:02.159> in<00:05:02.250> finding<00:05:02.610> out

about it they definitely flirt with that
idea<00:05:05.250> on<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:06.030> track<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.479> must<00:05:06.659> be<00:05:06.810> damned
