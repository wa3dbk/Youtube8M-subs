comes with it comes with three basic
mounts<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> front<00:01:00.030> engine<00:01:00.449> mount

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
mounts this is the front engine mount

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.410 
mounts this is the front engine mount
this<00:01:01.199> bolts<00:01:01.710> some<00:01:02.340> basically<00:01:03.030> where<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
this bolts some basically where the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.210 
this bolts some basically where the
engine<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:03.989> transmission<00:01:04.229> meet<00:01:04.739> at<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> very

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
engine and transmission meet at the very

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.210 
engine and transmission meet at the very
front<00:01:05.930> this<00:01:06.930> bushing<00:01:07.229> right<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.710> sits<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
front this bushing right here sits in a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.609 
front this bushing right here sits in a
cup<00:01:08.549> at<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> front<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> vehicle<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
cup at the front of the vehicle and it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.440 
cup at the front of the vehicle and it
actually<00:01:10.979> prevents<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> engine<00:01:12.180> from

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
actually prevents the engine from

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.899 
actually prevents the engine from
torquing<00:01:12.960> too<00:01:13.170> far<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.650> when<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.549> accelerate

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
torquing too far up when you accelerate

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.320 
torquing too far up when you accelerate
and<00:01:15.330> too<00:01:15.450> far<00:01:15.689> down<00:01:15.869> when<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> decelerate<00:01:17.330> let

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and too far down when you decelerate let

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.640 
and too far down when you decelerate let
me<00:01:18.420> see<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.780> get<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> good<00:01:19.170> close<00:01:19.439> up

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
up against the engine block so I'm not

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.470 
up against the engine block so I'm not
worried<00:02:27.440> about<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.680> one<00:02:28.010> bit<00:02:28.250> if<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:29.270> were<00:02:29.450> I

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
worried about it one bit if I were I

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.660 
worried about it one bit if I were I
would<00:02:29.840> sand<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.230> down<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.380> little<00:02:30.620> bit<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:31.340> I'm

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
would sand it down a little bit but I'm

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.510 
would sand it down a little bit but I'm
not<00:02:31.970> going<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.210> take<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.600> time<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.810> do<00:02:33.050> that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
not going to take the time to do that

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.880
