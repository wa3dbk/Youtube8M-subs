00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello guys this here as you can 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.920
 see and the housing of the ipad actually 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.360
 it is not the first that showed me in 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.639
 first video the one with the magnets here 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.250
 above because of space problems not 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.170
 I can put magnets inside the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.380
 frame that otherwise would not fit 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.369
 to housing even to consume a lot 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.570
 the frame as I already consumed I have 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.449
 redone a new one 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.390
 after redone I applied a 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.600
 I cut this back and later 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.610
 I will explain to you why later too 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.440
 stuccoed well plastered on the side 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.460
 outside on the inside even if it is 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.410
 I left the public in jail 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.489
 because anyway I want to do it well 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:52.070
 after paolo i will show you how the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.629
 all this and ipad 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.469
 take the ipad and put it in this 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.539
 way 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.359
 enter slightly inside you see supports 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.909
 inside the accommodation 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:09.630
 and then imagine that there is the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.340
 lightning connector is pushed this 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.960
 point you will tell how he keeps himself 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.900
 standstill if there is nothing if I am not there 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.740
 magnets there is nothing that can hold it 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.790
 then I have already done the test and I say that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.580
 it is there and keeps well here on the left 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.159
 there is the lightning connector that 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.229
 keeps firm on the right I do not know if not 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.310
 realize basket I made a kind of 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.130
 tongue a bit more enlarged 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.369
 so that it supports the ipad 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.520
 wings and hypothetically I try to hold 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.000
 so you see it should fall in front and 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.000
 does not fall 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:56.120
 because he asks for the back, here he is 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.670
 obtained from this tab you can 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.060
 see I don't know 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.880
 to extract it then it is easy to do 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.880
 so take it net 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.840
 this is an element that did it 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.930
 there are no coins 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.030
 Now 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.770
 what i miss to do is an opening here 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.180
 rectangular so you can have 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.700
 always under control when I take off 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.740
 the ipad the front panel of the stereo that 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.760
 It will be made from the rear a 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.740
 certainly a small opening 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.040
 some need to press a few 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.960
 button and then I have to paste it on 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.110
 frame once pasted on 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:12.650
 sugar frame everything and I will do it 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.790
 all nice smooth then yes it will be 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.130
 a jab made to finish even if already 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.760
 the roughness level here enough 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.709
 low there is already quite smooth the lo 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.620
 stocks however quite well 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:33.610
 the inside a little less but it is either way 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.610
 to greet everyone again
