you'll<00:01:47.290> know<00:01:47.440> that<00:01:47.470> that<00:01:47.979> is<00:01:48.009> a<00:01:48.490> very<00:01:48.729> hard<00:01:49.000> set

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
you'll know that that is a very hard set

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.300 
you'll know that that is a very hard set
up<00:01:49.360> for<00:01:49.899> Giggy<00:01:50.080> pump<00:01:50.320> man's<00:01:50.530> it's<00:01:50.920> really<00:01:51.160> hard

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
up for Giggy pump man's it's really hard

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.650 
up for Giggy pump man's it's really hard
you<00:01:51.369> have<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.520> get<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.729> flippy<00:01:52.000> thing<00:01:52.180> yeah

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
you have to get the flippy thing yeah

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.320 
you have to get the flippy thing yeah
honest<00:01:53.560> cause<00:01:53.860> he<00:01:54.399> calls<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.789> flippy<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.090> call

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
honest cause he calls the flippy a call

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.960 
honest cause he calls the flippy a call
to<00:01:55.450> focus<00:01:55.780> for<00:01:55.960> flipping<00:01:56.580> yeah<00:01:57.580> I<00:01:57.610> don't<00:01:57.820> know

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
to focus for flipping yeah I don't know

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.210 
to focus for flipping yeah I don't know
the<00:01:58.810> way<00:01:58.960> it<00:01:59.110> works<00:01:59.289> is<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.560> have<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.009> hit<00:02:00.130> the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
the way it works is you have to hit the

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.609 
the way it works is you have to hit the
lowest<00:02:00.580> hitbox<00:02:00.970> yes<00:02:01.630> all<00:02:01.869> of<00:02:01.899> them<00:02:02.259> so<00:02:02.440> it's

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
lowest hitbox yes all of them so it's

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.020 
lowest hitbox yes all of them so it's
really<00:02:02.740> tough<00:02:02.979> for<00:02:03.009> I<00:02:03.520> don't<00:02:03.700> know<00:02:03.789> if<00:02:03.940> it's

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
really tough for I don't know if it's

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.880 
really tough for I don't know if it's
the<00:02:04.090> lowest<00:02:04.509> hitbox<00:02:04.840> with<00:02:05.080> their<00:02:05.259> lowest<00:02:05.530> per

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
the lowest hitbox with their lowest per

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.800 
the lowest hitbox with their lowest per
box<00:02:06.130> it's<00:02:06.340> kind<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.520> yes<00:02:06.729> yeah<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.390> kind<00:02:07.570> of<00:02:07.600> has

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
box it's kind of yes yeah it kind of has

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.029 
box it's kind of yes yeah it kind of has
to<00:02:07.840> sync<00:02:08.140> with<00:02:08.259> each<00:02:08.320> other<00:02:08.530> but<00:02:08.709> it's<00:02:09.009> a

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
to sync with each other but it's a

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.469 
to sync with each other but it's a
pretty<00:02:09.160> complex<00:02:09.550> mechanic<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.119> recommend

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
pretty complex mechanic I recommend

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.470 
pretty complex mechanic I recommend
watching<00:02:10.600> a<00:02:10.750> video<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:12.310> you're<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.030> puff<00:02:13.239> player

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
watching a video if you're a puff player

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.710 
watching a video if you're a puff player
or<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.930> want<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.290> learn<00:02:14.440> puff<00:02:15.570> because<00:02:16.570> it's

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
or you want to learn puff because it's

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.420 
or you want to learn puff because it's
very<00:02:16.810> valuable<00:02:17.050> tab<00:02:17.410> right<00:02:17.680> there<00:02:17.920> if<00:02:18.040> you<00:02:18.130> if

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
very valuable tab right there if you if

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.009 
very valuable tab right there if you if
you<00:02:18.580> confirm<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.000> down<00:02:19.150> at<00:02:19.300> an<00:02:19.390> arrest<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.870> mean

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
you confirm you down at an arrest I mean

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.750 
you confirm you down at an arrest I mean
I<00:02:20.200> know<00:02:20.290> it's<00:02:20.620> really<00:02:20.739> tough<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.070> do<00:02:21.250> on<00:02:21.400> Fox

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
I know it's really tough to do on Fox

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.070 
I know it's really tough to do on Fox
i'm<00:02:22.000> not<00:02:22.150> sure<00:02:22.330> if<00:02:22.450> there's<00:02:22.570> any<00:02:22.690> easier<00:02:23.049> on

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
i'm not sure if there's any easier on

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.710 
i'm not sure if there's any easier on
falco<00:02:23.530> or<00:02:23.620> not<00:02:23.799> i<00:02:24.220> would<00:02:24.970> assume<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.360> can't<00:02:25.630> be

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
falco or not i would assume it can't be

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.860 
falco or not i would assume it can't be
much<00:02:25.930> easier<00:02:25.989> if<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.420> why<00:02:28.750> do<00:02:28.810> you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
much easier if it is but so why do you

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.570 
much easier if it is but so why do you
think<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.049> at<00:02:29.170> battlefield<00:02:29.350> like<00:02:30.250> just<00:02:30.430> more

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
think you at battlefield like just more

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.699 
think you at battlefield like just more
like<00:02:30.940> platforms<00:02:31.540> baby<00:02:31.870> yeah<00:02:32.170> i<00:02:32.200> think<00:02:32.410> i<00:02:32.650> think

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
like platforms baby yeah i think i think

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.830 
like platforms baby yeah i think i think
he<00:02:32.860> felt<00:02:33.070> restrained<00:02:33.459> by<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.480> lack<00:02:34.810> of

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
he felt restrained by the lack of

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.720 
he felt restrained by the lack of
platforms<00:02:35.500> but<00:02:36.100> now<00:02:36.310> he<00:02:36.370> might<00:02:36.610> be

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
platforms but now he might be

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.750 
platforms but now he might be
constrained<00:02:37.120> by<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.299> lack<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:37.630> edges<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
constrained by the lack of edges the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.330 
constrained by the lack of edges the
heck<00:02:40.000> of<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.360> wait<00:02:41.230> wait<00:02:41.590> how<00:02:41.769> many<00:02:41.829> edges<00:02:42.070> are

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
heck of it wait wait how many edges are

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.880 
heck of it wait wait how many edges are
to<00:02:42.430> be<00:02:42.790> like<00:02:43.150> this<00:02:43.510> with<00:02:43.720> two<00:02:43.870> others<00:02:44.019> too<00:02:44.380> but

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
to be like this with two others too but

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.560 
to be like this with two others too but
it<00:02:45.730> was<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.910> little<00:02:46.000> bit<00:02:46.120> harder<00:02:46.450> on

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
it was a little bit harder on

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.020 
it was a little bit harder on
battlefield<00:02:47.130> yeah<00:02:48.130> i<00:02:48.489> want<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.820> get<00:02:48.910> arrested
