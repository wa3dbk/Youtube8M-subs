00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
other dose so what I like to do I like

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.630 
other dose so what I like to do I like
to<00:00:43.320> pick<00:00:45.560> pacifiers<00:00:46.560> with<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> really<00:00:47.460> small

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
to pick pacifiers with a really small

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.870 
to pick pacifiers with a really small
nipple<00:00:48.470> because<00:00:49.470> they<00:00:49.740> just<00:00:49.980> feel<00:00:50.220> better

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
nipple because they just feel better

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.980 
nipple because they just feel better
and<00:00:50.970> it's<00:00:51.660> much<00:00:52.050> easier<00:00:52.470> to<00:00:53.270> I'm<00:00:54.270> sorry<00:00:54.540> it's

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 
and it's much easier to I'm sorry it's

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.670 
and it's much easier to I'm sorry it's
much<00:00:55.230> easier<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.320> put<00:00:58.560> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
much easier to you know like put the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.940 
much easier to you know like put the
silicone<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.400> the<00:00:59.430> baby's<00:00:59.820> mouth

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
silicone to the baby's mouth

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.660 
silicone to the baby's mouth
so<00:01:01.950> I<00:01:01.980> really<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.460> Chico<00:01:02.880> brand<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:04.339> this<00:01:05.339> is

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
so I really like Chico brand and this is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.859 
so I really like Chico brand and this is
three<00:01:06.509> facts<00:01:06.810> dry<00:01:07.799> facts<00:01:08.159> no<00:01:09.149> idea<00:01:11.719> come<00:01:12.719> on

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
three facts dry facts no idea come on

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.919 
three facts dry facts no idea come on

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
focus

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:20.359 
focus
okay<00:01:15.979> hope<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.130> could<00:01:17.280> see<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:19.369> because

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
okay hope you could see that because

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.620 
okay hope you could see that because
they<00:01:20.609> also<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:21.810> small<00:01:23.210> what<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> small

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
they also have really small what a small

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:33.260 
they also have really small what a small
nipple<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:26.039> this<00:01:26.249> is<00:01:27.499> another<00:01:28.499> one<00:01:29.749> and<00:01:32.270> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
nipple and this is another one and the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.139 
nipple and this is another one and the
next<00:01:33.569> rule<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.139> that<00:01:34.799> nipple<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.670> supposed<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
next rule is that nipple is supposed to

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.520 
next rule is that nipple is supposed to
be<00:01:36.359> really<00:01:36.630> hard<00:01:37.609> so<00:01:38.609> as<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.389> can<00:01:39.569> see<00:01:39.630> it's

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
be really hard so as you can see it's

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.449 
be really hard so as you can see it's
really<00:01:40.819> hard<00:01:41.819> to<00:01:42.319> to<00:01:43.319> bend<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.219> same

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
really hard to to bend this and the same

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.709 
really hard to to bend this and the same
one<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.999> with<00:01:45.380> Chico<00:01:47.119> this<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.270> even<00:01:48.479> harder

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
one is with Chico this is even harder

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.019 
one is with Chico this is even harder
and<00:01:49.819> to<00:01:50.819> compare<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.539> have<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.789> one<00:01:53.789> of<00:01:53.819> the

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:54.029 
and to compare I have here one of the

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.529 
and to compare I have here one of the
nukes

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
nukes

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.399 
nukes
and<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.130> see<00:01:56.429> this<00:01:56.749> nipple<00:01:57.749> is<00:01:57.959> much

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
and as you can see this nipple is much

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.440 
and as you can see this nipple is much
much<00:01:58.649> softer<00:01:59.219> and<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:02.189> reason<00:02:02.520> why<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
much softer and the reason why I like to

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.540 
much softer and the reason why I like to
choose<00:02:04.880> harder<00:02:05.880> nipples<00:02:06.299> is<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:07.139> it's<00:02:08.099> also

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
choose harder nipples is that it's also

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.500 
choose harder nipples is that it's also
much<00:02:09.060> easier<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.840> insert<00:02:10.290> a<00:02:10.350> pacifier<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.510> in

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
much easier to insert a pacifier to in

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.869 
much easier to insert a pacifier to in
the<00:02:12.630> baby's<00:02:13.020> mouth

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
the baby's mouth

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.199 
the baby's mouth
because<00:02:14.420> they<00:02:14.599> are<00:02:14.719> not<00:02:14.900> bad<00:02:15.439> you<00:02:15.680> know<00:02:15.799> just

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
because they are not bad you know just

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:27.149 
because they are not bad you know just
just<00:02:17.209> put<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.629> inside<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:21.249> have<00:02:22.249> with<00:02:23.079> bottle<00:02:24.079> so
