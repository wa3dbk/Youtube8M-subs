00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.770
 want discount to enter college 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.200
 access point good point want to bag br 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.420
 the side and finally such a picture today we go 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.760
 talk about the reptile egg 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.640
 the reptile egg is an important 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.760
 evolutionary novelty that allowed the 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.500
 conquest of the terrestrial environment and we 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.890
 Let's understand why this happens. 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.010
 in this class so starting is important 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.580
 remember that inside the egg there is a 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.180
 embryo which is represented here and 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.300
 there are also embryonic attachments that 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.640
 are associated with the embryo and 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.350
 What are these good attachments? 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.140
 are four types of attachments in 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.720
 billionaires, it is very important that you 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.590
 know all the names and functions of 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.079
 each one 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.540
 so let's go the first attachment 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.930
 embryo is obvious that it is a bag 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.960
 filled with fluid that surrounds the embryo 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.660
 So we have here the buddy that 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.710
 bag full of liquid and what is the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.920
 his role 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.609
 the love protects the embryo against the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.380
 secação against dehydration 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:15.200
 in addition it absorbs shocks 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.170
 mechanics and provides a 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.049
 mechanics for this embryo then look 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.409
 Interesting personal inside the egg already 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.139
 there is an accusative environment with an embryo 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.630
 no longer needs external water to 

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:30.439
 develop and any importance 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.950
 of this 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.299
 good corn is very important for 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.569
 independence of water from the external environment 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:42.079
 for the development of the embryo and this 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:44.630
 allows the definitive conquest of the 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.049
 terrestrial environment so the staff very 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.599
 because the amniotic egg is a 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.479
 very important evolutionary novelty that 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:56.389
 is related to the conquest of the 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.909
 terrestrial environment beyond the buddy 

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:01.909
 we also have here inside the egg the 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:06.340
 yolk sac and what the yolk sac 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:09.979
 do the good yolk bag single stores 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.620
 What do you want to see? 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.819
 a nutritional substance which then that 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.430
 is the function of the bag 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.760
 the technician the main function in the 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.069
 is the nutrition of the embryo 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.829
 and look how interesting the bag I saw 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.950
 is a bag that is attached to the 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:31.280
 region of the gut of the embryo 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.639
 besides these two embryonic attachments we 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.939
 we have here also alan todi who is 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:41.900
 here represented as pink and what the alan 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:45.079
 doyle does good alan todi stores 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.389
 that were produced during the 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.239
 these embryonic development 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.560
 discreet staff were produced by the 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.109
 own embryo 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.980
 during development and that discreet 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.379
 these are 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.590
 I have already said that reptiles produce 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.180
 especially uric acid and you 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.859
 reminds us of the importance of 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.739
 secrete uric acid 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:10.579
 We've already seen in the last class that the 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.609
 uric acid is a less toxic and 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:16.069
 insoluble in water and then because it is 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.650
 the less toxic it can be here it is 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.409
 stored inside the egg without causing 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.049
 for the embryo and there 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.069
 continuing the last annex a millionaire 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.849
 that I want to talk 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.909
 is the rabbit this attachment involves all 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:34.609
 other attachments and the embryo is here 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:38.509
 represented in yellow and what the code 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:41.209
 Does the choir really be a purse? 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:44.060
 which is in close contact with the shell 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.319
 egg is therefore a structure that confers 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.629
 protection for all others and also 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.489
 participates in the gas exchange trade 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.639
 gases that will happen between the 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.439
 embryo and the atmospheric and here only 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.959
 detail in reptiles 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.750
 the memory of alan tohid that this 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.909
 Membrane from here highlighted highlighting can 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.889
 to fuse with leather 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.560
 this will create a structure that is 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.509
 called alan touched the euro and this 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.789
 structure here will also stay in 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:16.130
 contact with egg shell 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:20.090
 so since we're talking about shell 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:24.260
 making outer coating of one knots 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.200
 Here we have kafka, then white. 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.410
 we have the barest attention because the 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.350
 bark is not the embryonic annex the four 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.130
 billionaire annexes are the million 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:40.610
 android voucher technical voucher and this code 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.720
 personal bark is rigid and because it is 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.340
 in the bark of the reptiles we find 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.890
 substances that are to be 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.170
 important for such rigidity and 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.900
 presence of this rigid shell 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.510
 was also an important acquisition 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.870
 evolution to the definitive conquest in the 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.960
 terrestrial environment but because the bark 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.790
 provides mechanical protection for the embryo 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:10.520
 and also protects against dehydration 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:13.100
 being the embryo within the egg with 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.550
 bark can stay longer 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.500
 in the terrestrial environment outside the 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.780
 Mom and to close 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.960
 it is very important to remember that in this 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:27.200
 there are several cigars and 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.440
 importance of these good neat pores 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.740
 allow the entry and the exit of gases 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.490
 which will allow the oxygenation of the embryo 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:40.460
 and also the elimination of carbon dioxide 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.450
 So the staff is this I hope you have 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.940
 understood 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:48.580
 Next class we are going to talk about snakes. 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.580
 I'll wait for you there, see you later.
