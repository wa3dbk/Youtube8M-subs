00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.540
 ruler one gets on the shelf between 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.540

 second generation 3 control key 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.600
 and a large conversational speaker when 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.760
 similar display characteristics 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.890
 desire s look here we get much more 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.900
 clear and juicy picture separately 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.300
 I want to note the minimum air 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.580
 interlayer screen feeling that you drive 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.590
 finger right in the image some 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.440
 say about not very high definition 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.759
 texts but me personally in this display 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.920
 arranges everything on top connector for 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.750
 headset microphone for noise reduction and 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.060
 lock button on the right rocker 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.430
 volume control power button 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.229
 responds well to pressing and grope 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.300
 its not easy to say about the key 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.660
 volume bottom inverted connector 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.200

 5 megapixel camera with flash 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.850
 logo and speaker how not to compare 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.920
 you is why i desire is with so 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.810
 last camera is much better here we are 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.850
 we have so low detail 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.770
 pictures that once again get the machine 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.569
 for the sake of a quick photo I don't want 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.580
 The speaker is quite high quality and 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.470
 loud if you take the smartphone speakers into 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.569
 Overall, but we know what is really 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.580
 eat up you learn and example them 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.740
 great speakers we saw in the lineup 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.110
 devices based on windows phone as a whole 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.000
 design is different from the same desire sv 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.190
 but then give a little less dimensions 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.690
 more premium materials for example 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.420
 the back cover is made of plastic 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.060
 like used won and heart 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.290
 apparatus is qualcomm snapdragon s4 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.750
 plus msm 8230 and graphics adreno 330 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.550
 operates at a frequency of 1 and 2 gigahertz you 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.390
 one gigabyte of ram what 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.010
 allows you to dial 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.750
 very good results for both 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.459
 middle class devices you no problem 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.650
 You can play all the most 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.540
 heaped games 8 gigabyte flash 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.830
 expandable memory with 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.380
 using micro sd cards 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.170
 but available to the user a little more than 5 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.780
 all the fault android 4 0 4 and branded 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.489
 sense 4 shell 1 interface works 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.800
 smoothly but sometimes I would like to 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.780
 scrolling was done faster like 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.879
 and in all the latest apparatus had it 6 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.920
 syw standard keyboard are present 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.750
 keyboard calibration tool which 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.480
 allows you to customize it specifically for your 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.610
 fingers 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.950
 and it really works the battery in 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.810
 bathroom sweet thousands of 800 milliamps an hour 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.299
 official manufacturer did not declare 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.280
 while working this can be justified by the fact that 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.810
 it varies greatly depending on 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.599
 work in different networks 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.480
 because the phone supports as 3g to kill 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.700
 those. in gsm + live mode with load 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.950
 Above average late evening for me 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.900
 40 percent charge left 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.610
 he did not torment him at least some troubles 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.799
 I could not find work 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.540
 what can we conclude that the smartphone 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.579
 Taiwanese have turned noble 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.470
 if you are ready to close your eyes to quality 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.420
 camera then this phone will be able to attract 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.129
 have a nice design 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.079
 body materials high 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.510
 performance and good display 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.549
 reasonably priced $ 380 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.769
 can make you pay attention to 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.720
 competitors' products but I know how fast 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.700
 smartphones fall the price I can assume 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.989
 that in a month the price ratio 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.890
 quality on this machine 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.890
 will be optimal 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.600
 he
