triple threat with a rock and John Cena

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.020 
triple threat with a rock and John Cena
which<00:01:07.049> would<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.380> good<00:01:07.619> or<00:01:08.159> he's<00:01:08.640> gonna<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
which would be good or he's gonna have a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.149 
which would be good or he's gonna have a
