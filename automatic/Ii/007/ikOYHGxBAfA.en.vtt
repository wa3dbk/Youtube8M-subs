00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
this is ian's line down here in blue we

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.310 
this is ian's line down here in blue we
have<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.420> introduction<00:00:57.899> between<00:00:58.170> that

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
playing ability then as we can see as

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.560 
playing ability then as we can see as
their<00:01:04.320> time<00:01:04.530> goes<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.430> different<00:01:06.210> other

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
their time goes on and different other

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.990 
their time goes on and different other
factors<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.350> introduced<00:01:07.890> into<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.460> equation

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
factors are introduced into the equation

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.070 
factors are introduced into the equation
so<00:01:09.630> his<00:01:09.930> guitar<00:01:10.350> ability<00:01:10.979> decreases<00:01:12.080> these

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
so his guitar ability decreases these

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.230 
so his guitar ability decreases these
