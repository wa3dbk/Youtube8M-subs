00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.250
 beginning of the harvest began his ministry 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.949

 relationships between people the youth sector of the accused 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.290
 technically it was also the practice of the early church of the church 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.240
 primitive his first profits from jesus christ he will have nothing at all 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.330
 because in February 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.900

 wal-mart immerse someone 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.130
 at the wheel we can consider that lives the river 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.770
 his doors 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.240
 it's inhumane 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.280
 it's an image 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.050
 very strong 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.430
 she will give the floor 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.280
 it's like that 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.400
 visual school 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.400
 made by internet that has already occurred 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.240

 by mirhossein to be saved 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.479
 it depends on both 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.620
 and not accept the grace of god and jesus christ to be saved for 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.000
 to be forgiven crisis he died on the cross he is risen he planned 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.069
 to address the points that sin 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.359
 new fronts 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.450
 receive this forgiveness for the general public 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.019
 and that's because a person 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.439
 3-2 of the medoc which Jesus Christ after the departures of the summer 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.559
 two extraordinary things in his last visit 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.789
 Marc Beauregard JJ.A. 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.749
 created at the first thing one assists said 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.019
 more efficient 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.389
 we fished 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.849
 when the most selfless person 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.749
 a scale 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.459
 still in this primary 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.730
 there is no more compassion for those who ask questions 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.810
 gm and chrysler have bothered 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.559
 rushed to the scene 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:00.999
 a trio accept this group 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:02.909
 it gets complicated 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.859
 but underneath christian walnut 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.909
 in clear in this sense rich windows 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.430
 the report notes a progression 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.939
 Judge Bourdeau 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.649
 and the wine to live 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:18.619
 in three encounters more and more savvy and prohibited south to north 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.899
 transpo 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:22.399
 this last 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:24.479
 and tells us that this person 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.899
 lusitanos new life with jesus christ 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:28.559
 electricity 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:29.499
 then of course 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.439
 he is not resurrected is still very heavy sense 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.369
 and for good reason if it is more lightly 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:38.599
 thank god to these people 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:39.989
 with his 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.349
 we are still waiting 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.119
 little by little the transaction will be paid 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:45.489
 the day of my opponent 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.899
 it was hot 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:50.379
 you will see gratifier explained 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.269
 I wonder why 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.539
 he will be bordeaux 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.539
 yes he goes there 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.819
 village and surrounding area causing his death prevented 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:06.239
 like toronto 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.510
 to prevent 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.539
 the presidential have fled after the meeting 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:12.809
 front-to-front 

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:15.399
 for the moment the highlights 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:17.650
 yann m'vila region 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.930
 more waste 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.819
 according to the world knows it 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:24.189
 in the water it is at the end of their stay 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.670
 in their case when the crisis needs to 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.559
 but why so 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.340
 world to manifest 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.800
 so he had baptized the departure of $ 2 41 billion 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.840
 The head of state 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.190
 his word 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.190
 according to a European source 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.190
 a house of culture maisonneuve and dupeux 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.809
 in the street we are hopeful to kill him and I do it 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:49.849
 they will have more than two months to act from there it's too much 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.029
 simple 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.029
 it will start at 9 5% 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.950
 as for him continued their way of cross for each one of us she says 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.870
 what prevents you from changing your mind and then if you believe that the car is 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.719
 possible the net answered I believe that Jesus Christ the son of 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:12.920
 he made the choice 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.949
 he reveals the underside of the whole group 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:17.860
 see you later 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.310
 when I came out of the water the spirit of the pornography lord it makes a 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.520
 rising passage 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.219
 in the pas-de-calais relegation 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.490
 we have to go back wow they came out 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.199
 Alonso thinks that 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.029
 in Athens but beware to see 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:36.029
 a single over a year those who believed that personal 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.199
 As a reminder 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:41.330
 christened 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.490
 so of course some have already done 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.900
 collective to do stupid things 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.620
 it's a big principle 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.620
 a problem with the head of the city high school 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.559
 out of collection 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:57.949
 in the heads of the blues 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.759
 2010the montreal convention 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.639

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:04.490
 pme 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.490
 3 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.259
 the response panel on the conditions 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.379
 of their sins and those who lay - sorry for fishing a few weeks 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:18.470
 judge rather 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.490
 but not too much as m 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.490
 but this stride they founded 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.279
 Mon 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.159
