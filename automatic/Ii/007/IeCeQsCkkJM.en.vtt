00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.470
 the road book shows us the different sections and the sections that 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.709
 there is in each of the sections of which it consists 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.559
 a day of the rally 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.470
 the pilots and co-drivers we know both the training day and the 

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:20.800
 day of rallies to guide us isabel for some are as many sections as 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.819
 links 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.379
 first we will have a series of information pages such as the program of the 

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:27.230
 rally 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.189
 the treasury itinerary 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.539
 a few pages will not show how we are human 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.510
 placed the sections and differentiated between the formations also as is where 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.130
 the park is closed 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.130
 that the assistance park 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.920
 but the schedule 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.770
 it does not stop being like a kind of summary 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.560
 where are you going to tell us 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.540
 as ret as others will cover the different sections of the rally 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.350
 first let's see for example here in the first section 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.510
 quesada of the first participant the park closed at 7 50 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.870
 and then we'll see an entry 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.200
 we released the private entrance to the service park and the minute in which 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.000
 enter to 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.450
 supposedly 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.270
 then 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.270
 we will see that the service park will leave 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.950
 the father the first stretch 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.950
 and the minute that the first stage arrived 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.100
 it will be divided 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.210
 of penalties different sections 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.340
 those that cost the rally 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.050
 in the case that in the case of the sections we must differentiate 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.080
 between the white squares 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.080
 and the gray boxes 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.990
 the little white houses after almost two months 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.830
 sheeran those classic of the timed section 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.360
 that is to say the one that runs 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.410
 and then the white squares will be the link boxes you can see that 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.670
 within each section 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.570
 will tell us in the section that we are moving forward in deep discussions processes 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.200
 we give a sector 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.350
 From where 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.380
 we go 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.770
 so since we checked take fly control the average kilometers 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.109
 the distance and the elapsed time 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:11.109
 then there will be for ourselves we voted for us 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.049
 which we will use time to train especially the total and partial distance 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.839
 the total will be dismissed travel in procession and the partial but entered 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.939
 sector and the partial will be the one between each box 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.019
 the streets with podÃ©s were numbered 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.180
 in this case that broke out against schedule and to the next box vries and 150 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.379
 meters 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.269
 give us some information to be able to devil us one more way 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.409
 easy we see squares and he tells us that they are cases 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:41.700
 the following case 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.530
 memo your nascent box that will be 850 meters from the previous 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.369
 we will go what we want if this arrow 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:54.269
 and we do not complain about a clue the right you appear crossed out this coughing box 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.009
 a marquee 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.159
 the next we follow that date from that left track another right 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.909
 we wanted that there would be a control our dog our paqui 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.909
 and if here after a signage from janeiro santiago 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.079
 as you see there 200 meters from east to west 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.079
 and the total distance keeps adding up 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.049
 for us to have at the time of training where the controls are 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:18.990
 schedules 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.990
 n when going to the rally and the exit 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.399
 to be able to take the notes 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:29.519
 We see a series of fashion a series of photos as you can see here where more 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.489
 or less is 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.569
 the exit to the time control 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.019
 the goal 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.019
 and control this 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.510
 an alternative would be when we enter another list and we can not go through that 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.679
 same stretch then we would see the return 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:46.400
 and we follow the boxes 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.019
 until the next stretch 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.900
 or because I work with we have to go if we have information boxes 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.589
 compulsively 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.219
 finally the euro route 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.150
 we have these two eyes one with a red cross that would be accident case not 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:02.479
 provide medical assistance 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.509
 and another 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:08.079
 as there is that they would be accident case but not medical assistance 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.919
 in both cases we must show 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.359
 well I hope it serves as something 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.339
 this explained that the centrals more or less as a defeat official 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.229
 and nothing else thanks
