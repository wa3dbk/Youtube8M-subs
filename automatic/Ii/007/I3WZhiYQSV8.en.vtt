00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.960
 Hey, people connected on cbf tv in the morning. 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.180
 we received a special visit from our 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.710
 Dante's studio was there and what 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.060
 rolled you check in the bulletin later 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.369
 selection 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.140
 soon after lunch afterwards 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.539
 in this same here were the players 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.330
 oscar and thiago silva 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.140
 for me particularly special in 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.550
 role playing in france as well 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.690
 meet multiple players play with 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.320
 Some of them 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.700
 so it's a special game for me 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.649
 is a classic a football classic 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.870
 world 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.250
 France has been growing a lot in the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.960
 The past few years have a team that is quite 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.989
 competitive is to have a coach is a 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.480
 that in the tactical formation of the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.670
 time he has worked hard 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.250
 and I could play there I have accompanied 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.480
 enough that this evolution of them then 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.330
 I think it's a very 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.189
 complicated for people but because of the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.380
 We are playing at home with the support of 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.470
 our fans and the will to win 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.259
 a departure from this greatness, I believe 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.990
 We're going to get ready to go. 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.909

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.250

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.159
 We have the freedom to 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.860
 take a lot more when you lose the ball to 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:37.710
 You have always're 22 side and a 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.380
 marking in the middle so I was doing 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.409
 this much in the heavens always playing at 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.960
 right side and recompose very well then 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.570
 felipÃ£o prefers to trade there then 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.460

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.350
