00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.300
 creating friends and youtube friends yo 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.529
 I am an angel because 01 and today 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.980
 I bring a video that I have been asked 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.450
 quite a few tips for 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.390
 custo tint your mini fix well without more 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.790
 rodeos start with a basic type that 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.380
 everyone should know and it's that I 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.360
 I am sure that all has happened to them 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.540
 who ever want to paint a mini 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.080
 fish either with permanent markers or 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.059
 with paint and it leaves them either do not 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.309
 they go well because they were moved 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.309
 hand or already painted a part that does not 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.339
 I was or things like that, well, I'm going to teach you 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.920
 how to correct that and it's pretty easy 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.110
 let's take this mini reference fit this 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.370
 elite of the drug 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.610
 paint LEDs with a permanent down 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.400
 a little bit of the foot of red 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.340
 and there it has red well the only thing that 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.480
 they are going to need to clear this up 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.070
 be a napkin and a deodorant 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.910
 it has to be deodorant forces in 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.550
 spray is not in a bar, other than in 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.220
 another type because they will not be served 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.010
 what they are going to do is sprinkle little 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.860
 the foot and how can you see there 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.980
 it is decorating 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.980
 then simply remove it with the 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.980
 napkin 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.560
 still has a little but 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.200
 that with more of this during correction 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.450
 they see it you almost do not have anymore and that last 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.450
 obviously with a little more 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.240
 already last will not have anything left them 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.660
 they remain to the mimicry absolutely as 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.660
 new 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.590
 there is something important and that is 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.259
 deodorants are the only thing that 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.730
 they will serve you because they have alcohol and 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.310
 you will say ah well if I have alcohol 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.319
 I can also can not do it with the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.120
 alcohol is much more difficult and is that what 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.340
 who have deodorants is a 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.400
 chemical component that makes it easier 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.050
 remove the oil that is what it is 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.490
 based on the testers 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.860
 well going on to other tips 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.030
 Many have also asked me how 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.580
 can I do this look here has a 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.700
 little hand and with that holds the 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.880
 good gun is easy simply 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.550
 you grab a hand from a spartan that does not get you 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.860
 like it or that you no longer use anything that does not 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.510
 you're going to miss him you cut his hand and he 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.210
 the glue 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.760
 your best friend to guard nuance mini 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.030
 clicks are going to be two things your best 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.790
 friends rather said first the tail 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.260
 crazy or the industrial glue the one 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.480
 you want but that is one that sticks 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.310
 quite strong and the deodorant for 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.410
 correct errors normally 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.340
 the deodorant can also help you 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.340
 quite 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.180
 remove what you have wrong with 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.040
 glue is easier if you do it with 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.550
 deodorant than with anything else 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.520
 because he has very strong things 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.770
 what happens to the chin heron the components 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.130
 chemicals that have to paste this or 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:41.080
 those that have the color of the deodorant 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.080
 and they have also asked me 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.880
 well I forgot where I left the rifle 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.420
 I know if I've ever noticed 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.840
 but this is therefore this is part of 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:59.810
 this soldier has a rifle that here 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:01.580
 is that this is maybe in my customs 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.430
 have seen it good for those who have 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.820
 played and the software this is called retro 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.810
 lancer with this you could impale the 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.640
 enemies and well that 's another story 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.980
 the question is that they ask me good and 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.980
 you how did you do this easy 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.340
 grab an assault rifle here has 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:28.350
 Some parts of assault rifle cut it 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:30.450
 totally totally I put this part 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.280
 which is where he grabbed that he was going more 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:37.849
 in front I put it back I grabbed a 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.099
 spyker i also did shit 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:42.300
 here are the spyker's knives are 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:45.120
 stuck 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.940
 and for the charger I just cut him 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.310
 the top of the rifle and the only thing 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.510
 all this is simply linked with 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.600
 crazy tail all 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.400
 and they can have better weapons another 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.770
 which also works well for them 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:05.270
 well that is 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.340
 Plasticine modeling clay and glue 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.280
 Local seriously it works quite well 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.820
 because you put plasticine then you 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.130
 put with the crazy and dry 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.010
 it dries gets hard and it's as if 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.050
 out of plastic you do not have to be 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.010
 worrying because if there is crushed 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.410
 How much did this happen if the other thing happened 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:31.650
 already with that you could not say that 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:33.210
 speak more of good and finally 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.370
 ah 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.759
 I have also been asked how the fuck 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:42.030
 I do this or how can I give that 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:47.729
 visceral effect to a good spartan is 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:51.150
 easy just hold plasticine 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:54.360
 he grabbed a bit of red down 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.969
 obviously and it starts to be like that 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.920
 I do like that because that's how weird it's like that 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:03.920
 I start to give small touches 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:08.320
 to make it look like that dotted with 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.320
 blood not smeared and does not splash 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.620
 as you can see there I grab a little more 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.620
 colored on the legs 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.730
 and it looks as if it had exploded 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.190
 a grenade or something would have exploded 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:25.270
 stronger and then I just put it 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.270
 in a dead pose 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.130
 well those have been the tips that 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.400
 I can give you how to custody 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.800
 better your mini feet 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:40.060
 I hope you have served them I hope the 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.160
 apply and believe me it has to be 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.070
 aerosol deodorant is what they 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.370
 I can say well I am in the pocket 01 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.220
 and I hope you liked the video 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:54.190
 share it, like it and subscribe 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:57.190
 well see you bye 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:00.040
 and I forgot one last advice 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.980
 they can create pretty good effects 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.950
 with your mini fix either by painting the 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:10.030
 totally or of various colors and or 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:12.940
 personal paint this I do not know if they get it to 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.990
 appreciate good well I do not know if they recognize 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.060
 that helmet 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:21.070
 If you do not recognize it, I'll leave you there 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:25.300
 task where I got it 

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:28.720
 it's a good I'm going to tell you it 's a pilot 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:31.420
 of the series 3 of which I lost my head and 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.000
 because I never found him I put this 

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:36.940
 and I painted it all in black and now it looks 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.090
 great good at least I think so 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:42.010
 in order not to be afraid to paint everything 

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.950
 a mini fill because in many cases 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:47.320
 it goes well and if they made a mistake it does not matter 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.520
 I already told you how to correct it and believe me 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.759
 that works 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.740
 well now yes this has been everything I am 

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:57.280
 that one because there is one and here I say goodbye 

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.280
 friends
