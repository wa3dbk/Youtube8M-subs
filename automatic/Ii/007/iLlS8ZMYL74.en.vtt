00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.059
 so now get back to one 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.610
 Another round live act of the fake of 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.719
 last week was number 13 namely that 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.140
 kay went to hogwarts and you sword 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.050
 she has it through gryffindor so 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.390
 Godrich Gryffindor only gets by 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.099
 again a mt 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.449
 so then you have me again much effect 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.680
 I thank you for that 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.390
 Of course I have a few, too 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.910
 built-in 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:39.960
 However, it would be super great 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:42.590
 super were gay, I'm not sure if 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.969
 you still have the source for it always 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 but now for now 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.320
 enough talk now it starts right 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.670
 my classics as probably so 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.070
 Well, as everyone knows that too in 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.890
 my loading screen is grace 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.320
 two special top spin doctors if he does 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.680
 him with his smoke grenade so his 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.580
 get away fast but that now 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.540
 Finally, not even grabbed that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.229
 no longer works 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.000
 yes I tried everything half an hour 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.220
 long somehow there always yes if you 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.590
 maybe dear saxon works first 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.130
 or or or no idea it comes 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.780
 no more 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.930
 So either I really have something 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.350
 fundamentally wrong or it works 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.600
 no more 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.740
 the dealer from the nile team on the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.650
 escape map is the uncle of eggmühl 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.500
 remmi tune is not an unknown 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.100
 playable characters from league of 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.009
 legends 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.430
 He presented, among other things, the bar for wu 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.880
 qun or the federal states 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.860
 Shield on sword and duran string 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.840
 if you look at the altars on the 3 and 3 maps 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.140
 So the twiste triel takes a map 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.979
 I'll tell the ghosts of the altars 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.130
 certain sayings at certain 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.630
 Characteristics give this very special 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.729
 claims by, for example, in 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.869
 kill casa elisa or york 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.530
 many of these sayings are for example 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.200
 based on 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.370
 a work by shakespeare or a song 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.730
 by iron maiden 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.010
 that's really cool there is 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.060
 certain characters or things on the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.560
 you can use smart and teleport 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.209
 Characters and things to do it 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.840
 Do not even think about it 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:33.930
 for example, six passes or taps or 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.580
 the spiders get religious or base 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.730
 market for his football if he uses it 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.840
 Towers destroyed in inhibitors is that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.470
 but not the case 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.019
 The same applies to the old brush 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:51.420
 nasus gets 1000 marks for the nexus 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.959
 damn hand e.on originally wanted 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.959
 to become a baker 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.290
 as this one for james, riot games has one 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.090
 for a long time the champion side of may 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.989
 in which it organizes everything there 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.150
 graffiti sprayed pretty nasty 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.250
 barrels had cinematic trailer at risk 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.950
 of fate a completely different look 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.810
 This look is actually supposed to go into it 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.600
 but the game was transferred 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.760
 not yet done when greven one 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.160
 his axes begins to appear the same 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.549
 symbol on the ground which he also as 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.470
 belt buckle anniviers the champion 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.010
 who live the least on level 1 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.630
 owns and although 420 has indeed 4 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.220
 kaká 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:47.060
 what nobody wants to have none of the name 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:50.220
 trainz rabe is beatrice sales 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.380
 bertrands the smiley with the showers 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.720
 painting his murder on the ground is the one 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.970
 same smiley in a smoke cloud 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.220
 if there is someone with her 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.650
 multi meets so close stems from 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.620
 Latin word sonus that's the way it is 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.019
 a lot how loud or sound this was 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.150
 a latin language of the masculine 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:16.320
 to circumvent feminine 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:20.449
 So from sonus he was so close to the elfer 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:25.410
 no that's spanish alia hunting is there 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:27.360
 the cube is fallen yes so 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.940
 aptly are enemies in the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.250
 story of yes, so will the murder 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.370
 a retiree described the idea 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.160
 from luxury in june to this retiree though 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.750
 even elders should be so protected 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.979
 but did not do it because he prefers 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.789
 wanted to fight in the right way 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:46.440
 which way ballets nice combination 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.090
 and then he's gone and since then 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.880
 he is looking for the true 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.220
 assassin because the weapon was a wind 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.410
 sound yes and there was so suspicious 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.050
 because he is a counter-value not well 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.590
 and that's why there are special ones 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.139
 remote when her multi triggers 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.250
 Yes, who understands cut then says 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:11.300
 he does not like a wind like that 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.300
 then everything is clear 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.950
 the extension does not recommend running again yes 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:33.550
 Infekt installed and I hope you 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:35.350
 find him all finds anyway no one let 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.090
 like your comment and see you 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.090
 then the next time up because
