00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.769
 and today I'm going to bring you a video 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.370
 from minecraft is a template that I 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.350
 the china in the biggest craft molds and even a 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.619
 time ago a friend my friend of mine 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.029
 the ones that made a video to the droid is I wanted 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.750
 show you guys think a mold 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.480
 very interesting and cool for who it is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.439
 has played minecraft already and wants to play 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.960
 now unites different craft and one thing 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.950
 new to change your survivor a bit 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.170
 good 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.960
 first of all it is note that for 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.100
 breaking mote master block is very 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.920
 harder 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.539
 and so is what you think when you 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.000
 thinks that they break their mouths a lot more 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.000
 difficult as I will get neither 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.110
 starting items to play 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.579
 good is so up in the corner is 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.760
 upper left 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.890
 you can see that a dollar sign is 10 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.920
 this working module is by the system 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.320
 of money you will try to join the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.330
 many items that you can have 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.280
 if you can break because if you 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.990
 is trying to break wood to 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.840
 sell wood if you will stay you will 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.729
 starve as many then say 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.880
 It's better for you to break seeds. 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.070
 things that are easy to break is 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.790
 You can break some here just to 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.790
 Show 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.320
 Ok guys, it's okay, I forgot to 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.460
 speak in a mold but it is poor craft is 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.149
 basically it triggers the system of 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.640
 Money in the game, it's for you to make your 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.729
 survival with a different form is 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.460
 collect money to buy good items 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.590
 You've put together some basic items, right? 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.330
 some that you can break a 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.360
 You also have the 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:04.509
 province understands local animal this land 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.130
 There it is, I know, I do not know, either. 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:12.269
 run away is not it 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.269
 The boy is that the law is that the galley 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:23.069
 It paid the chicken to try to kill 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.069
 this here too 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.080
 besides that, the guys were running away 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.190
 photographing here want you to win 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.160
 cooperate ready there you will tighten and that 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.250
 It's your normal inventory, and you 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.280
 you can see that here on the side of the dodo craft 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.140
 initial four blocks have a sky going 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.350
 put your item on the list can put 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.870
 so much item is kind one day this will see the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.430
 unit price will can put a whole 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.510
 you can put it like this too 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.799
 all the items you have a 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.870
 clear inventory and 44 and application can 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.549
 see I got 57 thing on top 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.829
 I will try to put together something more 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.829
 For us it 's enough of nike 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:16.370
 Let's see a little more here. 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.440
 our goal is quite also sells 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.510
 ready with 90 thing 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.790
 Well, how do you buy items? 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:29.209
 tightness is in the r c has several classes here 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.160
 de tite just did not stay with the german opel 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.230
 if you can see all the items here have 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.780
 to sell it there is the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.390
 Everyone here has all the items but you 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.170
 here on the side of the filters in case 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.100
 is the escape and will select only foods and 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.250
 etc 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.780
 the well organized farms can see that 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.760
 some things are really expensive right by 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.480
 some things you would not have 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.440
 to collect that neither is it because this number 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.850
 blocks okay this is left of the block 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.940
 It's been a long time since I played games or day care. 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.850
 It's not good, I have 90 things. 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.820
 buy here ready i bought i bought one 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.170
 a business to make planting 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.400
 Good, I think I can understand. 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.739
 basically the goal of mod 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.900
 The way I find it easier for you 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.959
 collect money because you can 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.510
 buying some tools is doing 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.880
 planting or even selling stones I do not know 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.350
 which is the country's stone there in business 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.300
 but it should be a very high thing too 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.720
 for you to be able to raise money well 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.780
 easy then is is think the way more 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.240
 Easy even was the implantation good guys 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.600
 but it was this very simple mold just wanted 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.570
 show you how it's already said to a friend 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.710

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.410

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.030
 I wanted to do it for a long time only 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.820
 it was not updating it and 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.280
 I wanted to make a point 3.2 updates the 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.300

 Good, but I'll have a video here. 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.229

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:29.860

 also the mod 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.759
 already with the point already in the thing because in a 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.440
 it was automatically very simple 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.870
 I do not think I actually get settled 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.879
 where squid I think he was alone 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.139
 but as a precaution it is in the 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:00.250
 to protest 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:02.969

 that map of that way from there and 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.919
 It's one thing that does not change much more 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:27.250
