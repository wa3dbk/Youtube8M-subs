my review of my new laptop
it's<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:06.710> Toshiba<00:00:07.710> Satellite<00:00:11.240> l50<00:00:12.240> 5<00:00:12.530> es<00:00:13.530> 5<00:00:14.040> 0<00:00:14.639> 18

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
it's a Toshiba Satellite l50 5 es 5 0 18

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.160 
it's a Toshiba Satellite l50 5 es 5 0 18
I<00:00:16.609> like<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.940> lot<00:00:18.240> I've<00:00:18.449> only<00:00:18.660> had<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.960> for<00:00:18.990> a

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
I like it a lot I've only had it for a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.800 
I like it a lot I've only had it for a
couple<00:00:19.320> days<00:00:19.470> not<00:00:20.460> too<00:00:20.699> many<00:00:20.880> problems<00:00:21.150> just<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
couple days not too many problems just a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.830 
couple days not too many problems just a
couple<00:00:22.020> dislikes<00:00:22.500> about<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.689> it's<00:00:24.689> pretty

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
couple dislikes about it it's pretty

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.009 
couple dislikes about it it's pretty
fast<00:00:25.109> 3<00:00:26.070> gigabytes<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:27.439> RAM<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:29.689> okay

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
fast 3 gigabytes of RAM is okay

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.860 
fast 3 gigabytes of RAM is okay
I<00:00:31.050> mean<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.790> pretty<00:00:33.030> fast<00:00:33.270> just

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
I mean I think it's pretty fast just

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.860 
I mean I think it's pretty fast just
from<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.410> through<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.730> 50<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:37.190> 512<00:00:38.870> megabytes

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
from going through a 50 a 512 megabytes

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.869 
from going through a 50 a 512 megabytes
so<00:00:40.700> I<00:00:41.700> mean<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.600> pretty<00:00:43.590> fast<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.520> far<00:00:44.789> as

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
so I mean this is pretty fast as far as

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.720 
so I mean this is pretty fast as far as
my<00:00:45.030> standards<00:00:45.860> it's<00:00:46.860> expandable<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.700> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
my standards it's expandable to a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.560 
my standards it's expandable to a
gigabytes<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> mean<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.160> want<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.570> bump

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
gigabytes so I mean if you want to bump

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.119 
gigabytes so I mean if you want to bump
it<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.399> at<00:00:53.399> least<00:00:53.610> get<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> up<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.120> five

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
it up to that at least get it up to five

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.819 
it up to that at least get it up to five
haven't<00:00:56.129> done<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.670> yet<00:00:57.230> just<00:00:58.230> because<00:00:58.410> I

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
haven't done that yet just because I

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
haven't done that yet just because I
don't<00:00:59.280> really<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.699> money<00:00:59.780> considering

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780

for<00:04:21.479> them<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:21.870> think<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:23.010> goes<00:04:23.190> on<00:04:23.400> my

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
for them I I think this goes on my

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.279 
for them I I think this goes on my
laptop<00:04:23.970> they<00:04:24.330> were<00:04:24.390> like<00:04:24.510> right<00:04:24.870> in<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.080> front

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
laptop they were like right in the front

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.070 
laptop they were like right in the front
so<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:25.590> would<00:04:25.860> usually<00:04:26.240> stick<00:04:27.240> out<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.690> jab

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
so that would usually stick out and jab

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.490 
so that would usually stick out and jab
you<00:04:28.260> in<00:04:28.289> the<00:04:28.380> stomach<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:30.200> you<00:04:31.200> got<00:04:31.350> this
