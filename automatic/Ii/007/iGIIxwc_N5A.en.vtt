00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.690
 hello welcome to a 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.220
 youtube channel as a graf you want today 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.779
 I show how to use a plectrum 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.789
 and you can really do a lot 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.400
 do wrong 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.289
 the easiest one to use it first 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.960
 only two forms completely at once 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.320
 this here the drop shape and once 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.030
 the larger amounts before neither 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.629
 I actually play that teardrop form so well 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.430
 like everything and that a medium strength 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.550
 and has a very good grip that is 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.590
 that does not slip out of my hand that 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.899
 I use bigger ones if I am now 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.690
 western guitar game or if I am 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:01.100
 really as a rhythm guitarist because you 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:06.090
 they only full board ok so 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.799
 If the pick is too strong I have 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.570
 be a feeling for when it insofar 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.380
 i have no feeling so i 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.680
 prefer medium strength 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:21.450
 the same with the bigger playboy 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.670
 Generally, how do you handle such a project? 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.200
 at all 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.020
 you place it here on the index finger of the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.460
 thumb presses above 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.270
 and now the tip of the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.600
 Spectrum at the index finger of out 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.790
 if I move the orders 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.850
 plectrum that is also one way 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.530
 technology is as important 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.899
 the stop is carried by Blackstone 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.040
 as if you had one in your hand 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.729
 small bag from the arm very loose this 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.490
 Movement shows the arm raising slightly 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.490
 the under swells sometimes wrist 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:11.000
 so the first exercise with the plectrum is 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.040
 we should not always try here 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.510
 to hit the page without version equal 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.100
 go further away 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:33.890
 So I'll do that negative now 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:36.670
 side whole locally then in exchange 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.260
 a chord I get out easily if 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.920
 so pretty far ahead of the times 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.920
 away and now 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.850
 I play tee and one 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.520
 today 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.230
 I can do that with you later 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.709
 Never show everything as a game 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.980
 So it's done by tacking inner staples 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.319
 stop is always all pages 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:16.900
 one after the other only a defense shield 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:21.720
 fast or just sounds that one should 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.720
 First, just practice this change 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:39.910
 I am here now and many 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.250
 people are asking me yes where does not know in 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.890
 which I nacorde on which side 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:50.500
 that's easy to apply 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:54.600
 note e minor or about alternatives 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.600
 page in paris 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.970
 g dur from the 4 billion and else 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.140
 always where the reason then most deeply 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.870
 is thus d major 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:12.240
 reason is that the 90 games I only 14 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.360
 the reason is here so I play off 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.360
 here 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.230
 a minor example, the reason lies here 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:30.930
 so now we come to the solo game 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.930
 Generally one believes the left and the 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.040
 right-wing must have somewhere 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.150
 synchronize so synchronously 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:45.050
 it is not like that but the right hand 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:47.880
 pretends that's what I do and 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.570
 my left had to the finger or 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.570
 the battery 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.360
 So you can relax on the solo 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.100
 play the third mistake or the 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.030
 little finger on the ceiling on supports 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.030
 or here 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:50.629
 spectrum will be really fast 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:53.509
 then here you have the tremolo on the 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:55.340
 the new guitarist is pretty heavy 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.550
 wester is doing better on the 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.500
 Electric guitar and stars like nothing like that 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.440
 generally like a pick 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.270
 I would be there fast as I would be 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.860
 the sides have to be hit again 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.930
 I'm taking a minor chord and now 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.310
 I play the side in exchange 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:16.629
 strike on strike strike on strike 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.629
 on strike and the same back 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:21.759
 the 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.850
 and if I practiced that then 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.169
 I hope that was a lot of fun yes 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.430
 learn something about the plectrum 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:57.770
 and I'll like the plectrum 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.570
 The guitar still works 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.520
 once in great detail in a video 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.090
 show on youtube 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.889
 thank you for the general videos 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.620
 then subscribed to the tube channel again 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.740
 you can with new intervals regularly 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.479
 to see the guitar on the vienna 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:18.220
 amplifier settings playing techniques 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:18.220
 and so on
