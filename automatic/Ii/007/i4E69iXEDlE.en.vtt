00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.509
 our earth has almost 350 different ones 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.340
 species of turtles 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.320
 turtles exist at least 200 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.809
 million years and some species are already 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.679
 extinct one of those extinct 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.660
 species 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.340
 is the all water turtle from vietnam 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.340
 at least we thought so 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.020
 August 14, 2013 it is 5 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.020
 and still dark 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.379
 in the Riviera Hall in Rotterdam Zoo 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.360
 a special transport is being prepared 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.489
 leave today to around 60 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.559
 turtles by plane to vietnam 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.970
 very special turtles though you 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.920
 would not at first sight 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.650
 say there are so attractive publice 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.210
 certainly not its a bit natural 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.030
 she verzwarte turtles mood debt 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.100
 wants beautiful and the heads are beautiful 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.750
 they have nice stripes on the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.760
 special about this is not so very 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.620
 clear because its only black 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.770
 turtles but the special thing is that 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.360
 they were going into 2007 eight 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.869
 by having been in central weather 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.170
 took 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.610
 get as good a track 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.220
 field research an investigation to local 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.410
 population showed in 2007 it still 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.600
 very small number do live in the wild 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.820
 and there are still remaining populations 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.869
 laps 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.490
 a large part of the assumption 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.050
 turtles transported today 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.930
 go is here in zoo blijdorp 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.300
 born via via their parents came into the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.280
 70s to us together with the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.470
 vietnamese government the zoo of 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.149
 munster and a private grower 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.250
 Germany has been there in recent years 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.599
 worked on a rescue plan as much 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.700
 possibly breeding turtles 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.259
 that was the assignment to eventually become one 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.009
 stable population 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.009
 put in the wild 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.450
 here they are ready 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.610
 now quickly to the oceanium because there 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.470
 wait a second load of turtles and 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.880
 there is confusion for a while because they have to 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.890
 not all after vietnam 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.420
 breeding couples must stay here and 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.750
 how do you know for sure that you have the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.599
 good way are with nail polish 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.310
 noticed we count we have every box 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.630
 an own number is number one comes here 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.269
 so we have two number three number 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.769
 four in the district number six seven eight 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.510
 and so on 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.360
 so you can see this way we can with 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.709
 the nail polish may be one 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.720
 this is have 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.200
 they really have a system today so yes 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.200
 thought a lot about it 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.940
 it's six o'clock outside , it's light 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.769
 and then they assumed 65 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.400
 water turtles 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.400
 on the way to Schiphol 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.180
 August 15, the airport of hanoi 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.770
 and yes there is the coffin that is henk 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.340
 15 hours ago in Rotterdam 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.340
 shut up 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.640
 the vietnamese government has one 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.640
 made of it per circus 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.390
 lift the devotional from london 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.760
 the turtles come here in hanoi 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.560
 temporarily in a reception center 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.330
 later it is decided whether these animals 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.019
 go back to the wild or maybe 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.019
 their offspring 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.310
 here in the asia house in zoo 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.500
 Turtles also remain behind 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.700
 because here too the breeding goes on 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.170
 by the way also on many others 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.340
 places in the zoo 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.170
 well we have an outside here again 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.330
 a number of species that 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.680
 that critical company are in it 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.090
 you an extinct 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.069
 and indeed it is a very 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.930
 important task of zoos 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.580
 to ensure that kind of survive and 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.680
 also to the general public at 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.209
 involved and the fairly large audience because 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.319
 also make clear we 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.060
 indeed a social function 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.640
 to not just leave animals 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.890
 because they are fun but also because 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.040
 they obviously have a certain status 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.450
 and hearing in it is the overall picture of 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.579
 in zoos but of course also in 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.579
 increase the whole biodiversity
