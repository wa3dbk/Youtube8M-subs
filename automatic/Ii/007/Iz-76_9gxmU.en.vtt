00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:05.759
Hello everyone, it is the fourth

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.334
and last day of The Summit,

00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:10.312
here we have Gleb (Funn1k)

00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:13.307
the King of Fields, and our hairy friend

00:00:13.307 --> 00:00:15.881
what can you say about the atmosphere

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:18.645
on this tournament, it's quite home-like, relaxed, no?

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:20.049
Yes, it is exactly as you said

00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:22.901
everything is awesome here, you can't say

00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:24.840
that you are on a tournament, more like you came

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.488
to play and relax

00:00:27.488 --> 00:00:32.931
It's not really a work environment, there are no people

00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:38.703
that usually come up to you for an autograph

00:00:38.703 --> 00:00:41.558
I mean it's cool and nice, but gets in the way sometimes

00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:45.691
There is none of that here, you are relaxed and enjoying the time here

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:47.892
You are saying it is relaxed here

00:00:47.892 --> 00:00:50.215
how does it show on your games

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:52.633
or on other teams' games, because I saw that

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:54.427
teams are making lots of different mistakes?

00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.110
It shouldn't show on your games

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.195
if you came here to win, you will win

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.471
but if you came here to just play, to practice

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:07.724
then you will get fourth place.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.243
Well, you came here, you practiced

00:01:11.243 --> 00:01:13.084
you got fourth place, what kind of

00:01:13.084 --> 00:01:15.735
lessons did you learn, what will you do in the future?

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:21.693
We figured out lots of things, the main was

00:01:21.693 --> 00:01:24.268
that right now, everything's not going that great

00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:28.605
but everything can be fixed... won't be easy, but it's possible.

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:31.959
We need a little bit of time, and everything will be good.

00:01:32.722 --> 00:01:35.421
As far as I know, you haven't practiced before,

00:01:35.421 --> 00:01:37.449
there were qualifiers in Europe, where Puppey and

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:40.713
Kuroky went, you didn't really play, now on this tournament

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:48.697
what were your expectations?

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.691
We didn't really have any expectations, we tried to

00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:56.714
practice before the tournament, to develop certain strategies

00:01:56.714 --> 00:01:59.365
and so on, here we tried what is working

00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:03.250
what is not working, but in general all this was caused

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.305
that we were playing poorly, it's hard to explain.

00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:11.284
We came here not to win, we came here to practice

00:02:11.284 --> 00:02:14.653
if we came here to win, then it would be disappointing

00:02:14.653 --> 00:02:19.504
but since we came here just to play, then it's not so bad.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.427
So this is all right for you then?

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.198
Yeah, it Is all right. Sorry, but they aren't

00:02:25.198 --> 00:02:27.434
paying $5 million for the first place here.

00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:29.051
We still have time.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.670
All right, then tell me about the $5 million dollars

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.965
for the first place, which will be coming soon

00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:36.148
in a month, you don't have much time left

00:02:36.148 --> 00:02:38.816
I know you will have a bootcamp for ESL One

00:02:38.816 --> 00:02:39.885
then you will have another one after ESL One

00:02:39.885 --> 00:02:44.172
can you tell us more on how you will prepare?

00:02:44.172 --> 00:02:48.163
On 19 June, I think, we will go to Germany

00:02:48.163 --> 00:02:51.849
we will have some sort of schedule there

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.375
or something, so we will start really working before

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:59.193
The International, like we did the last time we went to China

00:02:59.193 --> 00:03:05.603
try and repeat the same steps, to catch the groove

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:09.299
and go with the flow, win everyone, and so on.

00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:12.465
All right, as you know, this year's The International

00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:16.568
has a very large prize pool, do you think having such

00:03:16.568 --> 00:03:20.592
a large tournament, it devalues the other tournaments

00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:23.291
where you can slack off for a whole year, then

00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:26.473
focus and win, or work hard, and so on?

00:03:26.803 --> 00:03:32.088
Not really, I mean look, other tournaments are already 200-250 thousand

00:03:32.088 --> 00:03:34.787
and you can't really say that even compared

00:03:34.787 --> 00:03:36.659
to The International, that it's insignificant

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.625
I mean it is still a lot of money

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:41.120
and you should not relax, the more you win

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.431
the more you earn.

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:44.037
Can you tell us a little bit

00:03:44.037 --> 00:03:46.018
about the mood within the team

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:47.859
I know that Dendi is sad a little bit

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.121
even though like you said it was logical

00:03:50.121 --> 00:03:52.242
I haven't really spoke to Puppey and Kuroky

00:03:53.093 --> 00:03:55.181
How is it going in the team?

00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:57.461
It is actually going normally

00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:00.193
everyone understands what is going on

00:04:00.193 --> 00:04:05.305
there will be a point when we will all sit in the corner

00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:07.318
and will start examining what is going well

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:09.785
what is not going well, and will start actually working.

00:04:09.785 --> 00:04:11.670
This moment will come, for sure.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.363
It always is this way, and everything will be decided

00:04:17.363 --> 00:04:19.673
on this bootcamp, so how we will play there

00:04:19.673 --> 00:04:23.541
what we will learn there, that's about it.

00:04:24.243 --> 00:04:25.974
All right, thank you for the interview, see you

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:29.125
in Seattle, take care, I hope that

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:32.031
you will practice hard and will be in good shape

00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:33.745
at the tournament, we will, of course

00:04:33.745 --> 00:04:35.022
cheer for you.
