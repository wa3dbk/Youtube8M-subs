00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.130
 beautiful girl has come into this again 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.070
 videos are bobby cycles and we're back 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.400
 immediately he was a pirate sorry if he had been for a while 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.150
 that I do not make videos but had a 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.099
 candle a little busy 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.750
 we see our inter mail here and you 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.320
 you will wonder why I will not have things 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.800
 because I started working as a galleon 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.880
 I told you why I want to do a 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.730
 gigantic galleon made by me because i 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.500
 things you do 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.970
 in short, we can do it 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.420
 drive the analogy with the PC and someone 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.000
 here is our galleon and when it is 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.260
 see now I bring you to see it 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.580
 in fact I don't know why he doesn't care which 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:56.260
 proposer and I have only done already 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:59.410
 used all the wood I had and not any 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:03.790
 I had little because I had type 5 detaches from 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:07.590
 64 and one of 21 seems to me anyway now 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.789
 let's go to you I'll show you I did 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.509
 how can you say the part behind the 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.509
 stern of the galleon 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.060
 and I haven't seen that need for video 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.130
 speed most wanted quite liked it 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:31.090
 you have seen it is also seen that the cec pac 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.250
 not many, however this here 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.200
 part behind I want to do ie think if 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.610
 these are the parts behind this and all the 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.560
 I stay as long as I want to make it big 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:45.850
 however, it remained little wooden one 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:50.590
 stack of 21 I think and the stairs always 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:55.360
 the name does not come from wood and the fence 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:03.660
 anyway I thought I'd go too 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:07.180
 this time to get some ships and there 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.630
 resumes when I find a boat so much 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.630
 so much 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.710
 I found a ship nearby 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 quite close to jeffrey 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.480
 captain jeffrey ie one runs volver 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:27.820
 that I don't like at all 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:31.080
 no we do n't put it that way yet 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.720
 sitting her that stupid 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.060
 okay size 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.150
 no don't do it as stupid as the last one is 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:46.150
 the first time we approach however there is 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:50.020
 the ship without making us wanting to strike with 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:57.820
 from this sailor 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:03:01.540
 hello norton good weapons and thank you 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:06.340
 because it is my first video reached 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.440
 the 60 views is perfect has 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.260
 reached 60 views for me 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:21.790
 just to be the first video I have 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:26.680
 put it and I wanted to make a new series with 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:30.220
 a friend of mine of scribblenauts unlimited 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.570
 but this friend of mine say so before 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.190
 he tells me but we have to buy the only one 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.690
 Justin microphones equipment in 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.470
 what you do sucks is not true 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.470
 because I feel great 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:48.040
 in short, if the show Hague if he is 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.519
 wants to do 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.700
 but he wants to do it well and so he knows me 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.470
 we will not do it also because some buy 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.620
 microphone gets more complicated and as the one 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.690
 the other you spend more stuff to buy that 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.690
 to record hi 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.750
 ok maybe it was n't the best idea 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:18.390
 coming and therefore I don't know if it is 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:20.070
 I will do but I don't think I should 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:27.200
 start something with some of mine 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:29.910
 friend but you will still see good 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.520
 I demolish this ship and then see you 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.520
 to the next 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.100
 this is how I reduced the poor ship is 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.600
 a dungeon and a galleon is not the super 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:45.450
 barchetta this is the last ship that 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:49.260
 I do for today because I wanted to do it a 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:53.610
 this video is short and the other one short 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.330
 I have taken these things here and here it is from 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.950
 then I take the flag 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.150
 I will soon explain why 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.150
 now I tell you nothing 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:13.040
 and always looks like a ghost insists 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.040
 on sport anyway with 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:27.430
 the outlet jacko lantern amia 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:30.030

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.030
