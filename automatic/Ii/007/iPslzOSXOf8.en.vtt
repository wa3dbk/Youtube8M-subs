00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello today we will do 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.210
 repair in the right of the fishing line if you drew 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.650
 attention there are several types 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:17.250
 rim first this is a full bezel 2 it's on 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.210
 fishing line as we have with you now the third is 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.830
 right on the sleeves and 4 right on the screws we 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.650
 now we will do repairs and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.720
 right slicing means we happened 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.000
 such a case fell out and the right cut to 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.130
 us insert back and and us 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.370
 need here such a set 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.309
 In general, in theory, it is given when buying 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.500
 points when you get right here so 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.450
 it looks like this package goes there 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:52.949
 spare fishing line and goes such a ribbon 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.780
 It means if you did not give the bundle here 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.710
 This set is basically you can 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 use gift ribbon 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.000
 who knew flowers used and so 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:11.400
 Further, it is the same absolutely means if 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.799
 you pay attention then our lens goes 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.090
 a groove is cut around the entire circumference 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.210
 groove then approximately 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.180
 1 millimeter deep can be a half 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.790
 and in order for us to insert it 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:33.630
 back we need to first insert in 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.000
 spout here a corner and a temple corner 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.119
 only when my full 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.170
 fixed and we hold it securely to us 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.549
 next you need this here we tape 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.509
 pushing 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.509
 and here it is with us 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.380
 here we are and it means to fasten and begin with 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.970
 nose in the groove we put it and just 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:07.590
 we stretch everything here it has become but we 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.119
 until I take out this ribbon 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.040
 inspect everything is normal in this 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.140
 case we are not doing well because 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.500
 we cut this small forest here 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.480
 . 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.480
 we take it easy and 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.380
 inside I shove now we 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.800
 we compare both that and that lens and here too 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:38.080
 we correct so that nothing hinders everything 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:41.980
 here she got up look they look like everything and 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.480
 quietly about quietly take out here 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.480
