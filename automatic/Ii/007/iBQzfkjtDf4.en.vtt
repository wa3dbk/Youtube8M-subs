00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.070
 more call them it was 8 cavalry 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.130

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.570
 little that total military campfire 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.830
 medieval egypt made up mostly 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.470
 on from boys 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.540
 either slaves or captives of you to us 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.050
 Turkic her Caucasian origin 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.660
 Pants that go out at that time were alone 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.900
 of the best if you are here who 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.140
 gets a good level naturally 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.210
 these young people were treated to oars 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.990
 already trained specials and where to tell 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.940
 pro spice spice graphics 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.510
 that was generally and somewhere on them that is 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:22.650
 it was a turban 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.410
 the warriors are richer and see the iron helmet 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.830
 then I wanted to dress and could only 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.520
 small 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.800
 cartoons say stress put this in 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.310
 the state of a couple of barsihana between now 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.400
 these too I want to see him probably 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.220
 You need a spectrum of hair on a vanshot george 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.300
 in another way than on the move on 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.550
 own glitches 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:51.460
 there was a horse naturally arabic such and 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.420
 also each warrior was one or two 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.690
 camel he needed to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.830
 transfer equipment mainly than 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:09.280
 were public let's say armed with 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:14.140
 lesson spear he their warriors sword saber mace 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.370
 and toilers like someone rich say 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.940

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:25.150
 officers wore precious 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.070
 stones and gold were there were Rash 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.480
 points by yourself give me a principle 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:35.890
 different well and still say that at that time 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.420
 just so the age old was considered one of 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.900
 best warriors 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:46.250
 generally not only asia but 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:49.200
 and those who could fight the Mongols 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.879
 those who could fight with knights 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.290
 European videos were strong fire 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.560
