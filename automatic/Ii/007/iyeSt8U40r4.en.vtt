peyote plants that we can locate that

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.420 
peyote plants that we can locate that
will<00:00:23.029> enable<00:00:24.029> us<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.859> suddenly<00:00:25.859> become<00:00:26.039> other

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
will enable us to suddenly become other

that's the working theory right okay so
but<00:00:31.349> we<00:00:31.560> know<00:00:31.800> through<00:00:32.520> our<00:00:32.550> extensive

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
but we know through our extensive

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.020 
but we know through our extensive
research<00:00:34.010> we<00:00:35.010> went<00:00:35.190> down<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> library<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
research we went down to the library and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.500 
research we went down to the library and
look<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> microfiche<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:38.040> you

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
look at the microfiche that if you

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.970 
look at the microfiche that if you
follow<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.780> fence<00:00:40.079> line<00:00:40.350> at<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> baseball

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
follow the fence line at the baseball

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.350
