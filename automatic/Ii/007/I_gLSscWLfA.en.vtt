all right Brad since I promised you a

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.470 
all right Brad since I promised you a
video<00:00:02.310> showing<00:00:02.639> you<00:00:02.790> around<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.179> farm<00:00:03.419> a

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
video showing you around the farm a

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.749 
video showing you around the farm a
little<00:00:03.600> bit<00:00:03.840> came<00:00:04.740> out<00:00:04.890> today<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.339> shoot<00:00:05.549> that

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
little bit came out today and shoot that

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.760 
little bit came out today and shoot that
the<00:00:06.150> good<00:00:06.299> thing<00:00:06.480> about<00:00:06.509> me<00:00:06.899> delaying<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.560> long

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
the good thing about me delaying so long

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.770 
the good thing about me delaying so long
is<00:00:08.010> that<00:00:08.040> since<00:00:08.880> its<00:00:09.059> fall<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.480> can<00:00:09.599> have<00:00:09.750> a

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
is that since its fall you can have a

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.049 
is that since its fall you can have a
nice<00:00:10.019> look<00:00:10.290> at<00:00:10.410> our<00:00:10.559> fall<00:00:11.280> colors<00:00:11.670> as<00:00:11.880> they

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
nice look at our fall colors as they

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.480 
nice look at our fall colors as they
start<00:00:12.420> come<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.809> here<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.259> farm<00:00:13.500> men<00:00:14.370> and

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
start come in here on the farm men and

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.919 
start come in here on the farm men and
I'll<00:00:14.610> show<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.030> orchard<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.599> some<00:00:15.839> of

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
I'll show you the orchard and some of

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.710 
I'll show you the orchard and some of
our<00:00:16.049> hardwoods<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.119> beyond<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.359> think

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
our hardwoods and beyond that I think

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.929 
our hardwoods and beyond that I think
I'll<00:00:18.869> show<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.140> kind<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.460> concept

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
I'll show you kind of what the concept

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.939 
I'll show you kind of what the concept
is<00:00:21.060> behind<00:00:21.330> our<00:00:21.600> solar<00:00:21.900> greenhouse<00:00:22.320> today<00:00:22.680> and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
is behind our solar greenhouse today and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.170 
is behind our solar greenhouse today and
maybe<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.490> little<00:00:23.550> bit<00:00:23.699> more<00:00:23.970> information

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
maybe a little bit more information

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.640 
maybe a little bit more information
about<00:00:24.510> that

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.269 

this<00:00:29.430> is<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> newa<00:00:29.939> solar<00:00:30.270> greenhouse<00:00:31.009> we<00:00:32.009> cut

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
this is a newa solar greenhouse we cut

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.400 
this is a newa solar greenhouse we cut
this<00:00:32.489> together<00:00:32.700> mostly<00:00:33.300> out<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.450> material

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
this together mostly out of material

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.710 
this together mostly out of material
that<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.620> had<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.980> hand<00:00:35.220> that<00:00:36.180> being<00:00:36.390> metal

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
that we had on hand that being metal

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.380 
that we had on hand that being metal
pipes<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.260> think<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.650> total<00:00:37.829> cost<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.400> this<00:00:38.550> was

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
pipes I think the total cost of this was

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.280 
pipes I think the total cost of this was
somewhere<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:41.000> $1,000<00:00:42.000> range<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:43.079> we'll

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
somewhere in the $1,000 range but we'll

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.930 
somewhere in the $1,000 range but we'll
just<00:00:43.320> step<00:00:43.680> inside<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:49.699> immediately<00:00:50.699> when

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
just step inside here immediately when

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.090 
just step inside here immediately when
you<00:00:51.059> step<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.480> there's<00:00:51.690> about<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.960> 20<00:00:52.949> degree

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
you step in there's about a 20 degree

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.450 
you step in there's about a 20 degree
difference<00:00:53.670> between<00:00:54.180> what<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.839> is<00:00:54.930> outside

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
difference between what it is outside

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.680 
difference between what it is outside
what<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.620> now<00:00:58.620> I'll<00:00:58.739> explain<00:00:58.860> the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
what it is in here now I'll explain the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.350 
what it is in here now I'll explain the
mechanism<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.839> you<00:01:00.930> behind<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:02.180> this<00:01:03.180> is

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
mechanism to you behind that this is

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.330 
mechanism to you behind that this is
well<00:01:03.570> over<00:01:03.600> into<00:01:05.090> November<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:08.280> know

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
well over into November now and you know

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.580 
well over into November now and you know
we've<00:01:08.490> got<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> green<00:01:08.880> beans<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
we've got a green beans going on and the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.890 
we've got a green beans going on and the
way<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.700> we're<00:01:11.790> able<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.690> is<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
way that we're able to do that is to

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.850 
way that we're able to do that is to
heat<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.049> using<00:01:17.360> kind<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.479> solar<00:01:18.780> power<00:01:19.049> this

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
heat it using kind of solar power this

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.190 
heat it using kind of solar power this
is<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> magic<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.549> makes<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.939> happen<00:01:21.200> these

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
is the magic that makes it happen these

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.090 
is the magic that makes it happen these
are<00:01:22.260> old<00:01:22.909> they<00:01:23.909> call<00:01:24.119> them<00:01:24.210> teeth<00:01:24.420> dip<00:01:25.100> barrels

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
are old they call them teeth dip barrels

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.999 
are old they call them teeth dip barrels
and<00:01:26.340> these<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.360> from<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.570> dairy<00:01:27.810> farm<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.860> we've

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and these are from a dairy farm so we've

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.740 
and these are from a dairy farm so we've
just<00:01:29.040> reused<00:01:29.640> these<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.240> filled<00:01:30.600> them<00:01:30.720> with

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
just reused these and filled them with

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.980 
just reused these and filled them with
water<00:01:31.080> and<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:32.460> sunlight<00:01:32.850> comes<00:01:33.120> in<00:01:33.300> heats

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
water and the sunlight comes in heats

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.900 
water and the sunlight comes in heats
them<00:01:34.110> up<00:01:34.260> and<00:01:34.560> protects<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> plants<00:01:35.670> from<00:01:35.760> the

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
them up and protects the plants from the

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.580 
them up and protects the plants from the
frost<00:01:36.120> at<00:01:36.330> night<00:01:36.510> because<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.080> puts<00:01:37.260> out<00:01:37.440> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
frost at night because it puts out the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.580 
frost at night because it puts out the
energy<00:01:37.830> that<00:01:38.550> is<00:01:38.700> stored<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.180> there<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.990> that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
energy that is stored in there and that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.040 
energy that is stored in there and that
will<00:01:40.680> protect<00:01:40.830> these<00:01:41.130> well<00:01:41.910> into<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.420> first

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
will protect these well into the first

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.580 
will protect these well into the first
frost<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.680> we've<00:01:43.830> already<00:01:44.040> had

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.520 

in<00:01:50.590> case<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:50.979> do<00:01:51.220> plan<00:01:51.520> on<00:01:51.549> trying<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.600> text<00:01:53.350> on

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
in case you do plan on trying to text on

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.359 
in case you do plan on trying to text on
this<00:01:53.770> on<00:01:53.950> yourself<00:01:55.890> there's<00:01:56.890> some<00:01:57.010> plants

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
this on yourself there's some plants

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.040 
this on yourself there's some plants
that<00:01:57.490> you'd<00:01:57.670> probably<00:01:57.880> want<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.510> have<00:01:58.690> at

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
that you'd probably want to have at

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.320 
that you'd probably want to have at
least<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.440> few<00:01:59.590> were<00:01:59.710> in<00:01:59.800> North<00:02:00.040> Carolina<00:02:00.520> and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
least a few were in North Carolina and

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.760 
least a few were in North Carolina and
I'm<00:02:01.450> sure<00:02:01.659> that<00:02:01.869> some<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.290> you<00:02:02.470> in<00:02:02.590> California

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
I'm sure that some of you in California

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.070 
I'm sure that some of you in California
can<00:02:03.280> grow<00:02:03.430> this<00:02:03.610> as<00:02:03.790> well<00:02:04.000> when<00:02:04.810> we're<00:02:04.960> looking

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
can grow this as well when we're looking

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.270 
can grow this as well when we're looking
at<00:02:05.380> right<00:02:05.560> here<00:02:05.619> is<00:02:06.630> asparagus<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.890> has<00:02:09.039> gone

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
at right here is asparagus that has gone

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.699
