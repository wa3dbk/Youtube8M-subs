00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.790
 small demonstration 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.620
 performance 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.929
 snapdragon 810 are you looking for zion share and 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.449
 also try to measure the temperature 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.750
 to evaluate heating with 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.850
 special magic device 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:27.560
 magic well i have to play a little 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.689
 so that the device gets hot so i 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.419
 I will be silent during the game 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.479
 concentrate think it's all fine 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.210
 understand the person should be maximally 

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:43.999
 concentrated while playing the more so in 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.940
 such a game, yes, this device is so 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:55.729
 Looks like now I will play a couple of hours and 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:59.420
 then measure the temperature very much 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:02.019
 hard to play without sound is not felt 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.019
 full immersion 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.049
 we conducted heat testing 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.390
 htc one m9 is now running background 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.149
 several programs 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.600
 antutu in stability mode tester gta 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:25.210
 san andreas I played a half hour of his 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.520
 started paused paused temperature by 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.759
 battery measure how to see forty 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.960
 five and seven degrees if 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.970
 special device to measure it 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.390
 shows body temperature 40 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:41.979
 degrees while in the hand smartphone 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.600
 feels very hot well straight 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.250
 really not comfortable holding her 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.009
 the problem i think is that just 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.619
 aluminum body completely and he 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.179
 acts as a heat sink accumulating 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.119
 all the heat that is, if the housing 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.459
 was plastic with the same heat 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.830
 battery there and other components 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:02.530
 you would not feel such heat in your hand 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.470
 enclosures but here since it is used 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.410
 the metal then all the heating goes immediately to 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.660
 aluminum and in his hand hold let's say 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.790
 so not very comfortable with this heated 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.810
 although I repeat 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.700
 in the program, heating, well, not super critical 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.549
 Ie 45 degrees to under load well 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.250
 This is basically what it shows and 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.420
 other flagships under heavy load 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.049
 that is, how is anything critical 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.049
 there is no
