computer is pretty easy to do once

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.619 
computer is pretty easy to do once
you've<00:00:05.490> taken<00:00:05.640> all<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.940> cables<00:00:06.330> out<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
you've taken all the cables out of the

you've taken all the cables out of the
back<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.020> computer<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.620> put<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:07.890> up<00:00:07.980> onto

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
back of the computer and put it up onto

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:16.000 
back of the computer and put it up onto
a<00:00:08.309> bench<00:00:08.630> just<00:00:09.630> turn<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.900> around<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.230> back

they<00:00:36.840> have<00:00:36.989> hooks<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> side<00:00:37.500> hook<00:00:38.250> into

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
they have hooks on the side hook into

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.600 
they have hooks on the side hook into
the<00:00:38.610> lashes<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:39.059> top<00:00:39.270> here<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.050> bottom

the lashes up top here and the bottom
once<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> side<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.090> off<00:00:42.239> put<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:42.989> aside

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
once the side is off put it aside

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.330 
once the side is off put it aside
something<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.620> need<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.010> remove

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
something so now we just need to remove

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.279 
something so now we just need to remove
the<00:00:47.489> hard<00:00:47.700> drives<00:00:48.030> see<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.050> got<00:00:49.170> two

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the hard drives see you got two

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.930 
the hard drives see you got two
different<00:00:49.410> kinds<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.920> hard<00:00:50.100> drives<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.640> got

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
different kinds of hard drives here got

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.590 
different kinds of hard drives here got
the<00:00:51.120> IDE<00:00:51.449> which<00:00:52.350> has<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.280> power

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
the IDE which has this kind of power

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.650 
the IDE which has this kind of power
cable<00:00:54.600> an<00:00:55.289> IDE<00:00:55.649> ribbon<00:00:56.070> cable<00:00:56.510> we've<00:00:57.510> got

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
cable an IDE ribbon cable we've got

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
cable an IDE ribbon cable we've got
solder<00:00:58.079> which<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.469> underneath<00:00:58.879> has<00:00:59.879> different

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
solder which is underneath has different

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.790 
solder which is underneath has different
kinds<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.570> cables<00:01:00.809> there<00:01:01.230> which<00:01:01.440> I'll<00:01:01.590> show

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
kinds of cables there which I'll show

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.189 
kinds of cables there which I'll show
you<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.070> moment<00:01:02.219> once<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.390> remove<00:01:03.690> these<00:01:03.870> ones

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you in a moment once I remove these ones

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.300 
you in a moment once I remove these ones
so<00:01:05.210> let's<00:01:06.210> take<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.049> IDE<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
so let's take out the IDE I'm going to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.730 
so let's take out the IDE I'm going to
do<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> unplug<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.150> power<00:01:09.299> cable<00:01:09.510> first<00:01:09.900> we'll

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
do is unplug the power cable first we'll

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.789 
do is unplug the power cable first we'll
comes<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.840> then<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.140> take<00:01:13.500> out<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
comes out and then get take out the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.100 
comes out and then get take out the
ribbon<00:01:13.979> cable<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:15.299> put<00:01:15.509> your<00:01:15.630> fingers

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
ribbon cable you put your fingers

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.350 
ribbon cable you put your fingers
underneath<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.590> ribbon<00:01:16.770> cable<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.310> leave<00:01:18.060> him

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
underneath the ribbon cable to leave him

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.200 
underneath the ribbon cable to leave him
out<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> wiggle<00:01:19.409> or<00:01:19.650> yank<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.790> see<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
out with the wiggle or yank and see the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.749 
out with the wiggle or yank and see the
people<00:01:21.420> pins<00:01:21.810> there<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:23.009> audio<00:01:23.400> cable<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
people pins there the audio cable and

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.480 
people pins there the audio cable and
solder<00:01:26.759> drive<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.229> data<00:01:28.439> cable<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
solder drive is the data cable it's the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.539 
solder drive is the data cable it's the
power<00:01:29.700> cable<00:01:30.860> don't<00:01:31.860> do<00:01:32.040> them<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.400> got

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
power cable don't do them you just got

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.749 
power cable don't do them you just got
to<00:01:32.640> depress<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> latch<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.990> pull<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.320> out<00:01:34.759> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
to depress the latch and pull it out and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.630 
to depress the latch and pull it out and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
again for the power press latch pull it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.499 
again for the power press latch pull it
out<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.020> I'm<00:01:40.140> done<00:01:41.119> now<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.390> will

sometimes in any graphics cards you

sometimes in any graphics cards you
might<00:02:12.209> have

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
usually I feel a bit of a wiggle just a

usually I feel a bit of a wiggle just a
little<00:02:15.440> bit<00:02:15.560> you've<00:02:16.370> got<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.550> take<00:02:16.700> things<00:02:16.910> out

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
little bit you've got to take things out

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.759 
little bit you've got to take things out
don't<00:02:17.390> be<00:02:17.569> afraid<00:02:17.599> to<00:02:18.050> just<00:02:18.319> remember<00:02:18.650> which

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
don't be afraid to just remember which

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.100 
don't be afraid to just remember which
way<00:02:18.920> they're<00:02:19.099> going<00:02:19.220> back<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.580> again<00:02:20.110> that's

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
way they're going back in again that's

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.160 
way they're going back in again that's
all<00:02:21.290> there<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.680> take<00:02:21.830> another<00:02:22.040> hard<00:02:22.280> drive

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
all there is to take another hard drive

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.560 
all there is to take another hard drive
