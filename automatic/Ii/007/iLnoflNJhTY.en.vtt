eight months natural three months ago I
stopped<00:01:23.860> taking<00:01:24.070> it<00:01:24.340> because<00:01:24.490> I<00:01:24.670> wanted<00:01:24.880> to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030

there<00:01:27.550> was<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.850> difference<00:01:28.240> between<00:01:28.330> when<00:01:29.050> I

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
there was a difference between when I

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.320 
there was a difference between when I
was<00:01:29.380> taking<00:01:29.770> it<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.009> when<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.550> wasn't<00:01:30.880> taking

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
was taking it and when I wasn't taking

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.080 
was taking it and when I wasn't taking
it<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.600> I<00:01:31.750> took<00:01:32.140> it<00:01:32.350> long<00:01:32.590> enough<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:33.190> to<00:01:33.880> be

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
it and I took it long enough to to be

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.880 
it and I took it long enough to to be
able<00:01:34.179> to<00:01:34.330> see<00:01:34.539> if<00:01:34.750> there<00:01:34.960> was<00:01:35.080> a<00:01:35.140> change<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:35.740> I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
able to see if there was a change and I

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.350 
able to see if there was a change and I
stopped<00:01:36.340> taking<00:01:36.550> it<00:01:37.140> personally<00:01:38.140> for<00:01:38.740> me<00:01:38.979> I

stopped taking it personally for me I
don't<00:01:40.360> think<00:01:40.570> biotin<00:01:41.140> makes<00:01:41.350> your<00:01:41.530> hair<00:01:41.740> grow

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.800 
fragile and you know that's how my nails
are<00:02:36.850> they're<00:02:37.000> fragile<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.540> they<00:02:37.600> break

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
are they're fragile and they break

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.590 
are they're fragile and they break
easily<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.820> was<00:02:40.030> making<00:02:40.329> them<00:02:40.420> grow

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
easily but it was making them grow

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.060 
easily but it was making them grow
faster<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:41.200> wasn't<00:02:41.560> making<00:02:41.650> them<00:02:41.890> grow

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
faster it wasn't making them grow

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.150 
faster it wasn't making them grow
stronger<00:02:42.549> they<00:02:42.670> did<00:02:43.060> looked<00:02:43.299> healthier<00:02:43.780> and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
stronger they did looked healthier and

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.280 
stronger they did looked healthier and
for<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.310> reason<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.850> will<00:02:46.030> probably<00:02:46.359> start

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
for that reason I will probably start

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.009 
for that reason I will probably start
taking<00:02:47.650> biotin<00:02:48.070> again<00:02:48.340> just<00:02:48.730> for<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.030> for<00:02:49.840> the

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
taking biotin again just for the for the

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.710 
taking biotin again just for the for the
the<00:02:50.829> progress<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.579> has<00:02:51.820> on<00:02:52.090> my<00:02:52.269> nails<00:02:52.450> and

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
the progress that it has on my nails and

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.390 
the progress that it has on my nails and
what<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.049> does<00:02:53.170> for<00:02:53.320> my<00:02:53.440> nails<00:02:53.620> but<00:02:54.100> as<00:02:54.190> far<00:02:54.340> as

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
what it does for my nails but as far as

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.560 
what it does for my nails but as far as
I'm<00:02:54.489> concerned<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.880> does<00:02:55.030> nothing<00:02:55.180> from<00:02:55.480> my

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
I'm concerned it does nothing from my

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.939 
I'm concerned it does nothing from my
hair<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.650> does<00:02:56.859> say<00:02:57.070> skin<00:02:57.489> hair<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.690> nail

00:02:58.939 --> 00:02:58.949 
hair and it does say skin hair and nail

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.180 
hair and it does say skin hair and nail
