00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.940
 faces when they give me the soup that simple and 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.800

 [Music] 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.660
 and good moving on to another topic just a lot 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.940
 this news that this old woman who already 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.060
 It is not famous but it was very many 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.670
 years called paty christmas came out singing 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.100
 in a television show or something 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.890
 and suddenly a towel fell off 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.960
 female casual you're singing medium 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.910
 moving and pum you drop the towel 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.100
 it is clear to me if it was a towel or a 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.480
 party because we know that things 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.940
 they are bigger are not so many are the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.800
 small and skinny than size 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.540
 I think it was a towel I understand you 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.820
 that is screwed because then nobody gets 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.920
 his towel had fallen while he was 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.600
 on television that is something new 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.940
 I think but I do think it 's a 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.310
 advertising strategy of what footprint 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.500
 I am nobody I am already ruca and then already in and 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.270
 I take songs from an age and I need 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.300
 publicity so put I dropped the 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.780
 song towel ok yes because I think that 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.150
 it's because you do not mame or yours is 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.220
 clean and you are lowering the towel 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.620
 it's clean but good the most 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.690
 important today that I wanted to touch is 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.870
 based on this picture a little bit ago 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.680

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.390
 gratitude 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.060

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.340

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.160
