00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
ounces of precooked steak that I

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.220 
ounces of precooked steak that I
actually<00:00:50.090> bought<00:00:51.090> from<00:00:51.329> Costco<00:00:51.870> actually<00:00:52.140> all

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
actually bought from Costco actually all

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.720 
actually bought from Costco actually all
this<00:00:52.379> stuff<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.680> usually<00:00:53.010> bought<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.340> bulk<00:00:53.489> so

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
this stuff is usually bought in bulk so

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.660 
this stuff is usually bought in bulk so
it's<00:00:53.820> really<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.180> expensive<00:00:54.620> so

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
it's really not that expensive so

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.099 
it's really not that expensive so
something<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.270> most<00:00:57.629> people<00:00:57.870> could

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
something that I think most people could

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.189 
something that I think most people could
afford<00:00:59.059> but<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.210> my<00:01:00.359> medley<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.960> see<00:01:01.170> I

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
afford but in my medley you can see I

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.660 
afford but in my medley you can see I
got<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.680> there's<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:02.039> hands<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.460> there's<00:01:02.609> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
got a lot there's my hands so there's a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.240 
got a lot there's my hands so there's a
huge<00:01:03.059> amount<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:04.080> that's<00:01:04.739> definitely<00:01:05.129> gonna

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
huge amount here that's definitely gonna

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.670
