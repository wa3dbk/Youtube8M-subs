more close-range combat so regardless of

the attack and I've seem to work very

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.160 
the attack and I've seem to work very
well<00:02:12.459> so<00:02:12.640> if<00:02:13.420> you're<00:02:13.570> going<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.780> pick<00:02:14.019> an

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
well so if you're going to pick an

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.810 
well so if you're going to pick an
attachment<00:02:14.410> one<00:02:14.769> of<00:02:14.890> those<00:02:15.010> two<00:02:15.220> is<00:02:15.250> possibly

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
attachment one of those two is possibly

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.180 
attachment one of those two is possibly
best<00:02:16.150> having<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.570> bare-bones<00:02:16.989> desert<00:02:17.590> eagle<00:02:17.829> is

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
best having a bare-bones desert eagle is

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.819 
best having a bare-bones desert eagle is
ok<00:02:18.970> but<00:02:19.030> having<00:02:19.870> one<00:02:20.079> with<00:02:20.230> attachments<00:02:20.739> is

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
ok but having one with attachments is

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.210 
ok but having one with attachments is

gameplay<00:04:03.780> we<00:04:03.900> can<00:04:04.019> see<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.260> deagle<00:04:04.590> here<00:04:04.800> as

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
gameplay we can see the deagle here as

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.630 
gameplay we can see the deagle here as
many<00:04:05.880> people<00:04:06.209> call<00:04:06.300> it<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.450> deagle<00:04:06.900> has<00:04:07.560> a

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
many people call it the deagle has a

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.920 
many people call it the deagle has a
immense<00:04:08.640> amount<00:04:09.000> of<00:04:09.060> Rico<00:04:09.330> even<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.690> close

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
immense amount of Rico even a close

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.509 
immense amount of Rico even a close
range<00:04:10.260> it's<00:04:10.530> still<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.709> bit<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.070> struggle

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
range it's still a bit of a struggle

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.670 
range it's still a bit of a struggle
here<00:04:12.209> I've<00:04:12.390> been<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.630> medium-range<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.380> have<00:04:13.530> to

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
here I've been a medium-range I have to

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.680 
here I've been a medium-range I have to
have<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.489> kind<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:14.730> gap<00:04:14.970> between<00:04:15.120> my<00:04:15.420> shots

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
have that kind of gap between my shots

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.120 
have that kind of gap between my shots
it's<00:04:15.959> also<00:04:16.140> good<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.440> take<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:16.709> little<00:04:16.919> break

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
it's also good to take a little break

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.340 
it's also good to take a little break
after<00:04:17.370> two<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:17.970> three<00:04:18.150> shots<00:04:18.390> but<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.320> being

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
after two to three shots but that being

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.340 
after two to three shots but that being

kills<00:04:27.120> reload<00:04:27.960> is<00:04:28.169> a<00:04:28.200> bit<00:04:28.410> quick<00:04:28.680> and<00:04:29.250> we'll

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
kills reload is a bit quick and we'll

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.130 
kills reload is a bit quick and we'll
see<00:04:29.550> here<00:04:29.790> in<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:29.940> second<00:04:30.360> that<00:04:30.540> even<00:04:31.020> out

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
see here in a second that even out

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.200 
see here in a second that even out
immensely<00:04:31.560> long<00:04:31.950> range<00:04:32.190> it's<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.760> damage<00:04:33.090> is

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
immensely long range it's the damage is

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.390 
immensely long range it's the damage is
reduced<00:04:33.360> about<00:04:33.750> 30<00:04:34.110> points<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:35.100> it's<00:04:35.220> going<00:04:35.340> to

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
reduced about 30 points so it's going to

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.909 
reduced about 30 points so it's going to
take<00:04:35.550> three<00:04:35.910> or<00:04:36.060> four<00:04:36.360> hits<00:04:36.720> while<00:04:37.140> pacing<00:04:37.530> its

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
take three or four hits while pacing its

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.040 
take three or four hits while pacing its

oh Rico doesn't kick in too much so
we'll<00:04:40.200> see<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.440> effects<00:04:40.710> right<00:04:40.979> here<00:04:41.360> even

say<00:04:56.940> is<00:04:57.090> your<00:04:57.270> best<00:04:57.479> bet<00:04:57.660> because<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.830> tends<00:04:59.130> to

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
say is your best bet because it tends to

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.000 
say is your best bet because it tends to
lead<00:04:59.910> to<00:04:59.940> a<00:05:00.120> slight<00:05:00.479> bit<00:05:00.630> more<00:05:00.900> in

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
lead to a slight bit more in

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.940 
lead to a slight bit more in
then<00:05:03.010> you<00:05:03.160> would<00:05:03.340> aim<00:05:03.550> down<00:05:03.760> the<00:05:03.820> sights<00:05:04.950> but

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
then you would aim down the sights but

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.530 
then you would aim down the sights but
if<00:05:06.070> going<00:05:06.340> for<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.550> kind<00:05:06.700> of<00:05:06.760> running<00:05:07.060> gun<00:05:07.240> class

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
if going for a kind of running gun class

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.110 
if going for a kind of running gun class
it<00:05:07.780> would<00:05:08.050> be<00:05:08.340> somewhat<00:05:09.340> decent<00:05:09.760> but<00:05:09.910> always

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
it would be somewhat decent but always

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.430 
it would be somewhat decent but always
remember<00:05:10.330> you<00:05:10.600> have<00:05:10.750> to<00:05:10.780> be<00:05:10.960> up<00:05:11.080> close<00:05:11.320> you

remember you have to be up close you

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.080 
remember you have to be up close you
never<00:05:11.980> want<00:05:12.220> to<00:05:12.250> go<00:05:12.340> for<00:05:12.550> a<00:05:12.580> long<00:05:12.730> range<00:05:12.940> or

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
never want to go for a long range or

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.270 
never want to go for a long range or
medium<00:05:13.360> shelter<00:05:13.780> at<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:13.870> Desert<00:05:14.260> Eagle<00:05:14.350> so

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
medium shelter at the Desert Eagle so

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.530 
medium shelter at the Desert Eagle so
here<00:05:15.430> we<00:05:15.460> are<00:05:15.640> moving<00:05:15.820> onto<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.210> akimbo

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
here we are moving onto the akimbo

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.940 
here we are moving onto the akimbo
attachment<00:05:17.170> which<00:05:17.290> gives<00:05:17.560> you<00:05:17.710> the<00:05:17.860> ability

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
attachment which gives you the ability

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.250 
attachment which gives you the ability
to<00:05:18.370> have<00:05:18.490> to<00:05:18.970> desert<00:05:19.360> eagles<00:05:19.630> rather<00:05:19.870> than<00:05:20.110> the

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
to have to desert eagles rather than the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.920 
to have to desert eagles rather than the
ability<00:05:20.650> to<00:05:20.800> aim<00:05:20.980> down<00:05:21.160> the<00:05:21.250> sights<00:05:21.660> so<00:05:22.660> it's

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
ability to aim down the sights so it's

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.740 
ability to aim down the sights so it's
also<00:05:23.260> easier<00:05:23.710> here<00:05:24.100> to<00:05:24.130> take<00:05:25.060> off<00:05:25.210> two<00:05:25.390> enemies

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
also easier here to take off two enemies

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.290 
also easier here to take off two enemies

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
go for those long range shots even if

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.290 
go for those long range shots even if
you<00:05:32.710> code<00:05:33.010> you<00:05:33.160> off<00:05:33.370> that<00:05:33.580> much<00:05:33.700> firepower<00:05:33.940> on

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
you code you off that much firepower on
