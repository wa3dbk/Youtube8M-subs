I'm<00:01:43.340> going<00:01:43.549> to<00:01:43.609> do<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.700> modified<00:01:44.209> version<00:01:44.240> of<00:01:44.630> it

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
I'm going to do a modified version of it

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:45.789 
I'm going to do a modified version of it
just<00:01:44.840> because<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.139> want<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.319> show<00:01:45.439> you<00:01:45.499> how<00:01:45.679> it

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
just because I want to show you how it

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:46.209 
just because I want to show you how it
looks

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
looks

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.159 
looks
scaption<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:48.409> hand<00:01:48.679> should<00:01:48.829> be<00:01:48.889> supinated

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:50.169 
scaption the hand should be supinated

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:52.809 
scaption the hand should be supinated
the<00:01:51.169> opposite<00:01:51.590> hand<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:52.039> opposite<00:01:52.490> leg

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
the opposite hand the opposite leg

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.789 
the opposite hand the opposite leg
should<00:01:53.060> be<00:01:53.119> over<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:53.990> resistance<00:01:54.200> band<00:01:54.649> and

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
should be over the resistance band and

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.830 
should be over the resistance band and
what<00:01:55.369> you<00:01:55.459> want<00:01:55.639> to<00:01:55.729> focus<00:01:55.849> on<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.299> squeezing

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
what you want to focus on is squeezing

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.260 
what you want to focus on is squeezing
your<00:01:56.959> shoulder<00:01:56.990> blades<00:01:57.529> again<00:01:58.490> depending<00:01:59.179> on

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
your shoulder blades again depending on

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.120 
your shoulder blades again depending on
how<00:01:59.389> to<00:01:59.450> collarbone<00:01:59.899> fills<00:02:00.319> you<00:02:00.499> may<00:02:00.649> not<00:02:00.859> can

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
how to collarbone fills you may not can

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.830 
how to collarbone fills you may not can
move<00:02:01.369> at<00:02:01.669> this<00:02:02.090> plane<00:02:02.299> of<00:02:02.419> motion<00:02:02.509> so<00:02:02.749> you

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
move at this plane of motion so you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.690 
move at this plane of motion so you
can't<00:02:03.049> modify<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.590> but<00:02:04.099> what<00:02:04.219> you<00:02:04.310> want<00:02:04.459> to<00:02:04.549> be

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
can't modify it but what you want to be

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.580 
can't modify it but what you want to be
is<00:02:04.939> you<00:02:05.329> want<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:05.599> come<00:02:05.779> into<00:02:06.020> your<00:02:06.229> lateral

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
is you want to come into your lateral

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.309 
is you want to come into your lateral
plane<00:02:06.799> of<00:02:06.979> motion<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.549> back<00:02:08.300> down<00:02:08.599> again<00:02:08.869> you

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
plane of motion and back down again you

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.240 
plane of motion and back down again you
want<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.530> think<00:02:09.619> about<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.069> muscles

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
want to think about the muscles

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.760 
want to think about the muscles
stabilizing<00:02:11.090> your<00:02:11.180> back<00:02:11.420> because<00:02:12.110> again<00:02:12.380> your

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
stabilizing your back because again your

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.680 
stabilizing your back because again your
collarbone<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.340> in<00:02:13.460> front<00:02:13.760> but<00:02:13.970> those<00:02:14.270> muscles

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
collarbone is in front but those muscles

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.530 
collarbone is in front but those muscles
all<00:02:14.870> connect<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.590> some<00:02:16.250> weird<00:02:16.520> way<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.480> you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
all connect and some weird way so you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.309 
all connect and some weird way so you
can<00:02:17.690> keep<00:02:17.780> your<00:02:17.930> chest<00:02:18.020> up

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
can keep your chest up

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.780 
can keep your chest up
right<00:02:18.469> keep<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.769> core<00:02:18.980> contracted<00:02:19.640> and

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
right keep the core contracted and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.989 
right keep the core contracted and
you're<00:02:20.269> lifting<00:02:20.499> up<00:02:21.969> and<00:02:22.969> down<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:25.730> give<00:02:25.879> you<00:02:25.969> a

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:25.999 
you're lifting up and down to give you a

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:27.849 
you're lifting up and down to give you a
better<00:02:26.180> view<00:02:26.450> of<00:02:26.480> what<00:02:26.719> I'm<00:02:26.840> doing<00:02:27.230> I'm<00:02:27.799> making

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
better view of what I'm doing I'm making

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.339 
better view of what I'm doing I'm making
sure<00:02:28.249> my<00:02:28.280> shoulder<00:02:28.639> blade<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.819> squeezed<00:02:29.239> if<00:02:29.629> I

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
sure my shoulder blade is squeezed if I

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.250 
sure my shoulder blade is squeezed if I
can't<00:02:30.650> open<00:02:31.430> up<00:02:31.579> my<00:02:31.909> arms<00:02:32.329> all<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.540> way<00:02:32.689> say

have mobility here work and the range of
motion<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.269> can<00:02:38.480> work<00:02:38.629> in<00:02:38.689> because<00:02:38.959> I

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
motion that you can work in because I

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.390 
motion that you can work in because I
guarantee<00:02:39.379> you<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.920> get<00:02:40.069> better

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
because a lot of time you try to force

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.229 
because a lot of time you try to force
it<00:02:42.260> but<00:02:42.859> you<00:02:42.950> don't<00:02:43.040> need<00:02:43.219> to<00:02:43.280> just<00:02:43.939> work<00:02:44.120> in

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
it but you don't need to just work in

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.429 
it but you don't need to just work in
the<00:02:44.299> plane<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.599> motion<00:02:44.689> that<00:02:44.900> doesn't<00:02:45.200> hurt<00:02:45.260> so
