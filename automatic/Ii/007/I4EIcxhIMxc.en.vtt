00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
light core wham shell oh but wait that's

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.610 
light core wham shell oh but wait that's
not<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.940> how<00:02:46.090> can<00:02:46.150> I<00:02:46.330> forget<00:02:46.660> here<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.320> the

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
not it how can I forget here is the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.760 
not it how can I forget here is the
packaging<00:02:48.340> for<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.700> rattle<00:02:49.300> shake<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:50.620> is

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
packaging for a rattle shake so this is

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.800 
packaging for a rattle shake so this is
cool<00:02:51.040> because<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.610> means<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.360> rattle

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
cool because this means that rattle

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.470 
cool because this means that rattle
shake<00:02:53.080> will<00:02:53.680> not<00:02:53.920> be<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.459> 3ds<00:02:55.270> only<00:02:56.260> figure<00:02:57.070> it

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
shake will not be a 3ds only figure it

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.210 
shake will not be a 3ds only figure it
probably<00:02:58.480> won't<00:02:58.810> be<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.050> wave<00:02:59.380> one<00:02:59.770> release

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
probably won't be a wave one release

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.010 
probably won't be a wave one release
I'll<00:03:00.640> probably<00:03:00.880> make<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.209> wait<00:03:01.390> for<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.810> so

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
I'll probably make you wait for it so

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.900 
I'll probably make you wait for it so
maybe<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.380> get<00:03:02.560> desperate<00:03:02.770> and<00:03:03.130> buy<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.459> 3ds

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910
