how<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.460> get<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.969> best<00:00:33.300> results<00:00:33.480> for<00:00:34.260> my

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
how I can get the best results for my

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.960 
how I can get the best results for my
spring<00:00:35.070> seedlings<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.780> first<00:00:37.020> off<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.350> think<00:00:37.590> I

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
spring seedlings so first off I think I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.700 
spring seedlings so first off I think I
guess<00:00:38.970> this<00:00:39.120> looks<00:00:39.300> very<00:00:39.480> familiar<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.960> me<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
guess this looks very familiar to me the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.060 
guess this looks very familiar to me the
white<00:00:41.780> little<00:00:42.780> dots<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> potting<00:00:43.890> mix

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
white little dots in the potting mix

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.620 
white little dots in the potting mix
this<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.520> what<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> started<00:00:45.060> my<00:00:45.210> seeds<00:00:45.480> in

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630

little<00:00:50.940> moldy<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.570> my<00:00:52.530> seedlings<00:00:52.770> were<00:00:53.220> super

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
little moldy and my seedlings were super

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.370 
little moldy and my seedlings were super
long<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.270> stringy<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:55.050> towards<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
long and stringy going towards the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.510 
long and stringy going towards the
window<00:00:55.680> so<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:01.440> first<00:01:01.620> thing<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.829> growing

newspaper pots that we've seen you want
to<00:01:48.700> try<00:01:48.789> to<00:01:48.850> make<00:01:49.000> sure<00:01:49.030> you<00:01:49.119> get<00:01:49.390> something

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
to try to make sure you get something

that<00:01:49.869> has<00:01:50.140> smaller<00:01:51.300> grain<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:52.509> it<00:01:52.539> so<00:01:52.720> if<00:01:52.780> you

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
that has smaller grain to it so if you

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.570 
that has smaller grain to it so if you
look<00:01:52.990> at<00:01:53.080> this<00:01:53.200> mix<00:01:53.710> notice<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:54.399> there's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
look at this mix notice that there's

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.010 
look at this mix notice that there's
nothing<00:01:54.759> that's<00:01:55.000> really<00:01:55.300> large<00:01:55.569> and<00:01:55.720> if<00:01:55.869> it's

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
nothing that's really large and if it's

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.010 
nothing that's really large and if it's
all<00:01:56.140> really<00:01:56.440> small<00:01:56.710> pieces<00:01:57.520> okay<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.840> there's

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
all really small pieces okay and there's

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.719 
all really small pieces okay and there's
a<00:01:59.080> reason<00:01:59.350> for<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.530> so<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.399> know<00:02:00.550> I<00:02:00.580> was

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
a reason for that so you know I was

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.279 
a reason for that so you know I was
talking<00:02:00.940> about<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.149> large<00:02:01.330> pieces<00:02:01.539> apart<00:02:01.929> you

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
talking about the large pieces apart you

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.480 
talking about the large pieces apart you
notice<00:02:02.560> if<00:02:02.649> you<00:02:02.740> put<00:02:02.950> one<00:02:03.069> of<00:02:03.159> these<00:02:03.220> large

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
notice if you put one of these large

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.889 
notice if you put one of these large
pieces<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.819> bark<00:02:04.060> in<00:02:04.210> here<00:02:04.360> there<00:02:04.690> pretty<00:02:04.840> much

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
pieces of bark in here there pretty much

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.990 
pieces of bark in here there pretty much
fills<00:02:05.259> up<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.619> hole<00:02:05.770> you<00:02:06.580> had<00:02:06.700> one<00:02:06.819> of<00:02:06.850> these

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
fills up the hole you had one of these

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.320 
fills up the hole you had one of these
sticks

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
sticks

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.970 
sticks
you<00:02:08.600> know<00:02:08.720> it's<00:02:09.050> great<00:02:09.200> as<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.410> computer<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:09.950> a

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:09.980 
you know it's great as a computer is a

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.500 
you know it's great as a computer is a
component<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.550> grow<00:02:10.730> plants<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.270> I<00:02:11.300> don't

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
component to grow plants but I don't

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.260 
component to grow plants but I don't
want<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.690> grow<00:02:12.580> things<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:13.850> want<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.060> use<00:02:14.150> the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
want to grow things I want to use the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.990 
want to grow things I want to use the
mix<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:15.050> if<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.320> use<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:16.520> mix<00:02:16.790> you'll

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
mix and so if I use this mix you'll

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.090 
mix and so if I use this mix you'll
notice<00:02:17.240> that<00:02:17.330> I've<00:02:17.450> actually<00:02:18.010> spread<00:02:19.010> it

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
notice that I've actually spread it

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.650 
notice that I've actually spread it
around<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.550> notice<00:02:19.940> how<00:02:20.030> its<00:02:20.210> feeling<00:02:20.390> all

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
around and notice how its feeling all

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.290 
around and notice how its feeling all
that<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:21.430> know<00:02:22.430> what<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.000> made<00:02:23.270> of

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
that you know what is this made of

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.930 
that you know what is this made of
something<00:02:23.720> different<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.640> now<00:02:25.640> it's

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
something different is this now it's

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.700 
something different is this now it's
just<00:02:26.090> brown<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.750> our<00:02:26.900> part<00:02:27.080> it's<00:02:27.170> brown<00:02:27.440> more

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
just brown on our part it's brown more

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.470 
just brown on our part it's brown more
fine<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.370> production<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.090> something<00:02:29.360> that's

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
fine in production it's something that's

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.080 
fine in production it's something that's
specifically<00:02:30.320> designed<00:02:30.410> for<00:02:31.060> see<00:02:32.060> the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
specifically designed for see the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.180 
specifically designed for see the
production<00:02:32.540> sow<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.870> seed<00:02:33.140> starting<00:02:33.650> with<00:02:33.890> mix

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
production sow a seed starting with mix

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.070 
production sow a seed starting with mix
okay<00:02:34.700> um<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:35.150> what<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.300> really<00:02:35.600> recommend<00:02:35.690> I

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
okay um is what I really recommend I

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.210 
okay um is what I really recommend I
mean<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.290> got<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.500> start<00:02:36.650> with<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.860> right

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
mean you got to start with the right

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.880 
mean you got to start with the right
materials<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.840> there's<00:02:39.260> two<00:02:39.410> things<00:02:39.620> there

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
materials so there's two things there

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.740 
materials so there's two things there
there's<00:02:40.160> starting<00:02:40.550> with<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.790> right<00:02:40.910> mix<00:02:41.180> it's

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
there's starting with the right mix it's

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.060 
there's starting with the right mix it's
also<00:02:41.900> starting<00:02:42.140> with<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.500> right<00:02:42.650> container

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
also starting with the right container

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.010 
also starting with the right container
it's<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.880> lot<00:02:44.030> better<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.420> start<00:02:44.660> your<00:02:44.810> seeds

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
it's a lot better to start your seeds

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.260 
it's a lot better to start your seeds
and<00:02:45.230> something<00:02:45.500> small<00:02:45.980> like<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.640> though<00:02:47.210> you

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
and something small like this though you

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.700 
and something small like this though you
don't<00:02:47.540> have<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.750> use<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.080> many<00:02:48.350> if<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.500> had<00:02:48.680> a

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
don't have to use this many if you had a

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.560 
don't have to use this many if you had a
tray<00:02:48.890> like<00:02:49.070> this<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.580> cut<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:49.910> down<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.300> small

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
tray like this you cut it down to small

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.570 
tray like this you cut it down to small
or<00:02:50.750> something<00:02:51.110> more<00:02:51.230> manageable<00:02:51.500> size<00:02:51.800> you

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
or something more manageable size you

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.580 
or something more manageable size you
could<00:02:52.670> use<00:02:52.820> something<00:02:53.030> like<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:53.560> or<00:02:54.560> a

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
could use something like this or a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.860 
could use something like this or a
traditional<00:02:54.800> of<00:02:55.340> six<00:02:56.060> pack<00:02:56.240> I<00:02:56.450> think<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.750> this

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
traditional of six pack I think is this

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.230 
traditional of six pack I think is this
just<00:02:57.170> 12<00:02:57.530> mm<00:02:57.860> size<00:02:58.070> but<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.550> traditional<00:02:58.790> six

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
just 12 mm size but a traditional six

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.270 
just 12 mm size but a traditional six
pack<00:02:59.420> annual<00:02:59.930> but<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.770> don't<00:03:00.980> want<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.160> get

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
pack annual but you don't want to get

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.070 
pack annual but you don't want to get
much<00:03:01.430> larger<00:03:01.880> than<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:02.180> because<00:03:02.900> what

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
much larger than this because what

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.390 
much larger than this because what
happens<00:03:03.440> we<00:03:03.500> start<00:03:03.740> having<00:03:03.830> challenges<00:03:04.130> with

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
happens we start having challenges with

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.400 
happens we start having challenges with
it<00:03:04.580> water<00:03:04.850> we<00:03:05.330> got<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.570> keep<00:03:05.690> water<00:03:05.960> near<00:03:06.290> that

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
it water we got to keep water near that

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.440 
it water we got to keep water near that
seed<00:03:06.710> while<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:07.070> started<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.370> germinate<00:03:07.790> and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
seed while it started to germinate and

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.330 
seed while it started to germinate and
watering<00:03:11.230> your<00:03:12.230> water<00:03:12.500> too<00:03:12.709> much<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.160> water

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340

out so having a small container with it

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.410 
out so having a small container with it
with<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.810> real<00:03:24.770> short<00:03:25.310> height<00:03:25.670> on<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:25.970> like<00:03:26.240> this

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
with a real short height on it like this

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.810 
with a real short height on it like this
one<00:03:26.600> well<00:03:26.810> it's<00:03:26.990> not<00:03:27.080> very<00:03:27.290> tall<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:28.670> has<00:03:28.790> a

one well it's not very tall it has a

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.670 
one well it's not very tall it has a
real<00:03:29.060> fine<00:03:29.300> mix<00:03:29.630> in<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.050> makes<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:30.290> easier

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
real fine mix in it it makes it easier

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.680 
real fine mix in it it makes it easier
to<00:03:30.770> keep<00:03:30.890> moisture<00:03:31.160> around<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.850> seeds<00:03:32.090> if<00:03:32.540> you

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
to keep moisture around the seeds if you

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.090 
to keep moisture around the seeds if you
have<00:03:32.840> mixed<00:03:33.170> lengths<00:03:33.470> if<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:33.950> have<00:03:34.070> a

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
have mixed lengths if you have a

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.710 
have mixed lengths if you have a
container<00:03:34.370> like<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:34.910> what<00:03:35.450> happens

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
container like this what happens

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.900 
container like this what happens
little<00:03:37.020> nerdy<00:03:37.380> science<00:03:37.830> bit<00:03:38.010> for<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.340> show<00:03:38.730> me

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
little nerdy science bit for you show me

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.260 
little nerdy science bit for you show me
so<00:03:39.870> what<00:03:40.530> effects<00:03:40.860> is<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.490> biggest<00:03:41.820> thing

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
so what effects is the biggest thing

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.820 
so what effects is the biggest thing
that<00:03:42.300> affects<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.930> drainage<00:03:43.350> in<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.530> container

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
that affects the drainage in a container

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.350 
that affects the drainage in a container
is<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.070> vertical<00:03:44.460> height<00:03:44.490> of<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.000> drainage

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
is the vertical height of the drainage

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.660 
is the vertical height of the drainage
okay<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.080> if<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.560> have<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.710> tall<00:03:47.010> container<00:03:47.280> like

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
okay so if I have a tall container like

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.000 
okay so if I have a tall container like
this<00:03:47.730> can<00:03:48.270> I<00:03:48.330> use<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.630> same<00:03:48.780> mix<00:03:49.080> in<00:03:49.320> both<00:03:49.560> this

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
this can I use the same mix in both this

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.230 
this can I use the same mix in both this
one<00:03:50.220> versus<00:03:50.610> this<00:03:50.760> one<00:03:51.170> what<00:03:52.170> happens<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:53.240> the

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
one versus this one what happens is the

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.850 
one versus this one what happens is the
mix<00:03:54.450> will<00:03:54.690> drain<00:03:54.990> to<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.260> same<00:03:55.410> level<00:03:55.740> because

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
mix will drain to the same level because

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.320 
mix will drain to the same level because
of<00:03:56.010> gravity<00:03:56.490> its<00:03:56.700> gravity<00:03:57.120> that's<00:03:57.240> pulling

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
of gravity its gravity that's pulling

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.510 
of gravity its gravity that's pulling
out<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.750> water<00:03:57.960> trying<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.470> drain<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.160> down<00:03:59.310> on

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
out the water trying to drain it down on

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.460 
out the water trying to drain it down on
the<00:03:59.610> bottom<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.850> that<00:03:59.970> container<00:04:00.240> so<00:04:01.080> what

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
the bottom of that container so what

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.350 
the bottom of that container so what
happens<00:04:01.800> in<00:04:01.890> this<00:04:02.010> large<00:04:02.280> container<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:03.120> it

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
happens in this large container is it

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.600 
happens in this large container is it
drains<00:04:03.630> down<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:04.230> some<00:04:04.470> level<00:04:05.040> let's<00:04:05.340> say<00:04:05.400> it's

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
drains down to some level let's say it's

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.850 
drains down to some level let's say it's
here<00:04:05.910> if<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.510> use<00:04:06.660> my<00:04:06.870> if<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.140> keep<00:04:07.320> my<00:04:07.410> finger<00:04:07.710> in

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
here if I use my if I keep my finger in

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.230 
here if I use my if I keep my finger in
place<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.400> move<00:04:08.550> this<00:04:08.700> small<00:04:09.000> container

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
place and I move this small container

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.390 
place and I move this small container
next<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:10.110> it<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.740> drains<00:04:10.980> down<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
next to it and it drains down to the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.100 
next to it and it drains down to the
same<00:04:11.580> level<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:12.300> can<00:04:12.450> see<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.750> it's<00:04:12.870> just

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
same level you can see that it's just

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.380 
same level you can see that it's just
below<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.620> surface<00:04:13.800> of<00:04:14.160> this<00:04:14.370> two<00:04:14.550> pot<00:04:14.760> but<00:04:15.300> on

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
below the surface of this two pot but on

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.090 
below the surface of this two pot but on
this<00:04:15.480> pot<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.930> drains<00:04:16.290> way<00:04:16.530> down<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.890> near<00:04:17.040> the

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
this pot it drains way down to near the

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.130 
this pot it drains way down to near the
bottom<00:04:17.400> that's<00:04:18.359> great<00:04:18.570> for<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.780> full<00:04:18.989> grown

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
bottom that's great for a full grown

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.420 
bottom that's great for a full grown
clamp<00:04:19.440> but<00:04:19.590> for<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.769> ceiling<00:04:20.100> where<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.310> need

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
clamp but for a ceiling where you need

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.099 
clamp but for a ceiling where you need
lots<00:04:20.640> of<00:04:20.760> moisture<00:04:20.910> it's<00:04:21.600> going<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.870> get<00:04:21.930> too

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
lots of moisture it's going to get too

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.050 
lots of moisture it's going to get too
dry<00:04:22.410> until<00:04:23.100> your<00:04:23.340> have<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.550> come<00:04:23.700> back<00:04:23.880> and

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
dry until your have to come back and

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.520 
dry until your have to come back and
visit<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.420> water<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:24.750> water<00:04:24.900> water<00:04:25.140> then<00:04:25.410> you

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
visit and water and water water then you

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.910 
visit and water and water water then you
risk<00:04:25.740> pull<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.250> water<00:04:26.430> in<00:04:26.580> your<00:04:26.700> plans
