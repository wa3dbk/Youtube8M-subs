00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:08.719
 common 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.069
 let's see which of the two computers and is that despite the screen 

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:18.570
 is faster if today you weigh 10 thousand 500 of about 13 years of age with a 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.939
 hard drive of 30 gigas its windows appearance this one comma zero the lowest 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.189
 it's a 33a system 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.900
 As he said he does not have 513 minors his graphic card is intel 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.130
 pentium 4 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.530
 and asked mourinho added 40 gigahertz 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.410
 all in the other on the right side a toshiba nb200 10 uu 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.780
 with an antique sign 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.390
 by the way a 160 gigs disk evaluation of the commas 7 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.490
 the 72 bis must have a valley tour intel atom of the group of 60 gigahertz 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.830
 holst sight 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.830
 6 10 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590
 the legs 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.670
 houses 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.670
 sto 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 we want 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.010
 the monumental share seems to be first 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.590
 We are loading windows right now 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.509
 good both computers and chose to use powerful mothers 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:17.779
 to the hp at the time I bought it was one of the best there is in the 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.289
 market and it came out expensive 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.889
 noble the only mistake they have found in all the years 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.949
 is that after three years of entertaining the battery did not last more than half 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:29.759
 hour 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.309
 on the other hand in the import or 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.969
 The sweat battery checked for 16 hours 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.949
 the two computers has been very used mostly to the offensive 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.349
 well I think is that windows 7 and up almost 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.749
 just started 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.749
 while Hector Silva has just read 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.569
 just charged each reloaded ruined 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.569
 pc and also canyon 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.549
 and power 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.409
 team with windows 7 has already finished quality 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.539
 and now we have to wait for the doctor as they go 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.259
 with windows vista operating system 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.189
 both teams work fluently 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.689
 i 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.259
 with 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.719
 if someone says something 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:36.129
 mm some advice to talk about mothers can ask 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.989
 well, it seems that he 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.989
 with windows view and even finish it 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.729
 Syria is starting 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.359
 and well then we see that acquires 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.399
 that the hp compaq presario 2500 has many more years of antiquity 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.739
 just loaded 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.739
