00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.380
 per day 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.430
 but 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:31.580
 with respect to the open mouth that is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:36.840
 just happy because I'm having a 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.129
 studio of sold discs I have not always 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 said I have always said there are many 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.730
 many people who want a 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.820
 opportunity like I had the fortune to 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.820
 know it control doing well the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.500
 things the expert way sure all 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.730
 communication systems that do not 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.710
 work well only you i am good 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.160
 He told me like Carlos Barrero arrived 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 almost everything you both want a 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:16.360
 boy , I've always told you and this 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:20.350
 I always try because it makes you have 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.750
 well four times it can work 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.990
 a song that is called musician in favor 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.990
 of God 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.610
 God's favor of play many after 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.320
 that style that comes from pure corridos 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.540
 of some corridos rather a cumbia 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.160
 that I do not have many things 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.160
 times in fact the cumbia is recorded 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:06.490
 of songs of other crimes I'm going to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.860
 eat as I always did but I 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.800
 have said with no longer have to have 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.540
 company because they have to take the discs 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.670
 of stations and so it will be more technical 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.200
 leave the tight living disk 15 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.200
 songs with God's favor I have 35 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.200
 various 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:32.280
 and then we want them to come out 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.450
 i 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.070
 the authorities I'm not against 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.790
 I am but without any flexibility 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.790
 in terms of schedule
