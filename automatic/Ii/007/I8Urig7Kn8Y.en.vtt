00:00:10.846 --> 00:00:16.336
 In this tutorial, we review the basic operation of the digital reporting monitor CS65. 

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:20.786
 Once you have unpacked the equipment, read the user guide, 

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:24.336
 containing important security guidelines and complete information 

00:00:24.836 --> 00:00:26.166
 about the device's functions and use. 

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:31.716
 For the CS65, an 18 volt RIDGID rechargeable battery is used. 

00:00:32.316 --> 00:00:36.296
 An AC adapter for indoor use is also available and can be ordered 

00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:37.836
 with an authorized RIDGID dealer. 

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:43.706
 CS65 is designed to be docked on the rM200 

00:00:43.926 --> 00:00:47.616
 and is equipped with locking devices that secure CS65 during transport. 

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:52.166
 We move our equipment to a cleaning hole nearby and conduct a test inspection 

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:55.346
 to explore the functions and applications of CS65. 

00:00:56.416 --> 00:01:00.216
 There is a 4 inch main wiring near by so we inspect it. 

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:08.266
 The camera is connected to the monitor with the SeeSnake® system cable, 

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:10.166
 sitting on the camera roll. 

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:18.586
 Place the pins in relation to the connector, and then tighten the latch until it is tight. 

00:01:18.796 --> 00:01:22.616
 to ensure a good electrical and waterproof connection. 

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.626
 We press the power button to turn on the unit. 

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.556
 It takes a moment before the monitor is ready 

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:36.366
 and we spend this time preparing for the inspection. 

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:42.706
 When the red status bar disappears, CS65 is ready. 

00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:47.116
 CS65 can place text on still images and video. 

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:50.686
 Press the space bar to open the text entry field. 

00:01:55.216 --> 00:02:00.306
 To move the text, select the move icon below the text input field 

00:02:00.906 --> 00:02:05.386
 and then use the arrow keys in the keypad or on the keyboard to move the text field. 

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:16.386
 To put the text on the screen, select the green check mark icon and then press Enter. 

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:23.216
 To delete text from the screen, press the Space key, and then press the Enter key to select "Yes". 

00:02:25.936 --> 00:02:29.216
 We begin the inspection by taking a still image of the access point. 

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:35.676
 When we do that, CS65 will show a call to add to an existing job or to create a new one. 

00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:38.366
 We choose to create a new job ... 

00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:40.646
 Then we start recording video. 

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:50.086
 The PhotoTalk feature on CS65 allows you to capture a still image with a sound annotation. 

00:02:50.786 --> 00:02:54.916
 To make a PhotoTalk recording, press the photo key for a few seconds 

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.786
 and then start talking when a call is displayed. 

00:03:01.586 --> 00:03:06.586
 The countdown feature gives us 90 seconds to record in, and we can extend the time if we want, 

00:03:07.056 --> 00:03:09.256
 or we can stop recording before by pressing the Select key. 

00:03:12.316 --> 00:03:19.796
 At CS65, we can put a thumb drive in one or both USB ports while a job is in progress 

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:21.276
 without the video recording being interrupted. 

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:27.876
 We put a drive in and choose "Yes" to synchronize our jobs with this device. 

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:31.906
 CS65 then begins to copy what we have already recorded 

00:03:32.206 --> 00:03:34.946
 to this drive while we continue the inspection. 

00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:39.736
 Now we stop recording and pull the camera out of the tube. 

00:03:40.906 --> 00:03:46.206
 The icon next to the thumb drive shows that CS65 is still synchronizing the job 

00:03:46.406 --> 00:03:47.926
 on the internal drive with thumb drives. 

00:03:48.276 --> 00:03:52.406
 When jobs have been synchronized, a green check mark appears next to the thumb drive. 

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:57.906
 To avoid data loss, never remove a drive until the green check mark appears. 

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:05.476
 CS65 has a job reporting interface and we press the job edit key to open it. 

00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:12.236
 We use the arrow keys as well as the Enter and Escape keys to navigate, open and exit report screens. 

00:04:13.056 --> 00:04:16.846
 We navigate to the contact screen and open the company information page. 

00:04:20.836 --> 00:04:24.296
 The contact screen also contains pages for customer and job information. 

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.846
 Now we will review our footage. 

00:04:33.256 --> 00:04:37.486
 We can watch still images and play video clips as well as PhotoTalk recordings. 

00:04:46.896 --> 00:04:50.296
 If we want to add notes to some of our footage, then we can do it as well. 

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:06.016
 CS65 also allows us to preview the final report before delivering it to customers. 

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:12.726
 We cannot open images or play video clips through the report preview screen, but we can secure 

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:15.986
 that the report contains the information we want to share with our customer. 

00:05:17.196 --> 00:05:19.496
 When we finish, we close the report ... 

00:05:19.796 --> 00:05:21.366
 And leave the job review screen. 

00:05:25.306 --> 00:05:30.046
 The USB status icon shows a green check mark so it is safe to remove the thumb drive. 

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:37.316
 To avoid damaging the files, never remove the thumb drive unless the green check mark is lit. 

00:05:41.556 --> 00:05:44.496
 Over the past few minutes, we've seen how the PhotoTalk feature works 

00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:49.436
 we have learned how to open an open job with a thumb drive and we have used the keyboard 

00:05:50.136 --> 00:05:53.156
 to add text and to add notes to the job report. 

00:05:54.016 --> 00:06:04.206
 The entire RIDGID team appreciates your investment in SeeSnake® diagnostic equipment.
