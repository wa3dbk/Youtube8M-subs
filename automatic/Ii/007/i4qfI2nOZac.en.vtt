00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.629
 Hello now it was up to the filling 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.300
 my high bed and there very nice 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.210
 big is there a real problem 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.889
 I do not know if it's anyone 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.870
 but I know you have one 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.140
 Total length of about nine and a half meters 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.240
 with a 80's depth that's a whole 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.949
 nice volume 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.519
 At first I was rough 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.710
 concerned and pieces of wood have that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.140
 in the bottom of it, of course I did 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.600
 slit the film on the floor several times 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.989
 engraved holes have stung around 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.670
 that the water can drain 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.160
 then I have then as me 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.920
 shredded worried fresh 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.120
 schnetzeltes there I was god 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.219
 thanks 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.739
 of course we dragged there like 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.660
 the crazy but that's now time 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.320
 somehow I had my baby full now 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.210
 get 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.820
 Although I had a kind of synonymous 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.070
 Hydroponics recommended for below 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.010
 but quite frankly that would be so 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.960
 had become such costly because 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.110
 Of course, I already factor these factors 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.600
 did not think properly 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.810
 ok after the wood carved then now 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.630
 all were finally in it together 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.310
 I then considered which ones 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.100
 form earth, I do it 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.080
 I would of course like to have organic soil 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.950
 taken for the entire box 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.200
 fill 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.310
 but this horrendous sum would be so 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 been madness 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.259
 So I decided in the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.299
 seventh bottom of the ground have to exist 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.570
 then in about three and a half cubic meters 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.259
 calculated and then got six tons 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.439
 delivered 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.189
 So I think it was about 500 kilos 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.619
 too much 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.070
 Unfortunately my garden is not 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.950
 More with a wheelbarrow was to commit 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.590
 Of course we do not have two days 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.649
 from morning to evening but three to 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.469
 four man in buckets of diesel six tons 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.020
 earth dragged into the garden and therewith 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.060
 the high picture fills the upper edge 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.219
 I then deliberately released 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.970
 because of course the sense is that me 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.160
 also good organic soil in it 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.130
 but I would like that too 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.530
 somehow still remain affordable so 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.080
 After everything was in it I have 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.410
 then inquired me and then me one 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.860
 good organic earth and worried in the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.080
 Sacks had a volume of 40 liters 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.660
 and I have a total of 21 bags 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.240
 I then consumed it after and 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.490
 filled up and then have so 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.130
 top 25 to 30 centimeters 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.890
 first floor with the bio 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.380
 mixed earth 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.840
 After all this was done on the 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.959
 I will then have all the way 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.080
 again about ten centimeters pure 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.550
 bio earth on top of it 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.709
 Of course, now I hope that I can 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.320
 did everything right around mine 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.740
 vegetables and my fruit grows and thrives 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.690
 And I also come to a nice harvest 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.630
 some of you may know that 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.060
 I am absolute layman but you will be yes 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.980
 see what develops there so well 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.090
 give me the thumbs up I'm for 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.620
 always grateful to say tips then see you soon 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.620
 and bye
