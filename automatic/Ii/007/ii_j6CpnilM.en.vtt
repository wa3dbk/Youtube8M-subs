00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.070
 hi to all these friend picks i hope that 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.540
 you have the form me it's really going 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.160
 super good and today we're going 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.230
 tackle with the explosion series 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.369
 plasma so remember what are two 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.350
 blistered stories that had me 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.939
 offered dimitri in the little collar and 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.680
 we had opened with young people 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.029
 I thank you very much once again and 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.270
 then we will discover immediately what 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.270
 who's in it 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.300
 they have now withdrawn from the orb 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.340
 the eastern ex out of curiosity if you 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.110
 want to see the back here I am you 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.690
 watch for me is not seen very well 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.100
 here I show you like this I 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.680
 will rather be interested in the gift of a 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.320
 booster plasma explosion that I like 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.629
 read from time to time and we have them 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.610
 two illustrations of pau rigon z he me 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.710
 seems it's rotten goz and I preferred 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.260
 keep the dialga illustration for the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.720
 sealed booster collection so without 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.190
 no longer wait i'm going to open this ago 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.500
 than two little boosters but I say to myself 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.500
 that it could still be fun 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.610
 to exchange a little bit of blocks and 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.600
 I really wanted to see these 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.670
 boosters to know what it takes 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.220
 know anyway a gift 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.979
 it's done to open then the code in 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.009
 line if you want to see and that's 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.720
 always the demo of 1 2 3 1 2 I hope 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.190
 that they are lucky anyway dimitri 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.030
 if you watch this video I hope that 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.100
 you die brought luck 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:46.220
 we start right away with a muna 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:52.020
 I am really badly placed Galepids 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:56.130
 it's up to the kid a bide j.lo class 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.360
 gorgeous honig so binds her a pokemon 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.689
 of the plasma team it's written right here 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.299
 a match with fears recovery 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.530
 energy 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:12.150
 we have the trigger to pay in 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.100
 rivers okay and we finish with to 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.380
 it's a simple rare mega not kids 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.370
 but this pokÃ©mon it's been a while since I 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.260
 I have not seen it so it's always 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.260
 pleasure to see it is nice 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.830
 then it's really very very fast 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.630
 I find to open only booster 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.160
 who I really have trouble opening 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.350
 that two boosters because I'm not 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.380
 kind of wanting to open several 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.390
 the pleasure lasts longer 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.980
 when it's too fast sense already 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.930
 nostalgic of the moment that comes from 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.280
 place go code online 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.390
 in any case guys pabos very good 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.220
 surprise I had completely forgotten 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:54.540
 that he was in this 2nd booster series 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.099
 we will enjoy it we have a snail a 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.790
 little bezy 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.170
 What your tax agreement not rigon 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.700
 the more it is the normal but the one 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.200
 we saw on the booster illustration 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.469
 it was rotten and then we 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.150
 have installed kid who can think of 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:19.659
 motisma star game in special energy 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.340
 plasma energy times the feather that 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:26.109
 is for small bow if I'm wrong 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.849
 no we have a drakos but who knows 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:31.719
 exactly the illustration actually of the 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.159
 series chests of dragons at bao ninh la 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:36.219
 league we had earlier that is 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.349
 a little common rivers with no pv this 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.819
 which is not much now and 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.219
 no work for this opening but 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.739
 maybe monographic whaou 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:45.609
 she is very very beautiful crefo the 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.500
 holographic 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.659
 it took me to fall the wake CRRE 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.909
 all pink to agree with my 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.349
 polish it's nice a little 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.049
 holographic for this opening I 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:58.000
 will quickly show you the recap 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.709
 so we had 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.949
 honig the rivers and creates crazy and 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.900
 holographic the small but cape left 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:07.870
 without harare then we had a map 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.569
 henry vars trainer with shutter 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.310
 reversed that was all for this 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.409
 opening I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.030
 be aware that plasma exponents is 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.979
 a series on which I am not of 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.509
 all lucky I actually shot 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.889
 only one ultra rare to 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.599
 the time when I had bought full 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.530
 full of booster an ultra rare it is 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.240
 really that slab 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.250
 and in the end I had it exchange year 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.930
 I like for I do not know who are struggling 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.759
 rare by the way maybe an ultra of 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.409
 exalted dragon that I wanted more 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.909
 completed yes I told myself that one is 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:36.460
 rare for this series finally that 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.990
 served not much so bah voila 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.949
 I'm not even ultra anymore and it was 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.380
 Gerard Chaix 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.030
 the final well I still have not 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.620
 of work in this series but hey I 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.729
 think jean no I will never have 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.889
 if I not buy the unit 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.509
 in short, I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.190
 while waiting for the next video I will 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.250
