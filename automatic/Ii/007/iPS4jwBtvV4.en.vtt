looking forward to unpacking this and
trying<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.859> out<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.369> put<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.760> review<00:00:18.590> so

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
trying it out and put in a review so

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.910 
trying it out and put in a review so
we'll<00:00:19.740> have<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.859> look<00:00:20.039> inside<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.640> box

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920

okay well oven I unpacked it from the
box<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.599> first<00:00:27.599> thing<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.990> say<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:29.660> really

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
could have done with some instructions

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.709 
could have done with some instructions
as<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.600> how<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> assemble<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.860> there<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
as to how to assemble it there is a

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.030 
as to how to assemble it there is a
managed<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.870> work<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.200> out<00:00:37.380> though<00:00:37.680> from<00:00:37.950> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
managed to work it out though from a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.080 
managed to work it out though from a
sectional<00:00:38.670> view<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.629> instruction<00:00:40.290> manual

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
sectional view in the instruction manual

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.690 
sectional view in the instruction manual
there<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> an<00:00:43.020> instruction<00:00:43.680> manual<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
there is a an instruction manual but it

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.010 
there is a an instruction manual but it
doesn't<00:00:44.969> actually<00:00:45.149> tell<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.780> how<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
doesn't actually tell you how to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.490 
doesn't actually tell you how to
assemble<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> different<00:00:47.489> pieces<00:00:48.500> right

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
assemble all the different pieces right

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500 
assemble all the different pieces right
so<00:00:49.800> we'll<00:00:49.950> lift<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> lid<00:00:50.489> off<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
so we'll lift the lid off and have a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.430 
so we'll lift the lid off and have a
look<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:51.750> we've<00:00:52.050> got<00:00:52.079> inside<00:00:54.050> now<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> first

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
look what we've got inside now the first

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.189 
look what we've got inside now the first
thing<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> trivet<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:57.960> if

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
thing is this this is a trivet now if

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.200 
thing is this this is a trivet now if
you've<00:00:58.379> got<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.590> sort<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.219> chicken<00:00:59.760> or<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.969> big

you've got a sort of chicken or a big
joint<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.690> meat<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.079> would<00:01:01.230> put<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.710> there

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
joint of meat you would put it on there

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.520 
joint of meat you would put it on there
to<00:01:02.129> keep<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.489> away<00:01:02.640> from<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.229> actual<00:01:04.229> grill

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
to keep it away from the actual grill

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.539 
to keep it away from the actual grill
itself<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:05.970> you're<00:01:06.119> doing<00:01:06.390> burgers<00:01:07.020> or

itself but if you're doing burgers or

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.130 
itself but if you're doing burgers or
kebabs<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:08.850> something<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.960> would

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
kebabs or something like that you would

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.640 
kebabs or something like that you would
put<00:01:10.380> those<00:01:10.590> directly<00:01:11.340> onto<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.450> grill<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:13.530> you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
put those directly onto the grill as you

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.590 
put those directly onto the grill as you
can<00:01:13.799> see<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.100> quite<00:01:14.310> big<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.330> fit

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
can see it's quite big so you can fit

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.270 
can see it's quite big so you can fit
quite<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.229> bit<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:17.119> underneath<00:01:18.119> there

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280

you do here you put your room your fire
lighters<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.770> bottom<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:31.680> put

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
lighters in the bottom there and you put

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.819 
lighters in the bottom there and you put
your<00:01:32.040> briquettes<00:01:32.549> your<00:01:33.509> charcoal<00:01:34.259> briquettes

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
your briquettes your charcoal briquettes

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.999 
your briquettes your charcoal briquettes
in<00:01:35.130> there<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.320> get<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> going

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
in there and get it going

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.270 
in there and get it going
and<00:01:38.610> once<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.409> briquettes<00:01:40.409> are<00:01:40.590> white<00:01:40.799> then

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
and once the briquettes are white then

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.630 
and once the briquettes are white then
you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.579> start<00:01:41.880> cooking<00:01:42.799> so<00:01:43.799> yeah<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.460> that's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
you can start cooking so yeah so that's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.440 
you can start cooking so yeah so that's
it<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.649> think<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> thing<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.729> now<00:01:47.759> then

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
it so I think the thing to do now then

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.960 
it so I think the thing to do now then
is<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:49.430> take<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.610> outside<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:53.610> we'll<00:01:53.790> give

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
is to take it outside and and we'll give

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.300 
is to take it outside and and we'll give
it<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.240> go<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.689> see<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:55.290> sort<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.649> food<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.130> can

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it a go and see what sort of food we can

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.440 
it a go and see what sort of food we can
produce<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:58.820> so<00:01:59.820> yep

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
produce on it so yep

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.539 
produce on it so yep
looking<00:02:00.899> forward<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.649> mmm<00:02:02.100> I'm<00:02:02.219> feeling

two hours with one of these cobblestones

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.640 
two hours with one of these cobblestones
and<00:03:37.490> so<00:03:38.780> they've<00:03:39.780> got<00:03:39.930> plenty<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.260> cooking

time<00:03:40.860> there<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.610> can<00:03:41.760> hear<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.060> sizzling

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
time there you can hear that sizzling

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.800 
time there you can hear that sizzling
away<00:03:42.870> hopefully<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:44.150> what<00:03:45.150> you<00:03:45.209> can<00:03:45.420> do<00:03:45.600> now

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
away hopefully and what you can do now

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.340 
away hopefully and what you can do now
you<00:03:45.870> can<00:03:46.200> put<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.530> dome<00:03:46.709> on<00:03:46.980> if<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.250> wish<00:03:47.610> or

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
you can put the dome on if you wish or

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.260 
you can put the dome on if you wish or
or<00:03:49.350> just<00:03:49.620> leave<00:03:49.800> it<00:03:49.950> off<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.370> think<00:03:50.490> if<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:51.000> were

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
or just leave it off I think if you were

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.330 
or just leave it off I think if you were
to<00:03:51.540> cook<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.170> but<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.500> think<00:03:52.560> I'll<00:03:52.860> put<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.160> on

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
to cook this but I think I'll put it on

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.150 
to cook this but I think I'll put it on
because<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.700> like<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:53.940> nice<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.440> sort<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.530> smoky

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
because I like it nice and sort of smoky

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.520 
because I like it nice and sort of smoky
and<00:03:56.250> steamy<00:03:56.700> in<00:03:56.910> there<00:03:57.020> so<00:03:58.020> I'm<00:03:58.140> going<00:03:58.320> to<00:03:58.350> put

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
and steamy in there so I'm going to put

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.370 
and steamy in there so I'm going to put
the<00:03:58.650> dome<00:03:58.830> on<00:03:59.720> the<00:04:00.720> grill<00:04:01.020> bridge

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
the dome on the grill bridge

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.680 
the dome on the grill bridge
incidentally<00:04:02.160> is<00:04:02.400> Teflon<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.330> it's<00:04:03.510> all

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
incidentally is Teflon so it's all

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.530 
incidentally is Teflon so it's all
nonstick<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:05.640> you<00:04:05.730> don't<00:04:05.910> have<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.090> problem

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
nonstick and so you don't have a problem

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.470 
nonstick and so you don't have a problem
of<00:04:06.660> your<00:04:06.780> food<00:04:07.050> sticking<00:04:07.590> on<00:04:07.709> there

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
of your food sticking on there

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.440 
of your food sticking on there
so<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.900> looks<00:04:10.230> like<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.680> in<00:04:10.830> cooking<00:04:11.670> nicely

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
so it looks like it in cooking nicely

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.240 
so it looks like it in cooking nicely
now<00:04:12.690> I'm<00:04:13.500> going<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.740> put<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.980> grip<00:04:14.220> very

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.760 
now I'm going to put the grip very
little<00:04:19.730> there<00:04:20.730> we<00:04:20.850> are<00:04:20.930> that<00:04:21.930> will<00:04:22.019> keep<00:04:22.230> it<00:04:22.440> to

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
so we'll see what it looks like in a bit

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.870 
so we'll see what it looks like in a bit
right<00:04:34.800> well<00:04:35.010> we've<00:04:35.160> been<00:04:35.280> cooking<00:04:35.670> for<00:04:35.700> a

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
right well we've been cooking for a

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.090 
right well we've been cooking for a
while<00:04:36.120> now<00:04:36.390> so<00:04:36.420> we're<00:04:37.290> gonna<00:04:37.350> take<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.890> top

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
while now so we're gonna take the top

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.080 
while now so we're gonna take the top
off<00:04:38.340> and<00:04:38.610> see<00:04:38.820> how<00:04:38.910> we're<00:04:39.120> going<00:04:40.820> mm<00:04:41.820> now<00:04:42.060> that

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
off and see how we're going mm now that

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:53.600 
off and see how we're going mm now that
looks<00:04:42.770> pretty<00:04:43.770> good

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.330 

each<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.509> the<00:04:54.599> room<00:04:54.780> is<00:04:54.900> clear

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.010 

yep<00:05:00.830> what<00:05:01.830> I<00:05:01.860> like<00:05:02.220> about<00:05:02.250> this<00:05:02.790> is<00:05:03.090> that<00:05:03.120> means

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
yep what I like about this is that means

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.400 
yep what I like about this is that means
the<00:05:04.889> grill<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.639> actually<00:05:06.150> sort<00:05:06.449> of<00:05:06.570> quite

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
the grill is actually sort of quite

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.870 
the grill is actually sort of quite
combat<00:05:08.060> so<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.750> juices<00:05:10.350> of<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:11.130> fat<00:05:11.400> will

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
combat so the the juices of the fat will

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.650 
combat so the the juices of the fat will
run<00:05:12.330> down<00:05:12.630> out<00:05:13.229> of<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.590> way<00:05:13.620> from<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.660> actual

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
run down out of the way from the actual

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.890 
run down out of the way from the actual
cell<00:05:16.650> it<00:05:16.740> doesn't<00:05:16.770> flare<00:05:17.280> off<00:05:17.690> though<00:05:18.690> that's

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
cell it doesn't flare off though that's

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.990 
cell it doesn't flare off though that's
quite<00:05:19.199> quite<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:19.860> good<00:05:20.160> before<00:05:21.410> pops<00:05:22.410> in<00:05:22.680> there

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
quite quite a good before pops in there

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.610 
quite quite a good before pops in there
so<00:05:24.000> yeah<00:05:24.180> I<00:05:24.449> think<00:05:24.510> with<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:25.080> looking<00:05:25.440> down

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
so yeah I think with it looking down

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.540 
so yeah I think with it looking down
there<00:05:26.300> and<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.479> talked<00:05:27.780> around<00:05:28.400> 40<00:05:29.400> minutes

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.360 
there and that talked around 40 minutes

for a couple of kicking leg so that's
pretty<00:05:32.580> good<00:05:32.850> and<00:05:33.060> it's<00:05:33.150> done<00:05:33.360> it<00:05:33.479> looks<00:05:33.840> like

you did want to cook something else you

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.580 
you did want to cook something else you

something<00:06:16.830> else<00:06:17.099> on<00:06:17.400> it<00:06:17.750> so<00:06:18.750> yeah<00:06:19.470> and<00:06:20.720> the

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
something else on it so yeah and the

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.420 
something else on it so yeah and the
grill<00:06:21.990> itself

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
grill itself

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.760 
grill itself
take<00:06:24.210> that<00:06:24.389> off<00:06:24.599> as<00:06:24.810> I<00:06:24.840> say<00:06:25.139> now<00:06:25.380> that<00:06:25.410> should

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
take that off as I say now that should

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.340 
take that off as I say now that should
be<00:06:25.800> quite<00:06:26.010> easy<00:06:26.099> to<00:06:26.639> wash

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.820 

because<00:06:30.250> it's<00:06:30.400> it's<00:06:30.820> nonstick<00:06:31.440> so<00:06:32.440> they<00:06:32.620> will

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
because it's it's nonstick so they will

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.200 
because it's it's nonstick so they will
that's<00:06:33.580> my<00:06:33.820> first<00:06:34.090> try<00:06:34.540> at<00:06:34.570> the<00:06:35.020> Cobb<00:06:36.210> barbecue
