00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.930
 very good kids in this video I want 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.360
 announce several news that will 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:09.210
 see on the channel and I wanted you to tell me 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.980
 your opinion also because at the time 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.809
 to focus on those changes because they can 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.940
 help is worth it to me in the head I already have more 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.470
 or less as I want it structured but 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.869
 I want you to also tell me yours 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.109
 your opinion and so among all 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.240
 we will make a better channel first of all 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.330
 the inevitable has already happened 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.670
 the inevitable thing was that many of you told me 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.210
 the others play tell me do not play 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.530
 alol l before I tried it I said no 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.290
 I want to play in the sun because it's a game 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.760
 that requires a lot of time and I know that I 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.730
 I will hook and it will be a problem 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.930
 because in that aspect I'm pretty 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.600
 competitive and I like it when it starts to 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.580
 doing things right will start to stand out 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.960
 those who stand out is worth being a player more 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.150
 or less normal the villa or I think 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.129
 pretty good I just need 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.750
 just meet the champions but 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.720
 otherwise the other I have enough 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.000
 Of course, so I'm hooked 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.589
 It's worth a little bit with this I do not want 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.210
 to say that now my channel is going to stop 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.610
 be zombies I go and go to 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.510
 be pain or go up every day 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.950
 I have not explained to you the head 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.190
 I have mounted a little bit like I want 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.560
 do what 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.230
 I do not want my channel flood of 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.640
 hole then I did many 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.530
 I could not do them on YouTube 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.590
 And if I do them on YouTube, I'll erase them 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.899
 it's worth 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.409
 videos about those that remain on my channel 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.060
 will be things that have happened because that 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.490
 maybe one paints here and one 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.020
 game so funny anything but 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.219
 there are not going to be whole games to not 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.569
 I want already I tell you that I do not want to 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.789
 that people when I entered my channel see 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.619
 it's zombies but it's going to have something 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.000
 of lol and something else is worth those 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.310
 it's one of the changes I want 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.920
 explain later then good more 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.840
 forward but in this video then it 's 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.509
 I would do it this way or the direct others I do 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.880
 in tweets and summarize what I like best 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.270
 Youtube 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.680
 or I do on youtube and leave a 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.420
 hours for people who can not 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.100
 get to the directors can see then and 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.689
 then I will erase them malevolent better to the day 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.640
 next or something like that do not go I tell you 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.619
 that if the helmet for me is to say something 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.539
 six hours of lol are not going to stay there 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.730
 there will remain what I like the most 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.739
 I'll see how I do it but let's go 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.930
 I will not help us I 'm not going to 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.160
 flood of what that is one of the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.920
 aspects that I want to be very clear 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.099
 because I do not want the subject to change 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.110
 of the channel everything is to say not to drink 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.519
 zombie the zombies finish the three they finish 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.200
 I think we have just done, I'm already 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.640
 continuing with the black ops guides 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.739
 one that you can not do in your day because 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.739
 I did not have the channel so you go to 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.450
 have guides we go until you have all 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.830
 the maps and then more records and then 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.180
 more more of all 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.349
 they will always see us even if they make us more 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.690
 games that I'm sure is going to be 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.329
 a white stress but hey everyone 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.579
 can you think what you want that out there 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.530
 ok if I do the live in tweets 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.060
 I would have summarized the good times 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.060
 and if I do them on youtube delete the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.450
 direct and summarize and summarize also the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.630
 good times that was point 1.2 to 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.910
 see I want Wednesday to be a day 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.890
 different in the channel you know that I 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.870
 many times I have told myself to create a 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.109
 secondary channel but it gave me a lot 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.549
 laziness because I do not have enough 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.560
 time as for the poster that I 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.720
 like this primary channel I'm not going to 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.280
 create me another so I'm not going to create a 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.859
 secondary channel I'm going to discard that 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.139
 option at least for now and what 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.700
 I'm going to do is on Wednesdays when I 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.069
 play games that I have always said 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.749
 how can it be good for 17 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.400
 for example there is a country I 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.629
 I bought the other day but at the moment 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.599
 is making no good game nor 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.489
 nothing but good medievil what what 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.200
 I will try to put them on Wednesdays 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.079
 I want I do not want to be mixed in between 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.719
 ways I'll do it there it's worth we'll put 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.060
 Wednesday different by changing a 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.880
 little bit then the people who just 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.830
 want zombies 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.120
 directly on Wednesdays do not enter 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.720
 my channel because you will not find 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.060
 zombies the people who want zombies and 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.850
 lol because on Wednesdays there will surely be 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.280
 something of what you want to see what I 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.620
 because I want to see up and point it 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.350
 I will continue in the same dynamic watching my 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.090
 channel daily or when you want to see and 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.470
 On Wednesdays there will be different video and 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.600
 Even that will not erase them I will not do anything 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.490
 nothing special just on Wednesdays 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.370
 I will dedicate it to different videos 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.180
 what more good for example what I have 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.250
 said before 7 vital means also 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.080
 many times have I thought then any 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.610
 video that I see out there to any 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.860
 video that you pass me by private if I 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.740
 I can see why not only see you not only 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.340
 I do not usually see them for lack of time but 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.470
 no longer be of or that is no longer of 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.180
 zombies for example there is an uncle who plays 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.560
 the guitar very well and we known 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.150
 Well, that guy seems to me to have 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.800
 played the guitar very well 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.290
 surely on Wednesday I will take advantage of it 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.940
 and I will speak a half promotion or an uncle 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.390
 that sings very well or I know one that 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.630
 I was cooking whatever it is 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:57.990
 I'll upload it to promotion mode because there 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.280
 a lot of talented people and it's not that 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.980
 little opportunity on my channel is not 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.900
 that has 200 thousand 500 thousand subscribers 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.150
 but good since you already have 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.400
 enough for if something you see that you 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.010
 like to spread it 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.480
 so if I saw or if you from ostia 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.360
 look at this is my friend and the truth is 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.640
 that this is very good, so I do 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.470
 I have time and I can see it or if I 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.940
 always want to promote it or be 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.070
 I will always keep the right 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.330
 to choose is worth because maybe yes 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.940
 She is very talented but well 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.000
 person who does not end up not worth it or 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.710
 be I be the character of a person me 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.270
 throws a lot then if a person does 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.440
 something very good but I do not like its 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.390
 character I will not promote my 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.030
 channel that obviously so always 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.860
 I 'm going to save myself the last the last 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.480
 the last decision is worth what I say so that 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.190
 people do not tell you or send you this 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.470
 new promoted and promotes another 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.030
 thing is not that you go see 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.350
 many promotions but if it were given 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.620
 the case is worth something that really 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.760
 I like it because it's promoted on my channel 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.680
 as well as the best the fear of 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.270
 to be able to go see me that I want today 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.040
 tell a joke post recorded told a 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.650
 joke and I upload it on Wednesday is worth it 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.650
 I do not want myself to cook in 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.880
 balls and I tell the mind that I recorded or 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.340
 he heard that it will be bigger nonsense of 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.130
 You can see it on Wednesdays 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.210
 that this last thing will not happen but 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.040
 good for you to know that Wednesdays 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.690
 to be totally different 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.550
 it's as if we said that on Wednesday 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.680
 used on my secondary channel by 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.650
 put it to explain it in the way to 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.350
 that you understand nothing more is to say that 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.820
 do not add the balance or I am 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.130
 sure many people who say it does not fit 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.100
 or do not upload the cloud to which you say you know that 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:36.030
 to see the first day I said that I played 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:39.000
 to lol receive 30 thousand 30 minutes but 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.620
 I received many requests and you are 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.650
 many that you like the long and it's a 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.190
 game I think it's booming 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.229
 I do not know I think it's a game that 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.430
 there is a lot of much that is not like 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:51.690
 other games that maybe I would like 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.220
 and know how for instance tell you came 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.560
 due to infants or any game that 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.889
 play like this old game this play 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.050
 many but many of you who follow me 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:03.300
 and I think I think it can go well if I 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.919
 I do the direct ones in tweets and no and no 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.050
 Canary Islands I do them on YouTube for 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:10.259
 that more people see them and then the hats 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.490
 I do not tell you what you choose for 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:13.259
 also to add me because it is that 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.030
 I received too many requests I'm not going to 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:16.289
 add them all because it is that then 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.690
 what happens happens I do not remember 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:21.060
 you that there are people that all want 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.490
 play and the cards are 5 out of 5 just me 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.440
 I usually choose my friends and better 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.419
 there is a gap or two and if I have 300 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.100
 friends then well let's see is 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:30.750
 practically impossible that you enter like this 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.580
 that does not add from people do not see me 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.260
 and nothing more 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.330
 remind you of that that Wednesdays go 

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.789
 to be different and that you can take advantage 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.410
 to make any suggestion of some 

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:42.509
 video that is not related to zombies 

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:45.210
 of any other game or whatever 

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:47.610
 you can take advantage to demand it and I 

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.650
 if I like this game 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:53.460
 or simply because I want to play it or 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:55.610
 whatever it is I'll bring it so that 's 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.610
 all
