 touch the time of the protein that yes with 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.790
 Curry a lot curry for that digestion 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.110

 also also make it as it has 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.960
 happened is that the truth is that 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.590
 Dreams like a very strong thing but it's 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.930
 a is a great condiment that removes all 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.210
 those conditions so write down the 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.790
 ingredients of this recipe is the 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.030
 part apple pectin bone this is good 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.440
 that's good for all the digestion and 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.480
 Now we are going to use salt and 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.160

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.870
 and we will donate the chicken breasts 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.690
 nietito 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:22.090

 put some breasts here and we're going to 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.960
 season also from the other side 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.399
 let's put a little bit of herbs 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.430
 fine in our this chicks have 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.740
 more so that you know rich of beneficial and 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.409
 let's make a dressing on the other hand 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.500
 then we are going to take the mayonnaise here 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.840
 I want to remind you several times 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.429
 mayonnaise buy the mayonnaise dressing 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.130
 because of light mayonnaise at 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.229
 normal mayonnaise if there are many calories 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.600
 of difference but please check the 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.789
 ingredients today it hits me because ok if 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.619
 they have less fat I find divine but 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.440
 you will see how much sugar you have 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.049
 fixed has double the sugar then 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.090
 I did not better start the fat than at 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.760
 less burn it to the sugar that is 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.620
 reservation and it's terrible and then welcome 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.240
 to diabetes there are no others how are you going 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.100
 see, I did not tell you the truth 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.320
 I felt like a grandma right now in two 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.090
 second show my cut let's mix it 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:30.010
 with curry 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.410
 and the vinegar ok but you 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.470
 everything is here 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.470
 let's see how my chicks go 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.490
 let's flip them once before 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.060
 mix this so that they are well made 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.680
 do not 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.790
 now I like this one because of cold 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.610
 hot you like the cold 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.580
 hot 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.100
 and the hot cold game that they have 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.920
 for example served in hot meat 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.770
 but the cold sauce as he hears like I eat 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.420
 chiles en nogada have never 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.240
 tasted chiles en nogada that have 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.930
 this the different temperatures to me 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.930
 Like very much 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.069
 but then we heat it no more because 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.260
 more wants 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.260
 do not cry anymore now I hug you 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.840
 then we already mix mayonnaise curry and 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.940
 vinegar now let's incorporate the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.470
 raisins that aside let me tell you that 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.350
 pastes are excellent for 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.810
 digestion and if they have tannins we go 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.970
 to put celery that has so much fiber 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.670
 that causes you to burn more calories than 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.160
 that you consume I repeat the procedure 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.400
 a celery has 7 calories and for 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.000
 digest it you spend like 13 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.829
 is father because he is burning 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.730
 calories that we want so much 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:55.010
 truth and we are going to also put the 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.170
 apple that can be green can be 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.170
 red the properties are the same as 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.120
 important here is the pectin and the acid 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.579
 Ursolic that I love because that 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.090
 name I learned it because my daughter says 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:11.900
 my daughter says that she is bad like 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:15.799
 úrsula as úrsula that is the octopus 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:20.239
 of ariel not then this is the acid 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:22.550
 Ursolic is not good father this acid 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.550
 what it does convert 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.740
 cells white fat cells 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.289
 brown fat and as for the cells of 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.449
 fat are coffees are metabolized are going 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.400
 towards the cells towards all 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.840
 cells of our body and they become app 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.060
 which is a unit of energy that we 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.770
 it has to interest a lot and also 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.020
 helps when you exercise 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.430
 that more calories faster not good 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.720
 come and now what are we going to 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.720
 do let's put this mixture 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:54.290
 in our chicken who wants chicken 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.440
 they get scrubbed because it's for the 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:02.060
 males 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.060
 but if I want to take a little more 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:10.250
 to see this is heard and warm not 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.050
 you know what I want have you need you need 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.060
 tantita gives me away I will recover a 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.580
 little the flavor that stayed stuck in the 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.770
 chicken frying pan with tantita today that 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.120
 smells 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.870
 hold on to me that I really do not go 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.870
 to reach the males 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.009
 it is being watched I am also going to eat 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.009

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:39.480

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.110
 a splash of milk 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.890
 go for it to be a little bit more 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.890
 a little more 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.759
 this if they had made it logical that 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:53.150
 it would have been a very good idea more than 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:53.150
 you have hired 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.350

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.140
 redundancy and let's go a cut
