thought about it we spent time with each
other<00:06:33.729> you<00:06:34.729> know<00:06:34.760> I'll<00:06:34.880> be<00:06:34.970> the<00:06:35.060> first<00:06:35.240> to

admit I played a little bit of Xbox and
Christmas<00:06:37.310> but<00:06:38.090> I<00:06:38.120> wasn't<00:06:38.570> on<00:06:38.780> there<00:06:38.990> all<00:06:39.110> day

and I think our community is so focused

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.189 
and I think our community is so focused
on<00:06:43.010> getting<00:06:43.070> the<00:06:43.370> best<00:06:43.550> game<00:06:43.729> play<00:06:44.000> or<00:06:44.180> me<00:06:45.020> me
