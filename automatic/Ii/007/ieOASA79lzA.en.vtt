00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
this is all very important because

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.700 
this is all very important because
that's<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.080> way<00:02:52.200> you're<00:02:52.290> gonna<00:02:52.410> get<00:02:52.590> that

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
now that pressure as well I should

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.880 
now that pressure as well I should
mention<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.080> going<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.350> give<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:01.650> nice
