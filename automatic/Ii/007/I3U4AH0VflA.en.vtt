muscles is all tense and broken down

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.939 
muscles is all tense and broken down
because<00:01:03.539> she<00:01:03.629> was<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.930> lifting<00:01:04.470> weights<00:01:04.500> I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
because she was just lifting weights I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.929 
because she was just lifting weights I
would<00:01:05.549> do<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.030> college<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.590> I

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
would do that in college and then I

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.340 
would do that in college and then I
broke<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.090> down<00:01:09.240> when<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.540> became<00:01:09.990> an<00:01:10.229> adult

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
broke it down when I became an adult

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.350 
broke it down when I became an adult
once<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.130> got<00:01:11.280> into<00:01:11.460> my<00:01:11.580> adult<00:01:11.880> life<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.210> would

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
once I got into my adult life I would

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.480 
once I got into my adult life I would
break<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.689> down<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.140> far<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.530> separating<00:01:14.400> them

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
break it down as far as separating them

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.910 
break it down as far as separating them
completely<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.210> would<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.630> maybe<00:01:16.380> lift

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
completely so I would do maybe lift

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.490 
completely so I would do maybe lift
early<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> morning<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.689> go<00:01:19.290> home

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
eat and do whatever I was doing you know

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.469 
eat and do whatever I was doing you know

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
if you weren't going to work and then

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.840 
if you weren't going to work and then
come<00:01:24.509> back<00:01:24.780> better<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.680> day<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.610> do

a<00:01:29.790> long<00:01:29.909> time<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> lot<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.600> years<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.079> was

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
a long time for a lot of years that was

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.350 
a long time for a lot of years that was
basically<00:01:31.500> my<00:01:31.590> schedule<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:32.729> now<00:01:32.909> what<00:01:33.240> I've
