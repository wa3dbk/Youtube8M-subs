00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.510 
range of measures possible for angle C
now<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.440> this<00:00:16.590> problem<00:00:16.890> what<00:00:17.279> we're<00:00:17.369> going

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
now to do this problem what we're going

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.929 
now to do this problem what we're going
to<00:00:17.550> do<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:18.029> we're<00:00:18.630> gonna<00:00:18.750> try<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.020> figure<00:00:19.410> out

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
to do is we're gonna try to figure out

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.450 
to do is we're gonna try to figure out
the<00:00:20.939> smallest<00:00:21.330> angle<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.930> C<00:00:22.289> could<00:00:22.500> be<00:00:22.680> by

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the smallest angle that C could be by

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.630 
the smallest angle that C could be by
using<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.570> largest<00:00:25.080> possible<00:00:25.529> angles<00:00:26.369> for

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
using the largest possible angles for

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.870 
using the largest possible angles for
the<00:00:26.730> other<00:00:26.880> two<00:00:27.619> so<00:00:28.619> we're<00:00:28.769> gonna<00:00:28.890> say<00:00:29.189> we're

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
the other two so we're gonna say we're

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.840 
the other two so we're gonna say we're
just<00:00:30.029> draw<00:00:30.240> triangle<00:00:31.610> ABC<00:00:32.610> here<00:00:33.680> and<00:00:34.850> we'll

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
just draw triangle ABC here and we'll

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.080 
just draw triangle ABC here and we'll
just<00:00:36.030> put<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.630> 60<00:00:37.200> degrees<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.489> angle<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
just put and 60 degrees for this angle a

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.060 
just put and 60 degrees for this angle a
hundred<00:00:39.960> degrees<00:00:40.129> for<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.280> angle<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:43.070> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
hundred degrees for that angle and to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.560 
hundred degrees for that angle and to
figure<00:00:44.340> out<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.550> other<00:00:44.670> angle<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.180> use<00:00:45.300> X

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
figure out this other angle just use X

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.229 
figure out this other angle just use X
and<00:00:45.899> we'll<00:00:46.739> add<00:00:46.920> these<00:00:47.190> three<00:00:47.550> together<00:00:47.730> six

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
and we'll add these three together six

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.810 
and we'll add these three together six
degrees<00:00:48.660> plus<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> hundred<00:00:49.680> degrees<00:00:51.079> plus<00:00:52.079> x

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
degrees plus a hundred degrees plus x

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.900 
degrees plus a hundred degrees plus x
equals<00:00:53.820> 180<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.370> this<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.579> going<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
equals 180 and this is going to be a

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.150 
equals 180 and this is going to be a
hundred<00:00:57.270> sixty<00:00:57.539> degrees<00:00:58.230> plus<00:00:58.920> x<00:00:59.719> equals<00:01:00.719> 180

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
hundred sixty degrees plus x equals 180

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.020 
hundred sixty degrees plus x equals 180
take<00:01:02.160> away<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:03.650> hundred<00:01:04.650> sixty<00:01:05.280> degrees<00:01:05.729> from

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
take away a hundred sixty degrees from

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.539 
take away a hundred sixty degrees from
both<00:01:06.240> sides<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:08.280> you're<00:01:09.000> gonna<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.299> left<00:01:09.510> with

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
both sides and you're gonna be left with

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.050 
both sides and you're gonna be left with
x<00:01:11.549> equals<00:01:11.850> 20<00:01:13.159> degrees<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.760> that's<00:01:14.909> gonna

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
x equals 20 degrees so that's gonna

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.030 
x equals 20 degrees so that's gonna
marry<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.479> smallest<00:01:16.140> possible<00:01:16.409> angle<00:01:16.920> that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
marry the smallest possible angle that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.730 
marry the smallest possible angle that
could<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.729> angle<00:01:18.270> C<00:01:18.390> could<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.650> we

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
could that angle C could be and if we

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.560 
could that angle C could be and if we
look<00:01:19.890> at<00:01:20.009> our<00:01:20.130> choices<00:01:20.400> appears<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.330> choice

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
look at our choices appears like choice

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.240 
look at our choices appears like choice
number<00:01:21.840> one<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.350> gonna<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.680> our<00:01:22.770> answer<00:01:23.070> but

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
number one is gonna be our answer but

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.910 
number one is gonna be our answer but
let's<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.610> double<00:01:23.939> check<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.920> largest

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
let's just double check what the largest

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.330 
let's just double check what the largest
possible<00:01:26.369> angle<00:01:26.790> C<00:01:27.479> could<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:29.100> do<00:01:29.220> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
possible angle C could be and to do that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.859 
possible angle C could be and to do that
all<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> do<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:30.509> I'm<00:01:30.659> going<00:01:30.810> to

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
all I'm going to do is now I'm going to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.310 
all I'm going to do is now I'm going to
take<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.470> smallest<00:01:32.070> angle<00:01:32.579> measures<00:01:33.229> for<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
take the smallest angle measures for the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560 
take the smallest angle measures for the
two<00:01:34.670> angles<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.909> I'm<00:01:36.119> gonna<00:01:36.270> set<00:01:36.479> up

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
two angles there I'm gonna set up

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.700 
two angles there I'm gonna set up
another<00:01:36.780> triangle<00:01:37.439> here<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.570> go<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:40.250> b<00:01:41.250> c<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
another triangle here so go a b c and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.719 
another triangle here so go a b c and
we're<00:01:43.710> gonna<00:01:43.799> put<00:01:44.070> 50<00:01:44.520> degrees<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.060> frame<00:01:46.729> and

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
we're gonna put 50 degrees in frame and

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.899 
we're gonna put 50 degrees in frame and
90<00:01:48.240> degrees<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:49.079> B<00:01:49.200> now<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.700> tell

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
90 degrees and for B now you can tell

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.520 
90 degrees and for B now you can tell
this<00:01:51.180> isn't<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.630> scale<00:01:51.899> because<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.350> is

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
this isn't the scale because this is

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.039 
this isn't the scale because this is
nowheres<00:01:52.979> clear<00:01:53.880> looking<00:01:54.240> close<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> right

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
nowheres clear looking close to a right

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.749 
nowheres clear looking close to a right
angle<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.860> remember<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.549> sketch

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
angle but it remember it's just a sketch

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.359 
angle but it remember it's just a sketch
and<00:01:57.170> we're<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.320> set<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.590> our<00:01:58.740> equation

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
and we're going to set up our equation

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.990 
and we're going to set up our equation
so<00:01:59.549> we're<00:01:59.670> gonna<00:01:59.759> have<00:02:00.000> 50<00:02:00.509> degrees<00:02:01.820> plus<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
so we're gonna have 50 degrees plus the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.649 
so we're gonna have 50 degrees plus the
90<00:02:03.149> degrees<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.490> others<00:02:05.490> set<00:02:05.939> angle<00:02:06.270> Z<00:02:06.420> equal

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
90 degrees and others set angle Z equal

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.320 
90 degrees and others set angle Z equal
to<00:02:06.689> Y<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:06.990> time<00:02:10.099> and<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.940> we've<00:02:12.120> got<00:02:12.360> 150

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
to Y this time and so we've got 150

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.170 
to Y this time and so we've got 150
plus<00:02:13.660> 90<00:02:13.990> plus<00:02:14.200> y<00:02:14.350> equals<00:02:14.650> 180<00:02:15.130> let's<00:02:15.880> go<00:02:16.030> ahead

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
plus 90 plus y equals 180 let's go ahead

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.560 
plus 90 plus y equals 180 let's go ahead
and<00:02:16.510> solve<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.220> get<00:02:18.340> 140<00:02:18.940> degrees<00:02:19.240> plus

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
and solve this so I get 140 degrees plus

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.760 
and solve this so I get 140 degrees plus
y<00:02:19.810> equals<00:02:20.320> 180<00:02:20.890> degrees<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:22.200> we're<00:02:23.200> going<00:02:23.530> to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
y equals 180 degrees and we're going to

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.450 
y equals 180 degrees and we're going to
subtract<00:02:24.310> 144<00:02:25.030> both<00:02:25.450> sides<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:30.130> we're<00:02:30.370> gonna

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
subtract 144 both sides and we're gonna

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.630 
subtract 144 both sides and we're gonna
be<00:02:30.580> left<00:02:30.730> over<00:02:30.910> Y<00:02:31.330> over<00:02:31.720> here<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.280> 180<00:02:33.280> minus

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
be left over Y over here and 180 minus

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.960 
be left over Y over here and 180 minus
140<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.300> gonna<00:02:34.480> be<00:02:34.630> 40<00:02:35.110> degrees<00:02:35.500> over<00:02:35.950> here<00:02:36.280> so

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
140 is gonna be 40 degrees over here so

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.150 
140 is gonna be 40 degrees over here so
you<00:02:37.030> see<00:02:37.270> our<00:02:37.510> largest<00:02:38.110> possible<00:02:38.620> angle<00:02:38.890> for<00:02:39.040> C

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
you see our largest possible angle for C

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.460 
you see our largest possible angle for C
could<00:02:39.460> be<00:02:39.580> 40<00:02:39.910> degrees<00:02:40.210> and<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:41.140> lowest

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
could be 40 degrees and the lowest

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.500 
could be 40 degrees and the lowest
possible<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:42.190> could<00:02:42.280> be<00:02:42.370> 20<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:43.300> we're<00:02:43.420> gonna

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
possible it could be 20 so we're gonna

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.380 
possible it could be 20 so we're gonna
pick<00:02:43.720> choice<00:02:43.990> 1<00:02:44.350> which<00:02:44.860> has<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.370> range<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:46.030> 20

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
pick choice 1 which has a range of 20

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.760 
pick choice 1 which has a range of 20
degrees<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:47.050> 40<00:02:47.440> degrees<00:02:47.710> for<00:02:48.460> angle<00:02:48.580> C
