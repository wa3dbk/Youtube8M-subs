00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.230
 Good day to all my name is 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:09.080
 Kravchenko love I am a company teacher 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.640
 Victory in Kiev today in 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.220
 video we look at technology 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.190
 applying soft dissolve their gels 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.490
 esaulkov and you run the so-called 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.410
 biogels of interpretations is a line of elastic 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.520
 dissolve their gels to strengthen 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.500
 natural nails 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.600
 gel data is polymerized in 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.720
 ultraviolet devices three minutes 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.570
 well self aligned and not have 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.110
 smell and so get down to technology 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.329
 disinfect the hands of the client and 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.320
 masters spray disinfector am nail prep 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.620
 get away 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.630
 whose composition includes clotrimazole at 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.300
 help professional pusher 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.140
 use the spatula to move the cuticle very 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.000
 gently without pressure on the nail plate 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:01:02.320
 then carefully remove the hatchet 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.320
 Catherine brush and remove dust 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.080
 then sawn from easy flora abrasiveness 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.750
 180 to 180 grit give free form 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.490
 the edge of the nail 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.090
 then remove the surface of the file 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.070
 lipid layer from the nail plate 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.170
 nail growth from top to bottom 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.780
 so as not to injure and exclude 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.130
 nail plate 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.979
 use for the preparation of natural 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:36.360
 nails can be perks only abrasive 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:40.140
 180 grit brush remove dust 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.929
 move on to the next step then 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.220
 use dehydrator stand back or easy 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.000
 bond from izi flo 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.500
 These drugs are analogues 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.119
 dehydrator is needed to eliminate 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.759
 excess moisture with natural nail 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.009
 plates I recommend using it 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.130
 after the classic trim 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.500
 manicure soaking hands bath and for 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.240
 customers with hyperhidrosis it will eliminate 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.349
 excess moisture without disturbing ph balance 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.410
 dehydrator is applied to the nail 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:13.430
 plate and butt if client hands 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.650
 wet you can use it twice 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.379
 next we need to apply a bonder of this 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.230
 trouble or acid free primer from quick flo 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.480
 both drugs can replace each other 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.090
 as are analogs this 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.040
 acid-free primer and londor of that kind 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.780
 applied very very thin and 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.690
 polymerized in ultraviolet 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.060
 the unit is acid free one minute 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.890
 primer it izi flo applied very 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.959
 thin but nail plate 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.560
 You can first press it about 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.180
 wrap around the drug contributes 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.420
 better adhesion of the nail plate with 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.909
 artificial material transparent 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.680
 firming gel used in Sauk 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.760
 as a second phase to strengthen 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.310
 natural nails 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.310
 and also as a substrate for color 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.319
 Juice Gels Transparent Constructing 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.930
 south of gel is used for 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.409
 strengthen natural nail overlap 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.140
 tips 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.459
 and modeling nails on forms in 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.240
 as a second phase 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.620
 transparent sculpted gel south of 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.700
 used to strengthen natural 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.400
 nails 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.450
 for modeling on tips and on forms 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.980
 it is thicker in consistency 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.840
 we type a small drop on the brush 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.250
 gel 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.989
 distribute it evenly throughout 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.190
 surface of the nail plate 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.690
 creating a primer for 2 drops of gel 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.640
 thanks to the primer the guide will be very 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.450
 well self aligned across 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.340
 nail plate 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.040
 we collect the second drop of the gel and from the cuticle 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.780
 begin to distribute throughout 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.780
 surface of the nail plate 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.519
 can watch how the souk possesses 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.640
 excellent self-leveling quality 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.799
 polymerize 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.799
 ultraviolet device three minutes 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.410
 then you can apply color gel sauk 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.900
 or use gel polish 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.989
 we will need colored gel varnish and on 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.600
 choosing one of the top tops it can 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:22.770
 to be both matting and classic 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.200
 glossy top on a sticky layer of soft 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.789
 gel apply a beautiful gel polish and even 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.940
 gasoline to the entire surface of the nail 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:33.229
 plates and butt gel varnish necessary 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.229
 apply very thinly 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.520
 polymerize thirty seconds into the led 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.960
 machine or two minutes per 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.820
 ultraviolet apparatus applied second 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.920
 a layer of gel varnish to the surface 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.730
 nail plate and butt then 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.730
 polymerize 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.040
 Completion Apply Top Top Coat 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.940
 from aibige 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.940
 polymerize 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:25.520
 remove the sticky dispersion layer 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.520
 we put oil for a cuticle we rub in 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.410
 This video we reviewed 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.120
 technology of applying soft helium sauk 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.400
 this procedure takes very little 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.610
 time is an excellent defense 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.920
 nail plate from external factors 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.250
 the groundhog ate very resiliently fine 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.750
 itself is aligned and odorless 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.940
 one of the great advantages of this 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.100
 the system is that the gel of the shackles 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.680
 dissolve with the drug for 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.900
 gel nail removal 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.930
 removed as gel varnish removal time 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.490
 12-15 minutes 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.800
 This system will suit customers with 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.640
 soft weak and brittle nail and 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.590
 plates 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.450
 as well as customers who have 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.570
 constant contact with detergents 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.820
 and water soft gel this trouble and rush 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.050
 up to 3 weeks is perfect for 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.560
 nail strengthening 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.120
 I will be glad to your feedback and comments 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.100
 I wish you creative success and 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.100
 inspiration to new meetings
