00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
but it's not the same kind of yeast that

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.419 
but it's not the same kind of yeast that
you<00:00:12.840> make<00:00:13.080> bread<00:00:13.469> with<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.860> doesn't<00:00:14.280> cause

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
things to rise and usually people who

don't really have trouble with
nutritional<00:00:21.300> yeast<00:00:21.359> because<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
nutritional yeast because it's a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.630 
nutritional yeast because it's a
different<00:00:22.260> kind<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.369> East<00:00:23.939> um<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.609> lot<00:00:26.609> of

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
different kind of East um a lot of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.130 
different kind of East um a lot of
people<00:00:26.730> wonder<00:00:27.480> why<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.900> called

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
people wonder why it's called

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.849 
people wonder why it's called
nutritional<00:00:29.010> ease<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:30.539> don't<00:00:31.289> think<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.740> it

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
nutritional ease and I don't think of it

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.370 
nutritional ease and I don't think of it
as<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> nutritional<00:00:33.270> supplement<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:34.050> think

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
as like a nutritional supplement I think

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.350 
as like a nutritional supplement I think
of<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.559> as<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> seasoning<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> reason

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
of it as a seasoning but the reason

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.030 
of it as a seasoning but the reason
people<00:00:36.690> call<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> nutritional<00:00:37.680> yeast<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
people call it a nutritional yeast is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.549 
people call it a nutritional yeast is
because<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.640> does<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.940> nutrients<00:00:39.450> added<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
because it does have nutrients added to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.380 
because it does have nutrients added to
it<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:41.219> rather<00:00:41.660> there<00:00:42.660> are<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:42.960> brands<00:00:43.290> that

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
it or rather there are some brands that

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.900

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
to do that because I know I can get a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.870 
to do that because I know I can get a
high<00:01:07.740> quality<00:01:07.770> supplement<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.760> easily

high quality supplement it's easily

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.820 
high quality supplement it's easily
absorbed<00:01:09.510> whereas<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.470> rely<00:01:10.799> on

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
absorbed whereas if I rely on

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.370 
absorbed whereas if I rely on
nutritional<00:01:11.520> ease<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:12.330> may<00:01:12.600> not<00:01:12.810> absorb<00:01:13.140> quite

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
nutritional ease it may not absorb quite

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.510 
nutritional ease it may not absorb quite
as<00:01:13.560> well<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.979> also<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.369> pretty<00:01:14.430> salty<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.360> um

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
as well and also it's pretty salty so um

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.960 
as well and also it's pretty salty so um
it's<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.820> good<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.270> eat<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.509> ton<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.259> um<00:01:19.970> so

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
it's not good to eat a ton of it um so

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.039 
it's not good to eat a ton of it um so
yeah<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.509> where<00:01:21.659> I'm<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
yeah so that's where I'm at on the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.679 
yeah so that's where I'm at on the
nutritional<00:01:22.590> side<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.430> nutritional<00:01:24.270> yeast<00:01:24.299> is

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
nutritional side of nutritional yeast is

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.960 
nutritional side of nutritional yeast is
it's<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.619> great<00:01:25.799> if<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.670> kind<00:01:26.850> that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it's it's great if you get the kind that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.590 
it's it's great if you get the kind that
has<00:01:27.090> b12<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:28.049> not<00:01:28.770> my<00:01:28.979> main<00:01:29.220> source<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.909> then

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
has b12 but not my main source and then

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.649 
has b12 but not my main source and then
as<00:01:30.900> far<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> use<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.450> said<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
as far as what I use it for as I said I

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.870 
as far as what I use it for as I said I
think<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.079> as<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> seasoning<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> use<00:01:35.700> it

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
think of it as a seasoning so I use it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.230 
think of it as a seasoning so I use it
to<00:01:36.240> add<00:01:36.509> flavor<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.500> my<00:01:37.920> dishes<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:39.060> lot<00:01:39.210> of

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
you're looking for is nutritional yeast

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.430 
you're looking for is nutritional yeast
is<00:02:39.310> yellow<00:02:39.819> flaky

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
is yellow flaky

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.470 
is yellow flaky
there's<00:02:42.100> also<00:02:42.250> brewers<00:02:42.730> yeast<00:02:42.850> which<00:02:43.300> has<00:02:43.450> a

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
there's also brewers yeast which has a

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.000 
there's also brewers yeast which has a
very<00:02:43.720> very<00:02:43.840> different<00:02:44.260> flavor<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.830> more

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
very very different flavor it's more

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.390 
very very different flavor it's more
multi<00:02:45.519> so<00:02:46.209> it's<00:02:46.390> stronger<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.890> little<00:02:48.160> bit

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
multi so it's stronger and a little bit

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.229 
multi so it's stronger and a little bit
more<00:02:48.580> bitter

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
more bitter

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.150 
more bitter
whereas<00:02:49.660> nutritional<00:02:50.140> yeast<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.590> just<00:02:50.890> on<00:02:51.040> the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
whereas nutritional yeast is just on the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.930 
whereas nutritional yeast is just on the
savory<00:02:51.400> side<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:52.720> give<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.350> try<00:02:53.709> I<00:02:54.130> find<00:02:54.640> that

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
savory side so give it a try I find that

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.850 
savory side so give it a try I find that
it<00:02:55.150> really<00:02:55.180> adds<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.989> lot<00:02:56.019> of<00:02:56.260> depth<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.709> flavor

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
it really adds a lot of depth of flavor

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.259 
it really adds a lot of depth of flavor
to<00:02:57.100> dishes<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.900> use<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.680> fairly<00:03:00.489> often<00:03:00.880> I

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269
