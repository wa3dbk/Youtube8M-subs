00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.480
 and there are quiet people here is the case of 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.910
 channel 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.530
 the chaste br or wanted to ask 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.960
 strongly to make sure that you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.610
 enter here below in the channel you will have 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.100
 of high quality cultural and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.960
 doubt about computing that you 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.910
 have me sent a message waiting 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.539
 that I will do my best to be able to 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.460
 to help 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.910
 so what now is that I will teach 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.010
 for you as it is already common to use 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.439
 the possible internet you have 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.600
 but as well as ever so well is 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.640
 with our computer windows 7 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.579
 windows 8 operating system 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.360
 originally limited 80% of our 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.450
 Internet 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.610
 so we use only 20% of the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.170
 total of our internet that people 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.950
 could be using it in our 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.350
 browsers 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.719
 we use the 15th internet seminar 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.030
 to be able to do these things 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.940
 so today I'm going to teach you how 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.530
 you are you take away that limitation, right? 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.780
 that is unnecessary 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.640
 for me at least unnecessary and that 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.769
 It will help you a lot because your 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.600
 internet we get faster hope 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.000
 that you will not have this limitation you 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.490
 you will not need to always capture using 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.720
 only 20% of the internet you will use the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.950
 Web portal 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.630
 however the internet will increase to 80% 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 come on guys first you 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.090
 push the lindon button will appear this 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.979
 would have to perform 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.119
 in it you are going to type exactly what 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:36.030
 I'll be visiting Edith like this. 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:39.090
 both nsc dictated beauty confers and give a 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.210
 ok, ok then you'll wait for some 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.780
 segundinhos here Ã´ beauty in taborda 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.439
 April, it ends here. 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.720
 in this line simply increase here 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.329
 A little bit to get better in our 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.119
 Our visualization is because it is better 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.610
 but here in a little raise said 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.350
 there you go here in these new here are 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.079
 Clicking on this set that is of models 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.210
 have as beauty 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.050
 We will stay here. 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.470
 I clicked on those network 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.990
 several options here that we have here 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.060
 but what we really need is this 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.709
 schedules of the packages that the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.739
 what we'll give two clicks here 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.520
 is not in the 7th is two clicks of the ebx group 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:28.670
 has to increase because the two clicks 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.310
 will appear these six options here 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.040
 and in this being among these options but let 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.650
 use this option here use two 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.230
 click the option to limit the width of 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.730
 band reserve beauty will open this 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.739
 This technique has also been chosen to 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.489
 getting better for us opened this 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.930
 little screen 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.620
 today I 'm not like the computer of 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.700
 you are probably here at 80 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.130
 what here? 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.310
 the default o package scheduler 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.110
 80% bandwidth microsystem 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.720
 a connection 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.930
 so here is proof that the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.360
 system limits 80% of our internet 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.459
 then I will do what we get 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.890
 here is a dance on the computer you are already 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.829
 configured and here it will participate 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.650
 80 is sitting as it is here in my 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:19.040
 you will stay here in enabled and 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.170
 Let's put it where 80 when it's like this 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.320
 its you already can pay off 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.209
 quietly and leaves 10 left 10 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.250
 beauty you can click here 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.000
 apply applied give an ok beauty piece 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.010
 little screen 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.290
 now I see that you restart 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.739
 computer to fully apply the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.470
 our change there and you can be in the 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.870
 your browser that you will feel 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.680
 a very big difference on the internet 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.480
 yours 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.500
 the training was a difference is 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.170
 incredible because 80% is nothing at all right. 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.870
 anyway this is nice if you like 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.690

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.620
 You did it because you did not like it. 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.470
 Any questions you have sent me
