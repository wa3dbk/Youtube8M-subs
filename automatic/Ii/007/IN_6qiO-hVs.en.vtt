00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.630 
perform that on the neck so let's take a
picture<00:01:38.229> of<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.530> talk<00:01:38.860> about<00:01:38.890> her<00:01:39.340> how

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
picture of that and talk about her how

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.550 
picture of that and talk about her how
why<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:39.909> works<00:01:40.420> now<00:01:40.659> if<00:01:40.930> there's<00:01:41.170> just<00:01:41.229> a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
why this works now if there's just a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.289 
why this works now if there's just a
little<00:01:41.770> bit<00:01:41.979> of<00:01:42.100> extra<00:01:42.310> skin<00:01:42.670> SmartLipo<00:01:43.240> is

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
little bit of extra skin SmartLipo is

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.580 
little bit of extra skin SmartLipo is
great<00:01:43.509> it's<00:01:43.689> an<00:01:43.780> office-based<00:01:44.170> procedure

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
great it's an office-based procedure

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.590 
great it's an office-based procedure
permanent<00:01:45.280> result<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.790> skin<00:01:46.030> is<00:01:46.180> tightened

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
permanent result the skin is tightened

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.929 
permanent result the skin is tightened
with<00:01:47.470> using<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:47.920> laser<00:01:48.070> and<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.729> works<00:01:48.880> for

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
with using the laser and so it works for

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.490 
with using the laser and so it works for
someone<00:01:49.210> with<00:01:49.450> just<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.720> little<00:01:49.869> bit<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.259> extra

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
someone with just a little bit of extra

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.740 
someone with just a little bit of extra
skin<00:01:50.890> but<00:01:51.670> sometimes<00:01:52.060> there's<00:01:52.240> too<00:01:52.360> much<00:01:52.479> skin

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
skin but sometimes there's too much skin

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.450 
skin but sometimes there's too much skin
and<00:01:53.049> there's<00:01:53.290> there's<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.680> limitation<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.250> what

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
and there's there's a limitation to what

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.580 
and there's there's a limitation to what
the<00:01:54.579> laser<00:01:54.729> can<00:01:55.060> do<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.509> if<00:01:56.079> there's<00:01:56.259> too<00:01:56.560> much

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
the laser can do and if there's too much

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.039 
the laser can do and if there's too much
skin<00:01:57.100> then<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.399> need<00:01:57.549> to<00:01:58.030> move<00:01:58.180> up<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.509> more<00:01:58.960> of

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
skin then you need to move up to more of

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.149 
skin then you need to move up to more of
an<00:01:59.140> excisional<00:01:59.530> technique<00:01:59.860> where<00:01:59.979> you<00:02:00.040> see

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
an excisional technique where you see

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.560 
an excisional technique where you see
this<00:02:00.250> patient<00:02:00.460> here<00:02:00.700> she<00:02:00.880> had<00:02:01.060> smart<00:02:01.299> life<00:02:01.420> of

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
this patient here she had smart life of

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.359 
this patient here she had smart life of
the<00:02:01.630> neck<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.140> made<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.380> nice<00:02:02.799> permanent

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
the neck and it made a nice permanent

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.530 
the neck and it made a nice permanent
improvement<00:02:03.579> and<00:02:03.909> tightening<00:02:04.240> up<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.390> neck

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
improvement and tightening up the neck

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.700 
improvement and tightening up the neck
and<00:02:04.570> proving<00:02:04.990> her<00:02:05.079> overall<00:02:05.409> appearance

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
and proving her overall appearance

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.600 
and proving her overall appearance
minimal<00:02:06.490> downtime<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:08.110> just<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.649> small<00:02:08.769> little

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
minimal downtime and just a small little

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.190 
minimal downtime and just a small little
incision<00:02:09.729> underneath<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.569> chin<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:10.959> doing

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
incision underneath the chin and doing

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.410 
incision underneath the chin and doing
so<00:02:11.379> and<00:02:11.650> smart<00:02:12.010> lipo<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.550> done<00:02:12.760> pretty<00:02:13.060> quickly

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
so and smart lipo is done pretty quickly

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.300 
so and smart lipo is done pretty quickly
is<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:14.260> well<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:14.739> yeah

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
is it just well it's yeah

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.400 
is it just well it's yeah
in<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.700> out<00:02:16.090> office<00:02:16.720> space<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:17.110> takes<00:02:17.290> a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
in and out office space it takes a

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.199 
in and out office space it takes a
little<00:02:17.770> over<00:02:17.950> an<00:02:18.040> hour<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.459> recovery<00:02:19.090> is

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
little over an hour and recovery is

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.059 
little over an hour and recovery is
measured<00:02:19.510> in<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.690> few<00:02:19.870> days<00:02:20.050> that's<00:02:20.709> nice

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
measured in a few days that's nice

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.380 
measured in a few days that's nice
especially<00:02:21.730> because<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.030> think<00:02:22.180> with<00:02:22.360> a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
especially because you think with a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.670 
especially because you think with a
necklift<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.900> might<00:02:23.050> take<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.260> little<00:02:23.470> longer

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
necklift it might take a little longer

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.040 
necklift it might take a little longer
with<00:02:24.010> surgery<00:02:24.400> but<00:02:24.550> you<00:02:24.819> do<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.630> perform

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
with surgery but you do you can perform

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.690 
with surgery but you do you can perform
some<00:02:26.349> neck<00:02:26.530> lifts<00:02:26.800> at<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.220> office<00:02:27.550> so<00:02:27.610> we're

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
some neck lifts at the office so we're

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.790 
some neck lifts at the office so we're
gonna<00:02:27.790> take<00:02:28.000> another<00:02:28.110> little<00:02:29.110> picture<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.410> a

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
gonna take another little picture of a

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.650 
gonna take another little picture of a
neck<00:02:30.250> lift<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.520> was<00:02:30.670> done<00:02:30.849> in<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.180> office

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
neck lift that was done in the office

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.080 
neck lift that was done in the office
yes-no<00:02:32.170> if<00:02:32.709> there's<00:02:33.010> too<00:02:33.340> much<00:02:33.370> skin<00:02:33.849> like

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
yes-no if there's too much skin like

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.270 
yes-no if there's too much skin like
this<00:02:34.209> patient<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:35.319> laser<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.800> won't<00:02:36.040> will

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
this patient the laser just won't will

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.720 
this patient the laser just won't will
not<00:02:36.400> give<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.610> nice<00:02:38.250> result<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.550> will

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
not give a nice result that will

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.339 
not give a nice result that will
accomplish<00:02:40.300> what<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.750> patient's<00:02:41.080> looking

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
accomplish what the patient's looking

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.949 
accomplish what the patient's looking
for<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:41.800> in<00:02:42.580> someone<00:02:43.209> like<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.540> patient<00:02:43.750> you

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
for so in someone like this patient you

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.960 
for so in someone like this patient you
really<00:02:44.230> have<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.650> remove<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.099> extra<00:02:45.310> skin<00:02:45.700> so

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
really have to remove the extra skin so

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.300 
really have to remove the extra skin so
the<00:02:46.090> skin<00:02:46.569> can<00:02:46.599> be<00:02:46.750> removed<00:02:47.230> but<00:02:47.920> then<00:02:48.130> the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
the skin can be removed but then the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.860 
the skin can be removed but then the
soft<00:02:48.700> tissue<00:02:48.940> of<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.239> neck<00:02:49.390> can<00:02:49.510> be<00:02:49.569> read

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
soft tissue of the neck can be read

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.660 
soft tissue of the neck can be read
raped<00:02:50.140> as<00:02:50.319> well<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.069> can<00:02:51.100> be<00:02:51.310> tightened

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
raped as well and that can be tightened

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.120 
raped as well and that can be tightened
and<00:02:51.819> that<00:02:51.910> happens<00:02:52.239> basically<00:02:52.450> at<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.290> what's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
and that happens basically at the what's

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.530 
and that happens basically at the what's
called<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.370> angle<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.880> jaw<00:02:55.060> down<00:02:55.330> by<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
called the angle of the jaw down by the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.150 
called the angle of the jaw down by the
the<00:02:55.959> corner<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.350> jaw<00:02:56.500> back<00:02:56.739> behind<00:02:56.890> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
the corner of the jaw back behind the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.370 
the corner of the jaw back behind the
ear<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.660> can<00:02:58.810> tighten<00:02:59.080> that<00:02:59.170> tissue

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
ear and and you can tighten that tissue

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.800 
ear and and you can tighten that tissue
and<00:02:59.730> remove<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.880> extra<00:03:01.150> skin<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.569> gives

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
and remove the extra skin and that gives

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.870 
and remove the extra skin and that gives
a<00:03:01.989> real<00:03:02.410> nice<00:03:02.560> permanent<00:03:03.069> result<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:03.519> this

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
a real nice permanent result in this

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.789 
a real nice permanent result in this
patients<00:03:04.299> seen<00:03:04.450> immediately<00:03:04.870> after<00:03:05.650> having

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
patients seen immediately after having

patients seen immediately after having
this<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.840> recovery<00:03:07.840> for<00:03:08.170> this<00:03:08.380> is<00:03:08.709> within<00:03:09.549> a

week and a half two weeks looks really
nice<00:03:12.160> really<00:03:12.880> nice<00:03:13.120> now<00:03:13.299> some<00:03:13.620> patients<00:03:14.620> will

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
nice really nice now some patients will

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.199 
nice really nice now some patients will
have<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.950> go<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.250> operating<00:03:15.640> room<00:03:15.819> for

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
have to go to the operating room for

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.030 
have to go to the operating room for
their<00:03:16.330> neck<00:03:16.480> lift<00:03:16.690> procedures<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.920> have

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
their neck lift procedures and you have

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.819 
their neck lift procedures and you have
a<00:03:18.069> couple<00:03:18.310> examples<00:03:18.549> of<00:03:19.329> a<00:03:19.870> case<00:03:20.560> like<00:03:20.769> that

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
a couple examples of a case like that

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.030 
a couple examples of a case like that
right<00:03:21.489> now<00:03:21.700> now<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.870> patient<00:03:23.109> has<00:03:23.440> banding

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
right now now this patient has banding

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.470 
right now now this patient has banding
in<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.220> front<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.549> neck<00:03:24.730> when<00:03:25.269> there<00:03:25.420> are

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
in the front of the neck when there are

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.050 
in the front of the neck when there are
significant<00:03:26.109> bands<00:03:26.459> sometimes<00:03:27.459> just

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
significant bands sometimes just

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.940 
significant bands sometimes just
tightening<00:03:28.540> back<00:03:28.840> behind<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.380> ear<00:03:29.590> isn't

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
tightening back behind the ear isn't

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.440 
tightening back behind the ear isn't
enough<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.459> they'll<00:03:30.640> still<00:03:30.880> have<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.239> bands

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
enough and they'll still have the bands

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.319 
enough and they'll still have the bands
and<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.350> is<00:03:32.650> what<00:03:32.950> leads<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.760> an<00:03:34.150> aged

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
and and that is what leads to an aged

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.090 
and and that is what leads to an aged
appearance<00:03:34.510> in<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.350> neck<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.709> so<00:03:35.859> in<00:03:35.980> order

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
appearance in the neck and so in order

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.940 
appearance in the neck and so in order
to<00:03:36.280> improve<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:38.140> there's<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.709> small

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
to improve that the there's a small

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.410 
to improve that the there's a small
incision<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.459> that's<00:03:39.730> required<00:03:40.030> underneath

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
incision that that's required underneath

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.509 
incision that that's required underneath
the<00:03:40.569> chin<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.079> the<00:03:41.290> skin<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:41.709> released<00:03:42.190> from

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
the chin and the skin is released from

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.860 
the chin and the skin is released from
the<00:03:42.609> muscle<00:03:43.030> because<00:03:43.269> those<00:03:43.420> bands<00:03:43.630> are

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
the muscle because those bands are

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.690 
the muscle because those bands are
actually<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.500> muscle<00:03:44.739> of<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.280> neck<00:03:45.310> that's

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
actually the muscle of the neck that's

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.390 
actually the muscle of the neck that's
that's<00:03:46.120> fallen<00:03:46.930> forward<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.500> those<00:03:48.130> two

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
that's fallen forward and those two

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.160 
that's fallen forward and those two
edges<00:03:48.670> of<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.090> muscle<00:03:49.389> are<00:03:49.510> sewed<00:03:49.989> together

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
edges of the muscle are sewed together

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.050 
edges of the muscle are sewed together
and<00:03:50.590> tightened<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:51.130> then<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.549> skin<00:03:51.730> is<00:03:51.910> read

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
and tightened and then the skin is read

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.569 
and tightened and then the skin is read
raped<00:03:52.329> like<00:03:52.959> in<00:03:53.109> the<00:03:53.200> last<00:03:53.410> patient<00:03:53.620> there's

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
raped like in the last patient there's

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.520 
raped like in the last patient there's
another<00:03:54.819> patient<00:03:55.060> same<00:03:55.450> thing<00:03:55.690> she<00:03:55.900> had<00:03:56.079> those

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
another patient same thing she had those

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.400 
another patient same thing she had those
bands<00:03:56.859> in<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.190> neck<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.840> just<00:03:58.840> read<00:03:59.019> raping

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
bands in the neck and just read raping

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.440 
bands in the neck and just read raping
the<00:03:59.500> skin<00:03:59.709> back<00:03:59.920> behind<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.400> ear<00:04:00.609> wouldn't

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
the skin back behind the ear wouldn't

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.349 
the skin back behind the ear wouldn't
have<00:04:01.660> corrected<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.560> fully<00:04:02.889> and<00:04:03.160> so<00:04:03.609> it<00:04:04.209> is

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
have corrected that fully and so it is

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.690 
have corrected that fully and so it is
important<00:04:04.780> then<00:04:04.900> to<00:04:05.139> bring<00:04:06.130> those<00:04:06.280> muscles

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
important then to bring those muscles

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.720 
important then to bring those muscles
together<00:04:06.819> directly<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.109> that<00:04:08.170> requires<00:04:08.730> more

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
together directly and that requires more

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.759 
together directly and that requires more
of<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.970> dissection<00:04:10.389> a<00:04:10.750> longer<00:04:11.109> procedure<00:04:11.290> and

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
of a dissection a longer procedure and

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.199 
of a dissection a longer procedure and
that's<00:04:11.980> best<00:04:12.220> done<00:04:12.400> in<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.549> operating<00:04:13.000> room

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
that's best done in the operating room

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.330 
that's best done in the operating room
those<00:04:13.480> look<00:04:13.690> great<00:04:13.810> you<00:04:14.500> know<00:04:14.590> if<00:04:15.190> you're

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
those look great you know if you're

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.849 
those look great you know if you're
having<00:04:15.549> any<00:04:15.790> kind<00:04:16.090> of<00:04:16.329> surgery<00:04:17.200> perform<00:04:17.709> or

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
having any kind of surgery perform or

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.560 
having any kind of surgery perform or
plastic<00:04:18.190> surgery<00:04:18.549> it's<00:04:18.880> obviously<00:04:19.329> because

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
plastic surgery it's obviously because

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.300 
plastic surgery it's obviously because
you're<00:04:19.690> not<00:04:19.959> crazy<00:04:20.410> about<00:04:20.829> something<00:04:21.190> with

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
you're not crazy about something with

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.350 
you're not crazy about something with
your<00:04:21.430> appearance<00:04:21.729> so<00:04:22.419> that<00:04:22.690> brings<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:25.120> issue

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
your appearance so that brings the issue

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.800 
your appearance so that brings the issue
of<00:04:25.630> scarring<00:04:26.229> up<00:04:26.500> where<00:04:27.400> are<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.150> scars

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
of scarring up where are the scars

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.300 
of scarring up where are the scars
where<00:04:28.960> are<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.200> incisions<00:04:29.650> made<00:04:29.889> when<00:04:30.220> you

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
where are the incisions made when you

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.220 
where are the incisions made when you
have<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.490> neck<00:04:30.669> lift<00:04:30.790> procedure<00:04:31.000> my<00:04:31.870> preferred

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
have a neck lift procedure my preferred

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.750 
have a neck lift procedure my preferred
way<00:04:32.350> of<00:04:32.380> doing<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.740> is<00:04:32.830> around<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.190> ear<00:04:33.340> using

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
way of doing it is around the ear using

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.310 
way of doing it is around the ear using
the<00:04:33.970> contours<00:04:34.450> of<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.630> ear<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:35.020> camouflage

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
the contours of the ear to camouflage

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.080 
the contours of the ear to camouflage
the<00:04:35.650> scar<00:04:35.860> so<00:04:36.040> this<00:04:36.160> patient<00:04:36.550> is<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.730> one<00:04:36.760> from

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
the scar so this patient is the one from

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.600 
the scar so this patient is the one from
the<00:04:37.210> prior<00:04:37.630> example<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.560> incision<00:04:39.160> goes<00:04:39.340> in

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
the prior example the incision goes in

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.290 
the prior example the incision goes in
the<00:04:39.760> contours<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.360> ear<00:04:40.660> so<00:04:40.930> you<00:04:40.990> can<00:04:41.320> see

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
the contours of the ear so you can see

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.090 
the contours of the ear so you can see
just<00:04:43.300> a<00:04:43.450> little<00:04:43.780> faint<00:04:44.020> pink<00:04:44.290> line<00:04:44.560> she's

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
just a little faint pink line she's

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.980 
just a little faint pink line she's
about<00:04:45.280> two<00:04:45.490> months<00:04:45.790> out<00:04:45.910> from<00:04:46.090> having<00:04:46.419> it<00:04:46.570> that

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
about two months out from having it that

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.200 
about two months out from having it that
that<00:04:47.350> goes<00:04:47.560> basically<00:04:48.460> from<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:48.850> top<00:04:49.030> of<00:04:49.150> the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
that goes basically from the top of the
