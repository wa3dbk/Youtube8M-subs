so<00:00:35.370> one<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.820> problems<00:00:36.239> we've<00:00:36.450> solved<00:00:36.930> with

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
so one of the problems we've solved with

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.260 
so one of the problems we've solved with
a<00:00:37.079> duo<00:00:37.320> temp<00:00:37.649> pro<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.190> how<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.910> go<00:00:39.090> from

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
a duo temp pro is how do you go from

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.090 
a duo temp pro is how do you go from
texturing<00:00:39.870> milk<00:00:40.079> at<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.379> temperature<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
texturing milk at one temperature and

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.970 
texturing milk at one temperature and
extracting<00:00:41.940> espresso<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.600> another<00:00:42.870> milk<00:00:43.860> is

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
extracting espresso at another milk is

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.700 
extracting espresso at another milk is
textured<00:00:44.430> at<00:00:44.550> around<00:00:44.789> 135<00:00:45.660> degrees<00:00:46.260> C<00:00:46.530> but

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
textured at around 135 degrees C but

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.700 
textured at around 135 degrees C but
espresso<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.760> extracted<00:00:48.329> only<00:00:48.450> around<00:00:49.050> 93

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
espresso is extracted only around 93

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.040 
espresso is extracted only around 93
degrees<00:00:50.039> C<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.809> we

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
degrees C so what we do is we

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.170 
degrees C so what we do is we
automatically<00:00:52.949> put<00:00:53.219> cold<00:00:53.610> water<00:00:53.730> through<00:00:54.149> our

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
automatically put cold water through our

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.479 
automatically put cold water through our
thermofoil<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.620> brings<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.160> thermal

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
thermofoil and this brings the thermal

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.760 
thermofoil and this brings the thermal
heating<00:00:56.879> system<00:00:57.360> back<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> optimal

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
heating system back to the optimal

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.160 
heating system back to the optimal
temperature<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.489> extract<00:00:59.910> espresso<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.930> we

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
temperature to extract espresso so we

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.450 
temperature to extract espresso so we
don't<00:01:01.379> burn<00:01:01.620> our<00:01:01.829> next<00:01:02.100> coffee

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
don't burn our next coffee

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.600 
don't burn our next coffee
so<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> duo<00:01:03.719> temp<00:01:04.110> pro<00:01:04.379> also<00:01:04.680> features<00:01:05.400> low

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
so the duo temp pro also features low

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.120 
so the duo temp pro also features low
pressure<00:01:05.939> pre-infusion<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> system

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
pressure pre-infusion this is a system

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.980 
pressure pre-infusion this is a system
that<00:01:08.159> gradually<00:01:08.760> increases<00:01:09.450> pump<00:01:09.689> pressure

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
that gradually increases pump pressure

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.929 
that gradually increases pump pressure

precise dose of coffee ready for our

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.820 
precise dose of coffee ready for our
extraction<00:02:37.170> we're<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:38.320> going<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.500> insert

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
extraction we're just going to insert

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.800 
extraction we're just going to insert
into<00:02:38.980> our<00:02:39.130> grip<00:02:39.459> head<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:39.790> turn<00:02:40.209> our<00:02:40.390> control

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
into our grip head and turn our control

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.470 
into our grip head and turn our control
dial<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.320> espresso<00:02:44.940> right<00:02:45.940> now<00:02:46.120> we're<00:02:46.330> in<00:02:46.390> our

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
dial to espresso right now we're in our

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.449 
dial to espresso right now we're in our
low-pressure<00:02:46.990> pre-infusion<00:02:47.740> phase<00:02:48.160> of<00:02:48.370> our

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
low-pressure pre-infusion phase of our

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.620 
low-pressure pre-infusion phase of our
extraction<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.700> now<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.000> can<00:02:52.209> hear<00:02:52.360> we<00:02:52.480> have

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
extraction and now you can hear we have

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.530 
extraction and now you can hear we have
full<00:02:52.930> pump<00:02:53.230> pressure<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.209> see<00:02:55.420> our

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
full pump pressure you can see our

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.540 
full pump pressure you can see our
espresso<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:56.200> flowing<00:02:56.530> nice<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.100> slowly<00:02:57.340> just

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
espresso is flowing nice and slowly just

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.800 
espresso is flowing nice and slowly just
like<00:02:58.060> warm<00:02:58.360> dripping<00:02:58.750> honey<00:03:00.450> looks<00:03:01.450> like<00:03:01.660> we

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
like warm dripping honey looks like we

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.840 
like warm dripping honey looks like we
maybe<00:03:02.080> have<00:03:02.380> about<00:03:02.620> enough<00:03:02.890> espresso<00:03:03.430> now<00:03:03.610> so

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
maybe have about enough espresso now so

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.130 
maybe have about enough espresso now so
we're<00:03:04.000> just<00:03:04.030> going<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.420> turn<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.750> control

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
we're just going to turn the control

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.650 
we're just going to turn the control
dial<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.620> standby<00:03:06.240> now<00:03:07.240> we're<00:03:07.420> ready<00:03:07.600> to

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
dial to standby now we're ready to

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.930 
dial to standby now we're ready to
texture<00:03:08.170> some<00:03:08.380> milk<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:09.400> now<00:03:09.610> I'm<00:03:09.700> going<00:03:09.850> to

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
texture some milk so now I'm going to

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.430 
texture some milk so now I'm going to
turn<00:03:10.150> our<00:03:10.360> dial<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.870> steam<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.900> this<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.230> where

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
turn our dial to steam so this is where

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.979 
turn our dial to steam so this is where
our<00:03:14.470> thermic<00:03:15.070> oil<00:03:15.310> is<00:03:15.550> transitioning<00:03:16.239> from<00:03:16.269> 93

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
our thermic oil is transitioning from 93

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.030 
our thermic oil is transitioning from 93
degrees<00:03:17.320> C<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:18.060> 135<00:03:19.060> degrees<00:03:19.480> C<00:03:19.920> when<00:03:20.920> the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
degrees C to 135 degrees C when the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.590 
degrees C to 135 degrees C when the
steam<00:03:21.310> wand<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.640> up<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.910> temperature<00:03:22.120> I'll

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
steam wand is up to temperature I'll

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.900 
steam wand is up to temperature I'll
turn<00:03:23.500> our<00:03:23.650> controlled<00:03:24.070> all<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.280> standby<00:03:24.850> to

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
turn our controlled all the standby to

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.560 
turn our controlled all the standby to
pause<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.480> steam<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:27.090> then<00:03:28.090> I'll<00:03:28.239> start<00:03:28.480> to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
pause the steam and then I'll start to

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.990 
pause the steam and then I'll start to
texture<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.140> milk

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.240 

so<00:03:33.540> right<00:03:33.810> now<00:03:34.050> I've<00:03:34.320> got<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.800> tip<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.160> the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
so right now I've got the tip of the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.040 
so right now I've got the tip of the
steam<00:03:35.490> wand<00:03:35.550> just<00:03:35.910> at<00:03:36.210> the<00:03:36.330> surface<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
steam wand just at the surface of the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.200 
steam wand just at the surface of the
milk<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.530> what<00:03:38.130> I'm<00:03:38.250> trying<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.610> do<00:03:38.760> there<00:03:39.000> is

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
milk and what I'm trying to do there is

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.050 
milk and what I'm trying to do there is
create<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> whirlpool<00:03:40.260> motion<00:03:41.010> where<00:03:41.700> air<00:03:42.000> is

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
create a whirlpool motion where air is

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.690 
create a whirlpool motion where air is
being<00:03:42.510> drawn<00:03:42.870> into<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.380> hot<00:03:43.650> milk<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.130> it's

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
being drawn into the hot milk and it's

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.120 
being drawn into the hot milk and it's
actually<00:03:45.120> increasing<00:03:45.720> in<00:03:45.930> volume<00:03:46.130> creating

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
actually increasing in volume creating

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.340 
actually increasing in volume creating
micro<00:03:47.310> foam<00:03:47.820> bubbles<00:03:48.270> so<00:03:48.870> we<00:03:49.020> want<00:03:49.200> the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
micro foam bubbles so we want the

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.050 
micro foam bubbles so we want the
heating<00:03:49.710> and<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.920> texturing<00:03:50.460> to<00:03:50.610> be<00:03:50.760> one

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
heating and the texturing to be one

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.450 
heating and the texturing to be one
simultaneous<00:03:51.900> process<00:03:52.380> it's<00:03:52.830> not<00:03:53.130> two

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
simultaneous process it's not two

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.900 
simultaneous process it's not two
independent<00:03:53.910> parts<00:03:55.070> so<00:03:56.070> I'm<00:03:56.160> just<00:03:56.370> using<00:03:56.610> my

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
independent parts so I'm just using my

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.640 
independent parts so I'm just using my
fingers<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.540> judge<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.990> temperature<00:03:58.440> of<00:03:58.530> the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
fingers to judge the temperature of the
