00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
articulation goes the head is on a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.800 
articulation goes the head is on a
double<00:01:50.220> ball<00:01:50.430> peg<00:01:50.729> as<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.299> kind<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.630> see

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
double ball peg as you can kind of see

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.719 
double ball peg as you can kind of see
in<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.740> those<00:01:52.890> ball<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> neck<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
in there so those ball on the neck and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.880 
in there so those ball on the neck and
in<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.909> head<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.810> pretty<00:01:55.320> good<00:01:55.530> range<00:01:55.770> of

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
in the head so pretty good range of

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.819 
in the head so pretty good range of
motion<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.399> such<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> bulky<00:01:57.060> clunky<00:01:57.240> guy<00:01:57.829> it's

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
motion for such a bulky clunky guy it's

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.560 
motion for such a bulky clunky guy it's
pretty<00:01:59.100> nice<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.490> think<00:01:59.549> even<00:02:00.149> though<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.390> can

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
pretty nice I think even though you can

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.080 
pretty nice I think even though you can
see<00:02:00.750> through<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.140> some<00:02:01.350> spots<00:02:01.850> it's<00:02:02.850> pretty

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
see through in some spots it's pretty

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.410 
see through in some spots it's pretty
good<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.780> shoulders<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.350> ball<00:02:04.590> disks<00:02:05.420> so

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
good the shoulders have ball disks so

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.789 
good the shoulders have ball disks so
pretty<00:02:06.659> good<00:02:06.719> range<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.110> motion<00:02:07.290> really

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
pretty good range of motion really

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.889 
pretty good range of motion really
anything<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.250> want<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:09.090> these

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
anything you want to do you can do these

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.839 
anything you want to do you can do these
pads<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:10.860> get<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.220> way<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> little<00:02:11.670> bit<00:02:11.790> if

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
pads do get in the way a little bit if

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.130 
pads do get in the way a little bit if
you<00:02:11.910> try<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> go<00:02:12.300> straight<00:02:12.360> up

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
you try to go straight up

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.200 
you try to go straight up
but<00:02:13.290> that's<00:02:13.560> probably<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:14.280> mean<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.060> get

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
but that's probably I mean you can get

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.030 
but that's probably I mean you can get
really<00:02:15.480> anything<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.960> need<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.230> do<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.920> can

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
really anything you need to do you can

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.220 
really anything you need to do you can
get<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.310> done<00:02:17.490> so<00:02:17.819> don't<00:02:18.600> worry<00:02:18.750> about<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.080> too

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
get it done so don't worry about it too

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.020 
get it done so don't worry about it too
much<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.920> joints<00:02:20.250> are<00:02:20.340> relatively<00:02:20.730> well

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
much and the joints are relatively well

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.750 
much and the joints are relatively well
hidden<00:02:21.270> on<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.200> guy<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:23.220> works<00:02:23.400> for<00:02:23.580> me

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
hidden on this guy so that works for me

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.350 
hidden on this guy so that works for me
he<00:02:24.480> does<00:02:24.630> have<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.840> bicep<00:02:25.319> swivel<00:02:25.680> built-in<00:02:26.360> to

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
he does have a bicep swivel built-in to

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.810 
he does have a bicep swivel built-in to
that<00:02:27.510> ball<00:02:27.720> shoulder<00:02:28.200> he's<00:02:29.010> got<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> hinge<00:02:29.520> for

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
that ball shoulder he's got a hinge for

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.260 
that ball shoulder he's got a hinge for
the<00:02:29.910> elbow<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.900> swivels<00:02:31.350> at<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.709> forearm

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
the elbow and it swivels at the forearm

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.820 
the elbow and it swivels at the forearm
so<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.390> can<00:02:33.600> bring<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.959> around<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.709> these

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
so you can bring that around and these

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.410 
so you can bring that around and these
are<00:02:35.010> softer<00:02:35.430> pieces<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:35.970> they<00:02:36.060> don't<00:02:36.240> really

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
are softer pieces so they don't really

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.720 
are softer pieces so they don't really
get<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.810> way<00:02:36.959> too<00:02:37.020> much<00:02:37.380> if<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.430> wanted<00:02:38.640> to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
get in the way too much if you wanted to

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.570 
get in the way too much if you wanted to
make<00:02:38.850> his<00:02:39.000> arm<00:02:39.150> straight<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.600> can<00:02:39.840> do<00:02:40.050> that

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
make his arm straight you can do that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.430 
make his arm straight you can do that
you<00:02:41.580> have<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.760> fudge<00:02:42.569> with<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.020> little<00:02:43.200> bit

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
you have to fudge with it a little bit

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.070 
you have to fudge with it a little bit
to<00:02:43.680> get<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.790> arm<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.120> bend<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.450> way<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.660> want

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
to get the arm to bend the way you want

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.500 
to get the arm to bend the way you want
it<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.350> but<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.860> can<00:02:47.040> do<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:48.030> wrists<00:02:48.420> are

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
it to but you can do it the wrists are

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.449 
it to but you can do it the wrists are
on<00:02:48.690> ball<00:02:48.930> pegs<00:02:49.230> no<00:02:49.620> one<00:02:49.739> problem<00:02:50.100> really<00:02:50.220> have

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
on ball pegs no one problem really have

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.920 
on ball pegs no one problem really have
with<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.269> can<00:02:51.390> see<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.690> peg

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
with this is that you can see the peg

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.520 
with this is that you can see the peg
it's<00:02:52.830> like<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.100> on<00:02:53.190> both<00:02:53.370> sides<00:02:54.170> it's<00:02:55.170> not<00:02:55.320> so

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
it's like that on both sides it's not so

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.840 
it's like that on both sides it's not so
much<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.709> problem<00:02:55.800> on<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.370> one<00:02:56.550> due<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.760> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
much a problem on this one due to the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.180 
much a problem on this one due to the
armor<00:02:57.150> but<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:57.570> side<00:02:57.780> it's<00:02:58.530> pretty<00:02:58.620> ugly

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
armor but on this side it's pretty ugly

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.880 
armor but on this side it's pretty ugly
but<00:03:00.090> it<00:03:00.209> is<00:03:00.330> there

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
but it is there

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.290 
but it is there
torso<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.130> ball<00:03:02.370> peg<00:03:02.670> but<00:03:02.880> really<00:03:03.180> it's

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
torso is on a ball peg but really it's

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.270 
torso is on a ball peg but really it's
mostly<00:03:03.630> just<00:03:03.720> going<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.080> be<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.230> swivel<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:05.130> can

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
mostly just going to be a swivel you can

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.550 
mostly just going to be a swivel you can
get<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.459> little<00:03:05.700> bit<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.030> rocking<00:03:06.239> back<00:03:06.630> not<00:03:07.350> too

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
get a little bit of rocking back not too

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.890 
get a little bit of rocking back not too
much<00:03:07.739> forward<00:03:08.100> that's<00:03:08.489> about<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.910> but<00:03:09.660> pretty

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
much forward that's about it but pretty

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.560 
much forward that's about it but pretty
good<00:03:10.200> nonetheless<00:03:10.820> you<00:03:11.820> can<00:03:11.850> see<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.239> armor

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
good nonetheless you can see the armor

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.960 
good nonetheless you can see the armor
here<00:03:12.810> hides<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.320> articulation<00:03:14.130> fairly<00:03:14.790> well

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
here hides the articulation fairly well

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.600 
here hides the articulation fairly well
it's<00:03:15.180> not<00:03:15.300> perfect<00:03:15.600> but<00:03:15.900> it's<00:03:16.050> pretty<00:03:16.110> good

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
it's not perfect but it's pretty good

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.580 
it's not perfect but it's pretty good
the<00:03:17.610> hips<00:03:17.820> have<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.450> rotation<00:03:19.170> piece<00:03:19.380> right

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
the hips have a rotation piece right

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.949 
the hips have a rotation piece right
here<00:03:19.799> it's<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.100> cut<00:03:20.790> joint<00:03:21.120> or<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.329> swivel<00:03:21.810> and

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
here it's a cut joint or a swivel and

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.880 
here it's a cut joint or a swivel and
then<00:03:22.739> there's<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.310> swivel<00:03:23.730> again<00:03:24.000> here<00:03:24.739> so<00:03:25.739> this

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
then there's a swivel again here so this

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.270 
then there's a swivel again here so this
one<00:03:26.100> swivels<00:03:26.459> on<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.880> groin<00:03:27.090> itself<00:03:27.450> this<00:03:27.840> one

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
one swivels on the groin itself this one

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.039 
one swivels on the groin itself this one
swivels<00:03:29.280> on<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.850> piece<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.630> rotates

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
swivels on that piece so that rotates

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.830 
swivels on that piece so that rotates
this<00:03:31.320> way<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.769> then<00:03:32.430> these<00:03:32.640> pieces<00:03:33.030> have<00:03:33.540> a

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
this way and then these pieces have a

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.530 
this way and then these pieces have a
hinge<00:03:34.380> joint<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:35.700> lets<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.090> leg<00:03:36.269> come

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
hinge joint that lets the leg come

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.630 
hinge joint that lets the leg come
forward<00:03:36.959> even<00:03:37.049> more<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:38.070> there's<00:03:38.400> really

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
forward even more so there's really

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.910 
forward even more so there's really
pretty<00:03:39.360> much<00:03:39.570> unlimited<00:03:39.870> articulation<00:03:40.799> in

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
pretty much unlimited articulation in

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.440 
pretty much unlimited articulation in
the<00:03:41.040> hip<00:03:41.250> however<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.790> want<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.030> get<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.299> to

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
the hip however you want to get that to

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.190 
the hip however you want to get that to
pose<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.930> can<00:03:43.200> do<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.130> will<00:03:44.220> work<00:03:44.280> okay

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
pose you can do it and it will work okay

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.900 
pose you can do it and it will work okay
the<00:03:46.200> knees<00:03:46.440> have<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.769> standard<00:03:47.310> hinge<00:03:47.549> joint

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
the knees have a standard hinge joint

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.990 
the knees have a standard hinge joint
and<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.720> swivel<00:03:49.140> at<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.920> bottom<00:03:50.310> at<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.700> top

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
and the swivel at the bottom at the top

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.729 
and the swivel at the bottom at the top
of<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.239> boot<00:03:51.420> there<00:03:51.660> at<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.230> bottom<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.620> the

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
of the boot there at the bottom of the

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.690 
of the boot there at the bottom of the
knee<00:03:52.860> joint<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.880> then<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.120> feet<00:03:54.390> have<00:03:54.810> a

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
knee joint and then the feet have a

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.250 
knee joint and then the feet have a
hinge<00:03:56.700> joint<00:03:56.790> similar<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.630> shoulder<00:03:58.019> it

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
hinge joint similar to the shoulder it

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.620 
hinge joint similar to the shoulder it
swivels<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.549> has<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.850> hinge<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.390> then

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
swivels and it has the hinge and then

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.509 
swivels and it has the hinge and then
it's<00:04:00.780> actually<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.320> swivel<00:04:01.860> at<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.040> bottom<00:04:02.370> as

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
it's actually a swivel at the bottom as

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.030 
it's actually a swivel at the bottom as
well<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.570> really<00:04:03.600> good<00:04:04.140> articulation<00:04:04.410> on<00:04:04.890> this

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
well so really good articulation on this

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.819 
well so really good articulation on this

easiest<00:04:15.930> thing<00:04:16.079> to<00:04:16.229> do<00:04:17.239> sometimes<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.630> goes<00:04:18.720> in

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
easiest thing to do sometimes it goes in

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.599 
easiest thing to do sometimes it goes in
like<00:04:19.140> that<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.500> wasn't<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:19.890> bad<00:04:20.070> but<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.400> might

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
like that it wasn't so bad but you might

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.009 
like that it wasn't so bad but you might
have<00:04:20.789> some<00:04:20.820> trouble<00:04:21.239> getting<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.690> even

have some trouble getting it and even

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.290 
have some trouble getting it and even
taking<00:04:22.229> that<00:04:22.380> off<00:04:22.740> just<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.880> can<00:04:24.030> kind<00:04:24.240> of

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
taking that off just you can kind of

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.180 
taking that off just you can kind of
flex<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.720> thumb<00:04:24.930> just<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:25.229> little<00:04:25.470> bit<00:04:25.620> and

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
flex the thumb just a little bit and

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.490

and<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.760> open<00:04:27.090> hand<00:04:27.330> goes<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.630> this<00:04:28.020> part<00:04:28.350> of

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
and the open hand goes to this part of

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.750 
and the open hand goes to this part of
the<00:04:28.590> hammer<00:04:29.100> right<00:04:29.910> there<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.710> can<00:04:31.920> play

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
the hammer right there so you can play

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.310 
the hammer right there so you can play
with<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:32.970> or<00:04:33.180> spin<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:33.960> around<00:04:34.050> do<00:04:34.260> whatever

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
you need to do to get the hand where it

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.660 
you need to do to get the hand where it
needs<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:35.940> be<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.870> does<00:04:37.080> reach<00:04:40.160> of<00:04:41.160> course<00:04:41.430> I'm

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
needs to be it does reach of course I'm

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.120 
needs to be it does reach of course I'm
not<00:04:42.000> gonna<00:04:42.180> be<00:04:42.240> able<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.390> do<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.600> on<00:04:42.690> camera<00:04:42.720> but

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.010 

it<00:04:47.130> does<00:04:47.340> work<00:04:50.030> if<00:04:51.030> I<00:04:51.210> can<00:04:51.390> do<00:04:51.510> it<00:04:51.540> there<00:04:51.810> we<00:04:51.900> go

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
it does work if I can do it there we go

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.470 
it does work if I can do it there we go
get<00:04:52.380> in<00:04:52.530> there<00:04:52.710> so<00:04:53.490> as<00:04:53.640> you<00:04:53.790> can<00:04:53.880> see<00:04:54.060> he<00:04:54.210> holds

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
get in there so as you can see he holds

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.450 
get in there so as you can see he holds
the<00:04:54.570> hammer<00:04:54.780> just<00:04:55.200> fine<00:04:55.500> once<00:04:56.160> you<00:04:56.250> get<00:04:56.370> the

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
the hammer just fine once you get the

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.680 
the hammer just fine once you get the
hammer<00:04:56.640> in<00:04:56.820> there<00:04:56.940> of<00:04:57.030> course<00:04:57.240> it<00:04:57.390> locks<00:04:57.540> his

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
hammer in there of course it locks his

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.530 
hammer in there of course it locks his
arms<00:04:57.960> in<00:04:58.080> place<00:04:58.260> for<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.500> most<00:04:58.680> part<00:04:59.040> since

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
arms in place for the most part since

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.910 
arms in place for the most part since
they're<00:05:00.540> both<00:05:00.660> connected<00:05:01.200> you<00:05:01.440> can<00:05:01.590> only<00:05:01.710> do

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
they're both connected you can only do

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.460 
they're both connected you can only do
so<00:05:01.950> much<00:05:02.160> with<00:05:02.310> it<00:05:02.520> but<00:05:02.670> it<00:05:03.180> still<00:05:04.020> is<00:05:04.170> a<00:05:04.200> great
