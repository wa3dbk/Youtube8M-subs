the board he's a very beautiful endgame
composition<00:00:15.859> the<00:00:17.270> idea<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.510> find<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.050> way

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
composition the idea is to find a way

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.259 
composition the idea is to find a way
for<00:00:19.230> white<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.650> win<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:21.830> we<00:00:22.830> see<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.310> past

for white to win and we see this past
born<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.720> b6<00:00:25.109> if<00:00:25.789> this<00:00:26.789> bone<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.210> promote<00:00:27.890> then

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
born on b6 if this bone can promote then

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.500 
born on b6 if this bone can promote then
the<00:00:29.070> ending<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:30.029> one<00:00:31.910> but<00:00:32.910> how<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> win<00:00:33.360> this

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the ending is is one but how to win this

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.729 
the ending is is one but how to win this
if<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.649> want<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.950> try<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.219> find<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.670> yourself

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
if you want to try to find it yourself

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.470 
if you want to try to find it yourself
pause<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> video<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> good<00:00:39.210> look<00:00:39.360> at

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
pause the video and have a good look at

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.340 
pause the video and have a good look at
the<00:00:39.600> position<00:00:40.430> maybe<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> good<00:00:41.820> idea<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
the position maybe it's a good idea to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.700 
the position maybe it's a good idea to
take<00:00:43.350> your<00:00:43.620> chess<00:00:44.370> set<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.469> set<00:00:46.469> up<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
take your chess set and set up the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.410 
take your chess set and set up the
position<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> board<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.940> move

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
position on the board so you can move

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.360 
position on the board so you can move
your<00:00:48.480> pieces<00:00:48.809> because<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:49.920> easy<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
your pieces because it's not easy to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.799 
your pieces because it's not easy to
find<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.059> solution<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.600> very

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
find this the solution is a very

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.229 
find this the solution is a very
beautiful<00:00:52.850> way<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.059> win<00:00:55.940> let's<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> look

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
beautiful way to win let's have a look

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.990 
beautiful way to win let's have a look
at<00:00:57.390> some<00:00:58.100> ideas<00:00:59.899> what<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.079> white<00:01:02.070> tries<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.670> win

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
at some ideas what if white tries to win

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.520 
at some ideas what if white tries to win
directly<00:01:03.719> reply<00:01:04.019> mv7<00:01:04.909> well<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.090> case<00:01:06.530> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
directly reply mv7 well in that case you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.820 
directly reply mv7 well in that case you
can<00:01:07.710> go<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> f1<00:01:08.340> check<00:01:08.640> if<00:01:09.420> King<00:01:10.170> goes<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.470> h2

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
can go to f1 check if King goes to h2

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.270 
can go to f1 check if King goes to h2
then<00:01:11.070> root<00:01:11.250> V<00:01:11.430> 1<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:13.619> pawn<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.920> stopped

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.450 

I'll<00:01:17.280> go<00:01:17.520> back<00:01:17.670> now<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.770> another<00:01:19.770> idea<00:01:20.189> could

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
I'll go back now and another idea could

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.679 
I'll go back now and another idea could
be<00:01:20.930> what<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.110> we<00:01:22.140> try<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:23.479> stop<00:01:24.619> this<00:01:25.619> rook<00:01:26.280> from

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
be what if we try to stop this rook from

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.890 
be what if we try to stop this rook from
coming<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.810> f1<00:01:28.140> by<00:01:28.320> playing<00:01:28.770> rook<00:01:29.490> e1<00:01:29.900> with

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
coming to f1 by playing rook e1 with

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.230 
coming to f1 by playing rook e1 with
white<00:01:31.280> well<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.460> case<00:01:32.520> there<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.030> another

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
white well in that case there is another

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.810 
white well in that case there is another
check<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.810> h6<00:01:34.590> if<00:01:34.829> King<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:36.000> goes<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.409> g1<00:01:37.820> rook

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
check on h6 if King then goes to g1 rook

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.319 
check on h6 if King then goes to g1 rook
h8<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:40.530> mb<00:01:40.890> 7<00:01:41.070> Ruby<00:01:41.820> 8<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.799> again<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:45.060> porn

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
h8 and if mb 7 Ruby 8 and again the porn

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.590 
h8 and if mb 7 Ruby 8 and again the porn
has<00:01:45.570> been<00:01:45.750> stopped

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.890 

so<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.130> solution<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:54.540> correct

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
so this is not a solution the correct

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.030 
so this is not a solution the correct
solution<00:01:55.790> for<00:01:56.790> white<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.440> very<00:01:58.770> beautiful

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
solution for white is a very beautiful

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.020 
solution for white is a very beautiful

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
to go to h6 then rook e8 a beautiful

move sacrifice in the rook if King takes

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.960 
move sacrifice in the rook if King takes
the<00:02:23.250> rope<00:02:23.400> then<00:02:23.970> be<00:02:24.180> seven<00:02:24.569> now<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.230> see<00:02:25.970> that

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
the rope then be seven now we see that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.330 
the rope then be seven now we see that
the<00:02:27.090> black<00:02:27.300> rook<00:02:28.250> cannot<00:02:29.600> go<00:02:30.600> anymore<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:32.220> be

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
the black rook cannot go anymore to be

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.300 
the black rook cannot go anymore to be
eight<00:02:32.519> because<00:02:33.000> his<00:02:33.870> own<00:02:34.050> king<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:34.800> blocking

eight because his own king is blocking
the<00:02:35.340> way<00:02:39.049> so<00:02:40.700> what<00:02:41.700> happens<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:42.150> if<00:02:43.130> i'll<00:02:44.130> go

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
the way so what happens then if i'll go

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.000 
the way so what happens then if i'll go
back<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.819> initial<00:02:44.970> position<00:02:45.769> it's<00:02:46.769> ok

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
back to the initial position it's ok

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.970 
back to the initial position it's ok
