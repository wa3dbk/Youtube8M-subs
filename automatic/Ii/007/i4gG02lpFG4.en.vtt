00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.470
 holiday decor is a special story 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.960
 when you think about every little thing 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.150
 make all the details you put your hands 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.189
 guests will feel their love as they 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.290
 happy and the holiday will succeed because 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.750
 the atmosphere in your party will be 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.910
 a unique translation waiting 10 lessons 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.890
 during which I will teach you to make decor 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.820
 for the sled beautiful day party 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.870
 of birth 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.760
 and our main assistant will be set 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.890
 before the thing with that kind of thing which 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.250
 called styler 5 days cartridges for 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.860
 we will begin to decorate our holiday 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.330
 from the walls we will devote the first lesson to creation 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.330
 a garland of flags 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.870
 first of all we will make a template from put 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.280
 cardboard in half and then draw another 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.479
 the base of the triangle will lie like 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.880
 there is no time on the cardboard fold line 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.760
 strict sizes and shapes it all depends 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.550
 of your taste 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.550
 cut out the pattern like me and unfold it 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.810
 circle the pattern on paper as many times 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.320
 how many pieces do you need for 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.320
 Garlands 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.450
 and 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.299
 now we fold our triangles 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.299
 decorating the garland will be easier if 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.190
 mark with a pencil what are you 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.410
 gonna draw 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.800
 the foundations for giants are almost done and now 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.330
 we will proceed to the most interesting 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.940
 the main secret of working with da vinci is not 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.470
 you need to be afraid of it the faster bolder 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.670
 your movements will be neater 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.670
 the decor will turn out 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.030
 do not forget that yes Vinci this paint and 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.550
 it is better not to apply it on the usual thin 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:17.820
 yes vinci paper is too heavy for her 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:20.160
 and you with cardboard work had time to decompose 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.590
 triangles in the order in which they are 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.690
 will hang larch 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.690
 asked mom for a strong canvas rope 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.820
 measure the required length 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.760
 fix the parts of our 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.450
 garlands will be using two-way 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.090
 scotch tape 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.530
 do not forget to put the rope 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.769
 repeat these simple steps with 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.620
 the remaining triangles 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.239
 controls the distance between them not 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.760
 hurry to fix the garland on the wall 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.129
 leaving the spoons lying in horizontal 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.260
 position on two or three nights da Vinci 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.040
 hardens and keep the shape that 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.040
 we gave him
