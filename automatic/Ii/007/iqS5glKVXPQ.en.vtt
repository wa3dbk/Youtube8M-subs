00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.980
 last part of the videos in which 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.310
 let's gather everything we have 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.010
 learned from connect us by shh and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.250
 download games for psp only 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.750
 we're going to have to put edit add and 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.760
 let's add the repo that I am 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.269
 leaving in the description that is idea 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.750
 point p 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.460
 pss pp point or heretic once 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.670
 we have downloaded simply we are going to 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.290
 have to search and we will write pss 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.370
 and automatically you should not be 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.829
 leaving all install that says pepe 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.719
 ssp df the stoneware as it appears to me in 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.100
 the palomita once you have this 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.510
 downloaded will not ask you to do 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.100
 about spring you're just going to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.649
 appear the application on this side 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.960
 let's grab the downloaded zip and you 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.210
 will leave what is an iso only 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.949
 we're going to have to go through ssh to 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.890
 our device we are going to select 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.659
 a route that you can remember remember that 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.479
 the route is appearing in the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.179
 from up here we are going to look for the folder 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.759
 in which the document is in my case 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.890
 is folder number 2 and here we have what 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.509
 which is the iso file to pass it to 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.420
 our device the only thing we have 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.459
 what to do is grab it from the name and 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.920
 drag it to this side and 

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.780
 automatically the file will start 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.450
 to move on to what is ours 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.250
 device this may take a while or 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.049
 It may not take long depending on your 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.289
 connection and the game that is downloaded 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.060
 so I see you when this is over 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.469
 now yes once this process is finished 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.209
 that in my case lasted almost half an hour 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.829
 we would only have to enter 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.319
 what is the application and is going to be put in 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.929
 LED mode that once this 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.270
 start application you'll find that it looks 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.390
 very but very stable now simply 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.610
 we would have to find the place where 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.200
 we leave what is ours once 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.469
 there we are simply going to have to touch 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.549
 our iso so that it starts 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.170
 automatically as you can see it goes to 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.659
 start loading 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.670
 music music can load without 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.130
 no problem you only need 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.610
 activate it and you do not know between cutting do not 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.720
 will change anything 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.670
 As you can see it starts automatically 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.590
 for copyright problems I can not 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.320
 leave the music but good simply 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.540
 let's hurry for it to start and as 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.580
 you can see load very very fast maybe 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.110
 on screen sometimes reflected like that 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.840
 you see a little luck but the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.250
 true the game runs very, very, very 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.380
 well in what is our device 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.570
 let's put what's the story for 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.130
 show you how you see yourself playing once 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.170
 start the story as you can see it 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.630
 run without any problem and this what 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.430
 I'm doing from an iphone 5 so 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.530
 if you have a superior iphone friend 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.570
 seve execute much better way 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.820
 we can go sailing we can go killing 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.310
 we can do whatever we want in this 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.740
 good game on my part that would be all 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.480
