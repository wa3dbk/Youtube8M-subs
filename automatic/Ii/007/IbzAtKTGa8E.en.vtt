00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.349
 The truth is that many teams have been 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.360
 many very important players in the 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.559
 that I have also learned a lot from 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.559
 they the archer 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.940
 my friend not that how good he is 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.470
 a childhood friend of we know them 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:31.430
 of three years and is called Alejandro and 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.880
 he was an archer until he was 14 years old 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.190
 after good the circumstances have 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.039
 fact that 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.530
 let each one follow through other paths 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.289
 I did not continue with the profession that today 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.019
 I have he has another profession yes in 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.449
 good defense of central I put it to 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:53.260
 roberto ayala I think for a group 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:55.920
 It was always important, not because 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.839
 later when when he was older 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.289
 from experience from what the 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.180
 he had lived because he was very much 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.290
 time in the Argentine national team and 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.310
 also in the best clubs of 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.110
 of Europe then the other central one 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.390
 I put cannavaro practically 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.080
 similar to the personality of 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.540
 ayala is not to those defenders with much 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.750
 character of the group being well 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.700
 in every sense not so much in the locker room 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.700
 as in the field of play 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.600
 they handled the motivation of the group 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.090
 also in a very special way 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.210
 lateral is good 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.649
 I put it to dani alves as well 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.159
 could have put zanetti not that 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:49.340
 good, not just fast 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.609
 defends good and good and attacking already 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.539
 we know what a player arrives 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:59.010
 much to the goal that can come together with the 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.070
 other strikers that 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.920
 you solve a lot of things the other 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.020
 lateral is juan floor link with also 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.160
 that at the time he had a lot of 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.160
 projection a lot 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.910
 that game how good that the laterals 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.460
 they had the laterals in Argentina 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.500
 long ago from the midfield good 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.930
 I put it to leonardo astrada 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.920
 the good player that I when I got to 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.660
 river with 15 years good both he and 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.120
 HernÃ¡n DÃ­az 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.680
 the good side that were in that 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.489
 moment 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.969
 were two people who also have not 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.700
 had as I told you not to take a 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:48.969
 15 year old boy to try to power 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.230
 put it in maximum activity after 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:56.870
 well I put it to aimar that good with 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.900
 Pablo Aimar is he just a friend 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.299
 as a player he was the player that best 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.299
 I understood football in all my 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.209
 race when we were on river yo 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.750
 I was 17 years old the good one takes me 2 years 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.750
 so 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.820
 I think the relationship started when he did not 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.650
 is from buenos aires then my family and 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.500
 I always take it to my house to 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.150
 that ate well so that it rested 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:29.170
 so good he had the attention that 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.019
 that he needed to have familiarly not 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.500
 after good ariel ortega that my idol 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.500
 soccer 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.310
 before playing in 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.240
 I had the opportunity to play with him 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.790
 I remember an anecdote that 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.970
 well the wine to my house came to eat and 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.470
 I still did not know that I was the idol 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.210
 and well I remember that it started 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.210
 show my house we went to my room 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.650
 and well he turned around and there was a 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.810
 poster of him 2 meters then we 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.959
 we are looking like saying 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.010
 xavi also good just get to 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.550
 Barcelona 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.860
 with 19 years 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.200
 good for me it was a totally world and 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.630
 I remember that good with xavi we already did 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.560
 a very big friendship from the 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.640
 beginning 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:29.800
 I had barely arrived before he offered me 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.979
 he opened the door of his family home 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.990
 to every achievement that he has ok to each 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.930
 good moment that he has for me is 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:43.490
 It is important because it has meant 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.070
 very much as a person for me after good 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.440
 I psyche 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.930
 I think that I do not have football 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.960
 to explain anything because good and 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.139
 and everyone in the world of football 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.860
 account not what not what can arrive 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:03.500
 to do what you have a 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.440
 particularity of not being a 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.780
 very very simple person 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.660
 to this day that I also maintain 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.050
 a very good relationship from the day that 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.370
 we crossed in Barcelona and this 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.950
 good frizzy curly 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.180
 for me as a forward 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.130
 It was 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.630
 the forward who more than better 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.330
 I understood no 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.870
 for his movement by 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.610
 because he looked like he smelled when 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.340
 was near the area or near the goal 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.610
 always he knew where he could get to fall 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:46.560
 the ball was always positioned in a 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.110
 way that's good that he always did 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.480
 be a lethal forward striker 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.620
 very difficult 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.830
 to stop so good for me curly 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:01.350
 also football forward 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.220
 spectacular so it's very very difficult 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:09.020
 not because he will only elect 11 among so many 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:12.600
 good that there was during this long 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:16.260
 process that I was in my career so 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.800
 good try to select those who 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.800
 better could
