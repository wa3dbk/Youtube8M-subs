 possibly the rain is less effective 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.600
 point of view of the volume of 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.479
 trailers are allowed to fish 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.899

 more days to get and one

 much lower fishing rate

 facebook says expensive with line is 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:03.879
 usually ocean cove searched in the ocean 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.760
 or fraide or is fish 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.790
 before reaching maturity when 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.020
 near the coast and enters the phase 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.170
 spawning 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.950
 it is an attractive country at the 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.700
 maximum of its period in the ocean 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.420
 just the salmon with the salmon 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.930
 real kim and the pink pink salmon are

 a competent fisherman attain a price 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.270
 the volume of the country captured in 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.160
 party with Iran is much lower than the

 facebook stayed with networks

 the salmon caught in line fishing 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.450
 normally corresponds to less than 5% of the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.270
 total fishing effort of all species of 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.870
 salmon in Alaska the amount produced 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.070
 is compensated with the quality of salmon
