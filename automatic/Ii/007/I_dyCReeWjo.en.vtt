smooth<00:00:15.680> I'd<00:00:16.250> say<00:00:16.580> it's<00:00:17.200> relatively<00:00:18.200> around

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
smooth I'd say it's relatively around

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.740 
smooth I'd say it's relatively around
the<00:00:18.680> 30<00:00:18.860> frames<00:00:19.190> a<00:00:19.369> second<00:00:19.730> mark<00:00:19.970> I<00:00:20.270> don't<00:00:20.660> know

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
the 30 frames a second mark I don't know

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.530 
the 30 frames a second mark I don't know
for<00:00:20.930> sure<00:00:20.960> i'm<00:00:21.200> just<00:00:21.380> guessing<00:00:21.890> here<00:00:22.540> that's

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
for sure i'm just guessing here that's

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.070 
for sure i'm just guessing here that's
what<00:00:23.660> it<00:00:23.750> feels<00:00:23.930> like<00:00:24.080> to<00:00:24.200> me<00:00:25.900> this<00:00:26.900> on<00:00:27.050> the

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
what it feels like to me this on the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.460 
what it feels like to me this on the
other<00:00:27.290> hand<00:00:27.439> is<00:00:27.619> pretty<00:00:27.890> damn<00:00:28.099> smooth<00:00:28.400> i<00:00:29.470> guess

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
other hand is pretty damn smooth i guess

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.580 
other hand is pretty damn smooth i guess
it<00:00:30.619> makes<00:00:30.770> sense<00:00:30.920> because<00:00:31.390> dead<00:00:32.390> trigger<00:00:32.690> runs

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
it makes sense because dead trigger runs

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.020 
it makes sense because dead trigger runs
pretty<00:00:33.800> damn<00:00:34.040> smooth<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:34.550> I'm<00:00:34.610> guessing<00:00:34.940> they

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
pretty damn smooth and I'm guessing they

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.689 
pretty damn smooth and I'm guessing they
use<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.390> same<00:00:35.420> 3d<00:00:36.160> libraries<00:00:37.160> or<00:00:37.340> whatever

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
use the same 3d libraries or whatever

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:51.880 
use the same 3d libraries or whatever
they<00:00:37.850> developed<00:00:50.140> so<00:00:51.140> here's<00:00:51.350> that<00:00:51.409> problem

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
they developed so here's that problem

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.530 
they developed so here's that problem
with<00:00:52.010> Amy<00:00:52.220> you<00:00:52.430> can<00:00:52.580> see<00:00:52.729> how<00:00:52.850> far<00:00:53.150> away<00:00:53.269> that

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540
