00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
things in here I mean you could use

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.450 
things in here I mean you could use
juice<00:01:59.909> wine<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:01.170> don't<00:02:01.290> want<00:02:01.530> all<00:02:01.740> juice<00:02:02.250> or

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
juice wine you don't want all juice or

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.789 
juice wine you don't want all juice or
all<00:02:02.610> one<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> could<00:02:03.270> be<00:02:03.600> part<00:02:03.930> part<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
all one but it could be part part of the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.149 
all one but it could be part part of the
liquid<00:02:05.159> that's<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.490> there

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
liquid that's in there

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.540 
liquid that's in there
one<00:02:06.340> cup<00:02:06.609> two<00:02:06.789> five<00:02:07.030> that's<00:02:07.719> right<00:02:08.080> yeah<00:02:08.709> and

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
one cup two five that's right yeah and

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.670 
one cup two five that's right yeah and
that's<00:02:09.700> why<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.119> takes<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.569> long<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.840> stir<00:02:11.440> it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
that's why it takes so long to stir it

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.710 
that's why it takes so long to stir it
