00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.260
 born here so to make a deminer 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.090
 you do not play the first two 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 causes that are greedy you play the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.210
 rope to put the 4th time 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.160
 your roof to the 2nd class at the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.860
 fifth string you're laying your finger at 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.140
 the third box and the sixth body 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.310
 place your finger the first box 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.100

 first no milk strings would delight the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.020
 rope is there for the damage one hesitates 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.580
 not the first rope to the second 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.040
 map you place your finger at the 2d 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.460

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.369
