00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.060 
us we're just going to do a general all
purpose<00:01:47.390> detailed<00:01:48.020> answer<00:01:48.350> because<00:01:48.860> that's

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
purpose detailed answer because that's

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.920 
purpose detailed answer because that's
what<00:01:49.190> this<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:49.370> now<00:01:50.330> what<00:01:50.480> I<00:01:50.510> like<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.810> do<00:01:50.900> is

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
what this is now what I like to do is

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.680 
what this is now what I like to do is
drag<00:01:51.230> it<00:01:51.409> over<00:01:51.500> everything<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.540> then<00:01:53.540> just

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
drag it over everything and then just

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.060 
drag it over everything and then just
subtract<00:01:54.110> out<00:01:54.290> of<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.409> areas<00:01:54.650> that<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.860> don't

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
subtract out of the areas that I don't

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.440 
subtract out of the areas that I don't
want<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.430> because<00:01:55.700> it's<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:56.120> little<00:01:56.360> bit

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
want it because it's a little bit

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.270 
want it because it's a little bit
quicker<00:01:56.659> for<00:01:56.870> me<00:01:56.930> than<00:01:57.140> trying<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.620> get<00:01:58.250> a

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
quicker for me than trying to get a

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.370 
quicker for me than trying to get a
perfect<00:01:58.550> mask<00:01:58.909> on<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.270> first<00:01:59.480> one<00:01:59.659> so<00:02:00.230> what<00:02:00.350> I

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
perfect mask on the first one so what I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.560 
perfect mask on the first one so what I
do<00:02:00.470> is<00:02:00.590> I<00:02:00.740> hold<00:02:00.920> alt<00:02:01.190> or<00:02:01.460> option<00:02:01.700> on<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.000> Mac<00:02:02.300> and

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
do is I hold alt or option on a Mac and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.980 
do is I hold alt or option on a Mac and
