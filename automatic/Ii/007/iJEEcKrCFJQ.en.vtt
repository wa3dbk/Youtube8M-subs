is that they're weak genes get passed on

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.310 
is that they're weak genes get passed on

so<00:06:08.930> yes<00:06:09.169> humans<00:06:09.650> are<00:06:10.009> still<00:06:10.430> only<00:06:10.699> in<00:06:11.000> their

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
so yes humans are still only in their

so yes humans are still only in their

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
infancy when it comes to evolution

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.219 
infancy when it comes to evolution
there's<00:06:13.789> a<00:06:13.909> lot<00:06:14.180> more<00:06:14.389> weird<00:06:14.690> and<00:06:14.900> wacky

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
there's a lot more weird and wacky

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.230 
there's a lot more weird and wacky
mutations<00:06:15.979> to<00:06:16.159> come<00:06:16.430> in<00:06:16.550> the<00:06:16.669> future

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.570 
mutations to come in the future
but<00:06:17.930> there's<00:06:18.110> one<00:06:18.289> thing<00:06:18.560> you<00:06:18.800> can<00:06:19.220> guarantee

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
but there's one thing you can guarantee

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.659 
but there's one thing you can guarantee
the<00:06:20.539> human<00:06:20.900> race<00:06:21.139> a<00:06:21.350> million<00:06:21.919> years<00:06:22.250> from<00:06:22.430> now

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
the human race a million years from now

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.029 
the human race a million years from now
will<00:06:23.210> look<00:06:23.240> remarkably<00:06:24.110> more<00:06:24.380> different<00:06:24.860> and

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
will look remarkably more different and

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.980 
will look remarkably more different and
function<00:06:25.729> in<00:06:25.849> completely<00:06:26.330> different<00:06:26.479> ways

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
function in completely different ways

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.010 
function in completely different ways
