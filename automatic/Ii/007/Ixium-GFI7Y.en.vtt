think of that one on 2 360 for something

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.190 
think of that one on 2 360 for something
with<00:03:41.040> sindri<00:03:41.489> is<00:03:41.610> that<00:03:41.880> she<00:03:42.209> can't<00:03:42.720> move<00:03:43.140> her

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
with sindri is that she can't move her

with sindri is that she can't move her
body<00:03:43.739> anymore<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:45.180> theory<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.940> owner

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
body anymore so theory is that the owner

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.750 
body anymore so theory is that the owner
of<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.630> body<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:49.110> fighting<00:03:49.470> back<00:03:49.709> cuz<00:03:50.610> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
of the body is fighting back cuz the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.000 
of the body is fighting back cuz the
shadow<00:03:51.060> has<00:03:51.510> its<00:03:51.720> own<00:03:51.870> will<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.470> does<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.799> body

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
shadow has its own will so does the body

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.640 
shadow has its own will so does the body
have<00:03:53.340> its<00:03:53.489> own<00:03:53.640> will<00:03:53.910> as<00:03:54.150> well<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.989> all<00:03:55.350> of<00:03:55.530> a
