hi<00:00:01.319> I'm<00:00:01.500> Mike<00:00:01.680> T<00:00:01.920> here<00:00:02.190> and<00:00:02.340> in<00:00:02.669> this<00:00:02.760> video<00:00:02.970> I'm

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
hi I'm Mike T here and in this video I'm

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.650 
hi I'm Mike T here and in this video I'm
going<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.080> review<00:00:04.500> how<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.920> connect<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.790> Arduino

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
going to review how to connect a Arduino

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.140 
going to review how to connect a Arduino
or<00:00:06.899> Arduino<00:00:07.799> compatible<00:00:08.599> to<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.900> Raspberry<00:00:10.650> Pi

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
or Arduino compatible to a Raspberry Pi

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.770 
or Arduino compatible to a Raspberry Pi
using<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.559> serial<00:00:13.559> interface<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:14.820> Rx

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
using the serial interface so just Rx

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.480 
using the serial interface so just Rx
and<00:00:16.080> TX<00:00:16.520> lines<00:00:18.770> for<00:00:19.770> this<00:00:19.890> video<00:00:20.279> I'll<00:00:20.460> be

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
and TX lines for this video I'll be

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.840 
and TX lines for this video I'll be
using<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:21.300> moti<00:00:21.930> no<00:00:22.220> here<00:00:23.220> which<00:00:23.580> has<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
using the moti no here which has the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.710 
using the moti no here which has the
built-in<00:00:24.420> RFM<00:00:25.789> 11b<00:00:27.470> radio<00:00:28.470> transceiver<00:00:28.859> and

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
built-in RFM 11b radio transceiver and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.709 
built-in RFM 11b radio transceiver and
also<00:00:30.769> conveniently<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.250> 3.3<00:00:33.000> volt<00:00:33.210> logic

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
also conveniently it's a 3.3 volt logic

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.510 
also conveniently it's a 3.3 volt logic
device<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.530> connect<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:34.890> directly<00:00:35.040> to

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
device so I can connect it directly to

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.420 
device so I can connect it directly to
the<00:00:35.640> Raspberry<00:00:36.420> Pi<00:00:36.500> if<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.739> were<00:00:37.890> using<00:00:38.070> an

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the Raspberry Pi if I were using an

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.569 
the Raspberry Pi if I were using an
Arduino<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.329> could<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.920> I'd<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.340> using

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
Arduino I could do that and I'd be using

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.560 
Arduino I could do that and I'd be using
the<00:00:42.090> Rx<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.989> TX<00:00:43.520> signals<00:00:44.520> down<00:00:44.700> here<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the Rx and TX signals down here in the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.190 
the Rx and TX signals down here in the
lower<00:00:46.020> right<00:00:46.530> corner<00:00:47.360> but<00:00:48.360> these<00:00:48.629> are<00:00:48.809> 5<00:00:48.989> volt

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
lower right corner but these are 5 volt

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.139 
lower right corner but these are 5 volt
signals<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.770> we'd<00:00:49.950> need<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.340> take<00:00:50.550> care<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
signals so we'd need to take care of a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.160 
signals so we'd need to take care of a
logic<00:00:51.600> level<00:00:52.039> translation<00:00:53.390> with<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> matino

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
logic level translation with the matino

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.060 
logic level translation with the matino
the<00:00:55.770> USB<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.340> not<00:00:56.670> built-in<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.829> also

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the USB is not built-in so I'm also

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.840 
the USB is not built-in so I'm also
using<00:00:59.250> this<00:01:00.350> FTDI<00:01:01.350> type<00:01:01.770> device<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.670> one

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
using this FTDI type device this one

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.750 
using this FTDI type device this one
happens<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.600> modern<00:01:03.930> devices<00:01:04.470> USB<00:01:05.220> bub

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
happens to be for modern devices USB bub

happens to be for modern devices USB bub
-<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:07.590> both<00:01:07.770> power<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.729> moti<00:01:09.600> no<00:01:09.780> and

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
- to both power up the moti no and

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.370 
- to both power up the moti no and
program<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.460> I'll<00:01:12.090> use<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.020> observe

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
program it and I'll use that to observe

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.490 
program it and I'll use that to observe
what's<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> serial<00:01:15.060> monitor

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
what's going on with the serial monitor

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.399 
what's going on with the serial monitor
so<00:01:16.500> I've<00:01:16.860> got<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> very<00:01:17.159> simple<00:01:17.549> sketch<00:01:18.409> swing

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
so I've got a very simple sketch swing

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.630 
so I've got a very simple sketch swing
the<00:01:19.530> camera<00:01:19.920> over<00:01:20.009> here<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.340> my<00:01:20.460> macbook

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
the camera over here to my macbook

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.060 
the camera over here to my macbook
alright<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.110> what<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.590> going<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.009> in

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
alright and what we can see going on in

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.789 
alright and what we can see going on in
this<00:01:26.310> very<00:01:26.610> simple<00:01:27.270> sketch<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.110> we're<00:01:28.710> gonna

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
this very simple sketch is we're gonna

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.080 
this very simple sketch is we're gonna
terminate<00:01:30.020> ASCII<00:01:31.020> input<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.189> line<00:01:32.820> feed

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
terminate ASCII input on a line feed

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.179 
terminate ASCII input on a line feed
character<00:01:33.689> will<00:01:34.320> read<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.860> hundred

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
character will read up to a hundred

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.520 
character will read up to a hundred
characters<00:01:35.729> maximum<00:01:36.360> put<00:01:36.990> those<00:01:37.140> into<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
characters maximum put those into a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.520 
characters maximum put those into a
buffer<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.880> we're<00:01:39.659> gonna<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.290> at

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
buffer and we're gonna do all that at

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.850 
buffer and we're gonna do all that at
115k<00:01:41.280> baud<00:01:41.840> which<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.170> default<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
115k baud which is the default on the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.670 
115k baud which is the default on the
Raspberry<00:01:44.280> Pi<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:46.110> that's<00:01:46.320> your<00:01:46.470> standard

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
Raspberry Pi so that's your standard

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.880 
Raspberry Pi so that's your standard
serial<00:01:47.250> begin<00:01:48.020> statement<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.439> setup

serial begin statement in the setup

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.960 
serial begin statement in the setup
function<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.700> then<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> loop<00:01:51.270> down<00:01:52.020> here

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
function and then in the loop down here

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.340 
function and then in the loop down here
we're<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.119> gonna<00:01:54.240> say<00:01:54.509> if<00:01:54.659> there's<00:01:54.899> data

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
we're just gonna say if there's data

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.889 
we're just gonna say if there's data
available<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> serial<00:01:56.820> port<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.360> we'll

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
available on the serial port and we'll

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.859 
available on the serial port and we'll
read<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.920> maximum<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.969> 100<00:02:00.360> characters

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
read it in a maximum of 100 characters

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.870 
read it in a maximum of 100 characters
or<00:02:01.200> line<00:02:01.590> feed<00:02:01.829> character<00:02:02.040> whichever<00:02:02.610> comes

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
or line feed character whichever comes

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.880 
or line feed character whichever comes
first<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.450> then<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.170> print<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.500> right<00:02:04.710> back

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
first and then just print it right back

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.169 
first and then just print it right back
to<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> serial<00:02:06.659> monitor<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.000> this

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
to the to the serial monitor and so this

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.170 
to the to the serial monitor and so this
will<00:02:09.360> illustrate<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:10.379> few<00:02:10.739> things<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.910> might

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
will illustrate a few things that might

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.240 
will illustrate a few things that might
not<00:02:12.390> be

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
not be

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.560 
not be
obvious<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:15.280> namely<00:02:16.280> I'll<00:02:16.610> just<00:02:16.820> mention

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.440 
signals the serial signals by default
are<00:02:30.110> active<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.610> what<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.790> means<00:02:32.120> on<00:02:32.330> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
are active and so what that means on the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.530 
are active and so what that means on the
PI<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:33.440> during<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.160> boot<00:02:34.340> up<00:02:34.490> sequence<00:02:35.000> at

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
PI is during the boot up sequence at

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.810 
PI is during the boot up sequence at
least<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.110> PI<00:02:36.320> all<00:02:37.010> those<00:02:37.310> boot<00:02:37.670> up

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
least on the PI all those boot up

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.900 
least on the PI all those boot up
messages<00:02:38.330> are<00:02:38.540> gonna<00:02:38.660> go<00:02:39.020> out<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.560> its<00:02:40.190> TX<00:02:40.580> port

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
messages are gonna go out of its TX port

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.660 
messages are gonna go out of its TX port
so<00:02:41.060> I've<00:02:41.150> got<00:02:41.300> that<00:02:41.450> yellow<00:02:41.750> wire<00:02:42.080> hooked<00:02:42.410> up

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
so I've got that yellow wire hooked up

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.030 
so I've got that yellow wire hooked up
to<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.790> multi<00:02:44.150> knows<00:02:44.420> RX<00:02:45.320> input

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
to the multi knows RX input

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.710 
to the multi knows RX input
I've<00:02:46.430> also<00:02:46.640> got<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.940> black<00:02:47.209> wire<00:02:47.480> in<00:02:47.630> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
I've also got a black wire in the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.050 
I've also got a black wire in the
background<00:02:48.140> here<00:02:48.380> as<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.500> ground<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.640> although

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
background here as a ground so although

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.270 
background here as a ground so although
I'm<00:02:50.300> powering<00:02:50.780> up<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.110> mo<00:02:51.260> t<00:02:51.410> know<00:02:51.590> from<00:02:52.040> the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
I'm powering up the mo t know from the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.930 
I'm powering up the mo t know from the
MacBook<00:02:53.650> it's<00:02:54.650> got<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.920> common<00:02:55.310> ground<00:02:55.580> with

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
MacBook it's got a common ground with

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.240 
MacBook it's got a common ground with
the<00:02:56.239> rasp<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:59.320> let's<00:03:00.320> go<00:03:00.470> ahead<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.709> power

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
the rasp I so let's go ahead and power

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.130 
the rasp I so let's go ahead and power
up<00:03:01.489> well<00:03:02.030> let's<00:03:02.209> first<00:03:02.450> go<00:03:02.690> ahead<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:02.959> swing

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
up well let's first go ahead and swing

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.890 
up well let's first go ahead and swing
over<00:03:03.410> here<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.840> turn<00:03:05.840> on<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.170> serial<00:03:06.500> monitor

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
over here and turn on the serial monitor

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.090 
over here and turn on the serial monitor
now<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.959> way<00:03:09.140> this<00:03:09.290> serial<00:03:09.709> monitor<00:03:09.860> is

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
now the way this serial monitor is

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.400 
now the way this serial monitor is
written<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.580> course<00:03:10.630> even<00:03:11.630> if<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:11.840> put<00:03:12.050> in<00:03:12.170> some

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
written of course even if I put in some

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.780 
written of course even if I put in some
characters<00:03:13.220> here<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:13.730> send<00:03:14.510> them<00:03:15.040> into<00:03:16.040> the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
characters here and send them into the

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.940 
characters here and send them into the
matino<00:03:17.390> they<00:03:17.630> will<00:03:17.750> immediately<00:03:17.959> get<00:03:18.470> echoed

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
matino they will immediately get echoed

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.850 
matino they will immediately get echoed
because<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.860> again<00:03:21.860> by<00:03:22.070> default<00:03:22.549> on<00:03:22.880> the

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
because the again by default on the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.900 
because the again by default on the
Latino<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:24.890> Arduino<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.570> RX<00:03:27.320> input<00:03:27.769> on<00:03:28.340> the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
Latino and Arduino the RX input on the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.229 
Latino and Arduino the RX input on the
i/o<00:03:29.450> pins<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:30.260> really<00:03:31.130> sort<00:03:31.400> of<00:03:31.489> conceptually

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
i/o pins is really sort of conceptually

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.759 
i/o pins is really sort of conceptually
in<00:03:32.630> parallel<00:03:33.170> with<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:35.290> serial<00:03:36.290> input<00:03:36.440> that's

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
in parallel with the serial input that's

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.890 
in parallel with the serial input that's
coming<00:03:37.100> over<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.430> USB<00:03:37.760> bus<00:03:38.209> okay<00:03:39.080> so<00:03:40.040> it's

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
coming over the USB bus okay so it's

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.580 
coming over the USB bus okay so it's
you're<00:03:41.900> really<00:03:42.079> gonna<00:03:42.200> think<00:03:42.440> twice

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
you're really gonna think twice

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.560 
you're really gonna think twice
sometimes<00:03:43.130> they<00:03:43.280> keep<00:03:43.459> track<00:03:43.730> of<00:03:43.940> what<00:03:44.299> all<00:03:44.480> is

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
sometimes they keep track of what all is

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.960 
sometimes they keep track of what all is
going<00:03:44.630> on<00:03:45.019> so<00:03:45.500> gonna<00:03:46.010> swing<00:03:46.280> over<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.640> here<00:03:46.820> for

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
going on so gonna swing over to here for

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.449 
going on so gonna swing over to here for
a<00:03:47.030> second<00:03:47.510> and<00:03:48.200> just<00:03:48.260> mention<00:03:48.709> this<00:03:49.220> other

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
a second and just mention this other

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.539 
a second and just mention this other
gadget<00:03:49.940> in<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.090> background<00:03:50.540> here<00:03:50.780> is<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:51.549> ATX

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
gadget in the background here is the ATX

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.970 
gadget in the background here is the ATX
rasp<00:03:52.880> I<00:03:53.090> power<00:03:53.480> button<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.110> I've<00:03:54.620> reviewed

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
rasp I power button and I've reviewed

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.830 
rasp I power button and I've reviewed
this<00:03:55.190> in<00:03:55.459> in<00:03:55.790> Prior<00:03:56.060> videos<00:03:56.269> but<00:03:56.630> I'll<00:03:56.720> go

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
this in in Prior videos but I'll go

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.449 
this in in Prior videos but I'll go
ahead<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.049> fire<00:03:57.230> that<00:03:57.410> up<00:03:57.470> that's<00:03:58.220> gonna

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
ahead and fire that up that's gonna

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.240 
ahead and fire that up that's gonna
launch<00:03:58.790> the<00:04:02.230> Raspberry<00:04:03.230> Pi<00:04:03.290> boot<00:04:03.890> up<00:04:04.040> sequence

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
launch the Raspberry Pi boot up sequence

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.449 
launch the Raspberry Pi boot up sequence
and<00:04:04.730> you<00:04:04.760> can<00:04:04.940> see<00:04:05.180> that<00:04:05.329> that<00:04:05.480> is<00:04:05.540> flowing

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
and you can see that that is flowing

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.430 
and you can see that that is flowing
right<00:04:07.459> out<00:04:07.640> that<00:04:07.850> TX<00:04:08.840> output<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.470> into<00:04:10.190> the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
right out that TX output and into the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.020 
right out that TX output and into the
into<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.650> moti<00:04:13.010> no<00:04:13.070> it's<00:04:13.310> also<00:04:13.489> showing<00:04:13.820> up

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
into the moti no it's also showing up

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.009 
into the moti no it's also showing up
here<00:04:14.209> my<00:04:14.360> HDMI<00:04:14.989> monitor<00:04:15.230> okay<00:04:16.040> so<00:04:16.940> it<00:04:17.720> gets<00:04:17.900> to

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
here my HDMI monitor okay so it gets to

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.539 
here my HDMI monitor okay so it gets to
a<00:04:18.079> certain<00:04:18.140> point<00:04:18.380> by<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:18.890> way<00:04:19.130> where<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.400> does

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
a certain point by the way where it does

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.120 
a certain point by the way where it does
shut<00:04:19.820> that<00:04:20.000> off<00:04:20.060> so<00:04:20.660> it<00:04:21.289> won't<00:04:21.349> continue<00:04:21.739> to

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
shut that off so it won't continue to

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.050 
shut that off so it won't continue to
help<00:04:22.310> with<00:04:22.490> that

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
help with that

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.640 
help with that
definitely<00:04:24.600> gets<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.990> certain<00:04:25.020> point<00:04:25.290> where

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
definitely gets to a certain point where

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.190 
definitely gets to a certain point where
that<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:26.100> does<00:04:26.280> get<00:04:26.430> shut<00:04:26.669> off<00:04:26.790> by<00:04:26.970> default

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
that that does get shut off by default

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.600 
that that does get shut off by default
but<00:04:28.200> here's<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.530> thing<00:04:28.740> if<00:04:28.980> you're<00:04:29.160> running<00:04:29.430> a

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
but here's the thing if you're running a

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
but here's the thing if you're running a

sketch in the Arduino or moti know that

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.629 
sketch in the Arduino or moti know that

would not necessarily want to see all
this<00:04:41.270> information<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.540> so<00:04:43.820> it<00:04:44.820> took<00:04:44.970> me<00:04:45.150> a

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
this information and so it took me a

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.940 
this information and so it took me a
little<00:04:45.360> bit<00:04:45.540> of<00:04:45.630> searching<00:04:46.050> but<00:04:46.410> I<00:04:46.440> found<00:04:46.710> a

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
little bit of searching but I found a

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.360 
little bit of searching but I found a
great<00:04:47.160> website<00:04:48.200> on<00:04:49.200> the<00:04:49.500> internet<00:04:49.889> here<00:04:50.160> with

pages here's talking about serial port
add-ons<00:05:13.530> he<00:05:13.800> gets<00:05:13.979> into<00:05:14.190> a<00:05:14.220> lot<00:05:14.340> of<00:05:14.400> hardware

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
add-ons he gets into a lot of hardware

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.969 
add-ons he gets into a lot of hardware
detail<00:05:15.270> which<00:05:15.510> is<00:05:15.660> great<00:05:15.930> so<00:05:16.530> if<00:05:16.560> you're<00:05:16.770> using

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
detail which is great so if you're using

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.850 
detail which is great so if you're using
an<00:05:17.160> rs-232<00:05:17.790> interface<00:05:18.630> you<00:05:19.470> know<00:05:19.500> that's<00:05:19.740> a

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
an rs-232 interface you know that's a

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.610 
an rs-232 interface you know that's a
much<00:05:20.040> higher<00:05:20.220> voltage<00:05:20.700> level<00:05:21.690> swing<00:05:22.260> so

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
much higher voltage level swing so

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.460 
much higher voltage level swing so
there's<00:05:22.830> adapter<00:05:23.400> modules<00:05:23.790> out<00:05:23.940> there<00:05:24.470> you

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
there's adapter modules out there you

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.409 
there's adapter modules out there you
must<00:05:25.650> have<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.950> be<00:05:26.130> concerned<00:05:26.490> about<00:05:26.610> 3.3

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
must have to be concerned about 3.3

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.270 
must have to be concerned about 3.3
volts<00:05:27.720> versus<00:05:28.110> 5<00:05:28.350> volts<00:05:28.710> and<00:05:28.800> so<00:05:28.979> on<00:05:29.070> so<00:05:29.190> he

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
volts versus 5 volts and so on so he

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.890 
volts versus 5 volts and so on so he
covers<00:05:29.550> a<00:05:29.610> lot<00:05:29.760> of<00:05:29.850> hardware<00:05:30.090> information

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
covers a lot of hardware information

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.140 
covers a lot of hardware information
very<00:05:31.560> useful<00:05:32.039> they<00:05:32.160> are<00:05:32.310> even<00:05:32.610> gives<00:05:32.789> you<00:05:32.880> some

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
very useful they are even gives you some

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.420 
very useful they are even gives you some

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
tips if you're shopping for a module

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.100 
tips if you're shopping for a module
with<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.580> kinds<00:05:35.970> of<00:05:36.060> things<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.330> look<00:05:36.479> for<00:05:36.750> and

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
with the kinds of things to look for and

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.779 
with the kinds of things to look for and
you<00:05:37.740> know<00:05:37.860> how<00:05:38.070> would<00:05:38.130> you<00:05:38.310> how<00:05:38.610> would<00:05:38.640> you

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
you know how would you how would you

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.880 
you know how would you how would you
actually<00:05:39.000> connect<00:05:39.510> it<00:05:39.630> electrically<00:05:40.289> to<00:05:40.440> the

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
actually connect it electrically to the

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.659 
actually connect it electrically to the
Raspberry<00:05:41.430> Pi<00:05:41.460> and<00:05:42.000> so<00:05:42.780> on<00:05:42.990> but<00:05:43.380> where<00:05:44.250> this

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
Raspberry Pi and so on but where this

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.980 
Raspberry Pi and so on but where this
page<00:05:45.450> really<00:05:45.900> saved<00:05:46.320> my<00:05:46.650> bacon<00:05:47.490> was<00:05:48.060> down<00:05:48.630> here

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
page really saved my bacon was down here

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.779 
page really saved my bacon was down here
where<00:05:49.169> we<00:05:49.200> talked<00:05:49.500> about<00:05:49.610> reconfiguring<00:05:50.610> the

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
where we talked about reconfiguring the

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.629 
where we talked about reconfiguring the
Raspberry<00:05:51.450> Pi<00:05:51.510> console<00:05:52.200> port<00:05:52.500> and<00:05:52.740> so<00:05:53.460> it's

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
Raspberry Pi console port and so it's

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.140 
Raspberry Pi console port and so it's
really<00:05:53.880> in<00:05:53.970> two<00:05:54.180> parts<00:05:55.160> so<00:05:56.160> this<00:05:56.340> an<00:05:56.580> it<00:05:56.820> tab

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
really in two parts so this an it tab

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.650 
really in two parts so this an it tab

this<00:06:01.500> is<00:06:01.560> the<00:06:01.740> main<00:06:02.070> one<00:06:02.310> that<00:06:02.490> you<00:06:02.639> pretty

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
this is the main one that you pretty

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.140 
this is the main one that you pretty
much<00:06:03.090> want<00:06:03.510> to<00:06:03.660> make<00:06:04.440> sure<00:06:04.470> that<00:06:04.919> you<00:06:05.130> do<00:06:06.000> this

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
much want to make sure that you do this

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.060 
much want to make sure that you do this
modification<00:06:06.960> because<00:06:07.139> it's<00:06:07.530> going<00:06:07.830> in<00:06:07.950> the

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
modification because it's going in the

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.940 
modification because it's going in the
other<00:06:08.250> direction<00:06:08.960> we<00:06:09.960> pause<00:06:10.229> for<00:06:10.260> a<00:06:10.620> second

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
other direction we pause for a second

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.469 
other direction we pause for a second
here<00:06:11.070> and<00:06:11.190> swing<00:06:11.400> over<00:06:11.580> to<00:06:11.700> make<00:06:11.910> this<00:06:12.060> clear

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
here and swing over to make this clear

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.390 
here and swing over to make this clear
so<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.200> RX<00:06:13.710> input<00:06:14.160> on<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:14.789> Raspberry<00:06:15.330> Pi<00:06:16.400> by

so the RX input on the Raspberry Pi by

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.120 
so the RX input on the Raspberry Pi by

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:37.009 
applications will be to have

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:40.899 
applications will be to have
the<00:06:37.300> Latino<00:06:38.300> as<00:06:38.539> a<00:06:38.569> radio<00:06:39.229> receiver<00:06:39.879> for<00:06:40.879> a

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909 
the Latino as a radio receiver for a

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:42.730 
the Latino as a radio receiver for a
bunch<00:06:41.240> of<00:06:41.360> remote<00:06:41.659> nodes<00:06:41.900> and<00:06:42.139> then<00:06:42.259> feeding

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
bunch of remote nodes and then feeding

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.609 
bunch of remote nodes and then feeding
data<00:06:43.039> you<00:06:43.520> know<00:06:43.639> into<00:06:44.089> the<00:06:44.270> pie<00:06:44.539> with<00:06:45.110> on<00:06:45.469> the

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:45.619 
data you know into the pie with on the

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:48.820 
data you know into the pie with on the
RX<00:06:46.430> input<00:06:46.819> here<00:06:47.029> so<00:06:47.869> we<00:06:48.229> need<00:06:48.409> to<00:06:48.529> make<00:06:48.800> sure

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
RX input here so we need to make sure

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.139 
RX input here so we need to make sure
that<00:06:49.279> those<00:06:50.199> data<00:06:51.199> aren't<00:06:52.009> trying<00:06:52.909> to<00:06:53.059> be

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:53.149 
that those data aren't trying to be

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:55.600 
that those data aren't trying to be
interpreted<00:06:53.629> as<00:06:53.749> commands<00:06:54.259> so<00:06:55.129> just<00:06:55.399> swing

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
interpreted as commands so just swing

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.179 
interpreted as commands so just swing
back<00:06:55.819> over<00:06:55.849> here<00:06:56.509> so<00:06:57.169> the<00:06:57.439> key<00:06:57.589> thing<00:06:57.860> to<00:06:57.889> do

00:06:58.179 --> 00:06:58.189 
back over here so the key thing to do

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:00.070 
back over here so the key thing to do
there<00:06:58.550> and<00:06:58.819> all<00:06:59.059> the<00:06:59.240> directions<00:06:59.659> are<00:06:59.779> on<00:06:59.809> this

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
there and all the directions are on this

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.079 
there and all the directions are on this
website<00:07:00.349> is<00:07:00.999> to<00:07:01.999> remove<00:07:02.800> or<00:07:03.800> remark<00:07:04.460> out<00:07:04.759> a

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:05.089 
website is to remove or remark out a

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:08.170 
website is to remove or remark out a
line<00:07:05.509> at<00:07:05.809> the<00:07:05.839> very<00:07:05.930> end<00:07:06.349> of<00:07:06.619> the<00:07:06.800> file<00:07:07.399> so

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
line at the very end of the file so

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.790 
line at the very end of the file so
that's<00:07:08.389> that's<00:07:08.659> critical<00:07:09.139> that<00:07:09.169> you<00:07:09.379> do<00:07:09.529> that

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 
that's that's critical that you do that

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.010 
that's that's critical that you do that
and<00:07:10.159> then<00:07:10.580> the<00:07:10.729> second<00:07:11.089> part<00:07:11.270> is<00:07:11.569> going<00:07:11.629> the

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
and then the second part is going the

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.809 
and then the second part is going the
other<00:07:12.050> direction<00:07:12.430> which<00:07:13.430> already

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:13.819 
other direction which already

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.499 
other direction which already
Illustrated<00:07:14.479> was<00:07:15.110> the<00:07:15.409> command<00:07:16.009> text<00:07:16.550> file<00:07:16.759> so

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:17.509 
Illustrated was the command text file so

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:19.600 
Illustrated was the command text file so
once<00:07:17.809> you<00:07:17.960> make<00:07:18.139> that<00:07:18.169> edit<00:07:18.740> and<00:07:18.919> remove<00:07:19.309> a

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:19.610 
once you make that edit and remove a

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.820 
once you make that edit and remove a
section<00:07:19.819> of<00:07:20.120> that<00:07:20.149> line<00:07:20.509> then<00:07:21.319> you'll<00:07:21.559> get

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.830 
section of that line then you'll get

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.379 
section of that line then you'll get
very<00:07:22.249> minimal<00:07:22.789> message<00:07:23.499> from<00:07:24.499> the<00:07:25.389> Raspberry

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:26.389 
very minimal message from the Raspberry

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.739 
very minimal message from the Raspberry
Pi<00:07:26.419> to<00:07:27.050> the<00:07:27.289> Arduino<00:07:28.089> during<00:07:29.089> boot<00:07:29.270> up<00:07:29.419> to<00:07:29.569> just

00:07:29.739 --> 00:07:29.749 
Pi to the Arduino during boot up to just

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:31.299 
Pi to the Arduino during boot up to just
be<00:07:29.870> one<00:07:30.080> line<00:07:30.259> of<00:07:30.439> text<00:07:30.469> it<00:07:30.830> says<00:07:30.979> hey<00:07:31.129> I'm

00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:31.309 
be one line of text it says hey I'm

00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:33.399 
be one line of text it says hey I'm
booting<00:07:31.639> up<00:07:31.789> and<00:07:32.059> then<00:07:32.569> like<00:07:32.839> well<00:07:33.050> has<00:07:33.139> one<00:07:33.289> of

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:33.409 
booting up and then like well has one of

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:34.929 
booting up and then like well has one of
powers<00:07:33.709> down<00:07:33.919> there's<00:07:34.370> another<00:07:34.610> one<00:07:34.819> that

00:07:34.929 --> 00:07:34.939 
powers down there's another one that

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:38.290 
powers down there's another one that
would<00:07:35.119> that<00:07:35.569> would<00:07:35.629> happen<00:07:36.169> there<00:07:36.379> so<00:07:36.999> I<00:07:37.999> hope

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:38.300 
would that would happen there so I hope

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.969 
would that would happen there so I hope
this<00:07:38.539> has<00:07:38.629> been<00:07:38.659> helpful<00:07:38.749> I'm<00:07:39.229> going<00:07:39.439> to<00:07:39.529> shoot

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:39.979 
this has been helpful I'm going to shoot

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:42.579 
this has been helpful I'm going to shoot
a<00:07:40.099> second<00:07:40.459> video<00:07:40.699> which<00:07:41.029> will<00:07:41.209> get<00:07:41.360> into<00:07:41.589> more

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:42.589 
a second video which will get into more

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:44.969 
a second video which will get into more
information<00:07:42.680> going<00:07:43.520> in<00:07:43.610> the<00:07:43.699> other<00:07:43.789> direction

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:44.979 
information going in the other direction

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:48.430
