00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.260
 hello everyone how are you welcome to 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.260
 the ahs 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.370
 I already remind you that we are about to 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.799
 next special and if you want to participate 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.560
 you just have to send a photo or video 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.050
 of your aquarium or fish and put 8000 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.640
 front so you can see it you can 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.609
 put so much in the comments of 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.869
 youtube like on facebook or twitter 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.169
 attaching the file in it 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.390
 comment or by putting a link to the video 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.380
 let's make a change of water while 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.510
 we answer some questions 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.609
 Alejandro QuiÃ±ones says 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.280
 hello jose I have a 100 liter aquarium 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:43.530
 with two scalars a harmless cyclic 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.350
 two bottles or two male and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.079
 female two moli and a beta would like to know 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.120
 if that amount is fine I already know that they are 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.710
 incompatible but not bad 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.500
 postdata thank you 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.899
 I love your videos in terms of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.519
 amount is a little fair especially 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.219
 if we take into account that the boats 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.110
 clown are quite demanding in that 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.360
 aspect I think the best you can 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.149
 to do is look for a separate site to 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.520
 the beta and from there if everyone is 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.409
 do not touch anything else and think 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.300
 always first in the boots to touch 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.159
 the aquarium since they are the most fish 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.249
 longevity 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.679
 jesus deer says hello I have a problem 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:24.840
 with my pond a few months ago 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.429
 He has children and I have not been able to cure them 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.229
 Well the worst thing is that I'm leaving 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:30.869
 dying several fish of good size of 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.549
 the koi race that you recommend me to do are 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.799
 like the ones you mention at the beginning of 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.349
 video avoid aquarium parasites and that 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.000
 fish poke if I tell you the truth never 

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:40.709
 I've tried a pond that's why 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.869
 I recommend an expert on the subject 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.119
 if you do not find it you will have to remove 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.069
 the parasites of the fish as they are 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.229
 says in the video that you comment with tweezers 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.719
 and healing the wound and then treating the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.789
 pond with potassium permanganate is 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.979
 very important the correct dosage 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.619
 so as not to kill the fish two grams 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.860
 at the most it is already a bit risky 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.289
 per 1000 liters can be less 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.079
 but no more and the aerator is necessary 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.390
 if you do not have a weight for this two 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.329
 grams are a quarter of a 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.099
 teaspoon small rasa of course the 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.069
 filter can not be in contact with 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.170
 this treatment is also important 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.180
 know that it is dangerous to contact with 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.000
 the skin the treatment should last 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.520
 up to eight or ten hours maximum 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.530
 watching the fish after this is 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.200
 makes a change of water and we go back to 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.030
 put the filter with activated carbon in 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.580
 if parasites reappear 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.410
 you will have to repeat the treatment if 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.050
 you find another type of medication 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.700
 against parasites that there are also is 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.380
 valid following your instructions 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.540
 generally none of these 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.460
 Medicines is compatible with prawns and 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.950
 crustaceans 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.380
 marko mont he tells us hello jose how 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.500
 are you gave me a hexagonal fish tank 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.600
 like 30 to 40 liters the truth is not 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
 I have measured there is some fish that can put 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.970
 or better I discard greetings from Mexico 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.350
 the problem of hexagonal fish tanks and 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.930
 all kinds of aquariums that are not 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.700
 rectangular is that the proportions do not 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.410
 they are good for the fish because the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.230
 only way they have room to 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.000
 swim is in the shape of a rectangle then 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.460
 It will also depend on the type of fish that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.580
 be since a scalar prefers height 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.230
 a pete prefers little depth and to 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.240
 your case and considering that they are 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.520
 few liters I think the beta is a 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.680
 good option or also a few tetra 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.100
 with some gambitas according to the water that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.280
 have 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.260
 tsokos and more says hello jose congratulations 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.330
 therefore subscribers I have a 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.160
 preguntilla I do if a winter 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.750
 it breaks my heater that something up 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.420
 that buy me another greetings from 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.860
 argentina thank you and if maybe many 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.020
 but in reality they should be 100,000 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.730
 when it breaks the heater and makes 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.280
 cold you have to get them out quickly from 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.830
 aquarium and put blankets around this one 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.420
 so that the temperature is maintained if 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.850
 we have to wait a few days until 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.880
 get another one and there are less than 25 degrees 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.710
 the fish will not survive posts like this 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.990
 you would have to get the heater or 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.360
 move the fish to another place with 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.550
 its correct temperature here we end 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.500
 with questions for today I feel sorry for 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.390
 all those who are not receiving 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.760
 answer since I have no more time 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.590
 to answer I hope you give it to me 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.989
 like the video you share in the 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.600
 social networks and see you in the next 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.630
 do not forget that video is very close to the 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.270
 special 8000 you finish and we can put 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.750
 your aquariums do not miss until then 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.750
 will hit
