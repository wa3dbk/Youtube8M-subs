a bit but eventually i hopped in a tank
and<00:00:56.940> was<00:00:57.120> able<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.719> commandeer<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.649> enemy

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and was able to commandeer this enemy

lav ad which is their mobile a a
platform<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:04.250> i<00:01:05.250> got<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> couple<00:01:06.330> nice<00:01:06.600> little

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
platform and i got a couple nice little

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.039 
platform and i got a couple nice little
streaks<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.729> Jeep<00:01:09.090> here<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.689> trying

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
streaks going this Jeep here was trying

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.710 
streaks going this Jeep here was trying
to<00:01:10.350> circumvent<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.520> checkpoint<00:01:11.760> flag<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
to circumvent the checkpoint flag and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.770 
to circumvent the checkpoint flag and
I'm<00:01:12.810> guessing<00:01:13.290> go<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.880> gas<00:01:15.119> station<00:01:15.150> flag

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
I'm guessing go to the gas station flag

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.539 
I'm guessing go to the gas station flag
but<00:01:16.140> thankfully<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> was<00:01:16.619> able<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.040> stop<00:01:17.369> them

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
but thankfully I was able to stop them

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.070 
but thankfully I was able to stop them
before<00:01:17.700> they<00:01:18.119> were<00:01:18.270> able<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.600> pull<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.049> off

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
before they were able to pull that off

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.100 
before they were able to pull that off
and<00:01:21.979> kind<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.159> giving<00:01:24.090> myself<00:01:24.240> these<00:01:24.720> goals

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and kind of giving myself these goals

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.520 
and kind of giving myself these goals
and<00:01:25.560> these<00:01:26.270> little<00:01:27.270> activities<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.259> while

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
and these little activities to do while

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469 
and these little activities to do while
playing<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:29.070> high<00:01:29.549> ticket<00:01:29.790> servers<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
playing on high ticket servers is a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.600 
playing on high ticket servers is a
great<00:01:30.689> way<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> pass<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.140> time<00:01:31.340> I'm<00:01:32.340> not<00:01:32.549> a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
great way to pass the time I'm not a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.490

because battlefield 3's destruction

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.270 
because battlefield 3's destruction
engine<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.900> such<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.619> know<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.040> play

for the game to end and
there's<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:05.880> really<00:02:06.030> much<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.310> you

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
there's not really much to do so you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.249 
there's not really much to do so you
know<00:02:08.429> giving<00:02:08.729> my<00:02:08.880> myself<00:02:09.360> these<00:02:09.750> little<00:02:10.020> goals

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
seeing how many flags I can cap in a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.840 
seeing how many flags I can cap in a
single<00:02:15.780> round<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.830> good<00:02:17.010> way<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.220> keep

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
single round it's a good way to keep

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.070 
single round it's a good way to keep
myself<00:02:18.140> nice<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:20.030> distracted<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.750> I

twice in one round which was kind of

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.770 
twice in one round which was kind of
nice<00:03:10.850> unfortunately<00:03:11.850> i<00:03:11.880> don't<00:03:12.000> have<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.630> end

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
of this match saved up just because my

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.250 
of this match saved up just because my
game<00:03:16.200> crashed<00:03:16.670> with<00:03:17.670> like<00:03:18.000> 50<00:03:18.630> tickets<00:03:18.870> left

in<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:20.160> round<00:03:20.340> which<00:03:20.670> was<00:03:20.850> kind<00:03:21.090> of

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
in the round which was kind of

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.530 
in the round which was kind of
frustrating<00:03:21.680> but<00:03:22.680> i<00:03:23.250> thought<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.239> guys<00:03:24.359> would

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
frustrating but i thought you guys would

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.729 
frustrating but i thought you guys would
enjoy<00:03:24.600> this<00:03:24.900> footage<00:03:25.109> anyway<00:03:25.350> because<00:03:25.590> i

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
enjoy this footage anyway because i

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.319 
enjoy this footage anyway because i
really<00:03:26.040> don't<00:03:26.250> put<00:03:26.430> up<00:03:26.549> too<00:03:26.730> much<00:03:26.850> vehicle

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
really don't put up too much vehicle

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.910 
really don't put up too much vehicle
gameplay<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:28.220> even<00:03:29.220> less<00:03:29.400> often<00:03:29.700> do<00:03:30.239> i<00:03:30.500> post<00:03:31.500> a

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
gameplay and even less often do i post a

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.180 
gameplay and even less often do i post a
a<00:03:32.100> gameplay<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.450> i<00:03:33.690> really<00:03:34.410> like<00:03:34.620> using<00:03:34.859> the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
a gameplay so i really like using the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.610 
a gameplay so i really like using the
mobile<00:03:35.640> AAA<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.420> battlefield<00:03:37.140> 3<00:03:37.200> it's

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
mobile AAA in battlefield 3 it's

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.520 
mobile AAA in battlefield 3 it's
something<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.280> I've<00:03:39.239> never<00:03:39.570> really<00:03:39.930> seen<00:03:40.200> in

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
something that I've never really seen in

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.699 
something that I've never really seen in
a<00:03:40.799> first-person<00:03:41.190> shooter<00:03:41.670> before<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.750> for

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
a first-person shooter before so for

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.470 
a first-person shooter before so for
that<00:03:43.799> reason<00:03:43.859> it's<00:03:44.340> kind<00:03:44.549> of<00:03:44.579> novel<00:03:44.850> but<00:03:45.269> also

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
that reason it's kind of novel but also

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.789 
that reason it's kind of novel but also
I<00:03:45.959> just<00:03:45.989> really<00:03:46.769> enjoy<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:49.019> process<00:03:49.320> of

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
I just really enjoy the process of

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.569 
I just really enjoy the process of
taking<00:03:50.130> out<00:03:50.430> taking<00:03:51.000> down<00:03:51.120> aircraft<00:03:51.420> and

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
taking out taking down aircraft and

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.940 
taking out taking down aircraft and
obviously<00:03:53.579> mobile<00:03:54.000> AAA<00:03:54.150> is<00:03:54.690> where<00:03:55.320> it's<00:03:55.500> at<00:03:55.650> if

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
obviously mobile AAA is where it's at if

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.440 
obviously mobile AAA is where it's at if
you<00:03:56.100> want<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.370> take<00:03:56.519> down<00:03:56.670> aircraft<00:03:56.970> on<00:03:57.420> a

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
you want to take down aircraft on a

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.259 
you want to take down aircraft on a
regular<00:03:57.720> basis<00:03:58.400> just<00:03:59.400> because<00:03:59.700> you<00:04:00.120> have<00:04:00.239> a

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
regular basis just because you have a

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.759 
regular basis just because you have a
limited<00:04:00.630> amount<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.959> stingers<00:04:01.410> when<00:04:01.620> you're

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
limited amount of stingers when you're

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.130 
limited amount of stingers when you're

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.780 
on the ground and you know hopping in an
aircraft<00:04:04.319> requires<00:04:04.980> that<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.280> have<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.579> good

aircraft requires that you have a good
pilot<00:04:06.060> or<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.690> yourself<00:04:06.930> are<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.560> good<00:04:08.130> pilot

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
pilot or you yourself are a good pilot

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.380 
pilot or you yourself are a good pilot
and<00:04:09.680> unfortunately<00:04:10.680> i'm<00:04:11.400> not<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.790> best<00:04:11.880> pilot

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
and unfortunately i'm not the best pilot

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.890 
and unfortunately i'm not the best pilot
in<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.510> world<00:04:12.750> and

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
in the world and

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.680 
in the world and
good<00:04:14.260> pilots<00:04:14.709> are<00:04:14.980> few<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.310> far<00:04:15.459> between<00:04:15.640> so<00:04:16.449> I

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
good pilots are few and far between so I

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.229 
good pilots are few and far between so I
like<00:04:17.470> taking<00:04:17.680> down<00:04:17.949> aircraft<00:04:18.220> without<00:04:18.609> having

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
like taking down aircraft without having

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.749 
like taking down aircraft without having
to<00:04:19.329> be<00:04:19.509> in<00:04:19.540> an<00:04:19.750> aircraft<00:04:19.930> myself<00:04:20.709> which<00:04:21.489> means

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 
to be in an aircraft myself which means

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.870 
to be in an aircraft myself which means
that<00:04:22.259> the<00:04:23.259> mobile<00:04:23.440> AAA<00:04:23.740> is<00:04:24.160> definitely<00:04:24.729> my

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
that the mobile AAA is definitely my

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.060 
that the mobile AAA is definitely my
best<00:04:25.060> choice<00:04:25.389> but<00:04:25.810> that's<00:04:26.139> it<00:04:26.440> hope<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:26.919> guys
