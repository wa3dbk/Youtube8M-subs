00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
like my hair color it's like darker at

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.190 
like my hair color it's like darker at
the<00:02:26.920> roots<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.490> then<00:02:27.640> goes<00:02:28.600> down<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:29.020> only

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
the roots and then goes down the only

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.809 
the roots and then goes down the only
difference<00:02:29.680> between<00:02:29.770> this<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.220> my<00:02:30.580> hair

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
difference between this and my hair

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.910 
difference between this and my hair
color<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.330> my<00:02:31.480> roots<00:02:31.690> are<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:32.170> little<00:02:32.709> bit

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
color is that my roots are a little bit

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
color is that my roots are a little bit
further<00:02:33.190> down<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:35.260> it's<00:02:35.950> really<00:02:36.220> soft<00:02:36.610> it's

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
further down but it's really soft it's

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.640 
further down but it's really soft it's
really<00:02:37.330> pretty<00:02:37.600> I<00:02:37.750> think<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.140> color<00:02:38.350> looks

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
really pretty I think this color looks

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.930 
really pretty I think this color looks
really<00:02:38.890> good<00:02:39.040> on<00:02:39.160> my<00:02:39.310> skin<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:41.709> cool<00:02:42.610> part

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.410 
about these these ways is this invisible
part<00:02:47.590> portion<00:02:47.830> see<00:02:48.190> how<00:02:48.310> deep<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.910> and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
part portion see how deep that is and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.410 
part portion see how deep that is and
how<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:51.040> know<00:02:51.160> like<00:02:51.370> long<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:51.850> far<00:02:52.000> back<00:02:52.239> it

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
how you know like long and far back it

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.479 
how you know like long and far back it
goes<00:02:52.450> but<00:02:53.050> I<00:02:53.080> will<00:02:53.440> say<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.190> got<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.459> be

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
goes but I will say that you got to be

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.070 
goes but I will say that you got to be
careful<00:02:54.790> when<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.209> get<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.600> because<00:02:55.930> the

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
careful when you get it because the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.370 
careful when you get it because the
color<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:57.010> party<00:02:57.970> didn't<00:02:58.930> really<00:02:59.200> match

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
color of the party didn't really match

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.009 
color of the party didn't really match
me<00:02:59.769> per<00:03:00.190> se<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.760> I've<00:03:01.180> seen<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> lot<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.750> ladies

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
me per se and I've seen a lot of ladies

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.720 
me per se and I've seen a lot of ladies
say<00:03:02.350> that<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.650> didn't<00:03:02.830> really<00:03:03.010> match<00:03:03.190> them<00:03:03.489> so

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
say that it didn't really match them so

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.309 
say that it didn't really match them so
I<00:03:03.760> went<00:03:04.060> ahead<00:03:04.120> with<00:03:04.420> some<00:03:04.569> concealer<00:03:04.989> and

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
I went ahead with some concealer and

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.250 
I went ahead with some concealer and
just<00:03:06.130> put<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.180> there<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.750> kind<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:08.050> make<00:03:08.230> it

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
just put it in there to kind of make it

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.280 
just put it in there to kind of make it
more<00:03:08.560> believable<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:10.209> you'll<00:03:10.569> see<00:03:10.750> here<00:03:11.140> at

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
more believable and you'll see here at

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.900 
more believable and you'll see here at
this<00:03:11.410> little<00:03:11.650> front<00:03:11.950> part<00:03:12.220> here<00:03:12.280> where<00:03:12.610> it's

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
this little front part here where it's

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.270 
this little front part here where it's
this<00:03:13.690> little<00:03:13.780> front<00:03:14.050> part<00:03:14.230> here<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:15.069> doesn't

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
this little front part here it doesn't

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.039 
this little front part here it doesn't
for<00:03:15.700> whatever<00:03:15.850> reason<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.420> doesn't<00:03:16.570> go<00:03:16.810> all

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
for whatever reason it doesn't go all

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.660 
for whatever reason it doesn't go all
the<00:03:17.230> way<00:03:17.260> so<00:03:17.410> I<00:03:17.620> had<00:03:17.829> to<00:03:17.920> like<00:03:18.070> kind<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.340> paint

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
the way so I had to like kind of paint

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.000 
the way so I had to like kind of paint
over<00:03:18.880> that<00:03:19.060> as<00:03:19.329> well<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.720> make<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.900> look<00:03:20.200> all

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
over that as well to make it look all

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.460 
over that as well to make it look all
the<00:03:21.340> way<00:03:21.459> through<00:03:21.820> I'm<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.750> if<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:22.959> see<00:03:23.200> like

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
the way through I'm and if you see like

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.850 
the way through I'm and if you see like
it<00:03:23.980> has<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.730> end<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.780> lace<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.290> then<00:03:26.739> it

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
it has the end of the lace and then it

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.830 
it has the end of the lace and then it
has<00:03:27.010> hairs<00:03:27.310> out<00:03:27.519> under<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.269> so<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.510> makes<00:03:28.720> it

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
has hairs out under it so it makes it

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.949 
has hairs out under it so it makes it
look<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:29.709> lot<00:03:30.400> more<00:03:30.579> natural<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:31.299> think<00:03:31.570> how<00:03:31.750> they

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
look a lot more natural I think how they

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.130 
look a lot more natural I think how they
structured<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.829> it<00:03:33.400> comes<00:03:33.610> with<00:03:33.959> comb<00:03:34.959> in<00:03:35.079> the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
structured it it comes with comb in the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.310 
structured it it comes with comb in the
back<00:03:35.430> clothes<00:03:36.430> in<00:03:36.579> the<00:03:36.670> Front's<00:03:37.320> adjustable

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
back clothes in the Front's adjustable

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.920 
back clothes in the Front's adjustable
straps<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:39.250> even<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.360> could<00:03:40.510> probably<00:03:40.690> wear

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
straps and even you could probably wear

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.660 
straps and even you could probably wear
this<00:03:40.989> one<00:03:41.260> up<00:03:41.350> in<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.560> ponytail<00:03:41.890> because<00:03:42.400> even

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
this one up in a ponytail because even

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.220 
this one up in a ponytail because even
in<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.880> back<00:03:43.090> it's<00:03:43.329> not<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.540> full<00:03:43.780> lace<00:03:43.989> prom

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
in the back it's not a full lace prom

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.289 
in the back it's not a full lace prom
but<00:03:44.350> in<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.530> back<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.950> has<00:03:45.160> hairs<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.150> go

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.560 
but in the back it has hairs that go
down<00:03:46.510> so<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:46.870> could<00:03:47.200> certainly<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:49.209> know<00:03:49.329> put
