00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.119 
that this is open to your fingers you
also<00:02:40.920> could<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:42.299> you<00:02:42.840> wanted<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.590> could<00:02:43.799> sew

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
also could if you wanted you could sew

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.900 
also could if you wanted you could sew
this<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:45.180> here<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.859> glue<00:02:47.069> gun<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.730> as

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
this on here but the glue gun is just as

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.710 
this on here but the glue gun is just as
easy<00:02:48.060> or<00:02:48.420> as<00:02:48.590> easier<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.329> think<00:02:51.329> it<00:02:51.450> holds

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
easy or as easier and I think it holds

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.620 
easy or as easier and I think it holds
good<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.230> that's<00:02:53.190> how<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.340> do<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.850> then<00:02:54.389> if

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
good so that's how I do it and then if

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.780
