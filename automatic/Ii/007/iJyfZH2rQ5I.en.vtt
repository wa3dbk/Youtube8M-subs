00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.500 
under wraps but I was quite happy to not
know<00:02:09.560> too<00:02:09.619> much<00:02:09.979> about<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.369> project<00:02:10.550> because

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
know too much about the project because

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.150 
know too much about the project because
I<00:02:11.540> thought<00:02:11.720> be<00:02:11.870> exciting<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.560> less<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:12.920> knew

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
I thought be exciting the less I knew

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.610 
I thought be exciting the less I knew
the<00:02:13.700> more<00:02:13.880> were<00:02:14.030> surprising<00:02:14.569> with<00:02:14.690> being<00:02:14.930> in

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
the more were surprising with being in

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.400 
the more were surprising with being in
the<00:02:15.830> challenges<00:02:16.370> first<00:02:16.610> of<00:02:16.730> all<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.450> go

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the challenges first of all to just go

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.400 
the challenges first of all to just go
through<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.770> whole<00:02:18.800> score<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:19.370> see<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.790> try

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
through the whole score and see you try

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.530 
through the whole score and see you try
transfer<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> notes<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.400> detox<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.090> see<00:02:22.480> if

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
transfer the notes to detox and see if

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.120 
transfer the notes to detox and see if
it<00:02:22.660> was<00:02:22.840> actually<00:02:23.080> possible<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.710> get<00:02:23.950> through

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
it was actually possible to get through

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.720 
it was actually possible to get through
the<00:02:24.280> whole<00:02:24.400> thing<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.320> know<00:02:26.560> we<00:02:26.770> worked<00:02:27.490> on

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
the whole thing so you know we worked on

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.580 
the whole thing so you know we worked on
it<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.200> then<00:02:29.200> we<00:02:29.380> started<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.430> know

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
it and then we started you know

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.410 
it and then we started you know
dividing<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.620> notes<00:02:33.100> into<00:02:33.430> each<00:02:33.760> guitar<00:02:33.910> and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
dividing the notes into each guitar and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.330 
dividing the notes into each guitar and
figure<00:02:35.140> out<00:02:35.200> we<00:02:35.470> could<00:02:35.620> play<00:02:35.800> what<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.190> know

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
figure out we could play what you know

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.250 
figure out we could play what you know
the<00:02:36.970> classic<00:02:37.360> guitar<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.780> mathlete<00:02:38.110> are

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
the classic guitar and the mathlete are

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.420 
the classic guitar and the mathlete are
very<00:02:38.560> different<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.860> think<00:02:41.860> we<00:02:42.100> figure<00:02:42.400> out

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
very different so I think we figure out

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.270 
very different so I think we figure out
a<00:02:42.580> way<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:43.780> know<00:02:43.900> emphasize<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.860> American

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
a way to you know emphasize the American

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.100 
a way to you know emphasize the American
guitar<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.820> also<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.180> classroom<00:02:46.570> tour<00:02:46.840> and

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
guitar and also the classroom tour and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.260 
guitar and also the classroom tour and
use<00:02:47.830> all<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.220> different<00:02:48.340> techniques<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.060> of

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
use all the different techniques and of

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.930 
use all the different techniques and of
course<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:50.220> bringing<00:02:51.220> up<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.490> essence<00:02:51.850> of

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
course and bringing up the essence of

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.090 
course and bringing up the essence of
the<00:02:52.060> music<00:02:52.180> what's<00:02:52.960> really<00:02:53.320> important<00:02:53.830> to

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
the music what's really important to

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.360 
the music what's really important to
remember<00:02:54.310> when<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.860> whenever<00:02:56.860> I've<00:02:57.100> worked

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
Thomas while he was as much up the idea

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.790 
Thomas while he was as much up the idea
of<00:03:27.370> keeping<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.880> as<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:27.970> whole<00:03:28.240> performance<00:03:28.800> as
