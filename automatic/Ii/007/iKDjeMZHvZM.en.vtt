00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
years and honestly there's just nothing

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.070 
years and honestly there's just nothing
that<00:00:25.800> sounds<00:00:26.220> quite<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:27.060> there<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> lot<00:00:27.930> of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
that sounds quite like on there a lot of

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.439 
that sounds quite like on there a lot of
them<00:00:28.199> still<00:00:28.470> floating<00:00:28.830> around<00:00:29.070> these<00:00:30.060> horns

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
them still floating around these horns

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.330 
them still floating around these horns
are<00:00:30.630> not<00:00:30.779> without<00:00:30.960> their<00:00:31.380> quirks<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:32.040> course

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
are not without their quirks of course

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.240 
are not without their quirks of course
so<00:00:32.730> they<00:00:33.540> are<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.989> find<00:00:34.320> them<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.770> little

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
so they are I find them to be a little

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.600 
so they are I find them to be a little
bit<00:00:35.520> resistant<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.480> blowing<00:00:37.260> sometimes<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
bit resistant and blowing sometimes and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.530 
bit resistant and blowing sometimes and
the<00:00:38.969> intonation<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.140> little<00:00:40.829> uneven

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
the intonation is a little uneven

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.319 
the intonation is a little uneven
between<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.690> registers<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:44.010> man<00:00:44.340> nothing

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
between the registers but man nothing

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.260 
between the registers but man nothing
sounds<00:00:45.570> like<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> con<00:00:46.460> today<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.210> to

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
it's a very good one but now let's make

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.589 
it's a very good one but now let's make
it<00:02:28.629> better<00:02:28.840> now<00:02:29.680> contrary<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:31.060> what<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:31.450> may
