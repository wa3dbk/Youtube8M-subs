00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
always our biggest concern was was

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.370 
always our biggest concern was was
making<00:00:20.789> sure<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.240> had<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.779> halo<00:00:22.140> vibe

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
making sure that we had the halo vibe

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.290 
making sure that we had the halo vibe
down<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.160> lure<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.400> really<00:00:23.760> deep<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.179> rich

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
down the lure is really deep and rich

down the lure is really deep and rich
has<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> lot<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.750> units<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.380> can<00:00:25.500> play<00:00:25.679> with

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
has a lot of units that we can play with

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.560 
has a lot of units that we can play with
which<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.189> great<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.429> a<00:00:26.609> strategy<00:00:27.060> game<00:00:27.179> we

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
which is great for a strategy game we

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.880 
which is great for a strategy game we
found<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> covenants<00:00:28.259> be<00:00:28.320> pretty<00:00:28.590> fooled

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
found the covenants be pretty fooled

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.009 
found the covenants be pretty fooled
that<00:00:29.310> they<00:00:29.429> generally<00:00:29.789> had<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> good<00:00:30.269> array<00:00:30.990> of

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that they generally had a good array of

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.470 
that they generally had a good array of
vehicles<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> could<00:00:31.859> already<00:00:32.009> fight<00:00:32.480> we

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
vehicles that you could already fight we

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.060 
vehicles that you could already fight we
looked<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.839> UNSC<00:00:34.290> they<00:00:34.470> had<00:00:34.589> Master<00:00:34.890> Chief

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
looked at the UNSC they had Master Chief

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.920 
looked at the UNSC they had Master Chief
if<00:00:35.699> people<00:00:35.970> have<00:00:36.059> played<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.390> halo<00:00:36.510> shooter

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
if people have played the halo shooter

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.990 
if people have played the halo shooter
games<00:00:37.229> are<00:00:37.409> familiar<00:00:37.769> with<00:00:37.799> Master<00:00:38.220> Chief<00:00:38.430> but

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
games are familiar with Master Chief but

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.969 
games are familiar with Master Chief but
in<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.540> strategy<00:00:39.839> game<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.379> about<00:00:40.559> multiple

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:40.979 
in a strategy game it's about multiple

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:42.770 
in a strategy game it's about multiple
units<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.909> actually<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.269> to<00:00:42.330> fill<00:00:42.570> in

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
units so we actually have to fill in

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.570 
units so we actually have to fill in
quite<00:00:43.049> a<00:00:43.080> little<00:00:43.379> bit<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.739> UNSC<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.369> order

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
quite a little bit for the UNSC in order

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.280 
quite a little bit for the UNSC in order
to<00:00:44.729> make<00:00:45.269> them<00:00:45.570> feel<00:00:45.900> like<00:00:46.019> a<00:00:46.080> complete<00:00:46.530> army

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
to make them feel like a complete army

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.229 
to make them feel like a complete army
halo<00:00:49.290> wars<00:00:49.470> is<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.040> next<00:00:50.309> halo<00:00:50.580> game<00:00:50.790> but<00:00:51.119> it's

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
halo wars is the next halo game but it's

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.880 
halo wars is the next halo game but it's
a<00:00:51.299> prequel<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.290> from<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> game<00:00:52.680> design

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
a prequel so from a game design

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.229 
a prequel so from a game design
standpoint<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.369> was<00:00:53.460> challenging<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.940> go<00:00:54.059> back

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
standpoint it was challenging to go back

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.149 
standpoint it was challenging to go back
and<00:00:54.269> create<00:00:54.659> units<00:00:55.290> that<00:00:55.830> felt

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
and create units that felt

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.490 
and create units that felt
technologically<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:57.720> milieu<00:00:58.110> of<00:00:58.140> what

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
technologically in the milieu of what

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.840 
technologically in the milieu of what
sunday<00:00:58.769> would<00:00:58.860> have<00:00:58.979> had<00:00:59.070> 20<00:00:59.369> years<00:00:59.549> earlier

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
sunday would have had 20 years earlier

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.060 
sunday would have had 20 years earlier
so<00:01:00.839> when<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.110> best<00:01:01.170> examples<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.769> have<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.040> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
so when the best examples we have is a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.250 
so when the best examples we have is a
cyclops<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.030> cyclops<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.689> this<00:01:03.839> new<00:01:03.989> unit

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
cyclops the cyclops is this new unit

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.990 
cyclops the cyclops is this new unit
that<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.470> added<00:01:04.680> he's<00:01:05.129> almost<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.700> big

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
that we added he's almost like a big

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.410 
that we added he's almost like a big
giant<00:01:06.270> robot<00:01:07.189> it's<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.280> cool<00:01:08.460> unit<00:01:08.850> because<00:01:09.149> he

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
giant robot it's a cool unit because he

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.510 
giant robot it's a cool unit because he
can<00:01:09.570> repair<00:01:09.899> other<00:01:10.079> stuff<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.770> he<00:01:10.859> he<00:01:11.310> throws

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
can repair other stuff and he he throws

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.340 
can repair other stuff and he he throws
things<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> battlefield<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.079> pick<00:01:13.229> up

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
things on the battlefield we can pick up

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.349 
things on the battlefield we can pick up
stuff<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.740> throw<00:01:14.009> it<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.369> very<00:01:14.490> clunky<00:01:14.820> 20

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 
stuff and throw it it's very clunky 20

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:16.760 
stuff and throw it it's very clunky 20
years<00:01:15.570> before<00:01:15.899> halo<00:01:16.079> 1<00:01:16.289> this<00:01:16.469> thing<00:01:16.649> was

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
years before halo 1 this thing was

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.620 
years before halo 1 this thing was
awesome<00:01:16.859> because<00:01:17.549> red<00:01:17.820> court<00:01:18.030> could<00:01:18.179> rip

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
awesome because red court could rip

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.660 
awesome because red court could rip
chunks<00:01:18.869> off<00:01:19.109> of<00:01:19.289> vehicles<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.890> all<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.130> but

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
chunks off of vehicles and all that but

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.969 
chunks off of vehicles and all that but
it<00:01:20.789> was<00:01:20.880> too<00:01:21.030> bulky<00:01:21.329> too<00:01:21.749> unwieldy<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.530> so

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
it was too bulky too unwieldy and so

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.649 
it was too bulky too unwieldy and so
eventually<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.549> was<00:01:23.640> abandoned<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.329> favor<00:01:24.539> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
eventually it was abandoned in favor of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.270 
eventually it was abandoned in favor of
this<00:01:24.990> partner

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.030 

a<00:01:34.610> definite<00:01:35.610> feeling<00:01:35.880> when<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.240> Spartans

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040

a definite feeling when the Spartans
show<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> first<00:01:38.790> time<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.180> the
