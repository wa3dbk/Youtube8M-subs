is what I mean with no notation of a
background<00:03:04.350> from<00:03:04.560> Nala<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.400> assume

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
background from Nala you can assume

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.180 
background from Nala you can assume
pretty<00:03:06.030> much<00:03:06.210> anything<00:03:06.660> what<00:03:07.380> what<00:03:07.680> happened

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
pretty much anything what what happened

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.070 
pretty much anything what what happened
to<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.430> dad<00:03:08.640> did<00:03:09.450> he<00:03:09.540> run<00:03:09.720> away

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
to the dad did he run away

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.950 
to the dad did he run away
was<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.560> one-night<00:03:11.040> stand<00:03:11.070> what<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.270> blast

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
was it a one-night stand what a blast

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.140 
was it a one-night stand what a blast
well<00:03:13.620> for<00:03:13.800> what<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:13.950> know<00:03:14.070> about<00:03:14.310> lions<00:03:14.940> it's

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
well for what I know about lions it's

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.910 
well for what I know about lions it's
that<00:03:15.330> it's<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.660> dominant<00:03:15.930> male<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.680> pride

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
that it's the dominant male in the pride

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.770 
that it's the dominant male in the pride
that<00:03:16.950> gets<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.490> mate<00:03:17.640> with<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.910> lionesses<00:03:18.570> and

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
that gets to mate with the lionesses and

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.830 
that gets to mate with the lionesses and
well<00:03:19.440> quite<00:03:20.070> obviously<00:03:20.610> because<00:03:21.120> he<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.630> the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
well quite obviously because he is the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.020 
well quite obviously because he is the
king<00:03:22.050> Mufasa<00:03:22.680> would<00:03:22.980> be<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.250> dominant<00:03:23.580> male

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
king Mufasa would be the dominant male

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.880 
king Mufasa would be the dominant male
so<00:03:24.330> if<00:03:24.420> Disney's<00:03:24.810> following<00:03:25.260> these<00:03:25.380> facts

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
so if Disney's following these facts

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.040 
so if Disney's following these facts
that<00:03:26.040> Mufasa<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.239> guy<00:03:27.390> who<00:03:27.450> mates<00:03:27.870> with

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
that Mufasa is the guy who mates with

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.500 
that Mufasa is the guy who mates with
the<00:03:28.170> lionesses<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:29.070> would<00:03:29.280> make<00:03:29.550> Nala<00:03:30.030> his

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
the lionesses that would make Nala his

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.870 
the lionesses that would make Nala his
cub<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.650> would<00:03:31.830> make<00:03:31.950> Mufasa<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.610> father

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
cub so that would make Mufasa the father

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.050 
cub so that would make Mufasa the father
of<00:03:33.180> Nala<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.930> Simba<00:03:34.650> but<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.160> don't<00:03:35.580> fucking

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
of Nala and Simba but I don't fucking

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.240 
of Nala and Simba but I don't fucking
know<00:03:36.239> I'm<00:03:36.480> just<00:03:36.720> guessing<00:03:37.170> at<00:03:37.350> this<00:03:37.500> point<00:03:37.860> but

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
know I'm just guessing at this point but

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.010 
know I'm just guessing at this point but
let's<00:03:38.489> face<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.760> if<00:03:39.120> she<00:03:39.330> was<00:03:39.480> gonna<00:03:39.570> have<00:03:39.840> any

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
let's face it if she was gonna have any

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.720 
let's face it if she was gonna have any
overtone<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.709> fur<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.040> would<00:03:41.220> make<00:03:41.400> her<00:03:41.580> an

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
overtone of fur that would make her an

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.300 
overtone of fur that would make her an
outsider<00:03:42.270> and<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.930> only<00:03:43.080> male<00:03:43.530> on<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:43.920> pride

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
outsider and the only male on the pride

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.580 
outsider and the only male on the pride
who<00:03:44.520> has<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.000> tone<00:03:45.209> of<00:03:45.390> an<00:03:45.480> outsider<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.230> scar

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
who has the tone of an outsider is scar

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.800 
who has the tone of an outsider is scar
but<00:03:47.220> then<00:03:47.400> again<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:47.790> seriously<00:03:48.270> doubt<00:03:48.600> that

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
but then again I seriously doubt that

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.780 
but then again I seriously doubt that
scar<00:03:49.110> would<00:03:49.350> get<00:03:49.620> any<00:03:49.800> action<00:03:50.100> let<00:03:50.520> alone

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
scar would get any action let alone

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.590 
scar would get any action let alone
knock<00:03:51.180> up<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.480> lioness<00:03:51.959> yeah<00:03:52.730> weird<00:03:53.730> okay<00:03:54.540> so

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
knock up a lioness yeah weird okay so

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.479 
knock up a lioness yeah weird okay so
we've<00:03:54.900> out<00:03:55.050> ruled<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.470> possibility<00:03:56.160> that<00:03:56.190> it

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
we've out ruled the possibility that it

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.010 
we've out ruled the possibility that it
could<00:03:56.670> be<00:03:56.700> scarred<00:03:57.150> because<00:03:57.360> Nala<00:03:57.750> didn't

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
could be scarred because Nala didn't

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.960 
could be scarred because Nala didn't
adopt<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.440> outside<00:03:58.860> our<00:03:58.980> appearance<00:03:59.459> so<00:03:59.670> that

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
adopt the outside our appearance so that

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.910 
adopt the outside our appearance so that
would<00:04:00.300> mean<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:00.540> Mufasa<00:04:01.140> must<00:04:01.680> be<00:04:01.800> the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
would mean that Mufasa must be the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.650 
would mean that Mufasa must be the
father<00:04:02.130> well<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:03.060> seems<00:04:03.420> perfectly

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
father well that seems perfectly

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.020 
father well that seems perfectly
feasible<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.530> mean<00:04:04.830> look<00:04:05.160> at<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.310> comparison

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
feasible I mean look at the comparison

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.290 
feasible I mean look at the comparison
same<00:04:06.780> type<00:04:07.170> of<00:04:07.380> look<00:04:07.590> same<00:04:08.190> type<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.459> color<00:04:08.880> the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
same type of look same type of color the

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.150 
same type of look same type of color the
both<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.780> same<00:04:09.989> pride<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.800> think<00:04:11.010> that

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
both and the same pride and I think that

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.640 
both and the same pride and I think that
everybody<00:04:11.519> can<00:04:11.910> notice<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.390> wait<00:04:13.140> wait<00:04:13.620> a

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
everybody can notice that wait wait a

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.520 
everybody can notice that wait wait a
minute<00:04:14.070> if<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:15.150> go<00:04:15.390> on<00:04:15.420> in<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.959> believe<00:04:16.230> in<00:04:16.410> this

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
minute if I go on in to believe in this

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.650 
minute if I go on in to believe in this
theory<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.220> Simba<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:17.760> Nala<00:04:17.850> are<00:04:18.330> both<00:04:18.510> from
