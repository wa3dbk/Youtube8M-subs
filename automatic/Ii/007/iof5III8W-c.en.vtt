well<00:00:00.810> I<00:00:00.840> figured<00:00:01.230> it's<00:00:01.380> about<00:00:01.439> time<00:00:01.620> that<00:00:01.920> I

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
well I figured it's about time that I

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.409 
well I figured it's about time that I
start<00:00:02.429> working<00:00:02.610> on<00:00:02.850> another<00:00:02.909> one<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.360> the

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
start working on another one of the

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.809 
start working on another one of the
magnet<00:00:03.780> tracks<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.950> one<00:00:05.130> you<00:00:05.250> guys<00:00:05.370> haven't

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
magnet tracks this one you guys haven't

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.000 
magnet tracks this one you guys haven't
seen<00:00:06.029> yet<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.930> an<00:00:07.080> orange<00:00:07.529> one<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:07.980> I

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
seen yet this is an orange one that I

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.180 
seen yet this is an orange one that I
picked<00:00:08.309> up<00:00:08.929> probably<00:00:09.929> over<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:10.620> past<00:00:10.950> winter

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
picked up probably over this past winter

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.060 
picked up probably over this past winter
last<00:00:11.670> fall<00:00:12.000> somewhere<00:00:12.509> around<00:00:12.630> there<00:00:13.070> anyways

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
last fall somewhere around there anyways

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.580 
last fall somewhere around there anyways
it's<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.240> nine<00:00:15.509> horse<00:00:15.780> deluxe<00:00:16.170> model<00:00:16.500> with

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
it's the nine horse deluxe model with

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.140 
it's the nine horse deluxe model with
the<00:00:16.680> electric<00:00:17.039> start<00:00:17.369> 4-speed<00:00:18.119> transmission

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
the electric start 4-speed transmission

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.929 
the electric start 4-speed transmission
just<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.140> my<00:00:19.320> other<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.699> and<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.789> got

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
just like my other one and I got

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.670 
just like my other one and I got
ambitious<00:00:21.420> today<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.930> figured<00:00:22.260> I'd<00:00:22.350> see<00:00:22.380> if

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
ambitious today so I figured I'd see if

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.429 
ambitious today so I figured I'd see if
I<00:00:22.769> can't<00:00:22.980> get<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.279> running<00:00:23.720> it's<00:00:24.720> got<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.930> 23

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
I can't get it running it's got the 23

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.880 
I can't get it running it's got the 23
d9<00:00:26.279> horse<00:00:26.550> Briggs<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.289> and<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.650> see<00:00:28.800> it

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
d9 horse Briggs in it and you can see it

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.130 
d9 horse Briggs in it and you can see it
had<00:00:29.039> mice<00:00:29.279> underneath<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.849> shroud<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.990> got

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
had mice underneath the shroud and I got

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.479 
had mice underneath the shroud and I got
the<00:00:31.230> shroud<00:00:31.439> up<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> hill<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the shroud up on the hill for it the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.190 
the shroud up on the hill for it the
bottom<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:32.940> well<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.480> probably<00:00:33.630> rotted<00:00:34.079> off

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
bottom is well it's probably rotted off

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.250 
bottom is well it's probably rotted off
from<00:00:34.500> about<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:37.110> see

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
from about here to here and you can see

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.780 
from about here to here and you can see
this<00:00:37.410> back<00:00:37.680> plate<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.520> little<00:00:38.610> bit

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
this back plate here it's a little bit

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.930 
this back plate here it's a little bit
weak<00:00:39.629> too<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:41.040> coil<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.520> also<00:00:41.820> all

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
weak too and the coil is also all

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.639 
weak too and the coil is also all
blistered<00:00:42.360> apart<00:00:42.719> from<00:00:42.930> them<00:00:43.050> being<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.440> there

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
blistered apart from them being in there

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.310 
blistered apart from them being in there
but<00:00:44.430> surprisingly<00:00:45.210> enough<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.629> did<00:00:45.809> get<00:00:45.960> spark

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
but surprisingly enough I did get spark

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.619 
but surprisingly enough I did get spark
out<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.860> cleaned<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> points<00:00:47.640> i<00:00:47.820> gapped

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
out of it I cleaned the points i gapped

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.139 
out of it I cleaned the points i gapped
him<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> 20<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.440> got<00:00:49.559> good<00:00:49.739> spark<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.370> had

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
him to 20 and it's got good spark I had

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.569 
him to 20 and it's got good spark I had
a<00:00:51.180> clean<00:00:51.449> gas<00:00:51.690> tank<00:00:52.160> carburetor<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.250> pulled

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
a clean gas tank carburetor I pulled

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.250 
a clean gas tank carburetor I pulled
this<00:00:53.760> bottom<00:00:54.149> jet<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.420> which<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.110> can

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
this bottom jet out which you can

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.600 
this bottom jet out which you can
usually<00:00:55.379> tell<00:00:55.590> whether<00:00:55.949> it'll<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.190> clean<00:00:56.489> or

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
usually tell whether it'll be clean or

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.970 
usually tell whether it'll be clean or
not<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> was<00:00:57.210> nothing<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:58.829> not

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
not and it was nothing on it so I'm not

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
not and it was nothing on it so I'm not
gonna<00:00:59.129> bother<00:00:59.309> pulling<00:00:59.730> apart<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
gonna bother pulling apart the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.119 
gonna bother pulling apart the
carburetor<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.320> put<00:01:01.469> some<00:01:01.500> fresh<00:01:01.829> gas

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
carburetor and I just put some fresh gas

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.500 
carburetor and I just put some fresh gas
in<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> bowl<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.910> doesn't<00:01:03.180> leak<00:01:03.359> or

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
in the bowl and that doesn't leak or

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.420 
in the bowl and that doesn't leak or
anything<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:04.890> someone<00:01:05.189> shut<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
anything and I think someone shut the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.980 
anything and I think someone shut the
gas<00:01:05.580> off<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.299> before<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:06.750> stopped

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
gas off on this before they stopped

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.170 
gas off on this before they stopped
using<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.400> saved<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.880> pretty<00:01:09.090> good

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
using it so that saved it pretty good

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.740 
using it so that saved it pretty good
and<00:01:10.130> I'm<00:01:11.130> gonna<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.400> rope<00:01:11.580> starting<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.180> I'll

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
and I'm gonna be rope starting this I'll

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.270 
and I'm gonna be rope starting this I'll
let<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.930> run<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.590> little<00:01:13.830> bit<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.220> make

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
let it run for a little bit just to make

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.770 
let it run for a little bit just to make
sure<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.700> runs<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.240> then<00:01:15.479> I'll<00:01:15.570> put<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
sure it runs and then I'll put the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.030 
sure it runs and then I'll put the
shroud<00:01:16.470> back<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.340> cool<00:01:17.490> itself<00:01:19.040> and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
shroud back on so it can cool itself and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.530 
shroud back on so it can cool itself and
like<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.430> said<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.759> got<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> 4-speed

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
like I said it's got the 4-speed

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.719 
like I said it's got the 4-speed
peerless<00:01:21.990> rear<00:01:22.200> end<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:23.340> was<00:01:23.460> really

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
peerless rear end and it was really

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.390 
peerless rear end and it was really
stiff<00:01:24.030> rolling<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.680> ended<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:25.979> changing

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
stiff rolling and I ended up changing

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.310 
stiff rolling and I ended up changing
the<00:01:26.729> oil<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.540> put<00:01:27.780> some<00:01:27.810> new<00:01:28.080> gear

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the oil in it and I put some new gear

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.780 
the oil in it and I put some new gear
lube<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.369> lot<00:01:29.520> better<00:01:29.670> than

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
lube in there so it's a lot better than

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.770 
lube in there so it's a lot better than
what<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> was<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.600> starting<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.990> free<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.670> and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
what it was it's starting to free up and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.179 
what it was it's starting to free up and
this<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> stuff<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.530> came<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
this is the stuff that came out of it

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.700 
this is the stuff that came out of it
really<00:01:35.570> wasn't<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> best<00:01:36.930> looking<00:01:37.259> stuff<00:01:37.560> in

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
really wasn't the best looking stuff in

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.940 
really wasn't the best looking stuff in
the<00:01:37.799> world<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> had<00:01:39.840> actually<00:01:40.470> drained<00:01:40.770> out

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the world so I had actually drained out

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.010 
the world so I had actually drained out
probably<00:01:41.400> about<00:01:41.579> half<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.090> bucket<00:01:42.479> worth<00:01:42.840> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
probably about half this bucket worth of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
probably about half this bucket worth of
water<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.579> oil<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.299> was

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
water and then all this oil so it was

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.260 
water and then all this oil so it was
really<00:01:45.600> really<00:01:46.409> bad<00:01:46.710> stuff

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.510 

and<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:51.229> clutch<00:01:51.439> is<00:01:51.619> in<00:01:51.740> pretty<00:01:51.979> fair<00:01:52.189> shape

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
and the clutch is in pretty fair shape

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.120 
and the clutch is in pretty fair shape
to<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:53.479> splines<00:01:53.869> on<00:01:54.140> this<00:01:54.290> piece<00:01:54.560> here<00:01:54.950> are

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
to the splines on this piece here are

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.639 
to the splines on this piece here are
actually<00:01:55.579> pretty<00:01:55.820> well<00:01:56.030> worn<00:01:56.360> but<00:01:57.079> it<00:01:57.439> seems

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
actually pretty well worn but it seems

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.460 
actually pretty well worn but it seems
like<00:01:57.829> everything's<00:01:58.250> grabbing<00:01:58.700> pretty<00:01:58.939> well

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
like everything's grabbing pretty well

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.929 
like everything's grabbing pretty well
so<00:02:00.470> that'll<00:02:00.680> hopefully<00:02:01.070> drive<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:01.460> alright<00:02:01.729> so

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
so that'll hopefully drive it alright so

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.899 
so that'll hopefully drive it alright so
anyways<00:02:02.930> get<00:02:03.740> some<00:02:03.920> gas<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:04.490> we'll<00:02:04.729> see

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
anyways get some gas in it and we'll see

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:23.290 
anyways get some gas in it and we'll see
if<00:02:05.000> it'll<00:02:05.149> fire<00:02:05.390> up

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.940 

while<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.330> wasn't<00:02:24.540> firing<00:02:25.080> over<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.680> pulled

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
while I wasn't firing over so I pulled

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.490 
while I wasn't firing over so I pulled
the<00:02:26.100> bottom<00:02:26.430> jet<00:02:26.700> out<00:02:26.730> here<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.420> there<00:02:28.410> was

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the bottom jet out here and there was

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.140 
the bottom jet out here and there was
little<00:02:28.709> gas<00:02:28.890> running<00:02:29.220> out<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.850> see<00:02:30.030> it's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
little gas running out you see it's

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.350 
little gas running out you see it's
pretty<00:02:30.209> clean<00:02:30.660> too<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:32.490> checked<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.120> line

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
pretty clean too and I checked the line

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.930 
pretty clean too and I checked the line
and<00:02:33.600> lines<00:02:33.840> clear<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.250> took<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.520> carburetor

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
and lines clear so I took the carburetor

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.150 
and lines clear so I took the carburetor
apart<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.170> just<00:02:37.350> about<00:02:37.560> as<00:02:37.740> clean<00:02:38.010> as

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
apart and it's just about as clean as

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.600 
apart and it's just about as clean as
ever<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.550> there<00:02:39.140> good<00:02:40.140> float<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.459> could

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
ever in there good float but you could

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.790 
ever in there good float but you could
see<00:02:41.850> at<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.510> float<00:02:42.750> needle<00:02:43.760> focus<00:02:45.650> it's<00:02:46.650> all

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
see at the float needle focus it's all

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:55.960 
see at the float needle focus it's all
gummed<00:02:47.130> up<00:02:47.280> inside<00:02:47.700> there<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.239> stuck

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.990 

that's<00:02:56.970> why<00:02:57.269> getting<00:02:57.720> any<00:02:57.959> gas<00:02:58.580> add<00:02:59.580> just<00:02:59.820> a

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
that's why getting any gas add just a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.120 
that's why getting any gas add just a
little<00:03:00.030> bit<00:03:00.300> of<00:03:00.480> old<00:03:00.630> gas<00:03:00.900> in<00:03:01.260> there<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.860> ended

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
little bit of old gas in there and ended

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.790 
little bit of old gas in there and ended
up<00:03:02.220> getting<00:03:02.550> all<00:03:03.110> gummed<00:03:04.110> up<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.620> and

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
up getting all gummed up on it and

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.770 
up getting all gummed up on it and
that's<00:03:04.950> what<00:03:05.130> kept<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.430> from<00:03:05.640> moving<00:03:05.820> so<00:03:06.660> we'll

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
that's what kept it from moving so we'll

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.540 
that's what kept it from moving so we'll
clean<00:03:06.989> that<00:03:07.050> out<00:03:07.230> put<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.100> back<00:03:08.370> together

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
clean that out put this back together

00:03:08.550 --> 00:04:41.409 
clean that out put this back together
and<00:03:08.850> we'll<00:03:08.940> try<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.209> get

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.089 

now<00:04:41.900> I<00:04:41.930> got<00:04:42.199> it<00:04:42.229> running<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:42.710> everything

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099 
now I got it running and everything

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.490 
now I got it running and everything
sucked<00:04:43.370> up<00:04:43.550> got<00:04:43.939> the<00:04:43.969> fan<00:04:44.270> shroud<00:04:44.509> back<00:04:44.870> on<00:04:45.110> so

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
sucked up got the fan shroud back on so

00:04:45.500 --> 00:05:15.020 
sucked up got the fan shroud back on so
take<00:04:46.340> a<00:04:46.370> little<00:04:46.580> drive<00:04:46.879> up<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.150> hill<00:04:47.180> with<00:04:47.449> it

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:06:02.180 

we're<00:05:15.510> in<00:05:15.630> second<00:05:16.110> gear<00:05:16.320> right<00:05:16.620> now

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.010 

this<00:06:02.670> one<00:06:02.850> doesn't<00:06:03.060> have<00:06:03.210> any<00:06:03.450> brakes<00:06:03.690> hooked

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
this one doesn't have any brakes hooked

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.380 
this one doesn't have any brakes hooked
up<00:06:04.200> to<00:06:04.410> it<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:04.770> band<00:06:05.610> and<00:06:05.880> the<00:06:05.940> rod<00:06:06.120> are

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
up to it the band and the rod are

00:06:06.390 --> 00:07:18.150 
up to it the band and the rod are
missing<00:06:06.690> from<00:06:06.840> it

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.710 

so<00:07:19.160> there<00:07:19.400> you<00:07:19.430> have<00:07:19.550> it<00:07:19.730> that's<00:07:20.270> the<00:07:20.480> orange

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 
so there you have it that's the orange

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.160 
so there you have it that's the orange
magnet<00:07:21.170> rack<00:07:21.380> finally<00:07:21.860> running
