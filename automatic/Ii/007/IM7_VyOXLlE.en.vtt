00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
because we all fine-tune it after we

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.779 
because we all fine-tune it after we
glue<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.720> balsa<00:01:44.170> as<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:45.340> can<00:01:45.489> see<00:01:45.640> the

I'm using one and a half millimeter bolt
sir<00:01:52.960> as<00:01:53.109> the<00:01:53.289> mainboard<00:01:53.740> surface<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.579> I'll<00:01:55.090> be

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
sir as the mainboard surface and I'll be

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.419 
sir as the mainboard surface and I'll be

using a spray glue to fix the image to
the<00:01:57.460> balsa<00:01:57.939> it's<00:01:58.509> important<00:01:59.079> to<00:01:59.140> note<00:01:59.289> that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
the balsa it's important to note that

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.039 
the balsa it's important to note that
using<00:01:59.770> PVA<00:02:00.280> or<00:02:00.579> other<00:02:00.789> similar<00:02:01.299> glues<00:02:01.780> will

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
using PVA or other similar glues will

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.620 
using PVA or other similar glues will
cause<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.500> balsa<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:03.130> warp<00:02:03.399> I<00:02:03.670> found<00:02:04.509> that

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
cause the balsa to warp I found that

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.350 
cause the balsa to warp I found that
using<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.109> spray<00:02:05.380> adhesive<00:02:05.409> works<00:02:06.069> best<00:02:06.460> any

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
using the spray adhesive works best any

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.889 
using the spray adhesive works best any
particular<00:02:07.780> brand<00:02:08.140> should<00:02:08.500> do<00:02:08.739> fine<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:10.660> your

and<00:03:51.140> here<00:03:51.830> is<00:03:51.950> why<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:52.160> made<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.730> template

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230

getting<00:03:54.230> precise<00:03:54.620> spacing<00:03:55.130> is<00:03:55.250> much<00:03:55.520> easier

need<00:05:02.090> to<00:05:02.240> make<00:05:02.420> the<00:05:02.570> support<00:05:02.990> legs<00:05:03.230> that

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
need to make the support legs that

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.520 
attach to the rear again you can get
creative<00:05:08.090> or<00:05:08.210> make<00:05:08.390> them<00:05:08.540> as<00:05:08.660> complex<00:05:09.080> or<00:05:09.350> as

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530

the<00:05:11.960> middle<00:05:12.170> ground<00:05:12.350> and<00:05:12.620> build<00:05:12.770> something

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
the middle ground and build something

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.480 
the middle ground and build something
easy<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:14.000> still<00:05:14.330> looks<00:05:14.510> good<00:05:15.190> it's<00:05:16.190> just

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490

between<00:06:13.280> the<00:06:13.520> wood<00:06:13.640> panels<00:06:14.120> on<00:06:14.330> the<00:06:14.419> boardwalk

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
between the wood panels on the boardwalk

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.630 
between the wood panels on the boardwalk
like<00:06:15.110> you'd<00:06:15.290> see<00:06:15.500> on<00:06:15.530> a<00:06:15.650> deck<00:06:15.950> it<00:06:16.250> will<00:06:16.520> look

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
like you'd see on a deck it will look

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.290

much<00:06:17.480> more<00:06:17.660> realistic

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:34.840 

and<00:06:32.740> finally<00:06:33.740> I<00:06:33.889> felt<00:06:34.370> like<00:06:34.550> there<00:06:34.729> was

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
and finally I felt like there was

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.219 
and finally I felt like there was
something<00:06:35.030> missing<00:06:35.300> when<00:06:35.630> I<00:06:35.660> stood<00:06:35.930> back<00:06:36.199> and

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:36.229 
something missing when I stood back and

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.140 
something missing when I stood back and
looked<00:06:36.530> at<00:06:36.650> the<00:06:36.740> model<00:06:37.039> so<00:06:37.610> I<00:06:37.639> added<00:06:37.880> some<00:06:38.030> more

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
looked at the model so I added some more

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.770 
looked at the model so I added some more
wood<00:06:38.419> panels<00:06:38.840> to<00:06:39.050> the<00:06:39.080> base<00:06:39.289> and<00:06:40.660> there<00:06:41.660> you

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
wood panels to the base and there you

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.719 
wood panels to the base and there you
have<00:06:41.930> it<00:06:42.080> a<00:06:42.199> great<00:06:42.229> little<00:06:42.949> detail<00:06:43.370> you<00:06:43.400> can

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729
