00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
bit yeah I think because we start we

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.720 
bit yeah I think because we start we
didn't<00:00:44.930> start<00:00:45.530> looking<00:00:45.949> soon<00:00:46.159> enough

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
backtrack these we'll look for these

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.510 
backtrack these we'll look for these
blazes<00:00:55.609> on<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.149> trees<00:00:57.070> as<00:00:58.070> you're<00:00:58.340> going

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
blazes on the trees as you're going

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.750 
blazes on the trees as you're going
across<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:59.059> trail<00:00:59.300> both<00:00:59.600> ways<00:01:00.340> and<00:01:01.340> they'll

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
across the trail both ways and they'll

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.840 
across the trail both ways and they'll
be<00:01:01.879> at<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.059> entrances<00:01:03.070> from<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.250> water<00:01:04.460> also

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
be at the entrances from the water also

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.109

hysteria<00:03:46.840> pandemonium<00:03:47.840> but<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:49.250> I<00:03:49.519> think<00:03:49.850> the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940
