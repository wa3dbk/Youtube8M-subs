 My mother, uncles, I'm the fucking master 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.090

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.090
 Uncle current 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.990
 and come home for Christmas that for me 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.990
 if it goes to your uncle body 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.000
 the backpack how to take the backpack is 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.860
 over 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.860
 I do not drown I think the caught backpack 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.480
 how terrible 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.709
 every vera 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:30.560
 so the noses with age and a rifle 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.560
 has a rifle 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.580
 which has reflection 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.250
 I'll see you carrying that story more badly to 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.840
 human 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.250
 I shot him 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.250
 my voice and sales 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:55.170
 and I really do not know if it's outside or inside 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.170
 yes yes I keep listening 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.810
 the killed 1 but it was not 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.090
 one is killed but this one does not reflect this 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.280
 I was going up because that's just that 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.930
 same you confused joel huiquÃ­ solo 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.400
 that he just wanted different guns 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.400
 loaders but the one above 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.480
 it can be this helmet 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.909
 can assume that this cheese is 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.069
 the one that I see a little trombone ix on the web 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.790
 that there are only pipes and chargers 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.790
 different sizes 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.960
 d 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.790

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.870

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.680

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.530

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.730

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.240
