I<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.180> not<00:02:21.330> too<00:02:21.480> bad<00:02:21.740> obviously<00:02:22.740> there<00:02:22.920> what<00:02:23.460> I

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
I get not too bad obviously there what I

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.000 
I get not too bad obviously there what I
expect<00:02:24.060> if<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.900> wasn't<00:02:25.050> more<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.530> passing

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
expect if I wasn't more of a passing

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.180 
expect if I wasn't more of a passing
strike<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.670> expects<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.180> lot<00:02:27.390> less<00:02:28.190> shot

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
strike that it expects a lot less shot

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.760 
strike that it expects a lot less shot
some<00:02:29.460> more<00:02:29.610> passes<00:02:30.060> obviously<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.440> advance

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
some more passes obviously so we advance

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.710 
some more passes obviously so we advance
and<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.640> looks<00:02:32.820> like<00:02:32.940> we're<00:02:33.240> gonna<00:02:33.360> be<00:02:33.570> playing
