just<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.170> cincher<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.980> me<00:00:41.460> when<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> made<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.629> I

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
just a cincher on me when I made it I

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.630 
just a cincher on me when I made it I
weighed<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> little<00:00:43.649> bit<00:00:43.739> more<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.430> actually

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
weighed a little bit more so I actually

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.610 
weighed a little bit more so I actually
did<00:00:45.000> give<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> cinch<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.980> 25<00:00:47.520> inches<00:00:47.789> and

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
did give a cinch but it is 25 inches and

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.069 
did give a cinch but it is 25 inches and
that's<00:00:49.620> about<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.399> waist<00:00:50.670> size<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.600> right

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
that's about what my waist size is right

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.939 
that's about what my waist size is right
now<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.460> doesn't<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:53.820> cinch<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> at<00:00:54.390> all

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
now so it doesn't really cinch it at all

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.330 
now so it doesn't really cinch it at all
if<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:57.390> make<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.949> or<00:00:59.129> buy<00:00:59.309> one

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
if you do make one like this or buy one

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.460 
if you do make one like this or buy one
you<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:01.890> sure<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.250> know<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:03.170> if<00:01:04.170> you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
you have to be sure you know that if you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.649 
you have to be sure you know that if you
weigh<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:06.200> little<00:01:07.200> bit<00:01:07.320> more<00:01:07.619> your<00:01:08.210> skin<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
weigh a little bit more your skin and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.440 
weigh a little bit more your skin and
stuff<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.530> smoosh<00:01:11.159> out<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.880> top<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
stuff will smoosh out of the top and the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.450 
stuff will smoosh out of the top and the
bottom<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.860> most<00:01:13.890> flattering

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460

bones<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.299> there<00:02:40.080> were<00:02:40.290> twelve<00:02:41.720> or<00:02:42.769> six<00:02:43.769> on

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
bones and there were twelve or six on

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.839 
bones and there were twelve or six on
each<00:02:44.099> side<00:02:44.660> spring<00:02:45.660> steel<00:02:45.870> bones<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.849> there

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
each side spring steel bones and there

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.759 
each side spring steel bones and there
as<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.209> can<00:02:48.269> see<00:02:48.360> there<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:49.110> waste<00:02:49.380> tape<00:02:49.620> in

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
as you can see there is a waste tape in

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.120 
as you can see there is a waste tape in
here<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.000> video<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:52.170> Express<00:02:52.769> Corsa

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
here and in the video the Express Corsa

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.839 
here and in the video the Express Corsa
tree<00:02:53.280> videos

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
tree videos

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.229 
tree videos
she<00:02:54.269> showed<00:02:54.599> too<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.829> entire<00:02:56.370> waste<00:02:56.910> tape

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
she showed too so the entire waste tape

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.229 
she showed too so the entire waste tape
in<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.230> can<00:02:58.530> see<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:58.920> from<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.190> inside<00:02:59.340> but

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
in so you can see it from the inside but

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.289 
in so you can see it from the inside but
I<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:01.530> learned<00:03:01.769> since<00:03:02.069> then<00:03:02.190> how<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.819> do<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
I have learned since then how to do the

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.930 
I have learned since then how to do the
invisible<00:03:03.660> waste<00:03:04.230> tape<00:03:04.620> insertion<00:03:05.280> method<00:03:05.430> so

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
invisible waste tape insertion method so

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.580 
invisible waste tape insertion method so
I<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.569> method<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.900> lot<00:03:07.049> better<00:03:07.319> than

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
I like that method a lot better than

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.729 
I like that method a lot better than
this<00:03:07.829> one<00:03:08.780> but<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.900> definitely<00:03:10.140> can't<00:03:10.530> see

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
this one but you definitely can't see

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.900 
this one but you definitely can't see
from<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.040> outside<00:03:11.190> oh<00:03:12.200> my<00:03:13.200> goodness<00:03:13.560> yeah<00:03:13.910> you

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
from the outside oh my goodness yeah you

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.479 
from the outside oh my goodness yeah you
can<00:03:15.269> however<00:03:15.660> see<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.380> wrinkle<00:03:17.100> that<00:03:17.160> has

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
can however see this wrinkle that has

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.090 
can however see this wrinkle that has
appeared<00:03:17.819> on<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.750> third<00:03:19.139> panel<00:03:19.500> on<00:03:19.799> both

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
appeared on the third panel on both

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.270 
appeared on the third panel on both
sides<00:03:20.549> and<00:03:21.139> it<00:03:22.139> might<00:03:22.500> be<00:03:22.650> because<00:03:22.889> I<00:03:22.980> did<00:03:23.160> not

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
sides and it might be because I did not

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.699 
sides and it might be because I did not
do<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.519> roll<00:03:23.850> pinning<00:03:24.299> technique<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:25.049> might<00:03:25.590> be

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
do a roll pinning technique it might be

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.199 
do a roll pinning technique it might be
because<00:03:25.889> of<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:28.069> pattern<00:03:29.069> itself<00:03:29.549> or<00:03:29.970> the

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
because of the pattern itself or the

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.819 
because of the pattern itself or the
waste<00:03:30.359> aid<00:03:30.540> I'm<00:03:30.660> not<00:03:30.810> exactly<00:03:31.049> sure<00:03:31.200> but<00:03:31.590> I

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
waste aid I'm not exactly sure but I

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.140 
waste aid I'm not exactly sure but I
really<00:03:32.190> don't<00:03:32.430> like<00:03:32.609> that<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.120> doesn't

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
really don't like that and it doesn't

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.289 
really don't like that and it doesn't
show<00:03:33.420> up<00:03:33.660> as<00:03:33.810> much<00:03:33.989> when<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:34.380> on<00:03:34.590> me<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:38.299> made

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
show up as much when it's on me I made

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.150 
show up as much when it's on me I made
it<00:03:39.420> so<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.630> can't<00:03:40.049> see<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.560> stitching<00:03:40.950> of<00:03:41.069> the

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
it so you can't see the stitching of the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.580 
it so you can't see the stitching of the
buns<00:03:41.370> on<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.850> outside<00:03:42.329> at<00:03:42.510> all<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.440> only

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
buns on the outside at all you can only

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.390 
buns on the outside at all you can only
see<00:03:43.920> them<00:03:44.069> on<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.790> inside<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:47.130> bust

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
see them on the inside the bust

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.280 
see them on the inside the bust
consortium<00:03:48.030> technique<00:03:48.420> I<00:03:48.540> was<00:03:48.690> not<00:03:48.840> as<00:03:48.989> fond

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
consortium technique I was not as fond

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
consortium technique I was not as fond
of<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:50.630> don't<00:03:51.630> like<00:03:51.989> how<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.590> ended<00:03:52.769> up<00:03:52.889> showing

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
of I don't like how I ended up showing

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.220 
of I don't like how I ended up showing
these<00:03:53.670> stitches<00:03:54.060> on<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.540> outside<00:03:54.569> but

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
these stitches on the outside but

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.750 
these stitches on the outside but
there's<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.560> better<00:03:55.769> technique<00:03:56.220> for<00:03:56.370> my<00:03:56.519> next

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
there's a better technique for my next

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.069 
there's a better technique for my next
corset<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.329> I<00:03:57.359> used<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:58.579> also<00:03:59.599> I<00:04:00.599> used

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
corset that I used and also I used

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.370 
corset that I used and also I used
binding<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.489> bought<00:04:02.970> from<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.780> store<00:04:03.840> and

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
binding that I bought from the store and

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.229 
binding that I bought from the store and
I<00:04:04.500> got<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.859> really<00:04:05.069> small<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:05.760> should<00:04:06.120> have

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
I got it really small I should have

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.390 
I got it really small I should have
gotten<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.540> bigger<00:04:06.750> this<00:04:07.200> is<00:04:07.380> fourth<00:04:07.889> of<00:04:08.099> an

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
gotten it bigger this is fourth of an

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.530 
gotten it bigger this is fourth of an
inch<00:04:09.620> binding<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.769> believe<00:04:11.099> and<00:04:11.489> I<00:04:12.269> ended<00:04:12.419> up

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
inch binding I believe and I ended up

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.080 
inch binding I believe and I ended up
hand<00:04:12.870> stitching<00:04:13.260> it<00:04:13.380> on<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.590> inside<00:04:14.090> but

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
hand stitching it on the inside but

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.969 
hand stitching it on the inside but
there's<00:04:15.690> also<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.989> better<00:04:16.229> technique<00:04:16.620> for<00:04:16.859> that

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
there's also a better technique for that

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.979 
there's also a better technique for that
as<00:04:17.190> well<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:18.120> this<00:04:18.239> is<00:04:18.389> kind<00:04:18.599> of<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.840> learning

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
as well so this is kind of a learning

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.800 
as well so this is kind of a learning
experience<00:04:19.289> for<00:04:19.919> me<00:04:20.180> while<00:04:21.180> some<00:04:21.390> new<00:04:21.570> just

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
experience for me while some new just

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.990 
experience for me while some new just
sewing<00:04:22.140> I<00:04:22.200> started<00:04:22.530> sewing<00:04:22.710> last<00:04:23.070> summer<00:04:23.400> so<00:04:23.760> I

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
sewing I started sewing last summer so I

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.610 
sewing I started sewing last summer so I
started<00:04:24.570> sewing<00:04:24.720> because<00:04:24.900> I<00:04:25.110> wanted<00:04:25.349> to<00:04:25.470> learn

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
started sewing because I wanted to learn

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.040 
started sewing because I wanted to learn
how

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
how

on to the grommets on the outside they
look<00:04:36.009> very<00:04:36.039> pretty
