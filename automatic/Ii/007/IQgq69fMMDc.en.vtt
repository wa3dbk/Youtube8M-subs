if<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:49.360> know<00:00:49.480> what<00:00:49.630> I<00:00:49.690> mean<00:00:49.870> like<00:00:50.110> another<00:00:50.740> the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
if you know what I mean like another the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.160 
if you know what I mean like another the
other<00:00:51.310> one<00:00:51.610> like<00:00:51.850> this<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.770> the<00:00:54.100> Conair<00:00:54.760> wand

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
other one like this like the Conair wand

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.500 
other one like this like the Conair wand
it's<00:00:56.170> like<00:00:56.440> big<00:00:57.160> and<00:00:57.370> then<00:00:57.490> it<00:00:57.579> gets<00:00:57.730> smaller<00:00:58.060> I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
it's like big and then it gets smaller I

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.240 
it's like big and then it gets smaller I
don't<00:00:58.690> like<00:00:58.870> that<00:00:59.079> I<00:00:59.140> think<00:00:59.350> it<00:00:59.680> looks<00:00:59.860> I<00:01:00.100> mean

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
don't like that I think it looks I mean

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.100 
don't like that I think it looks I mean
it's<00:01:00.400> better<00:01:00.610> if<00:01:00.820> it's<00:01:01.000> just<00:01:01.090> like<00:01:01.510> this

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
it's better if it's just like this

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.460 
it's better if it's just like this
evenly<00:01:02.620> one<00:01:02.890> size<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:03.790> I<00:01:04.509> really<00:01:05.019> like<00:01:05.259> that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
evenly one size and I really like that

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.160 
evenly one size and I really like that
it's<00:01:05.680> clipless<00:01:06.159> it's<00:01:06.790> one<00:01:07.149> is<00:01:07.479> clipless<00:01:07.780> so

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
it's clipless it's one is clipless so

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.289 
it's clipless it's one is clipless so
it's<00:01:08.350> not<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.619> hassle<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:09.460> use<00:01:09.640> and<00:01:09.970> it's<00:01:10.060> really

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
it's not a hassle to use and it's really

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.749 
it's not a hassle to use and it's really
quickly<00:01:10.810> as<00:01:10.930> you<00:01:11.590> know<00:01:11.710> wrap<00:01:12.430> your<00:01:12.579> hair

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
quickly as you know wrap your hair

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.790 
quickly as you know wrap your hair
around<00:01:12.790> it<00:01:13.300> and<00:01:13.540> I<00:01:14.020> really<00:01:14.290> like<00:01:14.470> that<00:01:14.620> they

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
around it and I really like that they

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.430 
around it and I really like that they
let<00:01:15.190> it<00:01:15.400> give<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:15.700> options<00:01:16.210> on<00:01:16.570> you<00:01:17.110> know<00:01:17.229> your

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
let it give you options on you know your

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.670 
let it give you options on you know your
handle<00:01:17.860> colors<00:01:18.190> there's<00:01:19.000> this<00:01:19.690> pink<00:01:20.110> one<00:01:20.320> and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
handle colors there's this pink one and

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.969 
handle colors there's this pink one and
then<00:01:20.860> there's<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:23.110> zebra<00:01:23.440> one<00:01:23.620> and<00:01:23.830> then<00:01:23.920> I

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
then there's the zebra one and then I

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.410 
then there's the zebra one and then I
think<00:01:24.190> there's<00:01:24.400> just<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.850> regular<00:01:25.030> like

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
think there's just the regular like

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.390 
think there's just the regular like
black<00:01:25.720> handle<00:01:26.229> or<00:01:26.409> something<00:01:26.920> it's<00:01:27.280> really

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
black handle or something it's really

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.690 
black handle or something it's really
cool<00:01:28.060> they<00:01:28.420> have<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.659> lot<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.020> options<00:01:29.350> I<00:01:30.100> really

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
cool they have a lot of options I really

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.130 
cool they have a lot of options I really
like<00:01:30.850> that<00:01:31.060> -<00:01:31.270> you<00:01:31.479> can<00:01:31.630> pick<00:01:31.840> you<00:01:32.020> know<00:01:32.110> the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
like that - you can pick you know the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.080 
like that - you can pick you know the
smaller<00:01:32.590> barrel<00:01:33.490> or<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.729> bigger<00:01:34.060> barrel<00:01:36.090> what

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
smaller barrel or the bigger barrel what

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.200 
smaller barrel or the bigger barrel what
I<00:01:37.120> also<00:01:37.390> like<00:01:37.690> is<00:01:37.720> they<00:01:38.140> have<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.770> this<00:01:39.610> the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
I also like is they have the this the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.450 
I also like is they have the this the
bottom<00:01:40.830> does<00:01:41.830> a<00:01:41.860> 360<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:44.320> can<00:01:44.650> just<00:01:44.890> twirl

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
bottom does a 360 so you can just twirl

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.280 
bottom does a 360 so you can just twirl
it<00:01:45.640> around<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.420> won't<00:01:46.570> get<00:01:46.720> tangled<00:01:46.990> or

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
it around and it won't get tangled or

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.440 
it around and it won't get tangled or
anything<00:01:47.619> so<00:01:47.860> it's<00:01:48.010> very<00:01:48.549> easy<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:49.210> handle

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
anything so it's very easy to handle

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.990 
anything so it's very easy to handle
another<00:01:50.440> thing<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:50.979> really<00:01:51.010> like<00:01:51.460> is<00:01:51.700> it

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
another thing that I really like is it

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.390 
another thing that I really like is it
has<00:01:52.180> a<00:01:52.420> switch<00:01:52.780> instead<00:01:53.409> of<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.619> button<00:01:53.950> because

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
has a switch instead of a button because

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.100 
has a switch instead of a button because
sometimes<00:01:54.850> when<00:01:55.180> I<00:01:55.210> curl<00:01:55.330> my<00:01:55.540> hair<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.080> have

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
sometimes when I curl my hair and I have

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.130 
sometimes when I curl my hair and I have
the<00:01:56.710> ones<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.220> are<00:01:57.400> you<00:01:57.939> know<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.750> turn<00:01:58.990> on

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
the ones that are you know you turn on

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.020 
the ones that are you know you turn on
with<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.409> button<00:01:59.680> I<00:01:59.890> my<00:02:00.189> hand<00:02:00.460> accidentally

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
with the button I my hand accidentally

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.149 
with the button I my hand accidentally
presses<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.720> off<00:02:01.900> button<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.710> then<00:02:02.830> I'm<00:02:02.950> just

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
presses the off button and then I'm just

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.070 
presses the off button and then I'm just
like<00:02:03.310> how<00:02:03.729> come<00:02:03.909> it's<00:02:04.060> not<00:02:04.210> curling<00:02:04.630> right<00:02:04.869> and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
like how come it's not curling right and

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.539 
like how come it's not curling right and
then<00:02:05.170> I<00:02:05.259> look<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.619> I<00:02:05.710> was<00:02:05.920> like<00:02:06.040> oh<00:02:06.220> shoot<00:02:06.430> I

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
don't like the only thing that I don't

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.080 
don't like the only thing that I don't
like<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:28.530> they<00:03:28.920> don't<00:03:29.220> have<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.489> button

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
like is that they don't have a button

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.560 
like is that they don't have a button
mean<00:03:31.049> is<00:03:31.290> they<00:03:32.100> don't<00:03:32.250> have<00:03:32.579> like<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.120> little

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
mean is they don't have like a little

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.140 
mean is they don't have like a little
light<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.470> let<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.070> know<00:03:35.250> when<00:03:35.519> it's<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:35.940> or

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
light to let you know when it's on or

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.630 
light to let you know when it's on or
off<00:03:36.380> but<00:03:37.380> then<00:03:37.530> again<00:03:37.680> when<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.040> think<00:03:38.310> about<00:03:38.370> it

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
off but then again when I think about it

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.310 
off but then again when I think about it
it's<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.000> switch<00:03:39.329> so<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:39.900> actually<00:03:40.049> really

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
it's a switch so it's actually really

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.229 
it's a switch so it's actually really
hard<00:03:40.620> for<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.010> actually<00:03:41.250> turn<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.820> off<00:03:41.970> and

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
hard for you to actually turn it off and

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.710 
hard for you to actually turn it off and
on<00:03:42.450> by<00:03:42.720> accident<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.549> guess<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.090> can<00:03:45.299> do

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
on by accident so I guess I can do

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.900 
on by accident so I guess I can do
without<00:03:46.019> it's<00:03:46.200> not<00:03:46.380> too<00:03:46.620> bad<00:03:46.799> but<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.760> was<00:03:47.880> just

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
without it's not too bad but it was just

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.240 
without it's not too bad but it was just
kind<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.510> like<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.660> safety<00:03:48.870> passion<00:03:49.590> but<00:03:49.769> it's

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
kind of like a safety passion but it's

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.610 
kind of like a safety passion but it's
still<00:03:50.459> good<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.700> still<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.239> it's<00:03:51.480> it's<00:03:52.049> still

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
still good I still like it's it's still
