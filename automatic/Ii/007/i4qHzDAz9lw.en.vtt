00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.170
 finally after almost a year after 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.990
 release on metal gear consoles 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.730
 Inek has glanced 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.040
 generally metal gear and came into being in 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.080
 kojima tortures productions could not 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.450
 understand what to do next with the infinite 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.890
 TV series on this geon thought even 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.199
 send players on the battlefield 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.070
 second world until thought came 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.410
 better 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.960
 the Japanese decided to devote a project to ryden 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.360
 not effeminate one and deception 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.710
 fans in the second part but can not cyborg 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.930
 which he appeared in mgs4 ordinary 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.750
 slasher ward hideo kojima was 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.170
 little they needed beyond the idea and for the first time 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.089
 she was shown to the world in a video from e3 2010 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.909
 author and promised the opportunity to apply 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.250
 blows katana in any plane with 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.040
 the same ease of cutting and watermelons and 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.930
 enemy soldiers but 1 idea 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.600
 not enough to release the game 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.420
 the project stalled it was not brought on 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.490
 next e3 and almost closed 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.420
 Dima's descendant found a way out 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.310
 but this girling was handed platinumgames 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.409
 In retrospect it seems that it was lying on 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.539
 the surface of labor find those who 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.659
 versed in the genre better creators 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.420
 bayonetta is curious that developers are not 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.249
 forgot about spy roots ryden 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.409
 may pass some sections quietly 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:41.140
 slip past 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.840
 sentinels or eliminate gape so that 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.810
 facilitate the coming skirmish though more often he 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.750
 still fighting mechanics going right through 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.799
 metal gear came easy to use 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.420
 than mrt or any part of dr michael and 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.759
 remembering combinations do not need to hammer and 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.099
 on a pair of buttons and enemies will cover steel 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.719
 the whirlwind of successful attack is filled 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.840
 special scale and when it reaches 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.299
 the limit begins the most interesting 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.580
 pressing the left trigger player including 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.370
 famous free cutting mode 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.739
 time slows down ten times 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.019
 giving easy to choose the plane of impact 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.450
 in theory, opponents can be killed 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.000
 very effectively dissecting them into even 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.989
 wedges y you aim with exactly 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.480
 gamepad hard 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.610
 most likely you will do it only 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.829
 at the request of the designers, they are entertainment 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.569
 for most situations is enough 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.030
 wind the right joystick from side to 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.340
 side and look shred 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.410
 opponent on hundreds of pieces of lazy 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.540
 In general, they press all the same two buttons as 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.940
 a year ago responsible for horizontal and 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.829
 vertical attacks result right there 100 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.840
 the camera did not fight in seizures in general 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.849
 I will honestly say that management for the year 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.639
 not at all changed i played on 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.810
 hepalitis and xbox 360 as for 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.310
 keyboard and mouse 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.310
 here the trouble is complete 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.659
 surgical precision metal gear razin 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.489
 still necessary for the treatment of first-aid kits 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.650
 rarely therefore the main 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.200
 battery of spinal cord batteries 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.840
 other cyborgs to extract their homelands 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.640
 neat plants from the body 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.099
 miss production will be much more modest 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.900
 while killing armored villains and 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.599
 instantly you can not first have them 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.370
 wear out so that in every battle you have to 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.069
 take pitch tactics 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.109
 what order to destroy the enemy immediately 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.579
 whether do away with annoying little things or 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.370
 to heal at her expense 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.920
 when squeeze there is another amusing 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.349
 feature unlike many slasher 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.269
 dodge attacks do not need to 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.420
 imagine a dodge maneuver exists but 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.739
 inconvenient and there is no sense in it 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.579
 Ryden relies entirely on 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.030
 parry 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.769
 because of what people with poor reflexes mg 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.870
 contraindicated a split second before 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.510
 how will you warm something heavy 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.909
 flashing red light will have time 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.189
 react discourage even Finns 10 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.769
 a ton foot of a giant robot if 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:02.709
 signal yellow threat too big time 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.510
 run away in this case run out ninja 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.299
 useful also for quick moving 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.310
 the levels should hold the right resort and 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.340
 the hero automatically jumps on 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.019
 obstacle to assassin's creed gearbox 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.280
 general battle in metal gear for different 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.919
 fascinating let a little 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.959
 monotonous and however the game consists not 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.500
 only of them and between battles everything is wrong 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.320
 smooth 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.360
 for example the plotted writers are torn and 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.940
 can not decide which topic is more important 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.280
 exploitation of cyborgs by corporations or 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.919
 dirty world politics first line 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.650
 they throw somewhere in the middle but why 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.169
 as if recollecting themselves they remember right 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.880
 before the closing credits following 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.830
 traditions of metal gear in radio 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.720
 negotiations with private colleagues 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.970
 military company which works 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.790
 Ryden stuffed a huge amount 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.620
 information on the one hand 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.870
 if you made a mistake for hours of talking 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.120
 emphasize break through interesting information with 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.860
 another like this to deepen the universe 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.870
 helpless lazy way 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.570
 hoping to collect all the details 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.300
 will have to open the menu every 20 meters 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.510
 without exaggeration it is and check 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.310
 Did a new message appear? 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.620
 easier to spit on the chatter on the code q and 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.150
 just watch the screensaver you lose 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.700
 a series of references to the rest of the games in the series 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.490
 away and they are not as much as I would like 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.620
 fans, but the rate of narration will be 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.260
 noticeably more cheerful direction here is quite 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.640
 Kaji man's eyes flash 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.950
 dramatic scenes 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.830
 and common sense puts a bullet in 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.810
 The temple degree of madness in mbr is even higher than 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.840
 in home projects kojima production 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.330
 there is a hero they cut the airplanes swords and not 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.330
 ran on a dozen flying missiles such 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.400
 nonsense can not be attributed even to nanomachines though 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.940
 platinum games and trying to turn on 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.790
 logic 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.070
 This is probably the main thing that the videos 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.060
 Yakuts episodes delivered stylishly and 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.490
 breathtaking 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.440
 good and boss battles 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.170
 accompaniment of interactive melodies 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.390
 brought the villain to the next stage music 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.250
 became more aggressive the climax 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.190
 vocals are connected to it 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.010
 the situation is being crammed masterfully by you 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.350
 hardly hold back a victorious experience 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.690
 the game itself looks very poor 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.210
 scenery primitive concrete box 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.120
 from small parts not playstation level 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.950
 3 and xbox 360 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.630
 characters are decently for nothing 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.450
 screensavers sometimes scares them curve 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.360
 animating a variety of enemies a little 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.310
 allocations are not impressive in size if 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.610
 you numbers from barbarism on the radio 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:32.550
 voyage africa abkhazia mexico usa pakistan 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.350
 take about 5 hours and no 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:38.570
 virtual leaves 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.570
 if this pill is not a sweetener
