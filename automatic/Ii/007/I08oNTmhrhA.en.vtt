on your wish list well you're in luck if
you<00:00:12.360> haven't<00:00:12.540> picked<00:00:12.599> one<00:00:12.719> up<00:00:12.870> already

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
you haven't picked one up already

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.560 
you haven't picked one up already
because<00:00:13.380> EVGA<00:00:13.830> has<00:00:14.130> released<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.639> dual<00:00:15.150> slot

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570

it's<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.170> same<00:00:19.439> thing<00:00:19.820> what's<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.880> advantage

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
it's the same thing what's the advantage

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.599 
it's the same thing what's the advantage
of<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.449> being<00:00:21.600> bigger<00:00:21.840> look<00:00:22.500> quiz<00:00:22.920> pop<00:00:23.279> quiz<00:00:23.460> do

worse<00:00:30.029> everyone<00:00:30.840> knows<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.050> mass<00:00:31.470> times

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
worse everyone knows that mass times

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.670 
worse everyone knows that mass times
acceleration<00:00:32.360> equals<00:00:33.360> pain<00:00:33.570> everybody<00:00:34.500> knows

acceleration equals pain everybody knows

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.770 
acceleration equals pain everybody knows
that<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.790> mass<00:00:36.270> times

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
that and this one is mass times

that and this one is mass times
acceleration<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.649> equals<00:00:38.280> framerate

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
acceleration and that equals framerate

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.229 
acceleration and that equals framerate
pain<00:00:40.219> that's<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.430> great<00:00:41.790> runs<00:00:41.969> cooler

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
pain that's just great runs cooler

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.880 
pain that's just great runs cooler
because<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> nicer<00:00:43.320> fan<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> lot

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
because it's got a nicer fan and a lot

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.529 
because it's got a nicer fan and a lot
of<00:00:43.920> people<00:00:44.250> who<00:00:44.640> are<00:00:44.730> installing<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
of people who are installing this and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.260 
of people who are installing this and
it's<00:00:45.629> gonna<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.870> their<00:00:46.020> primary<00:00:46.230> card<00:00:47.239> 90%<00:00:48.239> of

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
it's gonna be their primary card 90% of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.360 
it's gonna be their primary card 90% of
the<00:00:48.360> time<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> I'd<00:00:48.930> say<00:00:49.170> they're<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:50.100> gonna<00:00:50.190> be

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the time I I'd say they're not gonna be

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.920 
the time I I'd say they're not gonna be
putting<00:00:50.520> anything<00:00:50.879> beside<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.360> now<00:00:51.840> if

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
putting anything beside this now if

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.590 
putting anything beside this now if
you're<00:00:52.050> running<00:00:52.170> SLI<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:53.100> SLI<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:54.210> unit

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
you're running SLI you can SLI this unit

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.340 
you're running SLI you can SLI this unit
with<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.899> standard<00:00:55.940> single<00:00:56.940> slot<00:00:57.230> 9600<00:00:58.230> GT

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
with the standard single slot 9600 GT

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.540 
with the standard single slot 9600 GT
which<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:58.890> cool<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.190> run<00:00:59.399> this

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
which is really cool you can run this

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.889 
which is really cool you can run this
one<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.940> then<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.600> single

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
one and then you can have the single

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.060 
one and then you can have the single
slot<00:01:01.050> one<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.379> beside<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
slot one right beside it so if you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.560 
slot one right beside it so if you
already<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> single<00:01:02.670> slot<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.030> pick<00:01:03.449> this

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
already have a single slot one pick this

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.270 
already have a single slot one pick this
one<00:01:03.719> up<00:01:03.780> it'll<00:01:04.080> keep<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> heat<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.189> your

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
one up it'll keep the heat in your

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.920 
one up it'll keep the heat in your
system<00:01:05.640> down<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.570> does<00:01:06.720> run<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
system down because this one does run a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020 
system down because this one does run a
little<00:01:07.080> cooler<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.490> runs<00:01:08.670> great<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.909> mean

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
little cooler and it runs great I mean

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.840 
little cooler and it runs great I mean
it's<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.229> 9600<00:01:10.710> GT<00:01:11.130> which<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.580> an<00:01:11.700> awesome

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
it's it's a 9600 GT which is an awesome

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.149 
it's it's a 9600 GT which is an awesome
card<00:01:12.299> now<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:13.020> does<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.320> one<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
card now what does this one have and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.320 
card now what does this one have and
what<00:01:14.549> makes<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:14.909> special

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
what makes it so special

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.530 
what makes it so special
it's<00:01:15.659> got<00:01:15.810> 64<00:01:16.290> stream<00:01:16.590> processors<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.540> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
it's got 64 stream processors and the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.270 
it's got 64 stream processors and the
reason<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.900> these<00:01:19.020> cards<00:01:19.320> are<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.830> fast<00:01:20.070> with

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
reason that these cards are so fast with

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.770 
reason that these cards are so fast with
their<00:01:20.400> stream<00:01:20.610> processors<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.270> because<00:01:21.659> they

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
their stream processors is because they

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.490 
their stream processors is because they
clock<00:01:22.049> them<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.350> I

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
clock them so I

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.590 
clock them so I
this<00:01:22.830> one's<00:01:23.009> clocked<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.400> 16<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:24.000> 25<00:01:24.420> that's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
this one's clocked at 16 at 25 that's

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.289 
this one's clocked at 16 at 25 that's
the<00:01:24.780> shader<00:01:25.049> clock<00:01:25.380> now<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.790> core<00:01:26.970> clock<00:01:27.119> is

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the shader clock now the core clock is

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.580 
the shader clock now the core clock is
at<00:01:27.450> 600<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.520> 650<00:01:29.520> megahertz<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.470> also<00:01:31.470> we

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
at 600 and 650 megahertz and also we

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.179 
at 600 and 650 megahertz and also we
have<00:01:31.680> 512<00:01:32.220> megabytes<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.900> gddr3<00:01:34.040> it's<00:01:35.040> also

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
have 512 megabytes of gddr3 it's also

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.060 
have 512 megabytes of gddr3 it's also
256<00:01:35.939> bit<00:01:36.119> carb<00:01:36.390> now<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.990> memory<00:01:37.710> clock<00:01:37.920> on

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
256 bit carb now the memory clock on

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.450 
256 bit carb now the memory clock on
this<00:01:38.189> effectively<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.380> 1800<00:01:40.380> megahertz<00:01:40.560> so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
this effectively is 1800 megahertz so

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.679

it<00:03:28.170> does<00:03:28.380> run<00:03:28.560> cooler<00:03:28.800> it's<00:03:29.220> got<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.430> nice<00:03:29.580> fan

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
it does run cooler it's got the nice fan

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.400 
it does run cooler it's got the nice fan
and<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.330> can<00:03:30.510> overclock<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.080> heck<00:03:31.230> out<00:03:31.380> of

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
and you can overclock the heck out of

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.140 
and you can overclock the heck out of
this<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:32.040> guess<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.730> moral<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.120> story

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
this so I guess the moral of the story

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.120 
this so I guess the moral of the story
is<00:03:33.480> here<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.500> you're<00:03:34.680> getting<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:34.920> lot<00:03:35.100> for

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
is here is that you're getting a lot for

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.250 
is here is that you're getting a lot for
the<00:03:35.370> money<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:36.000> can<00:03:36.120> pick<00:03:36.269> up<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:36.510> card<00:03:36.780> plus

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
the money you can pick up this card plus

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.920 
the money you can pick up this card plus
money<00:03:37.470> than<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.739> 8800<00:03:38.250> GT<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:39.660> believe

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
money than the 8800 GT and I believe

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.270 
money than the 8800 GT and I believe
it's<00:03:40.019> less<00:03:40.170> money<00:03:40.350> than<00:03:40.530> most<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:40.920> 38

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280

the box that's nice on the other side
here<00:04:47.260> we<00:04:47.380> do<00:04:47.530> need<00:04:47.710> one<00:04:47.889> 6<00:04:48.160> pin<00:04:48.370> PCI<00:04:48.400> Express

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
here we do need one 6 pin PCI Express

here we do need one 6 pin PCI Express
connector<00:04:49.570> they<00:04:49.960> recommend<00:04:50.350> using<00:04:50.470> over<00:04:50.770> a

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
connector they recommend using over a

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.409 
connector they recommend using over a
400<00:04:51.250> watt<00:04:51.370> power<00:04:51.550> supply<00:04:51.699> so<00:04:52.120> this<00:04:52.240> doesn't

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
400 watt power supply so this doesn't

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:53.250 
400 watt power supply so this doesn't
require<00:04:52.600> a<00:04:52.750> lot<00:04:52.930> of<00:04:53.020> power

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
require a lot of power

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.320 
require a lot of power
typically<00:04:53.949> we<00:04:54.070> recommend<00:04:54.100> over<00:04:54.610> 500<00:04:55.000> Watts<00:04:55.150> in

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
typically we recommend over 500 Watts in

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.430
