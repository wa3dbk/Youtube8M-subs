along to check to see if there's a baby
bird<00:00:28.050> inside<00:00:29.269> you<00:00:30.269> can't<00:00:30.570> really<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:30.869> this

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
bird inside you can't really do this

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.069 
bird inside you can't really do this
with<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.650> very<00:00:32.099> low<00:00:32.399> wattage<00:00:32.730> bulb<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
with a very low wattage bulb in the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.810 
with a very low wattage bulb in the
light<00:00:34.260> bulb<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.950> flashlight<00:00:35.219> because

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
light bulb in that flashlight because

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.060 
light bulb in that flashlight because
big<00:00:36.630> eggs<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.260> light<00:00:37.440> doesn't<00:00:37.620> always<00:00:37.829> go

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
big eggs the light doesn't always go

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.650 
big eggs the light doesn't always go
through<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.730> can't<00:00:38.969> really<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> bird

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
through so you can't really see the bird

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.139 
through so you can't really see the bird
but<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.110> one's<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.440> good<00:00:40.590> one<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.910> not

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
but this one's a good one and I have not

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.600 
but this one's a good one and I have not
handled<00:00:43.050> them<00:00:43.230> yet<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.190> know<00:00:44.460> if

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
handled them yet so you do not know if

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 
handled them yet so you do not know if
there's<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> baby<00:00:45.090> bird<00:00:45.420> inside<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.230> we're

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
to flesh that out at the egg okay one

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:12.140 
to flesh that out at the egg okay one
Ellen<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.860> here's<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.280> egg

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.830 

oh<00:01:13.550> it<00:01:14.550> looks<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.910> there's<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.180> baby<00:01:15.360> bird<00:01:15.630> in

oh it looks like there's a baby bird in
there<00:01:16.850> do<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.910> go<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.540> veins

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
there do you go see the little veins

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.300 
there do you go see the little veins
that's<00:01:20.190> how<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.550> can<00:01:20.790> tell<00:01:21.060> if<00:01:21.840> there<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
that's how you can tell if there is a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.330 
that's how you can tell if there is a
bird<00:01:23.940> and<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.300> try<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.860> check<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.040> see<00:01:26.220> if<00:01:26.280> you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
bird and you try to check to see if you

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.910 
bird and you try to check to see if you
see<00:01:26.580> any<00:01:26.700> veins<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.510> when<00:01:28.260> there<00:01:28.440> is<00:01:28.470> that

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
see any veins and when there is that

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.020 
see any veins and when there is that
usually<00:01:29.250> means<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.520> there's<00:01:29.760> a<00:01:29.820> living

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
usually means that there's a living

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.480 
usually means that there's a living
thing<00:01:30.150> there's<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> tiny<00:01:31.500> little<00:01:31.710> moving<00:01:32.250> dot

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
thing there's a tiny little moving dot

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.460 
thing there's a tiny little moving dot
in<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.910> middle<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.300> can<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.480> that's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
in the middle you can see that's

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.440 
in the middle you can see that's
probably<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.130> forming<00:01:35.610> little<00:01:35.910> baby<00:01:36.120> bird

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
probably the forming little baby bird

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.370 
probably the forming little baby bird
and<00:01:37.820> this<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.150> light<00:01:39.330> does<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.570> harm<00:01:40.050> them<00:01:40.230> it

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
and this the light does not harm them it

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.500 
and this the light does not harm them it
can't<00:01:40.890> hurt<00:01:41.040> them<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.370> all<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.180> do<00:01:42.360> not

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
can't hurt them at all so you do not

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.570 
can't hurt them at all so you do not
have<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.960> worry<00:01:43.290> about<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:44.040> hurting<00:01:44.310> them

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
have to worry about this hurting them

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.740 
have to worry about this hurting them
it's<00:01:45.420> got<00:01:45.510> another<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:46.320> see<00:01:50.450> okay

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
it's got another one and see okay

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.450 
it's got another one and see okay
this<00:01:52.050> is<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.260> smallest<00:01:52.619> egg<00:01:52.950> out<00:01:53.160> of<00:01:53.190> all<00:01:53.430> of

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
this is a smallest egg out of all of

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.280 
this is a smallest egg out of all of
them<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:54.150> still<00:01:54.300> pretty<00:01:54.570> big<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
them it's still pretty big what is the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.800 
them it's still pretty big what is the
smallest<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:56.060> see<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.119> there's<00:01:57.300> anything<00:01:57.510> in

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
smallest one see if there's anything in

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.370 
smallest one see if there's anything in
here<00:01:57.860> okay<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.660> was<00:02:00.660> thinking<00:02:00.720> that<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.200> one

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
here okay I was thinking that this one

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.930 
here okay I was thinking that this one
would<00:02:01.470> be<00:02:01.530> too<00:02:01.800> small<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.400> baby<00:02:02.670> bird

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
would be too small to have a baby bird

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.719 
would be too small to have a baby bird
but<00:02:03.890> there<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:07.190> it's<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.310> little<00:02:08.550> bit

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
but there is one here it's a little bit

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.370 
but there is one here it's a little bit
