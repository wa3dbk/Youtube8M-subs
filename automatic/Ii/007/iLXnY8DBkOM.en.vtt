 Well guys, I'm already here with 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.309
 my two great lovers that are the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.640
 shit and fish on the left 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.200
 my little world that today under pardon 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.240
 by the pulse and by the quality and by the 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.820
 sound that I am recording with my mobile 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.530
 fucking and doing it a little bit no but 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.950
 I'm seriously recording with my cell phone and 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.770
 my pulse is to steal tambourine I do not know 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.270
 if the light is fine I do not know I do not know how 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.430
 this is the first time I do this 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.360
 but good to the left until the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.700
 old computer 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.890
 I will miss you dearly but here 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.890
 is my new most earthly pc 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.730
 I have a pc more you laugh good because it is 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.530
 be here to see how I catch on the 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.690
 angle shingle 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.940
 and I think that what is mounted is 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.020
 in my room by the way is the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.020
 old I had but here 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.620
 I 'm riding it to the state as four 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.940
 horitas riding it takes me a while 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.220
 I really like to be quiet but 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.260
 well I will teach a little more or 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.750
 less what it is worth well over 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.550
 but then I'll teach it better with the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.510
 computer turned on i go out a test of 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.510
 blaze up 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.050
 so the first thing we have here 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.710
 is a 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.620
 the source is of power with the source of 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.040
 food is worth a victory of 630 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.080
 watts worth I think it's enough 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.570
 I caught this one I do not know I've always had 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.320
 good always the old one that I had the be 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.150
 quiet also 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:07.940
 of 500 so he decided to fuck me 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.940
 this here is the hard drive 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.010
 if it's a hard disk seagate barracuda not 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.010
 I know what the fuck 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.240
 but there is the disc I do not know if it looks 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.570
 well in 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.420
 a job here we have the ssd of 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:33.580
 agreement that it is a samsung solid state 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:38.470
 drive a ssd point of 250 gigas I do not 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:43.490
 I remember more precisely because here is the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:46.790
 floppy disk drive here we have the 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.710
 the dissipator is worth as I do this not 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.920
 no no I can not be turning to camera 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.200
 I think it's here the lemon support was this 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.210
 it's a cooler master of agreement I do not know what 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.560
 brand is now about the brand 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.840
 model but I know it's a cooler master 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.459
 you can see it 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:08.660
 and cooler master of agreement there are the 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:15.530
 two plates which are branch x yauri 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:18.590
 x I do not know what balls 1600 CD4 I say 8 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.530
 gb each one are cl 9 so they are something 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.060
 faster good in the box it's worth 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.370
 has four fans has two 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.349
 up 61 in the background and another there in the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.250
 front panel according to the box is 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:37.410
 a palm 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.940
 because this is a better salt is a 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.880
 is white that the truth that I 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.260
 really like here is the front panel 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.090
 It's simple and I like it like it is 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.470
 I'm probably sweating but this one 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.870
 here it's hot and I have the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.750
 air out of the room and do here 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.280
 a heat of noses and I'm sweating and 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.350
 my uncles 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.500
 Well, the motherboard is good 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.870
 which is a rock h 97 but as you can 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.640
 see there 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.410
 same with the rom that equal my three 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.380
 last base plates sonar rock and everything 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.540
 perfect, so he decided to repeat with 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.500
 them and good since it's on the card 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.790
 graph 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:20.630
 scott and as we would say is the appointment for the 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.810
 the gtx 970 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.880
 and pc master the kid is what happens that 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.460
 we do not see any side 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.280
 I have not seen before and I'm surprised that gb does not 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.490
 let's put no side what is the model 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.460

 motherboard is there the ram can not 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.230
 continue to be worth 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.670
 61 thousand to 600 watts 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.460
 the heatsink could also be worth the 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.040
 plate more of this new also the disk 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.530
