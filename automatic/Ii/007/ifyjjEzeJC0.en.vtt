00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:21.060
 so we melt the mango butter on 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:22.890
 water bath looks like manga oil 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.890
 the original here and so well, such as in 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.599
 grains like ghee and i have to 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.930
 note that this 2 jar is so 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.910
 liked that first one just left 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:44.670
 quite a bit because I'm on my hair 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:48.149
 she used very much our butter she 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.030
 ready and it should not be very warm 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.890
 hot add up oil there she is 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.890
 just a few drops and 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.629
 Well, this is probably 5 droplets 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.110
 that is, 5 droplets of oil on my friend in 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:09.570
 the green color is very very soft and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:12.570
 very nutritious and as long as our butter and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.420
 warm add glycerin here 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.420
 I have vegetable glycerin 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:35.479
 well , add one of the most important 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.400
 ingredients literally that's just and even 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.600
 less on the tip you now look 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.600
 how much is a minute 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.910
 here so literally do not overdo it and 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.100
 those who have any allergies 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.500
 the reaction to honey by no means we go there 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.290
 don't add let's a little bit more 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.180
 probably here and that is the knife at the tip 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:09.270
 bowls whether there still remained a little window 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:11.520
 and I will not walk anymore I think that 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.530
 need to add another handle glycerin 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.620
 This will look at the consistency but 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.630
 I want him to be some more 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.700
 more gelatinous and good all this 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.820
 knead i. need of course 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.020
 patience time firstly pleasant smell 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.550
 scarlet 3 of course 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.550
 for skin tone 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.310
 two drops no more because you can 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.110
 learn the word too much with this gay 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.319
 get a defect back you can 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.319
 just ruin the skin a little 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.069
 well and in the end 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.170
 if you have here add 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.920
 hyaluronic acid you can also 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:06.940
 open the capsule and mix it in well 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:12.030
 I add water somewhere 1 2 3 4 no need 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.680
 5 5 drops and hyaluronic acid 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.950
 if you do not have it do not upset 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.349
 You can do without it and now I'm going 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.160
 skirt but send such a beautiful jar 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:27.750
 inherited from 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.750
 the mouth of the streaks fill and leave 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.750
 freeze
