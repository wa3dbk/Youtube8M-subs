00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.589
 because people today are putting the area in the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.029
 dsl nano go that is a camera 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.680
 stabilizer over which I already have one 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.870
 video made so or a 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.970
 testvideo and in the video I want 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.460
 Show you today how to do it all 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.320
 balancing I think the test images 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.900
 speak for themselves there is no 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.939
 review necessary only the balance itself 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.009
 It is just difficult the whole thing will be 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.269
 scored with this weight would have been there 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.460
 below and with a few others 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.109
 Setting mechanisms up around that 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.970
 whole just fine tune 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.580
 do you keep that in balance 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.590
 this handle must be perfect in 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.120
 Libra be trained with it 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.140
 besides, one has one below 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.030
 extendable rod flaig mdr nano 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.500
 So that's just what I do that job 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.190
 will show later 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.840
 The whole beast is good at acting 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.340
 you can see practically so high 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.120
 it's about easy here 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.000
 estimate 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.280
 to build on top buys you on 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.830
 best a quick release plate with it 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.720
 your camera quickly and easily from 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.600
 and could pack again for everyone 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.200
 who now also have a canon 60d 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.539
 with the 18 135 mm lens it is 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.159
 tutorial practically perfect because of that 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.299
 right here adjusted to this camera 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.820
 I will bring this quick release 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.619
 plate due to the camera arrangement of the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.880
 now a little further to the left from behind 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.499
 seen on the camera with this 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.990
 actually for a screw that is 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:24.240
 a special screw so you should 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.369
 which in any case do not lose the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.859
 kitchen display can be found at the bottom of the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.859
 make a camera and thus the small one 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:34.109
 schnitzer mooring if you like the whole 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.329
 then it should have fastened about like that 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.889
 look and we have down there though 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.499
 even those fat weights on it 

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:43.380
 I'm doing this upper weight package 

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:44.789
 always gone because that's really too 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.459
 hard for the camera and the there 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.079
 upstairs now so handy around then dangling 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.499
 I'll take two little ones down below 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.299
 plates out because of each 95 grams 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:57.090
 So it is actually right 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.159
 hard if you have the other three 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.689
 or four in there then you have to trust 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.709
 the whole thing does that on the other 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.709
 course, too 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.759
 then I recommend with this attitude 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.039
 still this rod to extend something 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.900
 since this drop test I after 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.370
 I'll stress again a little bit 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.260
 makes better and therefore the camera 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.760
 makes it seem even more stable now 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.580
 Get ready for the first test and can 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.980
 lift up the flag mdr nano and look 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.540
 as the camera tends when you do that 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.720
 you have to do with these little ones just 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.220
 you just wheel up this plate 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.320
 shift that tilt just so 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.260
 is practically compensated for it 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.840
 on the side 2 and below 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.410
 Below four screws on this matter 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.910
 to balance it exactly 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.400
 that can always take a little longer so 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.780
 've really there with a bit of patience 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.070
 Exercise is actually relatively 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.590
 quickly then goes always two 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.330
 It has everything 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.370
 no problem 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.750
 At some point the whole thing is parried 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.790
 is perfect and you can see the camera 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.700
 then sit up normally and do this job 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.470
 mooring it's just that 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.450
 this if you have the camera on the side 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.120
 what I also show here that the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.250
 camera something like this almost two 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.220
 takes seconds until he falls down 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.630
 what can be seen here now what it may 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.500
 Do not be so fast that is not allowed 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.120
 to be too long 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.760
 you can see that actually here 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.250
 everything is perfectly balanced you can 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.230
 then also here this armbruster 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.299
 take the burden a bit 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.519
 and you should stop testing 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.739
 look afterwards that the camera always 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.340
 it does not matter how far you go 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.959
 Camera moves up and down should 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.090
 you also necessarily test that you 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.850
 the camera still forward and after 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.780
 the back tends that 's it for 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.519
 this video 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.230
 Thank you for seeing it if you are 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.610
 liked if it helped you 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.880
 I'm sure a thumb 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.650
 high 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.030
 if you have more stuff in this direction 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.280
 you can like to see me 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.780
 Subscribe and I would say then see 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.780
 we'll just go to the next video
