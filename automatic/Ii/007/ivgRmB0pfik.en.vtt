hi and welcome to the unboxing video for
the<00:00:10.879> highway<00:00:12.010> e9<00:00:13.010> mini<00:00:13.400> Wi-Fi<00:00:13.969> modem<00:00:14.420> I<00:00:14.599> got

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
the highway e9 mini Wi-Fi modem I got

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.850 
the highway e9 mini Wi-Fi modem I got
this<00:00:15.710> modem<00:00:16.160> through<00:00:16.820> Optus<00:00:17.240> it's<00:00:17.509> a<00:00:17.689> 4G<00:00:18.349> modem

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
this modem through Optus it's a 4G modem

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.060 
this modem through Optus it's a 4G modem
and<00:00:19.570> this<00:00:20.570> is<00:00:20.720> just<00:00:20.960> to<00:00:21.080> replace<00:00:21.439> a<00:00:22.540> 3G<00:00:24.070> USB

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
and this is just to replace a 3G USB

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.060 
and this is just to replace a 3G USB
modem<00:00:25.579> that<00:00:25.820> I<00:00:26.390> have<00:00:26.720> at<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.899> moment<00:00:27.070> I

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
modem that I have at the moment I

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.830 
modem that I have at the moment I
thought<00:00:28.579> this<00:00:28.790> would<00:00:28.939> be<00:00:28.970> more<00:00:29.390> handy

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
thought this would be more handy

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
thought this would be more handy
particularly<00:00:30.829> that<00:00:30.980> it's<00:00:31.460> a<00:00:31.759> Wi-Fi<00:00:32.570> hotspot

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
particularly that it's a Wi-Fi hotspot

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.650 
particularly that it's a Wi-Fi hotspot
it's<00:00:33.860> also<00:00:34.040> battery<00:00:34.670> powered<00:00:34.969> which<00:00:35.210> means<00:00:35.540> I

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
it's also battery powered which means I

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.910 
it's also battery powered which means I
don't<00:00:35.809> need<00:00:35.989> to<00:00:36.110> have<00:00:36.230> it<00:00:36.350> connected<00:00:36.739> to<00:00:36.800> a

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
don't need to have it connected to a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.479 
don't need to have it connected to a
computer<00:00:37.570> or<00:00:38.570> a<00:00:38.780> power<00:00:39.410> outlet<00:00:39.739> for<00:00:40.250> it<00:00:40.339> to

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
computer or a power outlet for it to

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.049 
computer or a power outlet for it to
work<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.629> it's<00:00:42.050> rated<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.589> work<00:00:42.769> between<00:00:43.219> 6<00:00:43.850> to

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
work and it's rated to work between 6 to

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.869 
work and it's rated to work between 6 to
10<00:00:44.269> hours<00:00:44.449> but<00:00:44.809> of<00:00:45.050> course<00:00:45.320> that<00:00:45.469> will<00:00:45.589> vary

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
10 hours but of course that will vary

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.189 
10 hours but of course that will vary
depending<00:00:46.879> upon<00:00:47.149> how<00:00:47.420> many<00:00:47.600> devices<00:00:47.870> you<00:00:48.170> have

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
depending upon how many devices you have

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.130 
depending upon how many devices you have
hooked<00:00:48.469> up<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.829> it<00:00:48.949> so<00:00:49.820> without<00:00:50.420> further<00:00:50.659> ado

nothing fantastic there pretty standard
stuff<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:12.640> we'll<00:03:13.640> look<00:03:13.760> at<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.120> modem<00:03:14.630> itself

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
stuff and we'll look at the modem itself

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:24.069 
stuff and we'll look at the modem itself
right<00:03:15.590> here<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:21.110> there<00:03:21.890> we<00:03:21.980> go<00:03:22.360> just<00:03:23.360> looking

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
right here so there we go just looking

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.600 
right here so there we go just looking
around<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.410> side<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:24.799> this<00:03:24.920> is<00:03:24.980> where<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.370> SIM

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.540 
without having to use code micro SD slot
there<00:04:01.849> we<00:04:01.940> go<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:03.170> reset<00:04:03.950> button<00:04:03.980> if<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.520> need

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
there we go a reset button if you need

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.500 
there we go a reset button if you need
to<00:04:04.760> do<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:05.209> hardware<00:04:05.930> where<00:04:06.349> you

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
to do a hardware where you

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.039 
to do a hardware where you
set<00:04:06.689> and<00:04:06.959> it's<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.799> microUSB<00:04:08.250> slot

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
set and it's the microUSB slot

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.380 
set and it's the microUSB slot
doesn't<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.890> don't<00:04:11.700> think<00:04:11.879> you<00:04:11.970> can<00:04:12.060> actually

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
doesn't I don't think you can actually

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.360 
doesn't I don't think you can actually
crack<00:04:12.659> this<00:04:12.840> open<00:04:13.049> so<00:04:13.620> it<00:04:13.680> might<00:04:13.829> be<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.040> sealed

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
crack this open so it might be a sealed

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.379 
crack this open so it might be a sealed
unit<00:04:14.760> with<00:04:14.879> a<00:04:14.909> battery<00:04:15.810> inside<00:04:16.310> but<00:04:17.310> um<00:04:17.519> yeah

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
unit with a battery inside but um yeah

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.560 
unit with a battery inside but um yeah
and<00:04:19.519> let's<00:04:20.519> just<00:04:20.699> see<00:04:20.880> if<00:04:20.940> there's<00:04:21.120> any<00:04:21.269> juice

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
and let's just see if there's any juice

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.830 
and let's just see if there's any juice
in<00:04:21.750> here

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
in here

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.580 
in here
okay<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:24.900> there's<00:04:25.229> some<00:04:25.440> juice<00:04:27.380> we'll<00:04:28.380> just

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
okay so there's some juice we'll just

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.740 
okay so there's some juice we'll just
see<00:04:28.800> where<00:04:29.130> this<00:04:29.280> goes<00:04:29.550> now<00:04:29.580> I'm<00:04:30.030> not<00:04:30.210> actually

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
see where this goes now I'm not actually

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.320 
see where this goes now I'm not actually
in<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.990> 4G<00:04:31.440> area<00:04:31.800> they<00:04:32.580> haven't<00:04:32.820> rolled<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.180> out

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
in a 4G area they haven't rolled it out

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.460 
in a 4G area they haven't rolled it out
yet<00:04:33.919> but<00:04:34.919> we'll<00:04:35.789> see<00:04:36.090> what<00:04:36.870> happens<00:04:37.229> when<00:04:37.410> I

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
yet but we'll see what happens when I

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.050 
yet but we'll see what happens when I
get<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:38.100> I'm<00:04:39.050> going<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.110> get<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.380> work<00:04:41.060> they'll

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
get to I'm going to get to work they'll

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.700

telling me the Wi-Fi is on usually in

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.020 
telling me the Wi-Fi is on usually in
this<00:05:04.350> part<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.830> screen<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.490> top<00:05:05.700> left

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
this part of the screen the top left

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.970 
this part of the screen the top left
it'll<00:05:06.330> tell<00:05:06.600> you<00:05:06.750> what<00:05:06.900> sort<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.170> signal<00:05:07.620> you

it'll tell you what sort of signal you

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:15.080 
it'll tell you what sort of signal you
have<00:05:08.010> if<00:05:08.370> I<00:05:08.520> remember<00:05:08.880> correctly<00:05:13.910> you<00:05:14.910> got

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
have if I remember correctly you got

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.780 
have if I remember correctly you got
battery<00:05:15.630> there<00:05:16.290> and<00:05:16.620> down<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.460> bottom<00:05:17.580> it

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
battery there and down the bottom it

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.130 
battery there and down the bottom it
tells<00:05:17.820> you<00:05:18.090> what<00:05:18.210> sort<00:05:18.420> of<00:05:18.480> Wi-Fi<00:05:18.900> security

you've<00:05:19.530> got<00:05:19.770> going<00:05:20.040> there<00:05:20.660> and<00:05:21.660> I<00:05:21.720> think

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.170 

which<00:05:28.890> button<00:05:29.370> is<00:05:29.520> it<00:05:31.040> okay<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.220> think<00:05:32.400> once<00:05:33.090> you

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
which button is it okay I think once you

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.300 
which button is it okay I think once you
got<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.450> semen<00:05:33.840> you<00:05:34.050> can<00:05:34.200> press<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.680> Wi-Fi

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
got the semen you can press the Wi-Fi

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.810 
got the semen you can press the Wi-Fi
button<00:05:35.640> it'll<00:05:36.000> toggle<00:05:37.190> information<00:05:38.190> such<00:05:38.790> as

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
button it'll toggle information such as

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.260 
button it'll toggle information such as
the<00:05:41.000> SSID<00:05:42.000> so<00:05:42.480> the<00:05:42.780> access<00:05:43.110> point<00:05:43.440> name

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
the SSID so the access point name

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.660 
the SSID so the access point name
password<00:05:45.270> to<00:05:46.020> connect<00:05:46.410> so<00:05:46.860> you<00:05:46.890> don't<00:05:47.160> forget

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
password to connect so you don't forget

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.690 
password to connect so you don't forget
it<00:05:47.910> and<00:05:48.680> other<00:05:49.680> information<00:05:49.980> I<00:05:50.370> think<00:05:50.430> like

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
it and other information I think like

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.790 
it and other information I think like
the<00:05:50.820> I<00:05:50.850> me<00:05:51.150> and<00:05:51.270> that<00:05:51.390> sort<00:05:51.630> of<00:05:51.720> thing<00:05:51.930> but

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
anyway that's it that's the unboxing

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.080 
anyway that's it that's the unboxing
