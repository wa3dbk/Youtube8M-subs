you can tell it is some kind of an alien

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.229 
you can tell it is some kind of an alien
if<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:24.060> flip<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.810> calls<00:03:25.169> you<00:03:25.319> a<00:03:25.349> ghost<00:03:26.239> school

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
if you flip the calls you a ghost school

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.900 
if you flip the calls you a ghost school
around<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.260> then<00:03:28.620> at<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.950> start<00:03:29.340> some<00:03:29.760> other

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
around and then at the start some other

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.409 
around and then at the start some other
stuff<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.690> looks<00:03:31.049> like<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.099> it<00:03:33.060> looks

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
stuff it looks like that and it looks

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.650 
stuff it looks like that and it looks
like<00:03:33.569> an<00:03:33.810> alien<00:03:34.019> with<00:03:34.650> bangs<00:03:35.160> bangs<00:03:35.940> or<00:03:36.359> bangs

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
like an alien with bangs bangs or bangs

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.860 
like an alien with bangs bangs or bangs
one<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.169> them<00:03:37.519> so<00:03:38.519> that's<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.840> that's

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
one of them so that's so that's

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.979 
one of them so that's so that's
possibility<00:03:40.799> of<00:03:40.889> dinosaurs<00:03:41.609> and<00:03:41.880> aliens<00:03:42.690> just

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
possibility of dinosaurs and aliens just

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.280 
possibility of dinosaurs and aliens just
there<00:03:44.329> hopefully<00:03:45.329> in<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.540> future<00:03:45.750> we'll<00:03:46.049> find

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
there hopefully in the future we'll find

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.220 
there hopefully in the future we'll find
out<00:03:46.470> more<00:03:46.500> but<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.720> then<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.840> next<00:03:48.870> one<00:03:49.169> is

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
out more but and then the next one is

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.120 
out more but and then the next one is
cabin<00:03:49.829> fever<00:03:50.280> make<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.690> cabin<00:03:52.169> so<00:03:52.620> you

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
cabin fever make it to the cabin so you

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.900 
cabin fever make it to the cabin so you
probably<00:03:53.160> got<00:03:54.120> some<00:03:54.660> kind<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.280> like<00:03:56.280> clock<00:03:56.639> if

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
probably got some kind of like clock if

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.420 
probably got some kind of like clock if
you<00:03:57.000> go<00:03:57.090> back<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.299> sprint<00:03:57.870> now<00:03:58.019> we<00:03:58.919> reach<00:03:59.220> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
you go back to sprint now we reach the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.430 
you go back to sprint now we reach the
actual<00:04:00.060> chopper<00:04:00.419> but<00:04:00.690> this<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:01.109> like<00:04:01.260> it's

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
actual chopper but this is like it's

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.229 
actual chopper but this is like it's
gonna<00:04:01.590> be<00:04:01.680> something<00:04:01.829> like<00:04:02.010> make<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.120> the

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
gonna be something like make it to the

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.479 
gonna be something like make it to the
cabin<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.049> it's<00:04:04.530> all<00:04:04.590> going<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:04.889> be<00:04:04.950> really
