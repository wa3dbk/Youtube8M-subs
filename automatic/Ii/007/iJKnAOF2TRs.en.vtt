00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
be working together at first I thought

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.720 
be working together at first I thought
this<00:01:01.320> theory<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:01.770> intriguing<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.460> me<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.699> I

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
this theory was intriguing to me and I

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.160 
this theory was intriguing to me and I
was<00:01:02.850> wearing<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> same<00:01:03.239> clothes<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.049> have

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
was wearing the same clothes and have

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.870 
was wearing the same clothes and have
the<00:01:04.290> same<00:01:04.470> bad<00:01:04.680> haircut<00:01:05.129> when<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.339> read<00:01:05.549> Hitler

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the same bad haircut when I read Hitler

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.850 
the same bad haircut when I read Hitler
and<00:01:06.119> sharks<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.840> share<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.260> same<00:01:07.290> trait<00:01:07.710> as

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and sharks do share the same trait as

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.770 
and sharks do share the same trait as
eating<00:01:08.100> food<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.939> possible<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.540> they

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
eating food so it is possible that they

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.420 
eating food so it is possible that they
could<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:10.049> working<00:01:10.350> together<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.250> got

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
could be working together then I got

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.679 
could be working together then I got
suspicious<00:01:11.850> how<00:01:12.150> could<00:01:12.330> somebody<00:01:12.540> just

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
suspicious how could somebody just

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.719 
suspicious how could somebody just
stumble<00:01:13.170> upon<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.130> their<00:01:14.310> motive

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
stumble upon this what is their motive

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.390 
stumble upon this what is their motive
it<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.030> doesn't<00:01:15.390> add<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.570> unless<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.170> course

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
it just doesn't add up unless of course

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.830 
it just doesn't add up unless of course
they're<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.549> awe<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> thought<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> plan<00:01:18.630> out

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
they're in awe I thought of a plan out

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.230 
they're in awe I thought of a plan out
