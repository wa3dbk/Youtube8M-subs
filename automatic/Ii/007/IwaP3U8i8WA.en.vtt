tiny<00:00:55.900> little<00:00:56.200> seeds<00:00:56.560> I'm<00:00:57.460> just<00:00:57.670> gonna<00:00:57.820> spread

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
tiny little seeds I'm just gonna spread

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.760 
tiny little seeds I'm just gonna spread
the<00:00:58.390> whole<00:00:58.540> packet<00:00:59.050> out<00:00:59.200> in<00:00:59.350> there<00:00:59.560> and<00:00:59.680> then

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
the whole packet out in there and then

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.820 
the whole packet out in there and then
cover<00:01:00.130> them<00:01:00.340> real<00:01:01.270> lightly<00:01:02.050> with<00:01:02.380> a<00:01:02.710> little

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
cover them real lightly with a little

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.390 
cover them real lightly with a little
bit<00:01:03.190> of<00:01:03.370> potting<00:01:04.330> soil<00:01:04.629> and<00:01:05.140> it's<00:01:05.860> pretty<00:01:06.070> dark

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
bit of potting soil and it's pretty dark

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.860 
bit of potting soil and it's pretty dark
and<00:01:06.520> overcast<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.360> I<00:01:07.420> don't<00:01:07.480> think<00:01:07.660> it's

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
and overcast and I don't think it's

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.320 
and overcast and I don't think it's
supposed<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:08.200> rain<00:01:08.470> so<00:01:08.950> I'm<00:01:09.180> thinking<00:01:10.180> it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
supposed to rain so I'm thinking it

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.300 
supposed to rain so I'm thinking it
might<00:01:10.360> be<00:01:10.660> a<00:01:10.900> good<00:01:11.170> night<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.590> plant<00:01:11.890> them<00:01:12.040> and

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
might be a good night to plant them and

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.000 
might be a good night to plant them and
it<00:01:12.940> says<00:01:13.150> on<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.420> packages<00:01:13.990> these<00:01:14.140> take<00:01:14.440> three

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
it says on the packages these take three

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.150 
it says on the packages these take three
to<00:01:15.220> five<00:01:15.460> weeks<00:01:15.910> to<00:01:16.180> germinate<00:01:16.450> so<00:01:17.080> that's<00:01:18.010> a

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
to five weeks to germinate so that's a

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.100 
to five weeks to germinate so that's a
long<00:01:18.370> time<00:01:18.730> hopefully<00:01:19.270> I<00:01:19.300> can<00:01:19.420> remember<00:01:19.810> to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
long time hopefully I can remember to

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.820 
long time hopefully I can remember to
keep<00:01:20.290> them<00:01:20.500> watered<00:01:21.750> as<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:23.050> can<00:01:23.200> see<00:01:23.470> those

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
keep them watered as you can see those

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.750 
keep them watered as you can see those
are<00:01:23.980> really<00:01:24.460> fine<00:01:25.140> little<00:01:26.140> small<00:01:26.590> seeds<00:01:27.040> so<00:01:27.520> I

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
are really fine little small seeds so I

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.120 
are really fine little small seeds so I
spread<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.450> whole<00:01:28.570> packet<00:01:29.080> out<00:01:29.230> over<00:01:29.950> that

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
spread the whole packet out over that

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.490 
spread the whole packet out over that
and<00:01:30.940> I'm<00:01:31.090> gonna<00:01:31.270> cover<00:01:31.690> them<00:01:31.930> lightly<00:01:32.260> with

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
and I'm gonna cover them lightly with

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.460 
and I'm gonna cover them lightly with
potting<00:01:33.370> soil<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.000> then<00:01:34.570> I'll<00:01:34.720> water<00:01:35.200> them

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
potting soil and then I'll water them

00:01:35.470 --> 00:02:14.790 
potting soil and then I'll water them
and<00:01:36.870> we'll<00:01:37.870> see<00:01:37.900> what<00:01:38.200> happens

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.250 
so those seeds are all covered and
watered<00:02:17.770> in<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:19.090> they<00:02:19.360> sprout<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:19.720> guess<00:02:20.080> we'll

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260
