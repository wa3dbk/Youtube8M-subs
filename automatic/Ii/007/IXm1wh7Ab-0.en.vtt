00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
all right this is Rob's detector cells

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.150 
all right this is Rob's detector cells
and<00:00:02.879> this<00:00:03.330> is<00:00:03.449> part<00:00:03.720> two<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.170> video<00:00:04.350> with

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
up then you can see a bigger hole

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.890 
up then you can see a bigger hole
there's<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> couple<00:01:10.650> little<00:01:10.770> tiny<00:01:11.070> holes

attached to some of them ironstone some

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.469 
attached to some of them ironstone some
of<00:01:21.100> these<00:01:21.189> guys<00:01:21.399> were<00:01:21.579> really<00:01:21.759> rough<00:01:24.390> get<00:01:25.390> an

but that's the old Jim Morel like I said

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.990 
but that's the old Jim Morel like I said
I'll<00:01:31.650> probably<00:01:31.860> put<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.189> gold<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:32.790> sale

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
I'll probably put this gold up for sale

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.310 
I'll probably put this gold up for sale
I<00:01:33.030> actually<00:01:33.330> haven't<00:01:33.630> even<00:01:33.750> weighed<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
I actually haven't even weighed with the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.640 
I actually haven't even weighed with the
totalism<00:01:34.799> what's<00:01:35.549> what's<00:01:35.850> right<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.650> but

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
totalism what's what's right here but

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.940 
totalism what's what's right here but
just<00:01:38.520> gives<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.850> demo<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.600> what<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.770> guy

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
just gives you a demo of what this guy

just gives you a demo of what this guy
can<00:01:40.979> do<00:01:41.340> clean<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.180> gold<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.580> Rob<00:01:44.940> with

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
can do clean and gold this is Rob with

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.800 
can do clean and gold this is Rob with
Rob's<00:01:45.390> detector<00:01:45.899> cells<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.009> said

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
Rob's detector cells and like I said

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.870 
Rob's detector cells and like I said
this<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.080> natural<00:01:49.710> gold<00:01:49.890> nuggets<00:01:50.310> from

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
this is a natural gold nuggets from

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.029 
this is a natural gold nuggets from
Arizona<00:01:51.649> right<00:01:52.649> below<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.100> source<00:01:55.039> these

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
Arizona right below the source these

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.410 
Arizona right below the source these
nuggets<00:01:56.399> things<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.789> just<00:01:56.850> been<00:01:57.030> cleaned

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
nuggets things have just been cleaned

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.749 
nuggets things have just been cleaned
and<00:01:57.810> they'll<00:01:58.440> probably<00:01:58.649> go<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:58.950> herself<00:01:59.100> what

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and they'll probably go up herself what
