00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
effect you can now achieve bloom and

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.340 
effect you can now achieve bloom and
glare<00:00:15.379> effects<00:00:15.709> in<00:00:15.889> your<00:00:16.010> renderings<00:00:17.350> first

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
glare effects in your renderings first

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.019 
glare effects in your renderings first
let's<00:00:18.860> have<00:00:18.980> a<00:00:19.070> look<00:00:19.279> at<00:00:19.369> a<00:00:19.400> rendering<00:00:19.910> without

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
let's have a look at a rendering without

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.410 
let's have a look at a rendering without
using<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:20.810> new<00:00:20.930> lens<00:00:21.170> effect<00:00:22.120> this<00:00:23.120> image

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
using the new lens effect this image

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.180 
using the new lens effect this image
looks<00:00:23.630> pretty<00:00:23.840> good<00:00:24.050> but<00:00:24.530> there<00:00:24.710> are<00:00:24.830> a<00:00:24.860> couple

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190 
looks pretty good but there are a couple

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.220 
looks pretty good but there are a couple
simple<00:00:25.430> but<00:00:26.030> important<00:00:26.570> lighting<00:00:26.930> effects

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
simple but important lighting effects

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.470 
simple but important lighting effects
that<00:00:27.380> are<00:00:27.440> missing

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.620 

in<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:31.710> v-ray<00:00:32.040> options<00:00:32.520> let's<00:00:33.000> simply<00:00:33.390> enable

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
in the v-ray options let's simply enable

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.460 
in the v-ray options let's simply enable
the<00:00:33.930> bloom<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.320> glare<00:00:34.559> effects<00:00:36.290> we<00:00:37.290> will

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
the bloom and glare effects we will

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.920 
the bloom and glare effects we will
change<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.920> glare<00:00:38.129> size<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.760> zero<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.420> so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
change the glare size to zero for now so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.050 
change the glare size to zero for now so
that<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.199> focus<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.829> bloom<00:00:41.129> effect

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.190 

you

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.130 

as<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:52.460> can<00:00:52.610> see<00:00:52.850> we<00:00:53.390> now<00:00:53.570> have<00:00:53.600> a<00:00:53.840> bloom

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
as you can see we now have a bloom

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.370 
as you can see we now have a bloom
effect<00:00:54.470> in<00:00:54.620> our<00:00:54.680> image<00:00:55.840> let's<00:00:56.840> take<00:00:57.050> a<00:00:57.080> quick

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
effect in our image let's take a quick

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.140 
effect in our image let's take a quick
look<00:00:57.590> at<00:00:57.800> two<00:00:58.070> of<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.340> bloom<00:00:58.550> parameters

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
look at two of the bloom parameters

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.130 
look at two of the bloom parameters
bloom<00:01:00.020> size<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:00.710> weight<00:01:01.600> you<00:01:02.600> can<00:01:02.810> control

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
bloom size and weight you can control

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.660 
bloom size and weight you can control
the<00:01:03.290> amount<00:01:03.500> of<00:01:03.680> bloom<00:01:03.980> with<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.460> balloon

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
the amount of bloom with the balloon

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.660 
the amount of bloom with the balloon
size<00:01:04.879> parameter<00:01:05.680> larger<00:01:06.680> values<00:01:07.040> increases

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
size parameter larger values increases

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.580 
size parameter larger values increases
the<00:01:07.820> bloom<00:01:08.000> effect<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:08.570> smaller<00:01:09.140> values

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
the bloom effect and smaller values

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.900 
the bloom effect and smaller values
reduce<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.160> effect<00:01:12.430> after<00:01:13.430> changing<00:01:13.880> the

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
reduce the effect after changing the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.610 
reduce the effect after changing the
bloom<00:01:14.180> size<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:14.810> can<00:01:15.020> see<00:01:15.200> how<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.350> bloom

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
bloom size you can see how the bloom

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.450 
bloom size you can see how the bloom
effect<00:01:15.950> is<00:01:16.130> larger<00:01:16.550> in<00:01:17.620> some<00:01:18.620> cases<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:19.310> may

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
effect is larger in some cases you may

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.180 
effect is larger in some cases you may
want<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.760> refine<00:01:20.150> your<00:01:20.180> bloom<00:01:20.570> effect<00:01:21.010> you<00:01:22.010> can

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
want to refine your bloom effect you can

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.620 
want to refine your bloom effect you can
do<00:01:22.370> this<00:01:22.580> by<00:01:22.790> adjusting<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.450> weight

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
do this by adjusting the weight

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.380 
do this by adjusting the weight
parameter

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.660 

now<00:01:29.390> let's<00:01:29.900> change<00:01:30.140> bloom<00:01:30.500> size<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:31.010> zero<00:01:31.040> so

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
now let's change bloom size to zero so

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.210 
now let's change bloom size to zero so
that<00:01:31.790> we<00:01:31.910> can<00:01:32.060> focus<00:01:32.240> on<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.750> glare<00:01:32.960> effect

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.710 

you<00:01:37.220> can<00:01:37.400> control<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.910> amount<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.240> glare<00:01:38.510> with

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
you can control the amount of glare with

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.500 
you can control the amount of glare with
the<00:01:38.840> glare<00:01:39.050> size<00:01:39.320> parameter<00:01:40.150> larger<00:01:41.150> values

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
the glare size parameter larger values

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.510 
the glare size parameter larger values
increase<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:42.080> glare<00:01:42.290> effect<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.860> smaller

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
increase the glare effect and smaller

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.569 
increase the glare effect and smaller
values<00:01:43.940> reduce<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.570> effect

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.840 

now<00:01:48.579> you<00:01:48.640> can<00:01:48.939> see<00:01:49.180> our<00:01:49.360> glare<00:01:49.780> effect

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
now you can see our glare effect

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.520 
now you can see our glare effect
let's<00:01:52.850> take<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.090> look<00:01:53.299> at<00:01:53.540> two<00:01:53.810> more<00:01:53.840> important

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
let's take a look at two more important

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.819 
let's take a look at two more important
lens<00:01:54.920> effects<00:01:55.310> parameters<00:01:56.350> camera<00:01:57.350> num<00:01:57.560> sides

and glare diffraction notice that the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.389 
and glare diffraction notice that the
glare<00:02:01.790> effect<00:02:02.119> has<00:02:02.420> six<00:02:02.689> rays<00:02:02.930> of<00:02:03.140> light<00:02:03.399> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.320 
ammeter to a value of four you will
limit<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.560> rays<00:02:12.709> of<00:02:12.920> light<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.459> four<00:02:13.730> rays<00:02:14.000> as

limit the rays of light to four rays as

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.610 
limit the rays of light to four rays as
you<00:02:14.900> can<00:02:15.050> see<00:02:15.260> here<00:02:16.630> another<00:02:17.630> very<00:02:17.989> realistic
