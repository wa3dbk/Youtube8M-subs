00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:02.440
 anyway rub 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.900
 following h exactly put on the table 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.049
 because it will be fired 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:09.859
 it turned out that he was surprised by the position 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.759
 enough snowfall in english and rest 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.619
 mitrokhin opportunities 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:16.109
 but unlike 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.220
 let's say for example even 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.199
 the second was helping Vladimir cockerels 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.970
 which is very active robbery 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.529
 there if 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.970
 moving then away from 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.339
 excitement 100 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.699
 all this time flies away 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.330
 bijan a little different tactic 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.140
 I believe that will carry overpayment popular 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.980
 such tournaments because it is not too 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.180
 the prince will receive and you can not 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.180
 for some reason what is 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.450
 he is a good way out according to the surkov seas 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.540
 very good grave crime form 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.460
 even seconds 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.460
 just wonderful 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.160
 but also here 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.250
 Alexander Neradko twice headed 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.240
 self depressed 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.890
 found continues 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.890
 robert computers but now 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.110
 authorities want right handed 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.280
 not quite clear what 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.200
 he has a good way 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.500
 it's only for now 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 something to me my hands 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.680
 continue and alexander six 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.680
 the dead 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.910
 7 from anger to light 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.549
 key factor 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.549
 all this is football 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:15.589
 Moldovan authorities 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.649
 I like no secret what is 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:19.749
 It turned out and I will try to play 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.849
 your hockey but we'll see about 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.479
 how easy 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:25.740
 after the complex in the new gpu 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.740
 two balls 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:32.379
 that's what we won 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.679
 as noted 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.149
