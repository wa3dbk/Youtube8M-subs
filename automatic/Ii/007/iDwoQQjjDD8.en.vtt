I<00:00:43.200> can't<00:00:43.440> do<00:00:43.559> too<00:00:43.860> horribly<00:00:44.309> gets<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.670> Psyduck

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
I can't do too horribly gets a Psyduck

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.340 
I can't do too horribly gets a Psyduck
so<00:00:45.270> whatever<00:00:47.239> Thunder<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:48.360> very<00:00:49.140> useful

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
so whatever Thunder that's very useful

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.540 
so whatever Thunder that's very useful
actually<00:00:51.260> but<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.469> has<00:00:52.590> served<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.219> don't

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
actually but it has served and I don't

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.850 
actually but it has served and I don't
expect<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.570> KO<00:00:55.079> specialist<00:00:55.770> of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
expect that to do a KO specialist of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.330 
expect that to do a KO specialist of
areas<00:00:56.370> decent<00:00:56.820> special<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:58.070> not<00:00:59.070> again

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
areas decent special I think not again

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.430 
areas decent special I think not again
with<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> few<00:01:00.120> special<00:01:00.570> stat<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:01.350> have

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
with the few special stat I really have

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.880 
with the few special stat I really have
no<00:01:01.590> idea<00:01:04.790> yeah<00:01:06.409> that's<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.560> thing<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.770> really

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
no idea yeah that's one thing I really

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.190 
no idea yeah that's one thing I really
hate<00:01:08.189> about<00:01:08.369> Thunder<00:01:08.729> less<00:01:09.689> than<00:01:09.900> perfect

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
hate about Thunder less than perfect

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.399 
hate about Thunder less than perfect
accuracy<00:01:10.970> fact<00:01:11.970> pretty<00:01:12.659> cruddy<00:01:12.900> accuracy

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
accuracy fact pretty cruddy accuracy

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.929 
accuracy fact pretty cruddy accuracy
honestly<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.100> he's<00:01:14.369> probably<00:01:14.520> gonna<00:01:14.729> switch

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
honestly and he's probably gonna switch

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.219 
honestly and he's probably gonna switch
like<00:01:15.150> Cuban<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.720> something<00:01:18.020> audit<00:01:19.020> showed

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
like Cuban or something audit showed

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.039 
like Cuban or something audit showed
that<00:01:19.619> well<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.759> little<00:01:21.030> less<00:01:21.180> annoying<00:01:21.450> he

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
that well it's a little less annoying he

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.980 
that well it's a little less annoying he
had<00:01:22.229> cuban<00:01:22.619> i<00:01:22.680> guess<00:01:22.830> he<00:01:22.950> would<00:01:23.070> switch<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
had cuban i guess he would switch to it

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.899 
had cuban i guess he would switch to it
Emil<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:26.280> Hugh<00:01:26.490> bone<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.790> on

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
Emil that I I think Hugh bone was on

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.090 
Emil that I I think Hugh bone was on
that<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.119> wasn't<00:01:27.390> really<00:01:27.630> paying<00:01:27.810> attention

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
that I wasn't really paying attention

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.700 
that I wasn't really paying attention
that's<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.340> terrible<00:01:29.759> look<00:01:30.409> let's<00:01:31.409> go<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.619> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that's just terrible look let's go for a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
that's just terrible look let's go for a
mega<00:01:31.890> punch<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.280> time

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
mega punch this time

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.090 
mega punch this time
still<00:01:34.630> less<00:01:34.870> than<00:01:35.020> perfect<00:01:35.320> accuracy<00:01:35.620> but<00:01:36.070> I

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
still less than perfect accuracy but I

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.820 
still less than perfect accuracy but I
think<00:01:36.340> better<00:01:37.050> plus<00:01:38.050> stabbed<00:01:38.320> at<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.620> critical

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
think better plus stabbed at a critical

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.150 
think better plus stabbed at a critical
that's<00:01:39.220> very<00:01:39.400> nice<00:01:39.550> but<00:01:41.130> unfortunately<00:01:42.130> I

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
that's very nice but unfortunately I

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.520 
that's very nice but unfortunately I
think<00:01:42.280> these<00:01:42.490> things<00:01:42.520> up<00:01:42.850> like<00:01:42.880> no<00:01:43.720> v's<00:01:44.230> or

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
think these things up like no v's or

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.810 
think these things up like no v's or
whatever<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.920> equivalent<00:01:45.100> is<00:01:45.460> in<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.640> first

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
whatever the equivalent is in the first

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.330 
whatever the equivalent is in the first
generation<00:01:46.330> so<00:01:47.080> moves<00:01:47.380> do<00:01:47.590> less<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:47.920> I<00:01:48.220> was

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
generation so moves do less and I was

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.050 
generation so moves do less and I was
like<00:01:53.010> sure<00:01:54.010> let's<00:01:54.400> finish<00:01:54.550> it<00:01:54.730> with<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.940> lot

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
like sure let's finish it with a lot

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.850 
like sure let's finish it with a lot
about<00:01:55.120> which<00:01:55.480> I<00:01:55.660> could<00:01:56.080> go<00:01:56.230> for<00:01:56.410> a<00:01:56.440> metronome

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
about which I could go for a metronome

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.650 
about which I could go for a metronome
but<00:01:57.160> it<00:01:57.580> might<00:01:57.850> end<00:01:57.880> up<00:01:58.150> something<00:01:58.630> that

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
but it might end up something that

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.450 
but it might end up something that
doesn't<00:01:59.050> actually<00:01:59.170> do<00:01:59.410> any<00:01:59.590> damage<00:01:59.830> so<00:02:00.280> what

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
doesn't actually do any damage so what

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.760 
doesn't actually do any damage so what
do<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:00.580> know<00:02:01.410> and<00:02:02.410> another<00:02:02.950> critical<00:02:04.470> maybe<00:02:05.470> odd

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
do I know and another critical maybe odd

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.590 
do I know and another critical maybe odd
it<00:02:05.920> is<00:02:06.220> slow<00:02:06.490> as<00:02:06.640> hell<00:02:06.790> maybe<00:02:07.000> clefairy<00:02:07.450> is

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
it is slow as hell maybe clefairy is

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.900 
it is slow as hell maybe clefairy is
actually<00:02:07.900> really<00:02:08.050> fast<00:02:08.410> but<00:02:08.649> I<00:02:08.710> don't<00:02:08.920> know<00:02:09.070> it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.070 

again<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:12.940> didn't<00:02:13.240> look<00:02:13.360> at<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.630> stats<00:02:13.870> or

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
again I didn't look at the stats or

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.450 
again I didn't look at the stats or
anything<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.500> don't<00:02:14.620> know<00:02:14.680> what<00:02:14.830> else<00:02:15.040> going<00:02:15.370> on

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
anything I don't know what else going on

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:22.020 
anything I don't know what else going on
there's<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:16.270> vulpix<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:19.320> then<00:02:20.850> sure<00:02:21.850> why<00:02:22.000> not

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
there's a vulpix and then sure why not

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.090 
there's a vulpix and then sure why not
go<00:02:22.330> for<00:02:22.390> that

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.340 

yeah<00:02:26.100> like<00:02:26.430> them<00:02:26.610> that's<00:02:27.240> probably<00:02:27.510> gonna<00:02:27.630> KO
