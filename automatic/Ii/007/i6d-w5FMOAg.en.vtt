00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
connection between the headphone jack

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.869 
connection between the headphone jack
and<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> wire<00:00:43.620> which<00:00:43.950> makes<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.370> very<00:00:44.399> nice

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and the wire which makes that very nice

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.229 
and the wire which makes that very nice
so<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.350> your<00:00:46.680> your<00:00:47.399> phones<00:00:47.789> about

so if you have your your phones about

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
so if you have your your phones about
your<00:00:48.450> pocket<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.110> you're<00:00:49.379> listening<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.860> your

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.180 
your pocket and you're listening to your
music<00:00:50.300> it's<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.899> their<00:00:52.680> connection

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
music it's not that their connection

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.580 
music it's not that their connection
won't<00:00:53.340> separate<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.180> drop<00:00:55.170> your<00:00:55.320> phone

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
won't separate and drop your phone

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.560 
won't separate and drop your phone
because<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.789> powerful<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.539> so

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
because this is just so powerful and so

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.920 
because this is just so powerful and so
strong<00:00:58.760> here<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.879> get<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> wire<00:01:00.420> which

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
strong here you get to the wire which

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.789 
strong here you get to the wire which
you<00:01:01.079> notice<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.469> once<00:01:02.219> again<00:01:02.570> red<00:01:03.619> red<00:01:04.619> in

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
you notice is once again red red in

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.620 
you notice is once again red red in
color<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:06.020> this<00:01:07.020> wire<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.909> very<00:01:08.909> thick<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.330> it

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
color and this wire is very thick and it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.649 
color and this wire is very thick and it
doesn't<00:01:09.930> tangle<00:01:10.340> easily<00:01:11.340> either<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:12.479> just

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
doesn't tangle easily either it just

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.649 
doesn't tangle easily either it just
pulls<00:01:12.869> right<00:01:13.260> out<00:01:13.430> which<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.580> nice<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.119> it's

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
pulls right out which is nice and it's

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.289 
pulls right out which is nice and it's
for<00:01:15.900> once<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.380> flat<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.820> round<00:01:18.060> wire

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
for once it's not flat it's a round wire

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.240 
for once it's not flat it's a round wire
so<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.830> still<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.970> tango<00:01:21.420> prone<00:01:21.689> at<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.250> now

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
so it's still not tango prone at all now

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.330 
so it's still not tango prone at all now
we're<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.520> move<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.939> splitter
