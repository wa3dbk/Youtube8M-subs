00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.849
 chapter 4 other considerations 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.179
 important other factors to have in 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.130
 account the light should be dim or null 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.320
 direct sun will ruin some vitamins 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.630
 and can harm the crop the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.340
 stay where the container rests should 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.899
 of being ventilated regularly and not 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.050
 be exposed to polluting sources 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.059
 how you cook tobacco powder and so on 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.190
 fermentation time will determine the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.309
 degree of acidity and final carbonation 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.270
 strong currents of ludic or 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.489
 electromagnetic can affect the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.219
 convulsive behavior like 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.410
 to any living organism it is said 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.329
 that classical music or similar affects 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.879
 positively to the growth of kombucha 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.799
 this makes sense if it is understood that 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.940
 we are before living organisms in a 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.740
 aqueous medium 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.690
 a relaxed atmosphere has been shown 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.880
 very favorable for the raising of 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.340
 animals and for plants just like 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.290
 acts in the development of people 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.030
 on the other hand masaru emoto scientist 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.860
 Japanese who has studied the structure 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.780
 of the water crystals has shown 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.820
 that water changes its structure by 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.850
 encouragement of music and prayers or 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.960
 phrases producing geometric shapes 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.150
 harmonious under the effect of music 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.220
 harmonica while with compositions 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.380
 strident adopts amorphous forms and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.690
 irregular when examining the crystals of 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.730
 ice under the microscope what you want 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.560
 say that the vibrations modify the 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.780
 state of the water so an environment 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.520
 calm will always be better than a climate 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.470
 of stress for the growth of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.930
 kombucha colonies in the same way 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.000
 that for any living being taking 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.890
 this in mind you can try sounds 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.750
 harmonics like music or the sounds of 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.880
 the nature especially those of water 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.470
 when even applying the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.720
 appropriate procedure for 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.970
 elaboration of kombucha can not be achieved 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.890
 satisfactory results perhaps 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.900
 have to try to change it before 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.840
 think that you are not able to perform the 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.910
 Properly cultivate utensils and 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.120
 ingredients 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.450
 stainless steel pot refrain from 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.910
 Use aluminum iron or copper container 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.220
 wide-mouthed greater than the capacity of 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.140
 used liquid the ideal is the one that 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.910
 allow space for a third of the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.590
 air allowing the liquid to maintain 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.960
 equal proportions between height and 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.210
 width or diameter this allows a 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.400
 Correct oxygenation in fermentation 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.250
 you have to avoid metallic materials 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.170
 or metal components use mud 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.570
 glass or plastic suitable for 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.730
 acidic foods the varnish of some 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.280
 ceramics contains quantities or traces 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.110
 of metal some glasses can contain 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.880
 heavy metals from the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.340
 molds and dyes for coloring 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.310
 just like plastics glass has 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.350
 to be totally transparent if you 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.420
 uses plastic the most suitable is the 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.430
 high grade of the polyolefin group as the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.440
 polyethylene called ac 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.620
 that must be visible on the packaging or 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.810
 pp polypropylene containers 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.790
 food grade plastic can be 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.620
 identified with the number one or two in 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.530
 the inside of a triangle in the part 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.430
 bottom of the mesh strainer container 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.620
 if you use loose 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.540
 fine canvas that lets the air pass but 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.329
 Do not dust the linen paper or cotton for 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.390
 cover the mouth of the band container 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.980
 Elastic or string to hold the canvas 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.799
 per liter of water without chlorine from the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.200
 best quality a healthy crop 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.030
 kombucha depending on the volume of this 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.769
 you can do more or less quantity 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.650
 although to begin with it is better to start 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.319
 doing little 1 liter or liter and a half is 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.239
 enough the crop shows healthy 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.069
 when you are of firm consistency like 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.049
 be slippery on the layers not 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.150
 they separate without producing tears between 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.849
 they are practically imperceptible 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.590
 It can have a square disk shape or 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.959
 another that will correspond to the form of 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.030
 container where it was grown in 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.370
 any case if you received a part of 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.049
 fermented tea this will be enough as 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.090
 initial starter for the ferment 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.919
 producing a new membrane that is 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.739
 will form on the surface even without the 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.870
 mother crop 100 milliliters of 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.790
 starter is a serving of tea 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.620
 fermented previous that will contribute the 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.599
 initial acidity needed to obtain 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.510
 hygienic conditions against elements 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:23.620
 strangers and the ways in the cultivation in his 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.690
 default a quarter cup each 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.030
 milliliters of alcohol vinegar 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.610
 distilled wine vinegar can be used 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.650
 or pasteurized apple better if the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.449
 used vinegar does not carry preservatives u 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.729
 other additives that will kill part of the 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.740
 nigga microbiota if you use a 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.360
 Organic vinegar is boiled first for 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.340
 kill his mother since it is believed that the 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.560
 microorganisms can change the mother 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.740
 of the convulsa the one of the vinegar you 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.040
 you'll hear sugar packed about 75 g 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.470
 white brown sugar 1 maltose honey 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.300
 maple syrup or a honey mixture 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.560
 will cause some instability in the 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.240
 ferment so it would have to 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.280
 use it with reservations or to make 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.260
 nutritive variants with a crop that 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.150
 over or with the usual fermented tea 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.620
 once filtered as to the tile 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
 we will use it in the same way or in 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.360
 combination of honey to make 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.610
 nutritious beer isotonic panela 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.260
 some countries scraping is the juice of 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.240
 the sugar cane concentrated and 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.520
 solidified by the evaporation of water 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.710
 which it contains is sometimes called by 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.570
 commercial reasons brown sugar 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.100
 cane but it differs from sugar in 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.780
 that the honey has not been extracted 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.880
 molasses where the 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.190
 crystallization as happens with the 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.550
 sugar the place where the 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.410
 coffee 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.810
 of sugar to turn your juice into 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.790
 panela is the sugar mill in the sugar mill or 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.580
 The juice is converted into panela 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.620
 two teaspoons of loose tea filled 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.080
 about five grams or two tea bags 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.270
 without the staple, many fats are 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.010
 alloy and certain metals react to 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.650
 warm up yielding microparticles 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.510
 harmful to the convulsa in the drink is 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.940
 You can use the thread to tie the bag and 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.920
 then remove the staple on the other hand the 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.450
 The paper of the bags distorts the flavor 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.090
 of tea and in some cases 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.860
 bleached with chlorine to start is 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.720
 better green tea for the formation of 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.180
 new crop while black tea 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.580
 will offer a drink more similar to cider 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.410
 in the taste a mixture is acceptable and 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.170
 will partly solve these two issues 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.270
 important to start the training 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.540
 of cultivation and adaptation of the palate 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.570
 to fermented drink 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.030
 well this has been all I hope that you
