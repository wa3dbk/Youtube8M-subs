00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:09.089
 hello youtube friends that we're going with 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:09.089
 the other tutorial on how 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.910
 connect the bluetooth to our 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.840
 Playstation 3 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.840
 here we have 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.849
 the main part 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.370
 The next thing we're going to do is 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.039
 connect here the control let's go to 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.289
 my profile 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.289
 the road is channel tuning 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.850
 and let's start looking 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.750
 we are going to go here 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.600
 to settings 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.600
 I run them a few because they can see it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.550
 ah 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.660
 settings 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.660
 after adjustments I'm going to be 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.079
 accessory settings 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.119
 because they see 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.119
 of accesories 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.330
 here we go 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.520
 us 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.520
 manage bluetooth devices 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.350
 and here is 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.590
 then we are going to enter here in this 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.780
 moment I have here my bluetooth go 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.780
 to pay it in a second 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.000
 on the screen of the play 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:52.700
 let's do the following we are going to 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.030
 here where it says register a device 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.030
 new 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.900
 and it's going to start scanning then it 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.550
 let's say start the scan 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.310
 is going to be scanning then as 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:10.890
 we will do four functions since 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.890
 it's off we're going to have it oppressed 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.540
 and there he found the device that can 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.560
 see remember is now let's 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.050
 explain that if player waits and here they go 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.269
 to type the key of the device 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.670
 this is a bluetooth that I had makes 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.400
 long time the truth I do not remember the 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:40.780
 key but the keys are almost always or 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:43.700
 four zeros or four ones 1 2 3 and 4 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.959
 almost always are the keys we are going to 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.959
 try with 4 zeros 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.680
 if you know the key then a lot 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.680
 best 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.300
 the key registration has been completed 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.310
 as I told them 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.590
 and we can see that I have my other 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.550
 connected devices these moments 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.350
 they are not connected but if my 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.110
 bluetooth device good now they 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.810
 I will teach how 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.000
 use it in games or know if it's 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.660
 working then we will go again 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.660
 to 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.440
 in the upper part to settings 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.629
 then let's go 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.629
 accessories settings 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.700
 and here we will go to device settings of 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.700
 Audio 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.710
 here something here can see 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.800
 the input device which is the 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:54.140
 central what 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:57.240
 where you are going to enter your voice 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.080
 in this case it is the bluetooth then 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.030
 default is this and the output is 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.200
 I'm going to give you say device 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.200
 Default TV 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:22.130
 execute it and if we put it here it would be 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:25.190
 listening directly through the hearing aid 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.530
 of the bluetooth there is everything that 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.289
 say what I would hear over here that more than 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.759
 everything is done when you are with another friend 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.820
 next door and want to hear what they 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:38.949
 they are saying you can put it like this and already 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.949
 that's all boys 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.300
