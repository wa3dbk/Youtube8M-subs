00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
of this vast world which I'm really

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.979 
of this vast world which I'm really
excited<00:02:11.830> about<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.330> original<00:02:13.540> edges

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
excited about and in the original edges

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.869 
excited about and in the original edges
of<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.590> world<00:02:14.890> was<00:02:15.129> like<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.730> was<00:02:15.849> a

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
of that the world was like that it was a

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.030 
of that the world was like that it was a
big<00:02:16.270> expensive<00:02:16.780> world<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.410> were<00:02:17.530> stuck

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
big expensive world that you were stuck

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.429 
big expensive world that you were stuck
in<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.670> had<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.090> go<00:02:19.209> explore<00:02:19.659> it<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.140> it

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
in and you had to go explore it so it

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.410 
in and you had to go explore it so it
seems<00:02:20.769> that<00:02:20.950> exploration<00:02:21.400> once<00:02:21.939> again<00:02:22.209> may

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
seems that exploration once again may

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.959 
seems that exploration once again may
take<00:02:22.719> head<00:02:22.989> point<00:02:23.319> in<00:02:23.439> this<00:02:23.980> legend<00:02:24.549> of<00:02:24.579> zelda

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
of course I had like a time frame it had

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.759 
of course I had like a time frame it had
time<00:03:06.730> slots<00:03:07.090> on<00:03:07.269> what<00:03:07.569> what<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.230> was<00:03:08.409> happening

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
time slots on what what I was happening

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.440 
time slots on what what I was happening
at<00:03:08.889> that<00:03:08.920> point<00:03:09.400> but<00:03:09.760> since<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.090> saw<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.299> way

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
at that point but since I saw the way

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.059 
at that point but since I saw the way
you<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.659> don't<00:03:11.109> think<00:03:11.349> it's<00:03:11.470> gonna<00:03:11.590> have<00:03:11.889> that

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.710 
you I don't think it's gonna have that
kind<00:03:12.280> of<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.549> know<00:03:12.579> time<00:03:13.090> thing<00:03:13.450> it's<00:03:13.599> gonna

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
kind of you know time thing it's gonna

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.830 
kind of you know time thing it's gonna
have<00:03:13.959> its<00:03:14.139> own<00:03:14.970> events<00:03:15.970> happening<00:03:16.450> within<00:03:16.629> the
