one I'll just place it in the middle of

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.259 
one I'll just place it in the middle of
my<00:02:13.709> lip<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.190> one<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.519> from<00:02:14.670> Estee<00:02:15.090> Lauder

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
my lip so this one is from Estee Lauder

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.300 
my lip so this one is from Estee Lauder
the<00:02:15.450> shimmer<00:02:15.780> which<00:02:16.110> usually<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.709> really<00:02:17.099> don't

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the shimmer which usually I really don't

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.130 
the shimmer which usually I really don't
like<00:02:17.430> shimmering<00:02:17.700> lipsticks<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.959> one

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
like shimmering lipsticks but this one

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.559 
like shimmering lipsticks but this one
for<00:02:19.349> some<00:02:19.530> reason<00:02:19.829> I<00:02:19.980> really<00:02:20.129> like<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.549> um<00:02:20.790> and

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
for some reason I really like it um and

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.069 
for some reason I really like it um and
then<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.560> color<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.489> pink<00:02:23.790> birthday<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.870> it

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
then the color is pink birthday so it

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.319 
then the color is pink birthday so it
looks<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.430> not<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.700> color<00:02:27.000> that

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
looks like this so it's not a color that

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.210 
looks like this so it's not a color that
I<00:02:27.390> think<00:02:27.959> I<00:02:28.049> would<00:02:28.200> wear<00:02:28.379> all<00:02:28.620> over<00:02:28.829> my<00:02:29.010> lips

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
I think I would wear all over my lips

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.309 
I think I would wear all over my lips
but<00:02:29.489> just<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.120> middle<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.599> my<00:02:30.810> lips<00:02:31.019> with

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
because it's so plump and so yeah I

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.059 
because it's so plump and so yeah I
really<00:04:11.629> do<00:04:11.989> notice<00:04:12.199> the<00:04:12.560> difference<00:04:12.889> when<00:04:13.040> I

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
really do notice the difference when I

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.069 
really do notice the difference when I
do<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.639> I<00:04:14.120> really<00:04:14.359> like<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.690> effect<00:04:15.049> that

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
do it and I really like the effect that

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.229 
do it and I really like the effect that
it<00:04:15.260> gives<00:04:15.440> but<00:04:15.949> be<00:04:16.190> careful<00:04:16.579> because<00:04:16.609> if<00:04:17.090> you

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
it gives but be careful because if you

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.599 
it gives but be careful because if you
have<00:04:17.449> a<00:04:17.659> small<00:04:18.019> lip<00:04:18.229> to<00:04:18.349> begin<00:04:18.590> with<00:04:18.769> you<00:04:19.579> don't
