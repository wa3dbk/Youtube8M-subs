00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
season on takeaways given that you know

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.189 
season on takeaways given that you know
as<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> team<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.129> had<00:00:50.280> 19<00:00:50.789> interceptions<00:00:51.199> yeah

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
as a team we had 19 interceptions yeah

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.680 
as a team we had 19 interceptions yeah
it<00:00:52.500> really<00:00:52.680> was<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> big<00:00:53.399> deal<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.969> know<00:00:54.000> we

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
it really was a big deal you know we

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.060 
it really was a big deal you know we
were<00:00:54.780> fortunate<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.140> be<00:00:55.230> tended<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.710> without

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
were fortunate to be tended to without

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.150 
were fortunate to be tended to without
getting<00:00:56.280> any<00:00:56.399> journal<00:00:56.730> was<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.000> unusual<00:00:57.539> so

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
getting any journal was it's unusual so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
getting any journal was it's unusual so
something<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.309> talked<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:00:59.850> that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
something that we talked to I think that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.330 
something that we talked to I think that
our<00:01:00.570> defensive<00:01:01.020> staff<00:01:01.260> has<00:01:01.829> done<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.039> great<00:01:02.219> job

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
our defensive staff has done a great job

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.549 
our defensive staff has done a great job
with<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.660> what<00:01:03.809> Marvin<00:01:04.170> being<00:01:04.379> new

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
with that you know what Marvin being new

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.170 
with that you know what Marvin being new
it's<00:01:04.979> got<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.309> newly<00:01:05.549> really<00:01:05.790> coming<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
it's got to be newly really coming to

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.370 
it's got to be newly really coming to
exercise<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.680> so<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.860> think<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.100> paying<00:01:08.340> off

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
exercise that so I think it's paying off

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.730 
exercise that so I think it's paying off
see<00:01:10.380> how<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.650> strong<00:01:11.070> safety<00:01:11.430> position

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
see how the a strong safety position

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.690 
see how the a strong safety position
well<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.770> thought<00:01:14.010> our<00:01:14.130> safeties<00:01:14.490> played

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.300 
seemed like down at the goal line here
there<00:04:47.290> was<00:04:47.380> some<00:04:47.530> confusion<00:04:47.710> with<00:04:48.160> the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
there was some confusion with the

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
they were trying to accomplish and why

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.970 
they were trying to accomplish and why
things<00:04:52.240> went<00:04:52.600> anywhere<00:04:52.900> yeah<00:04:53.500> you<00:04:53.800> know<00:04:53.890> we

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
things went anywhere yeah you know we

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.140 
things went anywhere yeah you know we
put<00:04:54.130> them<00:04:54.220> in<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.370> different<00:04:54.520> difficult

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
put them in a different difficult

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.150 
put them in a different difficult
situation<00:04:55.720> by<00:04:55.900> changing<00:04:56.320> personnelles<00:04:56.830> and

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
situation by changing personnelles and

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.510 
situation by changing personnelles and
you<00:04:57.850> know<00:04:57.940> they<00:04:58.090> didn't<00:04:58.720> have<00:04:58.990> 21<00:04:59.919> and<00:05:00.070> 7<00:05:00.190> you

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
you know they didn't have 21 and 7 you

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.830 
you know they didn't have 21 and 7 you
know<00:05:00.610> we<00:05:00.730> have<00:05:00.820> not<00:05:00.970> let<00:05:01.150> them<00:05:01.300> play<00:05:01.480> in<00:05:01.600> that

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
know we have not let them play in that

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.540 
know we have not let them play in that
so<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.110> think<00:05:02.230> that<00:05:02.410> when<00:05:03.160> they<00:05:03.250> got<00:05:03.400> to<00:05:03.520> the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
so I think that when they got to the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.520 
so I think that when they got to the
Tuesday<00:05:04.000> are<00:05:04.150> trying<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.419> rotate<00:05:04.600> in<00:05:04.900> casa<00:05:05.320> no

more days you can sear to be training

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.300 
more days you can sear to be training
camp<00:05:30.600> before<00:05:30.810> you<00:05:31.050> switch<00:05:31.260> over<00:05:31.410> to<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:32.100> game

camp before you switch over to the game
week<00:05:32.660> yeah<00:05:33.660> I<00:05:33.690> don't<00:05:34.350> really<00:05:34.530> think<00:05:34.980> there's<00:05:35.370> a

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
week yeah I don't really think there's a

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.890 
week yeah I don't really think there's a
big<00:05:35.760> deal<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:36.240> everybody<00:05:36.660> talks<00:05:36.840> about

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
big deal and everybody talks about

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.780 
big deal and everybody talks about
breaking<00:05:37.440> camp<00:05:37.800> and<00:05:37.890> I<00:05:37.920> think<00:05:38.040> that's<00:05:38.190> more<00:05:38.520> an

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
breaking camp and I think that's more an

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.760 
breaking camp and I think that's more an
NFL<00:05:39.240> doing<00:05:39.510> that's<00:05:39.750> more<00:05:39.960> if<00:05:40.050> you<00:05:40.170> go<00:05:40.320> off<00:05:40.470> site

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
NFL doing that's more if you go off site

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.890 
NFL doing that's more if you go off site
there's<00:05:41.460> no<00:05:41.580> difference<00:05:42.000> for<00:05:42.150> us<00:05:42.240> we<00:05:42.420> just<00:05:42.450> got

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
there's no difference for us we just got

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.450 
there's no difference for us we just got
moved<00:05:43.080> from<00:05:43.260> one<00:05:43.470> dorm<00:05:43.710> to<00:05:43.950> cross<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.430> street

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
moved from one dorm to cross the street

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.660
