00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.679
 hi to all the minute kids in this 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.669
 new video I'm here today to plant you 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.800
 these 32 for facts from the lux farm that I am 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:26.739
 for those who do not know the authors of 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.739
 belgique deep and you are practically 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.689
 equal say in the only quotes 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:37.190
 differences that are there is this that is a 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.870
 two axes this is a three axis and this 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.760
 was born three aces but it does not have the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.909
 the ability to de sovrapporne 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.129
 linsey side then as you can see 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:50.620
 I'm really well done at the level 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:53.089
 all details in texture level 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.949
 they believe it does so with grids 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.949
 the reversing light is everything 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:03.589
 these of these three axes year the axis 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.659
 steering both the one behind and the one 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.780
 in front so you have good ability to 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.299
 steering about attention steering 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.250
 because the rudder is a bit short then 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.300
 to the eye when you are caring because it is 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.840
 very likely you go to touch the 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.220
 then wheel behind the tractor 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.310
 caution 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.950
 as you can see this is already used I have 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.480
 made some trips with and never was 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.030
 really really dirty for good 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:41.300
 also cisco rco very taken and of the dirt 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:43.400
 very very accentuated as you can see 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.830
 however they obviously dirty all three 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.260
 I brought him one is the dirt and the same 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.600
 in short, for everyone 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.690
 you also see this one beautiful 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.670
 ladder behind and one is a platform for 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:01.400
 rise above as weights do not say 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.800
 they are excessively heavy there 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.830
 the pro of all three is filled with that 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.500
 I did not struggle much from empty spaces and there 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.200
 I pulled the airon here without even from 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.180
 now ahead so I went 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.200
 pretty good so there are none 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.680
 there are no weight problems we say 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.650
 then I'll show you something here 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.540
 so let's see even better there 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.360
 these three the first one is the central one 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.480
 with its banks ventilated treacy 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.450
 see with the button you can put it 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.570
 key the b key is raised is lowered e 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.980
 the side in front of the button 6 turn on 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.570
 the lights of practically of position 10 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.030
 at work because you see 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.459
 all three are these 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.890
 these spotlights that are business between 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.020
 quotes are really headlights that 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.660
 they light up behind why maybe you do 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.310
 reverse because those of the tractor 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.680
 the call that I am behind lights up again 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.340
 see a chip 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.410
 and back here used this is the 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.720
 according to what it practically has 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.670
 dirtied same exact same thing 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.150
 only that it was superimposed not in 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.130
 aluminum but writes wrote 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.800
 extension had that would be section of 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.290
 wood is always the v key 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.900
 light behind counts side store not father and 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.050
 Washable this same thing at nine years 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.380
 of theater his answers for linsey 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.380
 the high veil attack so you see 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:48.710
 let me turn off so you feel better 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.390
 then you will see with the v key for 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:57.600
 remove and place the overexposed button 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:04:01.860
 b raise the side in front of it again 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.160
 then close with the search key you see 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.880
 that the two lights that come on also light up 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.280
 I said first 1 and 2 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.770
 as you can see the jeff body already does 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.140
 let's say an effect an effect used 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:21.780
 very nice you see that the has faded 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:24.950
 background has lost its color and see here 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.350
 we have the flashing light 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.410
 now I'm a little sideways but here the 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:37.440
 floor is a bit we say the plan is not 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:41.270
 anyway, this was enough 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.880
 a capacity of that three axes hi 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:51.510
 29,000 the Triassic overlap with 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:53.790
 25,000 and the two axles with 19,500 e 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.740
 that's enough 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.110
 however fat on the vanilla valleys 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.919
 for those who might not have understood that 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.500
 he asks me every time which map I am 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.940
 well enough there is nothing else to tell you 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.310
 however, I recommend them a lot 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.620
 very beautiful or replaced with angers 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.100
 ville the orange one I had that 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.970
 I had it long ago and then I don't use them all 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:21.630
 and three euros put together to show them to you and 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:25.530
 low v greet you and leave you of course 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.460
 the link description and we'll see you in 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.460
