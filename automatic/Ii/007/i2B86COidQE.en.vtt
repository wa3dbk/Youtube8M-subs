00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hi nice that you look at couples talking 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.980
 today i'm going to tell something about the 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.450
 roadway rules and then you might think 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.230
 what is that 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.599
 but that is just normal 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.920
 traffic rules man left in the bin 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.540
 many younger is you get that 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.160
 nowadays no longer taught and it 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.820
 gives sometimes especially at competitions 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.740
 some problems 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.500
 that's why I'm going to tell you everything today 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.820
 about how that works 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.430
 we have it here with us in the inner box 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.890
 hang a very large plate and it says here 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.900
 the verse rob and actually sit there 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.519
 all lane rules hidden in it 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.380
 so it's a kind of donkey bridge 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.239
 and I'm going to read to you the bottle and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.760
 are you going to tell which rule is included 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.000
 and why that rule is figured out I am going 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.309
 you the lane rules for life 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.739
 it starts at the top of the first line 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.289
 anyone who wants to venture into the job 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.850
 must ask politely in advance and 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.890
 That means that before you bake 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.230
 that you have to call 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.030
 door quite far free so you know for sure 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.559
 that you do not post with anyone and that there is not 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.899
 accidentally someone just passed the purity 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.600
 if you do come in is the second line 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.300
 that link fight has the most place 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.519
 is gone makes for the other place 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.439
 And that means people who left 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.100
 oberia have priority over the people 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.100
 drive to the right 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.530
 Who gets to go next to the battle 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.390
 if you step and you are with several 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.100
 people in the bin then you just have to on the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.540
 inner battle going steps so that the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.130
 people just about the hoof 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.130
 drive do not bother you 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.100
 who they gallery 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.619
 has free job that means the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.759
 People with side aisles have priority 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.159
 For example, if someone is up to it 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.420
 district, and you sit yourself revolt 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.420
 then the other person has priority 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.340
 then there is one last piece and that 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.910
 is not official but that is more one 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.090
 kind of reminder runs much talk 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.800
 little comes to a conclusion on time go on 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.120
 time out and that actually means that 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.070
 if you are driving you are there 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.930
 really should only be busy there is you 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.730
 should not sit on your phone or 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.220
 other things that you have to do 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.590
 better train for half an hour than 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.390
 you an hour just wimps time 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.830
 this is actually not a rule on that on 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.660
 the sign is but it will be 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.640
 You should always use it in it 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.810
 middle step away from the safe and one 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.810
 just chance everyone around you 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.160
 now you know the roadway rules and avoid 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.870
 your collisions when you go horse riding 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.180

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.550

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.250
