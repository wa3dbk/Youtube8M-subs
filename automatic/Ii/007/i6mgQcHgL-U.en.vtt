00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
snug and that's how I need a snowplow I

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:06.010 
snug and that's how I need a snowplow I
have<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.680> 45<00:01:58.070> gallon<00:01:58.759> drum<00:02:03.070> now<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:05.600> angle<00:02:05.899> of

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
have a 45 gallon drum now the angle of

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.719 
have a 45 gallon drum now the angle of
attack<00:02:06.080> looks<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:07.009> little<00:02:07.160> bit<00:02:07.369> different

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
attack looks a little bit different

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.270 
attack looks a little bit different
because<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:08.149> where<00:02:08.300> it's<00:02:08.420> sitting<00:02:08.979> I'm<00:02:09.979> gonna

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280
