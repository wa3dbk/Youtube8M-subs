fitted all four sides it does require

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.379 
fitted all four sides it does require
some<00:00:11.130> curry<00:00:11.610> drilling<00:00:12.030> what<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.780> recommend<00:00:13.410> is

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
some curry drilling what I recommend is

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.630 
some curry drilling what I recommend is
always<00:00:15.389> leave<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> space<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.710> screw<00:00:17.130> space

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
always leave a space so screw space

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.950 
always leave a space so screw space
screw<00:00:18.270> space

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
screw space

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.750 
screw space
skroob<00:00:19.320> space<00:00:19.680> all<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> way<00:00:20.220> down<00:00:20.430> five

put<00:00:32.800> this<00:00:32.920> one<00:00:33.160> in<00:00:33.310> here<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:35.260> can<00:00:35.380> see<00:00:35.590> screw

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
put this one in here you can see screw

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.750 
put this one in here you can see screw
space<00:00:36.520> and<00:00:36.790> then<00:00:37.210> screw<00:00:38.190> now<00:00:39.190> it<00:00:39.340> does<00:00:39.490> require

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
space and then screw now it does require

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.890 
space and then screw now it does require
some<00:00:39.850> pre<00:00:40.300> drilling<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:43.180> so<00:00:43.420> you<00:00:43.870> don't

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
some pre drilling and just so you don't

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.020 
some pre drilling and just so you don't
damage<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.620> wood<00:00:44.800> when<00:00:45.370> you're<00:00:45.520> putting<00:00:45.850> in

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
damage the wood when you're putting in

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.870 
damage the wood when you're putting in
your<00:00:46.090> screws<00:00:46.810> because<00:00:47.530> without<00:00:48.220> doing<00:00:48.700> that

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
your screws because without doing that

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.430 
your screws because without doing that
wood<00:00:49.210> has<00:00:49.390> a<00:00:49.420> tendency<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:50.200> split<00:00:50.590> and<00:00:51.150> it<00:00:52.150> can

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
wood has a tendency to split and it can

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.410 
wood has a tendency to split and it can
make<00:00:53.440> it<00:00:53.650> look<00:00:54.210> unattractive<00:00:56.970> now<00:00:57.970> this<00:00:58.180> is<00:00:58.390> a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
make it look unattractive now this is a

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.100 
make it look unattractive now this is a
pine<00:00:58.989> wood<00:00:59.350> so<00:01:00.040> it's<00:01:00.190> quite<00:01:00.400> soft<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.210> it's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
pine wood so it's quite soft and it's

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.670 
pine wood so it's quite soft and it's
pressure<00:01:02.500> treated<00:01:02.890> so<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:03.940> last<00:01:04.210> year<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.780> 15

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
pressure treated so the last year to 15

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.750 
pressure treated so the last year to 15
years<00:01:05.979> without<00:01:06.160> rot<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:09.369> are<00:01:09.520> quite

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
years without rot and they are quite

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.190 
years without rot and they are quite
strong<00:01:10.030> structures<00:01:10.570> when<00:01:10.750> they're<00:01:10.930> together

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:33.670 

go<00:01:14.200> space<00:01:14.860> screw

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.670 

I'd<00:01:34.680> recommend<00:01:35.159> using<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.990> four<00:01:36.990> mil<00:01:37.229> drill<00:01:37.469> bit

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
I'd recommend using a four mil drill bit

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.950 
I'd recommend using a four mil drill bit
and<00:01:39.469> pull<00:01:40.469> that<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:42.689> screw

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and pull that in and then the screw

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:54.020 
and pull that in and then the screw
should<00:01:43.200> fit<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.560> nice<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.979> snug

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.319 

let<00:01:54.600> me<00:01:54.690> go

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.719 

maybe<00:02:01.329> of<00:02:01.539> it
