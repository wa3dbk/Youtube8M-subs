 the goal is already within a year 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.310
 god through with the foundation we won 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.870
 a direct fit to go to represent 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.950
 colombia in the world of bands 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.760

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.800

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.940
 same members of the groups 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.190
 musicals we can not talk that is one 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.780
 because there are four musical groups 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.880
 what 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.790
 we support at this moment within the 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.470
 foundation took about seven 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.320
 years playing trumpet 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.120
 I started then in the symphonic band the 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.130
 municipality and the next year would enter 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.960

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.540
 master arming monroy and then from there 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.020
 until now we have had some 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:42.370
 progress regarding that right now I'm 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.669
