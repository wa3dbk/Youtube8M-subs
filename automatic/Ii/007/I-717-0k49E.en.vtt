on to platinum rising rivals let's see

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.969 
on to platinum rising rivals let's see
what<00:05:28.060> we<00:05:28.180> got<00:05:28.360> in<00:05:28.599> this<00:05:28.720> set<00:05:29.020> what<00:05:29.409> I<00:05:29.710> think

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
what we got in this set what I think

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.610 
what we got in this set what I think
looking<00:05:30.370> up<00:05:30.520> what's<00:05:31.000> in<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.240> set<00:05:31.510> is<00:05:31.780> pretty

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
looking up what's in the set is pretty

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.890 
looking up what's in the set is pretty
lucky<00:05:33.010> so<00:05:33.940> I'm<00:05:33.970> gonna<00:05:34.090> keep<00:05:34.210> doing<00:05:34.389> it<00:05:34.599> in<00:05:34.780> this

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
lucky so I'm gonna keep doing it in this

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:44.040 
lucky so I'm gonna keep doing it in this
set<00:05:35.169> we<00:05:35.349> have<00:05:36.570> but<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.720> 13<00:05:38.470> hollows<00:05:40.770> 1<00:05:41.770> 2<00:05:41.979> 3<00:05:42.340> 4<00:05:43.120> 5

so and there's also a Rotom subset in

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.149 
so and there's also a Rotom subset in
this<00:05:55.300> one<00:05:55.510> there<00:05:55.690> are<00:05:55.720> six<00:05:56.440> different<00:05:56.620> rotom's

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
we get one I think they might be shiny
