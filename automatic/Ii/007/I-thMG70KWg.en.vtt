00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 I am a father and I come to present you this 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.480
 new video that you have on my channel if 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.480
 you like to give it a share 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.980
 hi i am maverick i am thinking your 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.750
 eyes and you are another in this video and the 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.869
 today I bring you a new clips of 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.450
 gears of war is a pistol clip number 28 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.939
 29 I do not know what it is but well we're going to 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.770
 learn to listen to the one shot of a 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.520
 way in which they can not 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.500
 see your laser or hear the sound ok 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.870
 Normally when you look out you take 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.170
 the hook here, for example, you look 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.149
 so normal look no can not shoot 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.489
 there because this is what 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.090
 they stop or that this has their vision 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:50.300
 but if you look down 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.790
 and then look up you can see the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.200
 character as I am seeing it 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.000
 and they can kill him without him 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.950
 count or see anything if you do not believe 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.200
 You do not see anything, well, let's go 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.700
 do the inverse test let's wait 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.879
 that his partner arrived to advance him 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.920
 little bit fast and now we see each other and 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.770
 well, we are already getting the part 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.140
 from above if you realize this one 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.020
 you do not see is there is no laser that we 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.729
 is pointing only you hear if 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.340
 can shoot the character but then 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.259
 it's super minimal what you see the truth 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.680
 they are fighting us against many 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.170
 account will be given and look how I die 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.119
 kill me dukes ok or they just gave 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.700
 account then also works here already 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.860
 the previous one also went up on the map of 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.259
 dry dock so well they are already 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.050
 the two that I know me and taught me so 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.509
 that I hope you have used them 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.700
 something is not this glitch what can 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.950
 to do is the round that they play the one 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.600
 shot they are changed respawn and here 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.539
 also from this support because when 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.490
 touches your guangzhou for example if you are 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.170
 If you are locus, it's your turn to coach 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.659
 in the second round you touch him 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.270
 on the right side as well as where I come from 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.369
 I do not and then you have to do that 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.930
 change of respawn take you over there 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.850
 one shot and you can start killing 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.770
 people very well and then it in my account 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.090
 whom he killed weekly I do not expect 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.259
 have enjoyed your video if you like 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.540
 on the iphone and its shares with your 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.410
 little friends and let's say the next one 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.410
 goodbye
