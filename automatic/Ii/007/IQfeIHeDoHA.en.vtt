00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.660 
I've never spilled anything on my
keyboard<00:03:23.840> but<00:03:24.170> if<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.709> ever<00:03:24.829> happened<00:03:25.220> I'm

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
keyboard but if it ever happened I'm

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.770 
keyboard but if it ever happened I'm
glad<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.060> know<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.359> will<00:03:26.450> probably<00:03:26.570> work

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
glad to know that it will probably work

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.920 
glad to know that it will probably work
afterwards<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:29.239> as<00:03:29.359> you<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.569> see<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:29.810> has

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
afterwards and as you can see it has

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.380 
afterwards and as you can see it has
this<00:03:30.109> eight<00:03:30.470> degree<00:03:30.769> kickstand<00:03:31.280> on<00:03:32.180> both

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
this eight degree kickstand on both

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.099 
this eight degree kickstand on both
sides<00:03:32.600> like<00:03:32.780> many<00:03:33.170> keyboards<00:03:33.620> do<00:03:33.799> have<00:03:34.989> one<00:03:35.989> of

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
sides like many keyboards do have one of

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.080 
sides like many keyboards do have one of
the<00:03:36.200> things<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:37.069> didn't<00:03:37.700> like<00:03:37.790> about

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
the things that I I didn't like about

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.840 
the things that I I didn't like about
well<00:03:38.870> it's<00:03:39.650> not<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:40.010> keyboard<00:03:40.340> itself<00:03:40.579> but

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
well it's not the keyboard itself but

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.940 
well it's not the keyboard itself but
I've<00:03:41.480> been<00:03:41.690> using<00:03:41.840> this<00:03:42.049> Logitech<00:03:42.530> mouse<00:03:42.680> for

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
I've been using this Logitech mouse for

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.190 
I've been using this Logitech mouse for
a<00:03:42.980> while<00:03:43.190> now<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:43.850> saw<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.870> had<00:03:44.989> about

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
a while now and I saw that it had about

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.150 
a while now and I saw that it had about
the<00:03:45.350> same<00:03:45.500> size<00:03:46.840> USB<00:03:47.840> receiver<00:03:48.319> however<00:03:48.799> the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
the same size USB receiver however the

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.099 
the same size USB receiver however the
one<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.519> is<00:03:49.700> for<00:03:49.910> my<00:03:50.030> mouse<00:03:50.209> is<00:03:50.540> called<00:03:50.959> a

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
one that is for my mouse is called a

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.050 
one that is for my mouse is called a
nano<00:03:51.350> receiver<00:03:51.799> whereas<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:52.700> one<00:03:52.850> for<00:03:53.000> the

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
nano receiver whereas the one for the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.569 
nano receiver whereas the one for the
keyboard<00:03:53.480> has<00:03:54.139> the<00:03:54.290> little<00:03:54.440> unifying<00:03:55.010> orange

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
keyboard has the little unifying orange

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.229 
keyboard has the little unifying orange
logo<00:03:56.000> on<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.299> and<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:57.579> orange<00:03:58.579> logo<00:03:59.030> is

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
logo on it and that orange logo is

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.050 
logo on it and that orange logo is
necessary<00:03:59.989> like<00:04:00.230> my<00:04:00.440> mouse<00:04:00.709> doesn't<00:04:01.100> have<00:04:01.790> the

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
necessary like my mouse doesn't have the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.660 
necessary like my mouse doesn't have the
unifying<00:04:02.420> logo<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.650> cannot<00:04:04.100> be<00:04:04.280> used<00:04:04.459> with

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
unifying logo so it cannot be used with

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.400 
unifying logo so it cannot be used with
this<00:04:04.760> unifying<00:04:05.209> receiver<00:04:05.630> so<00:04:05.930> keep<00:04:06.139> that<00:04:06.319> in

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
this unifying receiver so keep that in

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.259 
this unifying receiver so keep that in
mind<00:04:06.620> if<00:04:06.829> you<00:04:06.920> want<00:04:06.950> to<00:04:07.190> buy<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.459> keyboard<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.180> a

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
mind if you want to buy a keyboard and a

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.080 
mind if you want to buy a keyboard and a
mouse<00:04:08.420> that<00:04:08.480> are<00:04:08.780> both<00:04:08.900> compatible<00:04:09.500> with<00:04:09.650> one

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
mouse that are both compatible with one

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.340 
mouse that are both compatible with one
receiver<00:04:11.090> because<00:04:11.420> as<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:11.840> is<00:04:11.930> I<00:04:12.170> have<00:04:12.290> to

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
receiver because as it is I have to

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.660 
receiver because as it is I have to
actually<00:04:12.739> plug<00:04:12.950> both<00:04:13.130> of<00:04:13.340> these<00:04:13.400> into<00:04:13.639> my

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
actually plug both of these into my

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.509 
actually plug both of these into my
computer<00:04:14.180> which<00:04:14.660> uses<00:04:15.019> up<00:04:15.200> two<00:04:15.799> of<00:04:16.010> my<00:04:16.039> three

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
computer which uses up two of my three

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.659 
computer which uses up two of my three
USB<00:04:16.820> ports<00:04:17.269> which<00:04:17.419> is<00:04:17.539> kind<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.780> annoying<00:04:18.669> so

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
USB ports which is kind of annoying so

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.360

full price at 25 bucks or even 30 bucks
I<00:05:13.210> think<00:05:13.690> it's<00:05:13.840> worth<00:05:13.990> it<00:05:14.250> it<00:05:15.250> may<00:05:15.400> not<00:05:15.550> be<00:05:15.760> the

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
I think it's worth it it may not be the

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.790 
I think it's worth it it may not be the
keyboard<00:05:16.690> of<00:05:16.780> choice<00:05:16.930> for<00:05:17.169> like<00:05:17.350> a<00:05:17.380> hardcore

gamer<00:05:18.070> but<00:05:18.760> I<00:05:18.789> would<00:05:19.389> say<00:05:19.600> that<00:05:19.630> it's

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010
