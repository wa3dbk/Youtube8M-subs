00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the i3 system and we'll see how fast it

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.560 
the i3 system and we'll see how fast it
though<00:01:16.100> 14<00:01:17.100> minutes

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.480 
well that's 936 now so I'm gonna pause
the<00:01:24.270> camera<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.840> we'll<00:01:25.220> know<00:01:26.220> we're<00:01:26.400> gonna

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the camera and we'll know we're gonna

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.190 
the camera and we'll know we're gonna
come<00:01:26.730> back<00:01:26.880> when<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.180> gets<00:01:27.420> done<00:01:30.050> okay<00:01:31.050> it's

now nine forty two and we've now gotten

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.230 
now nine forty two and we've now gotten
past<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.260> analyzing<00:01:34.800> point<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.910> now<00:01:36.060> we're

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
past the analyzing point and now we're

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.730 
past the analyzing point and now we're
actually<00:01:36.360> encoding<00:01:36.810> mpeg-2<00:01:39.620> there's<00:01:40.620> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
actually encoding mpeg-2 there's the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.700 
actually encoding mpeg-2 there's the
time<00:01:41.010> Oh

gonna think the audience off we get our
credits

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.490 

and<00:02:29.900> it's<00:02:30.080> done

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.160 

so<00:02:34.070> it's<00:02:34.250> 949<00:02:35.000> p.m.<00:02:35.330> so<00:02:35.570> that<00:02:35.600> actually

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
so it's 949 p.m. so that actually

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.260 
so it's 949 p.m. so that actually
encoded<00:02:37.840> faster<00:02:38.840> than<00:02:38.990> real<00:02:39.170> time<00:02:39.460> on<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.730> i3

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
encoded faster than real time on the i3

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.080 
encoded faster than real time on the i3
system<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:43.070> meanwhile<00:02:43.490> all<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.610> Prescott

cooler than it's ever run when I had to

cooler than it's ever run when I had to
cover<00:03:15.440> on<00:03:15.680> but<00:03:16.670> we'll<00:03:16.850> get<00:03:16.970> back<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.330> this<00:03:17.450> well

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
cover on but we'll get back to this well

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.190 
cover on but we'll get back to this well
you<00:03:18.890> see<00:03:19.070> now<00:03:19.220> it's<00:03:19.400> it's<00:03:20.300> actually<00:03:20.450> 951

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
you see now it's it's actually 951

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.980 
you see now it's it's actually 951
that's<00:03:21.410> an<00:03:21.530> hour<00:03:21.650> are<00:03:22.370> off<00:03:22.700> we'll<00:03:23.540> get<00:03:23.690> back<00:03:23.810> to

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
that's an hour are off we'll get back to

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.150 
that's an hour are off we'll get back to
this<00:03:24.080> when<00:03:24.260> he<00:03:24.350> gets<00:03:24.530> done<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.890> we'll<00:03:24.980> see

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
this when he gets done and we'll see

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.100 
this when he gets done and we'll see
what<00:03:25.310> time<00:03:25.490> it<00:03:25.610> is

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
what time it is

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.940 
what time it is
okay<00:03:27.110> we're<00:03:27.290> back<00:03:27.670> it's<00:03:28.670> now<00:03:29.740> 11:00<00:03:30.740> or<00:03:30.830> 1:00

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.809 

we're<00:03:33.950> almost<00:03:34.040> done

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:55.650 

39<00:03:39.629> 990<00:03:40.200> of<00:03:40.319> 44<00:03:40.860> 20

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.390 

one<00:03:56.260> point<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.620> actually<00:03:56.770> thought<00:03:57.040> this<00:03:57.250> was

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
one point I actually thought this was

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.890 
one point I actually thought this was
fast<00:03:59.460> when<00:04:00.460> I<00:04:00.490> got<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:00.850> system<00:04:01.240> going<00:04:01.420> it<00:04:01.810> was

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
fast when I got this system going it was

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.630 
fast when I got this system going it was
like<00:04:02.050> double<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.530> speed<00:04:02.920> of<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.130> old<00:04:03.280> system

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
like double the speed of the old system

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.339 
like double the speed of the old system
that<00:04:03.670> I<00:04:03.850> have<00:04:03.880> for<00:04:05.520> encoding<00:04:06.520> for<00:04:06.820> DVD

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:28.760 

almost<00:04:12.010> on

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.290 

you<00:04:29.220> know<00:04:29.310> it's<00:04:29.430> clearing<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:29.820> out<00:04:29.940> but<00:04:30.180> yeah<00:04:30.270> I

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
you know it's clearing it out but yeah I

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.570 
you know it's clearing it out but yeah I
took<00:04:30.590> an<00:04:31.590> hour<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.070> 26<00:04:32.730> minutes<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:35.280> deal<00:04:35.430> with

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
took an hour and 26 minutes to deal with

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.270 
took an hour and 26 minutes to deal with
22<00:04:36.030> minute<00:04:36.390> video<00:04:37.110> file<00:04:37.760> whereas<00:04:39.920> the<00:04:40.920> system

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
22 minute video file whereas the system

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.020 
22 minute video file whereas the system
here<00:04:42.110> took<00:04:43.110> 22<00:04:43.500> minutes<00:04:46.580> that's<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.670> huge

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
here took 22 minutes that's a huge

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.390 
here took 22 minutes that's a huge
improvement
