different<00:02:59.659> connection<00:03:00.650> points<00:03:00.680> here<00:03:01.010> that's

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
different connection points here that's

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.110

what<00:03:01.909> you<00:03:02.000> want<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.239> do<00:03:02.329> is<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.599> line<00:03:02.810> goes<00:03:02.989> up

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
what you want to do is this line goes up

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.490 
what you want to do is this line goes up
put<00:03:05.120> it<00:03:05.209> over<00:03:05.299> and<00:03:05.840> once<00:03:06.049> you<00:03:06.139> get<00:03:06.260> it<00:03:06.349> on

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
put it over and once you get it on

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.500 
put it over and once you get it on
you'll<00:03:07.250> just<00:03:07.489> shift<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.819> back<00:03:08.030> when<00:03:08.389> you

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
you'll just shift it back when you

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.660 
you'll just shift it back when you
should<00:03:08.689> play<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.870> backward<00:03:09.469> it<00:03:09.889> locks<00:03:10.519> it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
should play the backward it locks it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.420 
should play the backward it locks it
into<00:03:10.790> place<00:03:10.969> so<00:03:11.359> it<00:03:11.420> won't<00:03:11.629> come<00:03:11.810> off<00:03:12.280> now<00:03:13.280> as

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
into place so it won't come off now as

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.949 
into place so it won't come off now as
what<00:03:13.579> you'll<00:03:13.730> do<00:03:13.909> is<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.450> here<00:03:14.659> needs<00:03:14.870> to

what you'll do is this here needs to

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.770 
what you'll do is this here needs to
connect<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.379> your<00:03:15.500> air<00:03:15.709> pump<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.780> before

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
connect to your air pump and before

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.179 
connect to your air pump and before
close<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.290> air<00:03:18.409> pumps<00:03:18.680> what<00:03:18.889> we<00:03:18.950> want<00:03:19.099> to

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:19.189 
close to the air pumps what we want to

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:26.229 
close to the air pumps what we want to
do<00:03:19.310> is<00:03:19.519> cut<00:03:20.980> your<00:03:21.980> tubing<00:03:23.379> and<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:26.030> kick<00:03:26.209> comes

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
also with a valve so you gonna connect

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:35.619 
also with a valve so you gonna connect
this<00:03:28.219> valve<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:33.969> the<00:03:34.969> kit<00:03:35.150> also<00:03:35.299> comes

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
this valve to it and the kit also comes

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.039 
this valve to it and the kit also comes
with<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:36.609> tee<00:03:37.609> and<00:03:37.879> the<00:03:38.389> only<00:03:38.510> time<00:03:38.689> you<00:03:38.840> use

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
with a tee and the only time you use

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.979 
with a tee and the only time you use
this<00:03:39.200> key<00:03:39.439> is<00:03:39.969> if<00:03:40.969> you<00:03:41.090> had<00:03:41.180> an<00:03:41.389> existing<00:03:41.689> air

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
this key is if you had an existing air

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.599 
this key is if you had an existing air
line<00:03:42.230> because<00:03:42.919> a<00:03:42.950> lot<00:03:43.129> of<00:03:43.159> times<00:03:43.340> people

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
line because a lot of times people

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.189 
line because a lot of times people
already<00:03:43.940> have<00:03:44.209> an<00:03:44.389> air<00:03:44.510> line<00:03:44.659> going<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.019> maybe

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
already have an air line going to maybe

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.199 
already have an air line going to maybe
an<00:03:45.560> airstone<00:03:45.919> or<00:03:46.310> maybe<00:03:46.489> another<00:03:46.699> decorative

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
an airstone or maybe another decorative

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.879 
an airstone or maybe another decorative
item<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.109> then<00:03:48.199> you<00:03:48.319> can<00:03:48.470> just<00:03:48.590> look<00:03:48.739> into

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
item and then you can just look into

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.219 
item and then you can just look into
that<00:03:49.069> line<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.549> this<00:03:50.449> single<00:03:50.659> line<00:03:50.900> would<00:03:51.109> go

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
that line and this single line would go

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:55.719 
that line and this single line would go
off<00:03:51.409> into<00:03:51.680> your<00:03:51.949> underwater<00:03:53.440> habitat<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:55.370> we

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:55.729 
off into your underwater habitat so we

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.569 
off into your underwater habitat so we
don't<00:03:55.909> need<00:03:56.000> that<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.239> our<00:03:56.449> case<00:03:56.689> so<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:58.370> take

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
don't need that in our case so you take

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.000 
don't need that in our case so you take
that<00:03:58.729> and<00:03:59.030> then<00:03:59.120> your<00:03:59.299> air<00:03:59.449> pump<00:04:00.010> nescience

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
that and then your air pump nescience

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.189 
that and then your air pump nescience
bump<00:04:01.370> from<00:04:02.269> pretty<00:04:02.540> much<00:04:02.629> any<00:04:02.810> score<00:04:03.049> will

that water out so what you'll do is

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.830 
that water out so what you'll do is
you'll<00:04:18.199> take<00:04:18.349> your<00:04:18.500> valve<00:04:19.479> just<00:04:20.479> go<00:04:20.570> ahead<00:04:20.659> and

open that valve up full blast and your
to<00:04:24.289> see<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.680> air<00:04:25.009> pushing<00:04:25.759> the<00:04:25.849> water<00:04:26.030> out

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
to see that air pushing the water out

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.580 
to see that air pushing the water out
the<00:04:26.449> water<00:04:26.659> will<00:04:26.840> be<00:04:26.930> coming<00:04:27.080> back<00:04:27.380> out<00:04:27.560> of

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
the water will be coming back out of

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.040 
the water will be coming back out of
this<00:04:27.830> entry<00:04:28.460> right<00:04:28.580> here<00:04:28.639> as<00:04:29.570> soon<00:04:29.780> as<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:29.930> air

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
this entry right here as soon as the air

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.330 
this entry right here as soon as the air
starts<00:04:30.349> coming<00:04:30.590> out<00:04:30.680> of<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:31.009> be<00:04:31.159> right

starts coming out of the to be right
here<00:04:31.520> there<00:04:31.940> are<00:04:32.060> these<00:04:32.180> two<00:04:32.570> small<00:04:32.810> holes<00:04:32.990> and

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
here there are these two small holes and

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.430 
here there are these two small holes and
the<00:04:34.220> release<00:04:34.639> points<00:04:34.970> through<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.210> air<00:04:35.440> then

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
the release points through the air then

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.870 
the release points through the air then
you'll<00:04:36.590> just<00:04:36.800> crank<00:04:37.099> that<00:04:37.250> down<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.520> little<00:04:37.669> bit

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
you'll just crank that down a little bit

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.149 
you'll just crank that down a little bit
and<00:04:39.430> just<00:04:40.430> adjusted<00:04:40.940> to<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.180> water<00:04:42.130> where<00:04:43.130> the

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
and just adjusted to the water where the

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.040 
and just adjusted to the water where the
air<00:04:43.340> comes<00:04:43.460> out<00:04:43.639> maybe<00:04:43.880> every<00:04:44.150> 5-10<00:04:44.599> seconds

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
air comes out maybe every 5-10 seconds

it doesn't really matter it doesn't have
to<00:04:46.669> be<00:04:46.789> exact<00:04:47.090> but<00:04:47.330> that's<00:04:48.080> about<00:04:48.289> what<00:04:48.469> I<00:04:48.500> like
