00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
right now is one of the things one of

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.790 
right now is one of the things one of
the<00:00:52.120> skills<00:00:52.390> that<00:00:52.510> you<00:00:52.810> need<00:00:52.990> to<00:00:53.050> know<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.680> be

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
the skills that you need to know to be

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.800 
the skills that you need to know to be
able<00:00:53.890> to<00:00:54.010> do<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.280> sweater<00:00:54.610> like<00:00:54.850> that<00:00:55.060> and<00:00:55.300> that

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
able to do a sweater like that and that

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.860 
able to do a sweater like that and that
is<00:00:56.020> how<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.200> do<00:00:56.500> a<00:00:56.530> bar<00:00:56.890> increase<00:00:57.610> we<00:00:58.570> can<00:00:58.720> go

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
is how to do a bar increase we can go

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.720 
is how to do a bar increase we can go
over<00:00:59.020> other<00:00:59.140> increases<00:00:59.590> if<00:00:59.890> you<00:01:00.010> want<00:01:00.250> but<00:01:00.520> the

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
over other increases if you want but the

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.600 
over other increases if you want but the
bar<00:01:00.910> increase<00:01:01.360> is<00:01:01.600> what<00:01:01.810> creates<00:01:02.260> this<00:01:02.710> so

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
bar increase is what creates this so

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.120 
bar increase is what creates this so
remember<00:01:04.180> I<00:01:04.329> started<00:01:04.869> from<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.110> top<00:01:05.439> down<00:01:05.770> and

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
remember I started from the top down and

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.740 
remember I started from the top down and
then<00:01:06.820> right<00:01:07.420> here<00:01:07.860> right<00:01:08.860> there<00:01:09.450> if<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.540> flip

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
then right here right there if you flip

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
then right here right there if you flip
it<00:01:10.840> around<00:01:10.960> here<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:11.800> there<00:01:12.190> I'm<00:01:13.770> increasing

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
it around here and there I'm increasing

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.160 
it around here and there I'm increasing
and<00:01:14.979> that's<00:01:15.670> what<00:01:15.909> gives<00:01:16.120> it<00:01:16.300> shape<00:01:16.330> you<00:01:17.050> know

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
and that's what gives it shape you know

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.440 
and that's what gives it shape you know
and<00:01:17.380> that's<00:01:17.440> what<00:01:17.740> leads<00:01:18.010> to<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.490> arms<00:01:18.880> we're

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
and that's what leads to the arms we're

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.180 
and that's what leads to the arms we're
gonna<00:01:19.540> pick<00:01:19.810> up<00:01:19.840> these<00:01:20.080> stitches<00:01:20.350> later<00:01:20.770> on<00:01:20.979> in

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
gonna pick up these stitches later on in

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.550 
gonna pick up these stitches later on in
another<00:01:21.430> video<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.900> I<00:01:22.960> thought<00:01:23.140> I'd<00:01:23.409> show<00:01:23.530> you

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
another video but I thought I'd show you

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.170 
another video but I thought I'd show you
how<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:23.799> do<00:01:23.979> this<00:01:24.130> bar<00:01:24.340> increase<00:01:25.440> so<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:27.880> Doug

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
how to do this bar increase so if Doug

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.750 
how to do this bar increase so if Doug
can<00:01:28.510> zoom<00:01:28.840> in<00:01:29.320> this<00:01:30.070> is<00:01:30.130> about<00:01:30.430> where<00:01:30.640> I'm

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
can zoom in this is about where I'm

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.940 
can zoom in this is about where I'm
gonna<00:01:30.850> be

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.270 

good<00:01:36.580> ok<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:38.229> I<00:01:38.500> just<00:01:38.530> happened<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:39.009> be<00:01:39.130> in<00:01:39.159> the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
good ok so I just happened to be in the

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.770 
good ok so I just happened to be in the
middle<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.700> row<00:01:39.850> so<00:01:40.330> you<00:01:40.390> can<00:01:40.570> kind<00:01:40.750> of

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
middle of a row so you can kind of

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.590 
middle of a row so you can kind of
ignore<00:01:40.960> that<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.490> way<00:01:42.640> you<00:01:42.700> do<00:01:43.060> in<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.390> bar

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.120 
ignore that but the way you do in a bar
increase<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:46.540> a<00:01:46.659> bar<00:01:46.840> increase<00:01:47.200> but<00:01:48.009> you

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
increase and it's a bar increase but you

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.980 
increase and it's a bar increase but you
can<00:01:48.280> also<00:01:48.399> call<00:01:48.759> it<00:01:48.790> just<00:01:49.210> knitting<00:01:49.689> in<00:01:49.869> the

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
can also call it just knitting in the
