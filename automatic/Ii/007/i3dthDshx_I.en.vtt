00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.890
 the trap 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.740
 and 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.110
 a mouse looking through a hole in the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.050
 wall I saw a farmer and his wife 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.810
 opening a package thought that the kind of 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.390
 food could have been there 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.360
 horrified when he discovered that it was a 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.970
 mouse trap was running to the 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.610
 farm yard warn everyone there 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.340
 a mousetrap in the house there is a mousetrap 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.040
 in the house the chicken that was 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.579
 cackling and scratching raised the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.109
 head and said excuse me mister mouse yo 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.379
 I understand that it is a big problem for 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.260
 you do not harm me in anything or me 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.809
 bothers 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.780
 the mouse went to the lamb and said 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.670
 there is a mousetrap in the house a mousetrap 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.190
 excuse me sir mouse more there is nothing 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.560
 that I can only ask for 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.940
 you want quiet that will be 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.880
 remembered you in my prayers 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.000
 the mouse then turned to the cow and 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.760
 the cow repeated the same thing, maybe I'm 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.200
 in danger I think the cow did not say 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.690
 then the mouse came home 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.830
 worried and dejected to face the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.620
 Farmer's mousetrap 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.110
 that night there was a great noise 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.600
 like that of a mousetrap trapping its 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.360
 victim the farmer's wife ran 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.540
 to see what had already caught the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.010
 darkness she did not see that the mousetrap 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.350
 caught the tail of a poisonous snake 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.630
 which bit the woman 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.689
 the farmer took her immediately to 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.400
 hospital she came back with fever and everything 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.009
 the world knows that to feed 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.760
 someone with a fever nothing better than a 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.610
 Soup 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.490
 the farmer grabbed his knife and went to 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.470
 look for the main ingredient a 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.060
 chicken 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.210
 like the woman's disease 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.970
 continued the friends and neighbors went to 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.950
 visit it and to feed them the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.340
 farmer killed the lamb 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.590
 the woman did not improve and she ended up dying 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.230
 farmer then sold the cow to 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.800
 slaughterhouse to cover the costs of 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.800
 funeral 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.459
 the next time you hear someone 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.790
 have a problem and believe that as it is not 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.569
 you should not pay attention 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.569
 think twice 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.110
 we read in Romans 1215 we enjoy with the 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.900
 who enjoy mourn with those who mourn 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.570
 unanimous among you not active 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.390
 associating them with the humble do not be 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.450
 wise in your own opinion and in 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.180
 Galatians 62 cope with the ones 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.880
 loads of others and thus fulfill the law 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.180
 of Christ because he who believes himself to be something 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.180
 not doing anything likewise is deceived
