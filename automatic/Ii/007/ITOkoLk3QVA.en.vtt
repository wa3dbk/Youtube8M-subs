00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
you'll take damage the reverse is true

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.130 
you'll take damage the reverse is true
would<00:02:51.910> move<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.180> when<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.570> move<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:52.750> can<00:02:53.020> hit

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
would move it when you move you can hit

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.800 
would move it when you move you can hit
walls<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:54.040> get<00:02:54.130> around<00:02:54.370> no<00:02:54.700> problem<00:02:55.120> but<00:02:55.720> if

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
walls to get around no problem but if

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.420 
walls to get around no problem but if
you<00:02:55.900> hit<00:02:56.080> a<00:02:56.110> character<00:02:56.590> while<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:56.920> move<00:02:57.100> and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
you hit a character while you move and

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.810 
you hit a character while you move and
you'll<00:02:57.970> take<00:02:58.150> damage<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.560> you<00:03:00.100> can<00:03:00.610> use<00:03:00.730> your

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
you'll take damage so you can use your

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.490 
you'll take damage so you can use your
moves<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.300> set<00:03:01.510> up<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:01.750> different<00:03:01.989> attack<00:03:02.230> and

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
moves to set up a different attack and

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500 
moves to set up a different attack and
then<00:03:02.770> practically<00:03:03.130> perform<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.700> attack<00:03:03.940> to

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
then practically perform the attack to

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.960 
then practically perform the attack to
knock<00:03:04.810> your<00:03:04.989> opponent<00:03:05.350> out<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.739> again<00:03:06.190> safe<00:03:06.520> a

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
walls or if you hit them off the table

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.789 
walls or if you hit them off the table
completely<00:03:11.800> you'll<00:03:12.730> do<00:03:12.880> extra<00:03:13.239> damage<00:03:13.799> so

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
completely you'll do extra damage so

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.949 
completely you'll do extra damage so
that's<00:03:15.519> kind<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.820> core<00:03:16.090> two<00:03:16.360> distillers

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
that's kind of the core two distillers

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.280 
that's kind of the core two distillers
but<00:03:17.560> there's<00:03:17.709> more<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:17.950> it<00:03:18.100> you<00:03:19.030> can<00:03:19.269> play<00:03:19.600> with
