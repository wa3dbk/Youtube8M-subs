00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.090 
decided to use just the Jill alone with
oil<00:01:51.299> because<00:01:51.750> i<00:01:51.840> feel<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.409> conditioner

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100

completely flat so i could really get

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.140 
completely flat so i could really get
underneath<00:03:51.440> because<00:03:52.220> these<00:03:52.519> little<00:03:52.850> prongs

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
underneath because these little prongs

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.680 
underneath because these little prongs
seem<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:54.430> kind<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.549> mess<00:03:55.850> with<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.299> definition
