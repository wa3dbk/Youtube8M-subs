I just talked about which is the top ten
of<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> year<00:00:57.590> okay<00:00:58.590> well<00:00:58.800> let's<00:00:59.010> not<00:00:59.070> go<00:00:59.309> that

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
far maybe this is an album that is more

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.460 
far maybe this is an album that is more
akin<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> potentially<00:01:03.270> change<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.870> top<00:01:04.140> 25

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
