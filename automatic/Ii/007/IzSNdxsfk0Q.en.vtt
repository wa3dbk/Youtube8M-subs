everywhere you go you're that much
closer<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.629> answer<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.319> with<00:00:08.130> technology

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
closer to the answer and with technology

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.060 
closer to the answer and with technology
becoming<00:00:09.150> more<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.719> more<00:00:09.780> prominent<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.769> our

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
well and then that's just been a really

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.980 
well and then that's just been a really
neat<00:01:04.739> thing<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.159> watch<00:01:05.309> them<00:01:05.580> grow<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.390> do

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
things without really having to work at

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.859 
things without really having to work at
or<00:01:10.470> look<00:01:10.680> at<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.760> work<00:01:12.000> because<00:01:12.780> I

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
or look at it as if it's work because I

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.840 
or look at it as if it's work because I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
or they don't understand why they do

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.359 
or they don't understand why they do
need<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.720> something<00:01:18.990> their<00:01:19.830> tendency<00:01:20.280> to

want to do it is much lower and with the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.370 
want to do it is much lower and with the
iPad<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:23.549> tend<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.390> take<00:01:24.689> right<00:01:24.900> -<00:01:25.080> and

a<00:01:41.380> quick<00:01:41.620> way<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.770> get<00:01:41.950> information<00:01:42.070> and

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
a quick way to get information and

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.400 
a quick way to get information and
instead<00:01:43.360> of<00:01:43.480> me<00:01:43.570> putting<00:01:43.870> the<00:01:43.960> sentence<00:01:44.290> on

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
instead of me putting the sentence on

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.810 
instead of me putting the sentence on
the<00:01:44.650> board<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:44.980> kids<00:01:45.130> come<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.460> Carbon

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
the board the kids come to the Carbon

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.870 
the board the kids come to the Carbon
Copy<00:01:46.030> they<00:01:47.020> can<00:01:47.380> immediately<00:01:47.860> McGovern<00:01:48.550> iPads

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
Copy they can immediately McGovern iPads

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.240 
Copy they can immediately McGovern iPads
and<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.320> will<00:01:50.410> tell<00:01:50.650> them<00:01:50.830> what<00:01:50.980> I<00:01:51.010> want

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
and and it will tell them what I want

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.130 
and and it will tell them what I want
and<00:01:51.760> I<00:01:51.850> think<00:01:52.060> that's<00:01:52.300> been<00:01:52.600> one<00:01:52.630> of<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.900> more

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
and I think that's been one of the more

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.840 
and I think that's been one of the more
rewarding<00:01:53.290> or<00:01:53.980> one<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.220> the<00:01:54.280> neater<00:01:54.490> things

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
rewarding or one of the neater things

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.750 
rewarding or one of the neater things
about<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.330> iPad<00:01:55.630> in<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.810> classroom<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:56.800> how

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
about the iPad in the classroom is how

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:13.240 
about the iPad in the classroom is how
limitless<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:58.990> is<00:01:59.140> our<00:02:00.010> network<00:02:00.610> screen

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
but the iPads and the iPod there's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.520 
but the iPads and the iPod there's
virtually<00:02:16.460> no<00:02:16.910> learning<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.350> kids

virtually no learning that the kids

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.200 
virtually no learning that the kids
usually<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:19.040> come<00:02:19.220> in<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.610> pick<00:02:19.730> them<00:02:19.880> up<00:02:19.970> and

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
usually can come in and pick them up and

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.210 
usually can come in and pick them up and
ride<00:02:20.390> away<00:02:20.570> they're<00:02:21.110> able<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.380> use<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.860> not

ride away they're able to use and not

ride away they're able to use and not
just<00:02:22.520> use<00:02:22.700> them<00:02:22.880> to<00:02:23.120> be<00:02:23.450> effective<00:02:23.690> with

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050

challenge<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:25.070> have<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.550> getting<00:02:25.790> out<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
challenge I have is getting out of the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.580 
challenge I have is getting out of the
way<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.510> letting<00:02:26.750> them<00:02:26.900> show<00:02:27.110> me<00:02:27.290> what<00:02:27.470> they

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
way and letting them show me what they

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.990 
way and letting them show me what they
can<00:02:27.650> do<00:02:28.010> because<00:02:28.190> they<00:02:28.400> can<00:02:28.430> do<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:28.790> much<00:02:28.970> more

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
can do because they can do so much more

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.140 
can do because they can do so much more
than<00:02:29.480> what<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.720> ever<00:02:29.810> thought
