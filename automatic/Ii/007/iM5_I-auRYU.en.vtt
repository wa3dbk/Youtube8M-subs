00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.189
 five times champion of France jump 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.889
 wheelchair laetitia bernard 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.750
 is blind from birth despite this 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.670
 handicap the appreciated ethician 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.199
 riding and especially the sensations 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.199
 that causes him jumping 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.000
 laetitia by its handicap is to 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.360
 listened to his horse and his body 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.460
 in a particular way a sharing of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.960
 his experience opens paths and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.180
 reflections that all valid riders 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.250
 deserves to hear I'm looking for a lot of 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.809
 calm and serenity and feeling 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.489
 to be able to understand everything that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.120
 is going to handle the most things 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.969
 possible and so this natural goofball where 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 there is a mental balance body between the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.989
 horse and suddenly the rider is 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.880
 something important do not need 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.510
 want to manage all its least 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.000
 movements 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.229
 because otherwise we bridle and then take 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.820
 the more decisions he needs to 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.659
 take for to help me when he 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.700
 so it's really a balance to 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:24.840
 its ends but great fun when we 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 find the feeling of the horse was 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.689
 enormously the plate and the basin but 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.220
 really enormously 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.720
 it's even the most it's the basin and the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.049
 upper legs it's really there 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.000
 happens 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.710
 and after at the bottom of the legs the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.650
 fixity of my leg will allow me 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.790
 to have independence from the rest is to 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.090
 to be able to feel what's going on 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.189
 else what's actually what I like this 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.259
 that I try not to suffer but 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.040
 summit to go with went to live for 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.040
 take full advantage of it 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.049
 to have a disability like mine 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.930
 something quite difficult end that 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.280
 it's something that makes life 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 especially everyday life extremely 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.320
 complex and finally the horse in all 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.970
 the cases I still find it's 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.920
 really very end bearer very 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.810
 constructive for a person who sees 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.750
 not because it gives a movement in 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.310
 before that gives one at the level of the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.280
 proprioception it gives sensations 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.580
 quite exceptional from taking 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.349
 confidence also in relation to the animal 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.599
 finally I find it's really something 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.599
 very positive thing 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.290
 yes it is very very well it is 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.940
 to go back in front but I said myself life 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.780
 for me the perfect first is to put the 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.209
 horse in the best conditions 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.500
 possible to cross a 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.540
 obstacle topple the sound football iron 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.150
 here is put the horse in the in the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.430
 better balance to have 100% of 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.430
 safety on the jump the french
