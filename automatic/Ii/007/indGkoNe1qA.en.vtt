come into a rehearsal at the end of the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.700 
come into a rehearsal at the end of the
day<00:00:38.430> having<00:00:38.730> been<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> office<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.780> you

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
day having been in the office and you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.369 
day having been in the office and you
need<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.040> initially<00:00:41.820> sort<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.210> relax<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.989> you

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
need to initially sort of relax and you

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.190 
need to initially sort of relax and you
need<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.789> well<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.969> bit<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.239> my<00:00:45.570> car<00:00:45.840> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
need to well it's a bit like my car you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.260 
need to well it's a bit like my car you
know<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> engines<00:00:46.800> started<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> engines

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
know the engines started out the engines

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.240 
know the engines started out the engines
called<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.770> inefficient

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
called in it it's just so inefficient

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.850 
called in it it's just so inefficient
and<00:00:50.640> then<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.059> gets<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.449> warm<00:00:51.750> up<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and then as it gets to warm up and the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.680 
and then as it gets to warm up and the
oils<00:00:53.219> start<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.640> move<00:00:53.789> around<00:00:53.910> then<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.570> know

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
oils start to move around then you know

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.360 
oils start to move around then you know
it's<00:00:55.170> much<00:00:55.350> more<00:00:55.530> efficient<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> same

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it's much more efficient and the same

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.610 
it's much more efficient and the same
with<00:00:56.579> singing<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.420> people<00:00:58.109> got<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.379> relax

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
with singing so people got to relax

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.290 
with singing so people got to relax
they've<00:00:59.010> got<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> begin<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.670> use<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> right

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
they've got to begin to use the right

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.170 
they've got to begin to use the right
muscles<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:01.440> diverted<00:01:02.160> from<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> problems<00:01:03.030> of

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
muscles be diverted from the problems of

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.759 
muscles be diverted from the problems of
the<00:01:03.300> day<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.960> think<00:01:04.080> more<00:01:04.409> maps<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:04.739> very

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the day so I think more maps are very

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.510 
the day so I think more maps are very
important<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.580> they've<00:01:05.729> got<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.030> fun

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
important but they've got to be fun

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.830 
important but they've got to be fun

getting to the highest possible standard
in<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.319> sense<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.709> all<00:02:21.950> over<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.819> all<00:02:22.940> the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
in a sense is that all over the all the
