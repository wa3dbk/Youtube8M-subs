00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.090
 hello all yourself hunter and in this video 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.400
 I tell in a steam turbine and kraft sral 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.290
 I will show how he crabs how it works so 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.200
 first you need to make a body 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.959
 steam turbine for this need steel 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.669
 steel plate and steel block 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.429
 plates can be obtained in rolling 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.410
 mill 4 steel track to 4 steel 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.720
 plates 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.150
 Immediately I say you need 12 blocks from 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.800
 games to build a fully steam 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.710
 the turbine 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.670
 do the next three in length 2 width and 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.320
 2 height as soon as you are done 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.899
 right you will see such here 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.550
 click the pictures with the right mouse button and 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.160
 get into the internal interface 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.370
 ships need to place the turbine rotor 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.530
 to make it you need three disks 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.690
 turbines to make a disk 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.079
 turbines need turbine blade and 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.140
 steel block shovel turbine kravec from 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.850
 three steel ingots 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.340
 now we need to steam to 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.320
 steam turbine worked immediately speaking 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.239
 for the steam turbine to work 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.839
 at maximum power that is a hundred 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.119
 percent 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.009
 you must use a low boiler 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.830
 pressure from such a construction of 3 by 3 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.740
 and 4 he height produces three hundred 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.540
 sixty miles and buckets it's time for tick either 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.040
 you can use the design from 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.340
 high pressure boilers 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.990
 3 by 3 and 2 height here we see them also 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.060
 produce three hundred and sixty miles and 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.400
 villar time for tick that is for that 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.619
 to make your steam turbine work on 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.399
 maximum power required 360 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.950
 trailed units couple to it hitting 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:38.530
 while she is here to produce 200 units 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.119
 electricity per tick at maximum 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.220
 power 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.399
 Immediately I say if you built this 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.380
 construction 3 by 3 and 4 height from the boilers 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.810
 high pressure you can immediately 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.250
 connect two steam turbines and they 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.500
 will work at maximum power 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.090
 when the steam boiler warm up to 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.969
 maximum temperature 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.979
 although I even think up to 900 degrees will be 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.259
 enough to steam turbine 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.619
 worked at maximum power and 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.619
 both 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.150
 also you can connect here such 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.390
 liquid pipes and steam will fall from 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.170
 boiler through these pipes to the right turbine but 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.030
 I advise you to put it in this close 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.750
 at the same time you can bet absolutely with 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.459
 any party 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.160
 the main thing that it is connected to the boiler 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:32.209
 Can top side generally can not 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.040
 difference well what do I think that's all 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.510
 put likes subscribe to my 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.510
 channel and see you soon
