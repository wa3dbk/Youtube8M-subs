teaspoon of baking powder and I stir

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.360 
teaspoon of baking powder and I stir
that<00:00:37.649> up<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.950> little<00:00:38.040> bit<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:39.260> then<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.410> add<00:00:40.590> 3

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
that up a little bit and then I add 3

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.369 
that up a little bit and then I add 3
tablespoons<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.059> oil<00:00:42.270> now<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> use

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
tablespoons of oil now I use

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.440 
tablespoons of oil now I use
heart-healthy<00:00:44.370> canola<00:00:44.700> oil<00:00:44.940> which<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
heart-healthy canola oil which is

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.840 
heart-healthy canola oil which is
flavorless<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.890> also<00:00:47.039> use<00:00:47.340> olive<00:00:47.550> oil

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
flavorless you can also use olive oil

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.709 
flavorless you can also use olive oil
which<00:00:48.270> gives<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> little<00:00:48.899> bit<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.289> flavor

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
which gives it a little bit of a flavor

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.479 
which gives it a little bit of a flavor
yeah<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.289> need<00:00:52.500> saturated<00:00:53.100> fat<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
yeah you don't need saturated fat to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.979 
yeah you don't need saturated fat to
make<00:00:53.610> good<00:00:53.820> tortillas<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> point

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
make good tortillas that's the point

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.200 
make good tortillas that's the point
so<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.379> recommend<00:00:55.800> canola<00:00:56.280> oil<00:00:56.489> over<00:00:57.000> anything

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
so I recommend canola oil over anything

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.049 
so I recommend canola oil over anything
else<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.320> stir<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> oil<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.789> step

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
else you stir in the oil now this step

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.389 
else you stir in the oil now this step
you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.680> you<00:01:01.680> could<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> food

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you can do you could do in a food

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.250 
you can do you could do in a food
processor<00:01:02.629> but<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.750> know<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:03.960> something

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
processor but you know it's something

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.500 
processor but you know it's something

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
just on it you could probably do this on

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.919 
just on it you could probably do this on
a<00:02:08.280> big<00:02:08.550> plate<00:02:08.819> sometimes<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.509> even<00:02:09.629> do<00:02:09.810> it

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
a big plate sometimes you can even do it

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.690 
a big plate sometimes you can even do it
inside<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.470> same<00:02:10.679> bowl<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.310> mixed<00:02:11.580> it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
inside the same bowl that you mixed it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.900 
inside the same bowl that you mixed it
in<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.629> all<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.930> want<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.230> do<00:02:13.379> is<00:02:13.530> just

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
in so all you want to do is just

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.580 
in so all you want to do is just
that<00:02:14.060> kind<00:02:14.240> of<00:02:14.300> come<00:02:14.510> together<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.440> can

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
that kind of come together and you can

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.080 
that kind of come together and you can
see<00:02:15.800> how<00:02:15.950> long<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.190> took<00:02:16.580> just<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:16.910> few

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
see how long that took just a few

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.050 
see how long that took just a few
seconds<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.990> now<00:02:18.500> it's<00:02:18.830> like<00:02:19.040> one<00:02:19.430> solid<00:02:19.910> mass

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
seconds and now it's like one solid mass

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.260 
seconds and now it's like one solid mass
now<00:02:20.930> at<00:02:21.050> this<00:02:21.170> point<00:02:21.730> they<00:02:22.730> say<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.000> should

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
now at this point they say you should

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.850 
now at this point they say you should
kind<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.540> cover<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:23.990> let<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:24.140> rest<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.680> put<00:02:24.830> a

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
kind of cover and let it rest and put a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.710 
kind of cover and let it rest and put a
towel<00:02:25.070> on<00:02:25.100> it<00:02:25.340> but<00:02:25.610> I'm<00:02:26.000> usually<00:02:26.180> too<00:02:26.480> hungry

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
towel on it but I'm usually too hungry

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.240 
towel on it but I'm usually too hungry
so<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.110> just<00:02:27.410> keep<00:02:27.530> going<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:27.980> have<00:02:28.070> no

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.070 
so I just keep going and I have no
problem<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:28.880> as<00:02:28.940> far<00:02:29.120> as<00:02:29.180> I'm<00:02:29.330> concerned<00:02:29.720> you

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
problem so as far as I'm concerned you

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.140 
problem so as far as I'm concerned you
can<00:02:30.110> keep<00:02:30.410> going<00:02:30.560> from<00:02:30.740> this<00:02:30.920> point<00:02:31.220> but<00:02:32.090> you

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
can keep going from this point but you

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.530 
can keep going from this point but you
will<00:02:32.390> need<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.570> very<00:02:32.870> hot<00:02:33.110> pan<00:02:33.410> so<00:02:34.120> I'm<00:02:35.120> going<00:02:35.480> to

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
will need a very hot pan so I'm going to

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.270 
will need a very hot pan so I'm going to
put<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.810> pan<00:02:36.020> on<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.470> start<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:36.890> preheat<00:02:37.220> it

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
put the pan on and start to preheat it

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.460 
put the pan on and start to preheat it
while<00:02:37.490> I<00:02:37.520> get<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.910> tortillas<00:02:38.360> ready<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.840> I

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
while I get the tortillas ready and I

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.270 
while I get the tortillas ready and I
preheat<00:02:40.070> to<00:02:40.930> about<00:02:41.930> medium-high<00:02:42.440> just<00:02:42.980> just

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
preheat to about medium-high just just

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.800 
preheat to about medium-high just just
below<00:02:43.550> medium-high<00:02:44.060> because<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.360> pan<00:02:44.570> has<00:02:44.780> to

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
below medium-high because the pan has to

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.740 
below medium-high because the pan has to
be<00:02:44.960> quite<00:02:45.380> hot<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:45.980> I'll<00:02:46.850> get<00:02:47.000> that<00:02:47.150> going<00:02:47.480> and

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
be quite hot so I'll get that going and

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.860 
be quite hot so I'll get that going and
now<00:02:48.650> we're<00:02:48.980> gonna<00:02:49.100> make<00:02:49.280> eight<00:02:49.550> tortillas<00:02:50.090> so

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
now we're gonna make eight tortillas so

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.110 
now we're gonna make eight tortillas so
I'm<00:02:51.440> gonna<00:02:51.590> use<00:02:51.770> them<00:02:51.980> what<00:02:52.820> do<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:52.940> call

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
I'm gonna use them what do you call

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.020 
I'm gonna use them what do you call
these<00:02:53.270> things<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.840> cutter<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.590> lift<00:02:54.950> scraper<00:02:55.310> cut

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
these things a cutter a lift scraper cut

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.910 
these things a cutter a lift scraper cut
it<00:02:56.120> into<00:02:56.270> about<00:02:56.450> 8<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.170> can<00:02:57.290> use<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.470> knife<00:02:57.740> to

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
it into about 8 you can use a knife to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.490 
it into about 8 you can use a knife to
do<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:58.190> too<00:02:58.460> but<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.760> just<00:02:58.910> want<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.120> make

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
do this too but you just want to make

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.810 
do this too but you just want to make
approximately<00:03:00.500> equal<00:03:01.010> sizes<00:03:01.550> so<00:03:01.730> the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
approximately equal sizes so the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.580 
approximately equal sizes so the
tortillas<00:03:02.270> are<00:03:02.420> about<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.690> same<00:03:02.870> size<00:03:02.930> and

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
tortillas are about the same size and

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.280 
tortillas are about the same size and
there's<00:03:04.460> 8<00:03:05.150> right<00:03:05.510> there<00:03:06.910> then<00:03:07.910> each<00:03:08.240> one<00:03:08.540> you

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
there's 8 right there then each one you

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.620 
there's 8 right there then each one you
form<00:03:09.590> into<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.860> ball<00:03:09.950> now<00:03:10.820> you<00:03:10.880> can<00:03:11.210> do<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:11.450> this

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
form into a ball now you can do it this

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.170 
form into a ball now you can do it this
way<00:03:11.690> where<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.320> kind<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.800> you<00:03:13.520> know<00:03:13.640> make<00:03:14.030> it

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
way where you kind of you know make it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.820 
way where you kind of you know make it
smooth<00:03:14.450> on<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.720> top<00:03:14.750> there's<00:03:15.410> different<00:03:15.740> ways

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
smooth on the top there's different ways

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.590 
smooth on the top there's different ways
to<00:03:16.040> do<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.220> sometimes<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:17.000> do<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.240> like<00:03:17.360> that

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
to do it sometimes I do it like that

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.380 
to do it sometimes I do it like that
sometimes<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:19.040> just<00:03:19.100> take<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.490> and<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.300> I

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
sometimes I just take it and I and I

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.660 
sometimes I just take it and I and I
roll<00:03:20.630> like<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:21.050> into<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.470> ball<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:22.310> doesn't

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
roll like that into a ball it doesn't

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.460 
roll like that into a ball it doesn't
seem<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:22.970> make<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.120> difference<00:03:23.209> how<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.110> get

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
seem to make a difference how you get

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.620 
seem to make a difference how you get
there<00:03:24.740> that<00:03:25.430> still<00:03:25.670> all<00:03:25.880> comes<00:03:26.120> out<00:03:26.270> into<00:03:26.600> a

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
there that still all comes out into a

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.900 
there that still all comes out into a
nice<00:03:27.020> tortilla<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:28.160> pan<00:03:28.459> is<00:03:28.610> getting<00:03:28.760> hot

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
nice tortilla the pan is getting hot

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.330 
nice tortilla the pan is getting hot
like<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:29.959> said<00:03:30.170> it's<00:03:30.320> about<00:03:30.410> medium<00:03:31.040> high<00:03:31.190> it's

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
like I said it's about medium high it's

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.370 
like I said it's about medium high it's
got<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.550> be<00:03:31.610> nice<00:03:31.820> and<00:03:32.030> hot<00:03:32.090> no<00:03:32.810> grease<00:03:33.080> on<00:03:33.260> the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
got to be nice and hot no grease on the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.580 
got to be nice and hot no grease on the
pan<00:03:33.590> just<00:03:34.130> grease<00:03:34.580> free<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:35.990> flatten<00:03:36.500> it

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
pan just grease free and so I flatten it

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.220 
pan just grease free and so I flatten it
out<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.709> little<00:03:36.890> bit<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:38.480> just<00:03:38.510> roll<00:03:38.930> this

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
out a little bit and you just roll this

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.170 
out a little bit and you just roll this
is<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:40.010> only<00:03:40.220> part<00:03:40.459> that's<00:03:40.520> kind<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:40.970> work

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
is the the only part that's kind of work

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.830 
is the the only part that's kind of work
when<00:03:41.390> it<00:03:41.480> comes<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.810> this<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.850> thing<00:03:44.060> is<00:03:44.270> I

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
when it comes to this and the thing is I

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.860 
when it comes to this and the thing is I
don't<00:03:45.260> think<00:03:45.500> you<00:03:45.739> can<00:03:45.890> use<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:46.630> tortilla<00:03:47.630> press

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
don't think you can use a tortilla press

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.960 
don't think you can use a tortilla press
because<00:03:48.320> flour<00:03:48.920> tortillas<00:03:49.520> have<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:49.850> be

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
because flour tortillas have to be

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.820 
because flour tortillas have to be
really<00:03:50.510> really<00:03:50.720> thin<00:03:51.020> so<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:52.280> just<00:03:52.790> roll<00:03:53.209> until

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
really really thin so I just roll until

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.140 
really really thin so I just roll until
there's<00:03:54.830> practically<00:03:55.340> until<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:55.790> can<00:03:56.000> almost

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
there's practically until I can almost

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.140 
there's practically until I can almost
see<00:03:56.510> through<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:58.250> it<00:03:58.459> should<00:03:58.700> ease<00:03:58.910> if

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
see through it and so it should ease if

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.020 
see through it and so it should ease if
you<00:03:59.300> make<00:03:59.510> 8<00:03:59.870> they<00:04:00.410> should<00:04:00.650> roll<00:04:00.860> into<00:04:01.160> about

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
you make 8 they should roll into about

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.729 
you make 8 they should roll into about
eight<00:04:02.300> inch<00:04:02.510> tortillas<00:04:03.020> and<00:04:03.230> they're<00:04:03.590> never

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
eight inch tortillas and they're never

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.490 
eight inch tortillas and they're never
going<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.950> be<00:04:04.100> perfect<00:04:04.250> circles<00:04:04.880> so<00:04:05.410> you<00:04:06.410> know

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
going to be perfect circles so you know

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.990 
going to be perfect circles so you know
the<00:04:06.590> more<00:04:06.739> you<00:04:06.920> roll<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.489> make<00:04:07.640> them<00:04:07.790> nice<00:04:07.940> and

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
the more you roll to make them nice and

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.970 
the more you roll to make them nice and
thin<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.570> more<00:04:08.750> kind<00:04:08.959> of<00:04:09.080> irregular<00:04:09.620> they<00:04:09.739> get

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
thin the more kind of irregular they get

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.680 
thin the more kind of irregular they get
but<00:04:10.400> that's<00:04:10.550> what's<00:04:10.850> nice<00:04:10.970> about<00:04:11.030> homemade

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
but that's what's nice about homemade

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.830 
but that's what's nice about homemade
that's<00:04:11.930> how<00:04:12.080> you<00:04:12.140> know<00:04:12.350> they're<00:04:12.470> homemade<00:04:12.830> so

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
that's how you know they're homemade so

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.940 
that's how you know they're homemade so
you<00:04:14.840> could<00:04:15.020> I<00:04:15.200> don't<00:04:15.260> know<00:04:15.380> if<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.560> can<00:04:15.709> tell<00:04:15.920> I

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
you could I don't know if you can tell I

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.060 
you could I don't know if you can tell I
can<00:04:16.250> almost<00:04:16.370> see<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.790> pattern<00:04:17.359> of<00:04:17.570> my<00:04:17.750> granite

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
can almost see the pattern of my granite

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.450 
can almost see the pattern of my granite
under<00:04:19.070> this<00:04:19.220> tortilla<00:04:20.440> so<00:04:21.440> that's<00:04:21.890> how<00:04:22.160> thin

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
under this tortilla so that's how thin

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.180 
under this tortilla so that's how thin
it<00:04:22.580> has<00:04:22.789> to<00:04:22.970> be<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:23.240> can<00:04:23.390> see<00:04:23.600> how<00:04:23.979> it<00:04:24.979> went

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
it has to be you can see how it went

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.430 
it has to be you can see how it went
from<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.520> size<00:04:25.760> of<00:04:25.940> that<00:04:26.090> ball<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:27.110> this

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
from the size of that ball to this

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.960 
from the size of that ball to this
and<00:04:27.770> even<00:04:27.950> when<00:04:28.070> just<00:04:28.400> when<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:28.610> think<00:04:28.760> you're

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
and even when just when you think you're

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.420 
and even when just when you think you're
done<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.660> just<00:04:29.900> keep<00:04:30.140> rolling<00:04:30.350> some<00:04:30.710> more<00:04:30.920> so

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
done you just keep rolling some more so

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.320 
done you just keep rolling some more so
roll<00:04:32.180> it<00:04:32.210> really<00:04:32.990> really<00:04:33.200> thin<00:04:33.470> you<00:04:34.150> just<00:04:35.150> lift

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
roll it really really thin you just lift

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.600 
roll it really really thin you just lift
it<00:04:35.450> off<00:04:35.600> it'll<00:04:35.900> left<00:04:36.260> it'll<00:04:37.220> peel<00:04:37.400> right<00:04:37.550> off

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610

of the counter here it goes you ready
you<00:04:42.260> can<00:04:42.440> hear<00:04:42.680> that<00:04:42.800> little<00:04:43.010> sizzle<00:04:43.340> that

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
you can hear that little sizzle that

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
to watch and you'll see it starts to

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.750 
to watch and you'll see it starts to
bubble<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.720> little<00:04:47.870> bit<00:04:48.140> and<00:04:48.350> if<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:49.430> bubbles

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
bubble a little bit and if the bubbles

bubble a little bit and if the bubbles
are<00:04:49.880> too<00:04:50.030> much<00:04:50.260> you<00:04:51.260> can<00:04:51.440> just<00:04:51.470> press<00:04:51.770> them

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
are too much you can just press them

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.080 
are too much you can just press them
down<00:04:52.040> with<00:04:52.460> whatever<00:04:52.790> you're<00:04:53.060> using
