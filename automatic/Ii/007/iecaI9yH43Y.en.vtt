00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.310
 ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.720
 drinking water quality is very clear 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.599
 and very easy to measure 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.920
 for 25 to 35 euros you can in 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.160
 internet a 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.410
 TDS meter buy this tds 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.730
 Meter means nothing but total 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.470
 this substance is dissolved on the whole 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.019
 It comes from the English 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.080
 one measures therein the so-called ppm 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.050
 parts per million of water dissolved 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.850
 substances and how not to make it easier 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.070
 Practice you can the device can do it 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.140
 run with lead and then we have to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.690
 now number one filtered water 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:50.000
 and here we see a valuable treasure 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:54.440
 mineralized around 20 also 21 pp 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.399
 then we go to number two a good one 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:05.210
 Tap water has a different value 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:08.400
 we look again over 285 ppm and 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:13.409
 here we have a mineral water one 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.119
 very prestigious brand where you too 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.670
 another value again have the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.770
 Statements are always the same 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.860
 Water is great and we see here 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.930
 a value of 66, however, you can see 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.810
 a little on this gage below 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.420
 Particles flash that is 10 times 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.979
 that means 660 parts I'll open it 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.700
 then I can take a close look 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.180
 so here's the value 66 that means here 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.880
 are 660 share course whether it is 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.100
 the same but with this best 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.000
 can you see here i have 20 parts 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.189
 here at 290 parts and their 660 part 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.689
 so you can see so comfortable 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.369
 how many foreign substances are in a water 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.899
 interestingly, you know that 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.149
 statements of the mineral water producers 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.289
 under water as mineral water is 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.069
 of course great and the same of the 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.649
 Drinking water supplier or the 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.269
 Sales of water filtration systems now 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.150
 Of course, it's interesting to know 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:17.830
 that the legislature until 1980 a 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.140
 legal limit was 140 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:26.660
 family ppm but that this value in 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.450
 Run the past 30 years at 1250 ppm 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.360
 parts per million has been adjusted so 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.590
 he was put up 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.660
 not every organism can handle that 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.390
 That's why there is a very good one again 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.450
 possibility of drinking water quality too 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.819
 test with very simple stripes the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.720
 for 12 euros in aquaristik shop 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.470
 able to buy 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.109
 in this case, the test is, from 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.190
 gabriel as sees s 6 in 1 with it 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:03:00.139
 I test more parameters of the water 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.239
 the hardness I can value the mph 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.620
 determine and I can even one 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.139
 get a rough overview 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.480
 if she is in the water and she is 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.560
 See immediately it takes less than one 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.709
 minute 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.810
 but blatant differences in the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.970
 expression of these stripes 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.690
 So if I now times regardless of 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:26.420
 Dear, see here on the left strip 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:28.950
 above the hardness of water soft 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.220
 I do not have water here 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.819
 very expensive mineral water of this 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.400
 Strip the middle is purple that is 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.319
 extremely hard water and here at 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.330
 tap water more or less 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.099
 same as hard water easy 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.260
 but I put the three stripes now 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.810
 next to each other and then I can 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.239
 clearly see that they relate to the hardness 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.370
 glaring differences exist 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.950
 filtered water is very soft 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.049
 it has different is the ph value 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.920
 and this parameter is again the 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.060
 total chlorine here is nowhere in 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.010
 those who left the top 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.549
 we neglect there, there are still 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.440
 But even a small device for 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.170
 So it's the fresh water, after all 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.109
 fish urgently need this control 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.419
 the human needs the tutorial is there 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.940
 is very good if you have it set 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.800
 even a little look at that 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.440
 There never was a tiresome theme there 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.030
 company merck high quality imitat 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.180
 You can also use test strips very much 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.860
 cheap internet referen as test 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.210
 now simply the share of the salary 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.940
 to the degree in the water 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.919
 we have right filtered water in 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.470
 the middle of it very expensive 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.840
 we have mineral water and left 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.330
 tap water and so on 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.580
 one minute you should see the results 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.970
 are basically to say 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.010
 The mineral waters are usually with 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.130
 very few nitrates burdened them 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.590
 come from deep drilling so 3 400 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.970
 meters are drilled the deep or me 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.620
 have been very nice to me 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.530
 on the run from your own 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.510
 Contamination is the human being in the 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.450
 deep fled but started wells 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.800
 before and does the water come out 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.740
 that's not what else 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.200
 daylight may come the question is whether 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.970
 human genetics for such a high one 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.330
 mineralization is created or 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.070
 Not 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.320
 but now we have the time 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.050
 bridged and are the result here 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.979
 no nitrate there either 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.650
 stepped in the tap water we see now 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:36.720
 but that did and the mietrad is located 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.220
 in a range of over 25 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.949
 milligrams per liter 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.990
 that is the value here to come here 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.310
 very nice to see 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:48.210
 it is a bit different 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.789
 What the water suppliers measure directly 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.069
 or what next to it for diversion arrives 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.479
 but in that case we have about 25 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.490
 milligrams per liter 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.800
 interestingly enough, here too the 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.639
 legal limit in the course of 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.310
 last 30 years from ten milligrams up 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:08.430
 50 mg per liter adjusted 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.800
 which of course means in turn 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.090
 ask if humans are genetically 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.090
 can adapt more quickly
