Tyrannosaurus Rex is a predator and it's

Tyrannosaurus Rex is a predator and it's

I'll give you there's a couple of
reasons<00:01:57.689> why<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.049> believe<00:01:58.350> he's<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> predator

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
reasons why I believe he's a predator

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.969 
reasons why I believe he's a predator
number<00:01:59.729> one<00:01:59.969> his<00:02:00.390> size<00:02:00.719> he's<00:02:01.560> an<00:02:01.710> enormous

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
number one his size he's an enormous

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.670 
number one his size he's an enormous
dinosaur<00:02:02.759> he<00:02:03.270> has<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> high<00:02:03.869> metabolism

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
dinosaur he has a high metabolism

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.980 
dinosaur he has a high metabolism
therefore<00:02:05.130> he<00:02:05.250> burns<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.700> lot<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.850> calories<00:02:06.570> he

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
therefore he burns a lot of calories he

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.160 
therefore he burns a lot of calories he
cannot<00:02:07.530> simply<00:02:08.280> hope<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.450> find<00:02:09.750> that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
cannot simply hope to find that

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.720 
cannot simply hope to find that
something<00:02:10.500> has<00:02:10.800> died<00:02:11.099> within<00:02:11.520> walking

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
something has died within walking

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.490 
something has died within walking
distance

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
distance

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.290 
distance
that's<00:02:13.040> just<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.460> me<00:02:13.580> that's<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.880> rational

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
that's just to me that's a rational

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.570 
that's just to me that's a rational
thinking<00:02:14.660> he's<00:02:15.410> got<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.830> go<00:02:15.980> out<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.280> actively

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
thinking he's got to go out and actively

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.180 
thinking he's got to go out and actively
look<00:02:16.970> for<00:02:17.000> prey<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.530> number-one

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
look for prey and so I number-one

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.680 
look for prey and so I number-one
believed<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.700> makes<00:02:19.940> him<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.150> predator

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
believed that makes him a predator

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.030 
believed that makes him a predator

incredible<00:03:18.950> sense<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.250> smell<00:03:19.310> but<00:03:19.640> that's

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
incredible sense of smell but that's

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.320 
incredible sense of smell but that's
because<00:03:20.269> they<00:03:20.870> usually<00:03:21.410> spend<00:03:21.920> their<00:03:22.190> time<00:03:22.430> 3

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
because they usually spend their time 3

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.420 
because they usually spend their time 3
and<00:03:23.450> 4<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.780> 500<00:03:23.989> feet<00:03:24.500> in<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.860> air<00:03:24.890> searching

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
and 4 and 500 feet in the air searching

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.759 
and 4 and 500 feet in the air searching
for<00:03:25.760> prey<00:03:25.970> they<00:03:26.480> need<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:27.019> sense<00:03:27.260> of<00:03:27.440> smell

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
for prey they need that sense of smell

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.440 
for prey they need that sense of smell
because<00:03:28.280> they're<00:03:28.700> needing<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.180> smell

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
because they're needing to smell

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.560 
because they're needing to smell
something<00:03:29.780> 500<00:03:30.500> feet<00:03:30.680> below<00:03:30.830> them

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
something 500 feet below them

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.520 
something 500 feet below them
Tyrannosaurus<00:03:32.570> Rex<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.050> other<00:03:33.170> hand<00:03:33.410> is

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
Tyrannosaurus Rex on the other hand is

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.199 
Tyrannosaurus Rex on the other hand is
at<00:03:33.709> ground<00:03:33.980> level<00:03:34.459> where<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.760> where<00:03:35.180> the

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
at ground level where the where the

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.270 
at ground level where the where the
smell<00:03:35.570> of<00:03:35.600> rotting<00:03:36.080> carcasses<00:03:36.620> lingers<00:03:37.130> and

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
smell of rotting carcasses lingers and

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.729 
smell of rotting carcasses lingers and
so<00:03:37.850> I<00:03:38.180> think<00:03:38.450> a<00:03:38.660> sense<00:03:38.870> of<00:03:39.019> smell<00:03:39.260> determines

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
so I think a sense of smell determines

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.410 
so I think a sense of smell determines
that<00:03:39.860> but<00:03:40.280> anyway<00:03:40.550> go<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:40.730> my<00:03:40.910> blog<00:03:41.150> and<00:03:41.360> you

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670

feathers but those on the tail are

feathers but those on the tail are
pretty<00:04:18.440> big<00:04:18.590> I've<00:04:18.919> also<00:04:19.160> studied<00:04:19.580> a<00:04:19.790> lot<00:04:19.970> of

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
pretty big I've also studied a lot of

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.880 
pretty big I've also studied a lot of
the<00:04:20.209> small<00:04:20.450> Raptors<00:04:20.900> that<00:04:20.930> have<00:04:21.260> clearly<00:04:21.680> have

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
the small Raptors that have clearly have

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.159 
the small Raptors that have clearly have
feathers<00:04:22.130> I<00:04:22.370> saw<00:04:22.640> one<00:04:22.880> about<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.840> month<00:04:24.050> ago

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
feathers I saw one about a month ago

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.969 
feathers I saw one about a month ago
that<00:04:24.410> was<00:04:24.530> just<00:04:24.710> staggering<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.520> me

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
that was just staggering to me

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.159 
that was just staggering to me
I<00:04:27.009> have<00:04:27.430> every<00:04:27.789> reason<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:28.180> believe<00:04:28.389> that<00:04:28.569> all

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
I have every reason to believe that all

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.650 
I have every reason to believe that all
predatory<00:04:29.770> dinosaurs<00:04:30.370> may<00:04:30.940> have<00:04:31.150> had<00:04:31.330> some

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
predatory dinosaurs may have had some

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.420 
predatory dinosaurs may have had some
kind<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:32.110> feathers<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:32.680> didn't<00:04:33.099> believe<00:04:33.280> this

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
kind of feathers I didn't believe this

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.339 
kind of feathers I didn't believe this
before<00:04:33.849> I'll<00:04:33.970> tell<00:04:34.180> you<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.629> fought

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
before I'll tell you I I fought

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.020 
before I'll tell you I I fought
constantly<00:04:35.710> with<00:04:36.220> people<00:04:36.520> who<00:04:36.610> would<00:04:36.729> claim

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
constantly with people who would claim

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.300 
constantly with people who would claim
that<00:04:37.090> Tyrannosaurus<00:04:37.780> look<00:04:38.379> like<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.560> bird

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
that Tyrannosaurus look like a bird

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.219 
that Tyrannosaurus look like a bird
I'd<00:04:39.699> screamed<00:04:40.389> at<00:04:40.509> the<00:04:40.599> time<00:04:40.750> my<00:04:40.870> lungs<00:04:41.050> that's

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
I'd screamed at the time my lungs that's

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.320 
I'd screamed at the time my lungs that's
completely<00:04:41.560> insane<00:04:42.009> but<00:04:42.819> all<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.210> new

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
completely insane but all the new

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.909 
completely insane but all the new
discoveries<00:04:43.840> have<00:04:43.990> changed<00:04:44.289> my<00:04:44.379> opinion<00:04:44.620> yeah

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
discoveries have changed my opinion yeah

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.619 
discoveries have changed my opinion yeah
I<00:04:44.949> think<00:04:45.099> they<00:04:45.310> had<00:04:45.460> feathers<00:04:45.669> now<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.240> don't

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
I think they had feathers now I don't

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.089 
I think they had feathers now I don't
think<00:04:47.050> they<00:04:47.169> were<00:04:47.229> completely<00:04:47.650> feathered

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
think they were completely feathered

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.430 
think they were completely feathered
like<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.340> like<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:48.970> bird<00:04:49.419> I<00:04:49.750> don't<00:04:50.050> think<00:04:50.199> every

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
like a like a bird I don't think every

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.960 
like a like a bird I don't think every
ounce<00:04:50.740> of<00:04:50.889> their<00:04:51.039> skin<00:04:51.220> was<00:04:51.400> covered<00:04:51.520> not<00:04:51.819> at

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
ounce of their skin was covered not at

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.999 
ounce of their skin was covered not at
all<00:04:52.120> because<00:04:52.569> I<00:04:52.750> think<00:04:52.990> that<00:04:53.289> would<00:04:53.500> hurt<00:04:53.710> them

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
all because I think that would hurt them

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.740 
all because I think that would hurt them
when<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.310> comes<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.699> body<00:04:55.150> temperature

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
when it comes to body temperature

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.749 
when it comes to body temperature
regulation<00:04:56.169> but<00:04:56.919> I<00:04:56.979> do<00:04:57.099> think<00:04:57.430> that<00:04:57.580> they<00:04:57.699> were

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
regulation but I do think that they were

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.279 
regulation but I do think that they were
ornamented<00:04:58.389> with<00:04:58.419> feathers<00:04:58.840> I<00:04:58.930> think<00:04:59.169> they

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
ornamented with feathers I think they

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:00.420 
ornamented with feathers I think they
may<00:04:59.409> have<00:04:59.440> had<00:04:59.590> feathers<00:04:59.830> on<00:05:00.069> their<00:05:00.220> head

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
may have had feathers on their head

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.550 
may have had feathers on their head
around<00:05:01.210> their<00:05:01.389> face<00:05:01.630> maybe<00:05:02.259> on<00:05:02.440> their

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
around their face maybe on their

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.899 
around their face maybe on their
shoulders<00:05:02.979> maybe<00:05:03.159> at<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.490> base<00:05:03.610> of<00:05:03.639> their

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
shoulders maybe at the base of their

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.700 
shoulders maybe at the base of their
tail<00:05:03.970> that<00:05:04.870> would<00:05:05.020> have<00:05:05.110> been<00:05:05.229> used<00:05:05.500> to

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
tail that would have been used to

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.399 
tail that would have been used to
display<00:05:06.370> during<00:05:06.819> courtship<00:05:07.419> and<00:05:07.659> so<00:05:08.080> I<00:05:08.110> think

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
display during courtship and so I think

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:09.809 
display during courtship and so I think
all<00:05:08.560> of<00:05:08.590> these<00:05:08.770> smaller<00:05:09.099> Tyrannosaurus<00:05:09.729> and

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
all of these smaller Tyrannosaurus and

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.059 
all of these smaller Tyrannosaurus and
even<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.300> bigger<00:05:10.509> ones<00:05:10.780> like<00:05:10.960> Rex<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:11.710> Betar

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 
even the bigger ones like Rex and Betar

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:13.830 
even the bigger ones like Rex and Betar
I<00:05:12.370> think<00:05:13.000> they<00:05:13.120> would<00:05:13.270> have<00:05:13.360> been<00:05:13.479> feathered

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
I think they would have been feathered

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.909 
I think they would have been feathered

just<00:05:35.440> such<00:05:35.949> a<00:05:35.979> much<00:05:36.430> more<00:05:36.699> powerfully<00:05:37.330> built

tyrannosaurus by the throat that could

tyrannosaurus by the throat that could

Rex and Spinosaurus does have that

Rex and Spinosaurus does have that

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
elongated snout which gave him a little

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
pinpoint his target a little better

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.570 
pinpoint his target a little better
think<00:06:02.169> of<00:06:02.289> Tyrannosaurus<00:06:02.770> rexes<00:06:03.250> head<00:06:03.430> as<00:06:03.550> a

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
think of Tyrannosaurus rexes head as a

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.809 
think of Tyrannosaurus rexes head as a
fist<00:06:03.880> and<00:06:04.120> think<00:06:04.330> of<00:06:04.539> Spinosaurus

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819 
fist and think of Spinosaurus

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.629 
fist and think of Spinosaurus
skull<00:06:07.509> as<00:06:07.750> a<00:06:07.810> finger<00:06:08.469> well<00:06:08.919> you<00:06:09.190> can<00:06:09.400> swing

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
skull as a finger well you can swing

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.100 
skull as a finger well you can swing
your<00:06:09.759> fists<00:06:10.210> but<00:06:10.419> you<00:06:10.539> may<00:06:10.690> not<00:06:10.870> be<00:06:11.020> as

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
your fists but you may not be as

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.899 
your fists but you may not be as
accurate<00:06:11.139> but<00:06:11.650> you<00:06:11.680> can<00:06:11.949> point<00:06:12.250> your<00:06:12.580> finger

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
accurate but you can point your finger

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.850 
accurate but you can point your finger
much<00:06:13.090> more<00:06:13.300> accurately<00:06:13.750> so<00:06:14.229> Spinosaurus

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
much more accurately so Spinosaurus

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.649 
much more accurately so Spinosaurus
would<00:06:15.009> have<00:06:15.099> been<00:06:15.190> able<00:06:15.250> to<00:06:15.449> point<00:06:16.449> that

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
would have been able to point that

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.209 
would have been able to point that
finger<00:06:17.080> right<00:06:17.259> at<00:06:17.289> the<00:06:17.500> throat<00:06:17.740> and<00:06:17.889> grab<00:06:18.039> him

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:18.219 
finger right at the throat and grab him

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:20.129 
finger right at the throat and grab him
so<00:06:18.580> yes<00:06:18.849> I<00:06:19.029> do<00:06:19.090> think<00:06:19.449> it's<00:06:19.569> perfectly

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
so yes I do think it's perfectly

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.140 
so yes I do think it's perfectly
legitimate<00:06:20.560> to<00:06:20.889> think<00:06:21.099> that<00:06:21.460> Spinosaurus

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
legitimate to think that Spinosaurus

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.120 
legitimate to think that Spinosaurus
could<00:06:22.360> have<00:06:22.680> could<00:06:23.680> have<00:06:23.770> killed<00:06:23.949> a

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
could have could have killed a

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.950 
could have could have killed a
Tyrannosaurus<00:06:24.729> Rex<00:06:24.789> it<00:06:25.479> would<00:06:25.599> be<00:06:25.719> tough

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
Tyrannosaurus Rex it would be tough

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.129 
Tyrannosaurus Rex it would be tough
