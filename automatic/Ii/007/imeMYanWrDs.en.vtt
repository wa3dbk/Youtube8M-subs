00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.149 

okay<00:00:00.539> this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.810> what<00:00:00.930> most<00:00:01.199> people<00:00:01.380> do<00:00:01.860> when

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
okay this is what most people do when

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.210 
okay this is what most people do when
they<00:00:02.429> are<00:00:02.460> pruning<00:00:03.210> it<00:00:03.449> an<00:00:03.840> upright<00:00:04.470> branch

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
they are pruning it an upright branch

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.540 
they are pruning it an upright branch
back<00:00:05.730> they'll<00:00:06.450> go<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.259> outside<00:00:07.830> bud<00:00:08.250> and

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
back they'll go to the outside bud and

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.419 
back they'll go to the outside bud and
prune<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.420> outside<00:00:09.960> bud<00:00:10.200> because<00:00:10.620> just<00:00:11.219> above

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
prune the outside bud because just above

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.430 
prune the outside bud because just above
the<00:00:11.610> outside<00:00:11.940> but<00:00:12.150> rather<00:00:12.420> because<00:00:13.259> that's

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
the outside but rather because that's

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.470 
the outside but rather because that's
what<00:00:13.679> seems<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.250> make<00:00:14.490> sense<00:00:14.519> but<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.330> is

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
what seems to make sense but this is

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.930 
what seems to make sense but this is
what<00:00:15.630> happens<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.590> get<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:17.039> outside<00:00:17.279> bud<00:00:17.789> to

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
what happens you get that outside bud to

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.630 
what happens you get that outside bud to
break<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.480> goes<00:00:18.660> up<00:00:19.260> very<00:00:19.590> vertically<00:00:20.460> and

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
break and it goes up very vertically and

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.019 
break and it goes up very vertically and
very<00:00:20.910> strongly<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.840> even<00:00:22.560> these<00:00:22.710> lower<00:00:23.250> buds

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
very strongly and even these lower buds

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.029 
very strongly and even these lower buds
will<00:00:24.269> break<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> they<00:00:25.019> will<00:00:25.170> also<00:00:25.410> be<00:00:25.769> very

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
will break and they will also be very

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.339 
will break and they will also be very
strong<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.240> instead<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.689> cutting<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
strong and so instead of cutting to the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.630 
strong and so instead of cutting to the
outside<00:00:29.160> bud<00:00:29.429> we<00:00:30.150> should<00:00:30.810> be<00:00:30.990> pruning<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
outside bud we should be pruning to the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.299 
outside bud we should be pruning to the
upright<00:00:33.270> bud<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.870> then<00:00:34.440> coming<00:00:34.860> back<00:00:34.890> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
upright bud and then coming back and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.700 
upright bud and then coming back and
taking<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.059> off<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.899> lower<00:00:37.110> bud<00:00:37.410> comes

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
taking that off as the lower bud comes

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.900 
taking that off as the lower bud comes
out<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:39.300> weaker<00:00:39.899> growth<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.530> that's<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
out as a weaker growth and that's the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.060 
out as a weaker growth and that's the
that's<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.629> branch<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.410> will<00:00:43.590> keep

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
that's the branch that you we will keep

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.549 
that's the branch that you we will keep
okay<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.420> an<00:00:45.539> example<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.170> what<00:00:46.410> we

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
okay this is an example of what we

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.350 
okay this is an example of what we
should<00:00:46.590> do<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.370> far<00:00:47.640> as<00:00:47.670> pruning<00:00:48.090> these

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
should do as far as pruning these

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.220 
should do as far as pruning these
vigorous<00:00:49.079> branches<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:49.920> want<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.670> want<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
vigorous branches we want to we want to

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.619 
vigorous branches we want to we want to
select<00:00:52.230> an<00:00:52.500> upright<00:00:53.039> bud<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.420> right

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
select an upright bud as we see right

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.660 
select an upright bud as we see right
here<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.050> prune<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.590> immediately<00:00:56.190> above<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
here and prune just immediately above it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.040 
here and prune just immediately above it
now<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.270> kind<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.600> counterintuitive

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
now this is kind of counterintuitive

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.110 
now this is kind of counterintuitive
because<00:00:58.680> typically<00:00:59.460> we'll<00:00:59.699> think<00:00:59.910> well<00:01:00.090> let's

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
because typically we'll think well let's

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.990 
because typically we'll think well let's
prune<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.289> outside<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.850> let's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
prune to that that outside but but let's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.640 
prune to that that outside but but let's
not<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.510> let's<00:01:03.719> prune<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> upright

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
not do that let's prune to the upright

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.640 
not do that let's prune to the upright
bud<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.640> did<00:01:05.820> here<00:01:05.850> what<00:01:06.659> happens<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
bud as we did here what happens then is

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.310 
bud as we did here what happens then is
that<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.310> upright<00:01:08.880> bud<00:01:09.150> will<00:01:09.390> break<00:01:09.780> very

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
that that upright bud will break very

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.620 
that that upright bud will break very
vertically<00:01:11.310> very<00:01:11.670> strongly<00:01:12.119> it'll<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:12.600> up

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
vertically very strongly it'll go up

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260 
vertically very strongly it'll go up
like<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.790> temporary

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
like you see here this is a temporary

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.780 
like you see here this is a temporary
branch<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.020> will<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.290> eliminated<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
branch it will be eliminated the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.660 
branch it will be eliminated the
important<00:01:18.299> thing<00:01:18.509> though<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.990> these

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
important thing though is that these

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.609 
important thing though is that these
lateral<00:01:20.670> branches<00:01:21.180> lateral<00:01:21.750> buds<00:01:21.960> down<00:01:22.259> below

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
lateral branches lateral buds down below

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.920 
lateral branches lateral buds down below
will<00:01:22.920> break<00:01:23.159> they'll<00:01:23.460> break<00:01:23.750> horizontally<00:01:24.750> as

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
will break they'll break horizontally as

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.929 
will break they'll break horizontally as
you<00:01:25.229> see<00:01:25.470> here<00:01:25.740> we've<00:01:25.860> got<00:01:25.890> three<00:01:26.430> branches

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
you see here we've got three branches

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.780 
you see here we've got three branches
that<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.450> keep<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.380> want<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.790> this

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
that we can keep if we want to this

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.460 
that we can keep if we want to this
branch<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.360> said<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.689> temporary<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.259> we'll

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
branch I said it's temporary so we'll

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.330 
branch I said it's temporary so we'll
come<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:33.000> we'll<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.689> simply

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
come in here and now we'll just simply

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.429 
come in here and now we'll just simply
remove<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.520> just<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.689> now<00:01:37.259> we've

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
remove it just like that and now we've

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.920 
remove it just like that and now we've
got<00:01:37.650> nice<00:01:37.950> flat<00:01:38.280> angles<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.210> these<00:01:39.509> three

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
got nice flat angles on these three

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.490 
got nice flat angles on these three
branches<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.159> left<00:01:41.869> this<00:01:42.869> type<00:01:43.320> of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
branches that are left this type of

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.139 
branches that are left this type of
pruning<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:44.040> called<00:01:44.310> double<00:01:44.549> sectoral

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
pruning is called double sectoral

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.880 
pruning is called double sectoral
pruning<00:01:45.720> because<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.170> basically<00:01:46.770> a

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
pruning because it's basically a

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.160 
pruning because it's basically a
two-step<00:01:47.159> process<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.540> make<00:01:48.780> your<00:01:48.990> initial

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
two-step process you make your initial

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.850 
two-step process you make your initial
cut<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.490> upright<00:01:51.299> bud<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.500> branch

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
cut to that upright bud that branch

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.069 
cut to that upright bud that branch
grows<00:01:53.220> up<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.640> come<00:01:53.970> back<00:01:54.149> later<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.990> you

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
grows up you come back later on and you

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.530
