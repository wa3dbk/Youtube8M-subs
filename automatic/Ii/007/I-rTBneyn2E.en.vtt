similar to the other camera apps on the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.500 
similar to the other camera apps on the
Micromax<00:00:49.079> devices<00:00:49.590> powered<00:00:49.980> by<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.510> mediatek

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
Micromax devices powered by the mediatek

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.470 
Micromax devices powered by the mediatek
processor<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.320> exactly<00:00:52.800> same<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.850> code

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
processor this is exactly same the code

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.720 
processor this is exactly same the code
core<00:00:54.750> mediatek<00:00:55.260> processor<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:56.219> powering<00:00:56.520> this

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
core mediatek processor is powering this

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.639 
core mediatek processor is powering this
device<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.020> interface<00:00:58.379> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
device and you can see the interface is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.770 
device and you can see the interface is
exactly<00:00:59.039> similar<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.850> we<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.420> normal

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
exactly similar so we have the normal

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.680 
exactly similar so we have the normal
option<00:01:01.739> set<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.010> options<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.510> have

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
option set of options here so we have

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.350 
option set of options here so we have
the<00:01:03.840> normal<00:01:04.019> shot<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.920> have<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.180> live

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the normal shot then you have the live

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.380 
the normal shot then you have the live
photo<00:01:06.780> mode<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.229> beauty<00:01:07.530> face<00:01:07.790> then<00:01:08.790> erased

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
photo mode the beauty face then erased

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.800 
photo mode the beauty face then erased
panorama<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.580> finally<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.450> multi

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
panorama and finally you have the multi

panorama and finally you have the multi
angled<00:01:13.200> view<00:01:13.229> mode<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.010> these<00:01:14.189> are<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
angled view mode so these are the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.640 
angled view mode so these are the
options<00:01:14.460> available<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.479> there<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.869> no<00:01:16.080> HDR

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
options available so there is no HDR

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.630 
options available so there is no HDR
option<00:01:17.090> instead<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> does<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.490> pen

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
with the light photo mode so these are

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.130 
with the light photo mode so these are
the<00:01:26.340> modes<00:01:26.549> available<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.840> choose

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
see the GPS information then you have

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.309

we find in almost any camera so the
nothing's<00:02:31.480> changes<00:02:31.930> them<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.769> then<00:02:32.890> going<00:02:33.129> to

shutter delay voice capture is there

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.390 
shutter delay voice capture is there
then<00:02:37.690> there<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:37.989> face<00:02:38.260> detection<00:02:38.440> smile<00:02:39.099> shot

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
then there is face detection smile shot

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.850 
then there is face detection smile shot

select from five megapixel goes down to
qvg<00:02:58.840> which<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.799> not<00:03:00.400> really<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.819> useful<00:03:01.360> feature

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
qvg which is not really a useful feature

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.990 
qvg which is not really a useful feature
then<00:03:02.440> again<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:02.860> can<00:03:02.950> select<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.459> ISO<00:03:03.849> so

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
these are the options available so it's

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.789 
these are the options available so it's
a<00:03:06.430> fairly<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:07.000> feature-rich<00:03:07.569> app<00:03:07.989> then<00:03:08.680> you

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
a fairly the feature-rich app then you

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.210 
a fairly the feature-rich app then you
have<00:03:09.010> image<00:03:09.910> stabilization<00:03:10.299> in<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.900> video

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
have image stabilization in the video

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.550 
have image stabilization in the video
microphone<00:03:12.220> audio<00:03:12.640> mode<00:03:12.879> and<00:03:13.150> then<00:03:13.599> you<00:03:14.049> have

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
microphone audio mode and then you have

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.830 
microphone audio mode and then you have
the<00:03:14.680> time-lapse<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:16.120> video<00:03:16.360> quality<00:03:16.540> so

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
the time-lapse and the video quality so

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.140 
the time-lapse and the video quality so
we<00:03:16.959> do<00:03:17.079> quality's<00:03:17.500> fine<00:03:17.769> high<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.340> medium<00:03:18.459> so

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
we do quality's fine high and medium so

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.240 
we do quality's fine high and medium so
it<00:03:19.359> can<00:03:19.600> record<00:03:19.870> videos<00:03:20.200> in<00:03:20.380> 1080p<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:21.069> that's

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
it can record videos in 1080p so that's

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.420 
it can record videos in 1080p so that's
a<00:03:21.430> good<00:03:22.120> feature<00:03:22.359> many<00:03:23.109> of<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.470> budget

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
a good feature many of the budget

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
Lumia fight unit does not support 1080p

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.080 
Lumia fight unit does not support 1080p
so<00:03:28.780> this<00:03:29.139> device<00:03:29.650> does<00:03:29.980> support<00:03:30.340> any<00:03:30.489> DVD

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
so this device does support any DVD

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.210 
so this device does support any DVD
videos<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.930> that<00:03:32.139> is<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.440> camera<00:03:32.769> features

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.740 
videos so that is the camera features
now<00:03:33.400> let's<00:03:33.670> go<00:03:33.849> straight<00:03:34.120> into<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.599> camera

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
now let's go straight into the camera

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.839 
now let's go straight into the camera
shots<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.769> first<00:03:36.010> step<00:03:36.160> let's<00:03:36.370> say<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.609> see

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
shots so first step let's say you see

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
see from the photos it is pretty decent

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.430 
see from the photos it is pretty decent
quality<00:03:48.430> photos<00:03:49.030> there<00:03:49.569> is<00:03:49.720> good<00:03:49.930> amount<00:03:49.959> of

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
quality photos there is good amount of

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.920 
quality photos there is good amount of
colors<00:03:51.069> included<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.569> capture

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
colors included and that the capture

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.839 
colors included and that the capture
detailed<00:03:53.349> capture<00:03:53.769> details<00:03:54.220> are<00:03:54.580> a<00:03:54.610> pretty

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
detailed capture details are a pretty

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.790 
detailed capture details are a pretty
average<00:03:55.090> although<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.959> 5<00:03:56.200> megapixel<00:03:56.769> camera

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
average although the 5 megapixel camera

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.460 
average although the 5 megapixel camera
isn't<00:03:57.430> able<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:57.670> capture<00:03:57.940> too<00:03:58.239> much<00:03:58.480> details

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
isn't able to capture too much details

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.130 
isn't able to capture too much details
it's<00:03:59.769> pretty<00:04:00.099> average<00:04:00.489> quality<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.870> can

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
it's pretty average quality and I can

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.559 
it's pretty average quality and I can
see<00:04:02.349> that<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:03.489> colors<00:04:03.790> have<00:04:03.940> come<00:04:04.180> really

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
see that the colors have come really

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.869 
see that the colors have come really
well<00:04:04.720> it's<00:04:05.260> almost<00:04:05.500> more<00:04:06.099> or<00:04:06.220> less<00:04:06.400> like<00:04:06.640> the

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
well it's almost more or less like the

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.619 
well it's almost more or less like the
natural<00:04:07.060> colors<00:04:07.599> in<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.530> photos<00:04:08.860> and<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:10.450> can

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
natural colors in the photos and you can

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.479 
natural colors in the photos and you can
see<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.110> sharpness<00:04:11.410> levels<00:04:11.890> are<00:04:12.040> also<00:04:12.190> not

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
see the sharpness levels are also not

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.860 
see the sharpness levels are also not
that<00:04:12.519> impressed<00:04:13.060> so<00:04:13.299> if<00:04:13.360> we<00:04:13.450> zoom<00:04:13.480> in<00:04:13.780> the

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
that impressed so if we zoom in the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.170 
that impressed so if we zoom in the
photos<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.260> can<00:04:14.410> see<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.709> goes<00:04:14.950> blurry<00:04:15.250> but

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
photos you can see it goes blurry but

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.330 
photos you can see it goes blurry but
then<00:04:16.419> it<00:04:16.840> is<00:04:17.019> a<00:04:17.049> 5<00:04:17.350> megapixel<00:04:17.650> shooter<00:04:17.979> so<00:04:18.280> you

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
then it is a 5 megapixel shooter so you

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.580 
then it is a 5 megapixel shooter so you
can't<00:04:18.639> expect<00:04:19.030> two<00:04:19.180> really<00:04:19.479> great<00:04:19.630> photos<00:04:19.989> but

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
can't expect two really great photos but

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.440 
can't expect two really great photos but
on<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.950> whole<00:04:21.100> lab<00:04:21.340> you<00:04:21.609> would<00:04:21.970> say<00:04:22.150> this<00:04:22.330> is

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
on the whole lab you would say this is

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.030 
on the whole lab you would say this is
pretty<00:04:22.630> decent<00:04:22.810> capture<00:04:23.470> and<00:04:23.650> it's

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
pretty decent capture and it's

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.860 
pretty decent capture and it's
definitely<00:04:24.490> better<00:04:24.790> than<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.090> Moto<00:04:25.419> e<00:04:25.540> and<00:04:25.780> a

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
definitely better than the Moto e and a

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.350 
definitely better than the Moto e and a
few<00:04:26.710> other<00:04:26.860> devices<00:04:27.220> in<00:04:27.760> this<00:04:28.090> price<00:04:28.330> point

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
few other devices in this price point

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.290 
few other devices in this price point
but<00:04:29.080> it<00:04:29.200> may<00:04:29.320> not<00:04:29.440> be<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.220> redmi<00:04:30.669> 1s<00:04:30.700> or<00:04:31.210> the

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
but it may not be to the redmi 1s or the

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.600 
but it may not be to the redmi 1s or the
Huawei<00:04:31.600> honor<00:04:31.810> only<00:04:32.139> or<00:04:32.470> even<00:04:33.039> the<00:04:33.490> other

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
Huawei honor only or even the other

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.260 
Huawei honor only or even the other
devices<00:04:33.970> like<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.570> Asus<00:04:34.960> zenfone<00:04:35.550> 5<00:04:36.550> which<00:04:37.240> is

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
devices like the Asus zenfone 5 which is

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.779 
devices like the Asus zenfone 5 which is
all<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.780> price<00:04:37.990> higher<00:04:38.350> but<00:04:38.650> then<00:04:39.310> this<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:39.760> a

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
all the price higher but then this is a

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.340 
all the price higher but then this is a
pretty<00:04:40.090> decent<00:04:40.510> camera<00:04:40.690> in<00:04:40.960> this<00:04:41.110> price<00:04:41.320> point

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
pretty decent camera in this price point

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.310 
pretty decent camera in this price point
now<00:04:42.070> let's<00:04:42.370> go<00:04:42.580> straight<00:04:42.880> into<00:04:43.180> some<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.169> that

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
now let's go straight into some of that

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.129 
now let's go straight into some of that
low<00:04:44.860> light<00:04:45.070> captures<00:04:45.639> so<00:04:46.210> as<00:04:46.539> you<00:04:46.660> can<00:04:46.780> see<00:04:47.020> in

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
low light captures so as you can see in

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.529 
low light captures so as you can see in
the<00:04:47.229> low-light<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.860> mode<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.280> photos<00:04:49.000> look

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
the low-light the mode the photos look

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.409 
the low-light the mode the photos look
totally<00:04:50.020> different<00:04:50.229> here<00:04:50.919> so<00:04:51.090> you<00:04:52.090> can<00:04:52.240> see

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
totally different here so you can see

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.110 
totally different here so you can see
there<00:04:52.630> is<00:04:52.750> lot<00:04:53.020> of<00:04:53.340> Eldo<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.400> steamed<00:04:54.760> added

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
there is lot of Eldo you steamed added

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.029 
there is lot of Eldo you steamed added
to<00:04:55.270> this<00:04:55.419> photos<00:04:55.870> so<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.440> slow<00:04:56.620> light<00:04:56.800> photo

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
to this photos so the slow light photo

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.100 
to this photos so the slow light photo
quality<00:04:57.430> is<00:04:57.490> not<00:04:57.760> that<00:04:58.060> really<00:04:58.599> impressive

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
quality is not that really impressive

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.500 
quality is not that really impressive
and<00:04:59.500> you<00:04:59.620> can<00:04:59.770> see<00:04:59.950> these<00:05:00.130> images<00:05:00.310> have<00:05:00.880> lot<00:05:01.389> of

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
and you can see these images have lot of

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.120 
and you can see these images have lot of
fellow<00:05:01.930> shooting<00:05:02.289> data<00:05:02.500> to<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.039> the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
fellow shooting data to it and the

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.440 
fellow shooting data to it and the
clarity<00:05:03.520> is<00:05:03.669> not<00:05:03.700> that<00:05:04.090> good

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
clarity is not that good

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.089 
clarity is not that good
but<00:05:04.630> if<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:04.810> use<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:05.110> flash<00:05:05.410> you<00:05:05.620> can<00:05:05.650> see<00:05:05.919> the

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
but if you use the flash you can see the

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.460 
but if you use the flash you can see the
capture<00:05:06.550> is<00:05:06.700> again<00:05:06.910> pretty<00:05:07.060> Wenli<00:05:07.720> and<00:05:07.930> are

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
capture is again pretty Wenli and are

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.589 
capture is again pretty Wenli and are
decent<00:05:09.010> looking<00:05:09.310> photos<00:05:09.700> so<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.450> was<00:05:10.570> a

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
decent looking photos so that was a

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.080 
decent looking photos so that was a
low-light<00:05:10.990> capture<00:05:11.470> so<00:05:12.250> all<00:05:12.550> in<00:05:12.700> all<00:05:12.789> we<00:05:12.970> would

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
low-light capture so all in all we would

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.240 
low-light capture so all in all we would
say<00:05:13.270> this<00:05:13.419> is<00:05:13.570> not<00:05:13.599> a<00:05:13.750> bad<00:05:13.960> camera<00:05:14.229> it's<00:05:14.950> just<00:05:15.220> a

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
say this is not a bad camera it's just a

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.430 
say this is not a bad camera it's just a
5<00:05:15.490> megapixel<00:05:15.789> camera<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:16.539> with<00:05:17.139> the<00:05:17.260> 5

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
5 megapixel camera and with the 5

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.440 
5 megapixel camera and with the 5
megapixel<00:05:18.039> camera<00:05:18.099> it<00:05:18.520> does<00:05:18.729> pretty<00:05:19.000> decent

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
megapixel camera it does pretty decent

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.659 
megapixel camera it does pretty decent
our<00:05:19.599> work<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:20.050> it's<00:05:20.650> far<00:05:20.979> better<00:05:21.190> than<00:05:21.460> the

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
our work and it's far better than the

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.790 
our work and it's far better than the
Moto<00:05:21.970> e<00:05:22.000> with<00:05:22.570> in<00:05:22.720> autofocus<00:05:23.229> camera<00:05:23.410> I<00:05:23.680> mean

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
Moto e with in autofocus camera I mean

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.350 
Moto e with in autofocus camera I mean
the<00:05:23.919> fixed<00:05:24.130> focus<00:05:24.520> camera<00:05:24.580> and<00:05:25.030> without<00:05:25.300> a

the fixed focus camera and without a

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.050 
is better and now let's go to the video
quality<00:05:31.690> so<00:05:32.110> here's<00:05:32.410> a<00:05:32.500> video<00:05:32.710> sample<00:05:33.220> so<00:05:33.970> as

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
quality so here's a video sample so as

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.520 
quality so here's a video sample so as
you<00:05:34.180> can<00:05:34.270> see<00:05:34.479> the<00:05:34.539> video<00:05:34.810> sample<00:05:35.169> is<00:05:35.260> also

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
you can see the video sample is also

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.620 
you can see the video sample is also
pretty<00:05:35.740> decent<00:05:36.220> again<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:37.240> 5<00:05:37.450> megapixel

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
pretty decent again the 5 megapixel

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.870 
pretty decent again the 5 megapixel
shoot<00:05:38.289> that<00:05:38.440> cannot<00:05:38.740> capture<00:05:39.190> really<00:05:39.520> great

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
shoot that cannot capture really great

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.089 
shoot that cannot capture really great
in-depth<00:05:40.539> quality<00:05:40.960> but<00:05:41.169> then<00:05:41.289> it's<00:05:41.500> again<00:05:41.830> a

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
in-depth quality but then it's again a

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.909 
in-depth quality but then it's again a
1080p<00:05:42.729> sample<00:05:43.240> looks<00:05:43.479> pretty<00:05:44.229> decent<00:05:44.410> if<00:05:44.770> the

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
1080p sample looks pretty decent if the

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.129 
1080p sample looks pretty decent if the
colors<00:05:45.190> are<00:05:45.400> come<00:05:45.610> really<00:05:45.970> good<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.330> the

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:47.139 
colors are come really good and the

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.709 
colors are come really good and the
overall<00:05:47.440> quality<00:05:47.710> is<00:05:47.979> just<00:05:48.520> average<00:05:48.729> but

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
overall quality is just average but

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.650 
overall quality is just average but
still<00:05:50.020> it's<00:05:50.169> again<00:05:50.469> better<00:05:50.740> than

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
still it's again better than

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.070 
still it's again better than
which<00:05:52.080> can<00:05:52.470> record<00:05:52.770> only<00:05:52.980> in<00:05:53.310> a<00:05:53.430> 480p<00:05:53.940> so<00:05:54.870> there

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
which can record only in a 480p so there

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.380 
which can record only in a 480p so there
is<00:05:55.260> definitely<00:05:55.500> 1080p<00:05:56.460> recording<00:05:56.520> available

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
is definitely 1080p recording available

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.350 
is definitely 1080p recording available
so<00:05:58.260> that<00:05:58.290> was<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.650> camera<00:05:59.100> a<00:05:59.370> review<00:05:59.880> of<00:06:00.090> the

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770
