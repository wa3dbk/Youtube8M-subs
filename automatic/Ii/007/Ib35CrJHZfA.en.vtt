00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.030
 trophy called barbecue in which 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.580
 we will have to insert the zombies in 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.830
 you really call the description of 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.450

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.970
 we need to have button you know that 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.440
 We can build all this with 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.960
 elements that we can find in the 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.539
 city ​​and we will be here very close to 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.190
 where we made the same trophy of all 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.070
 dance then what we have to 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.960
 search are places where there are some 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.089
 leaks where we can insert the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.850
 enemies and here in this location that 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:45.499
 I am showing you where I am, we are going to 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.760

 around the map this is not the only 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.339
 where we can do it we can 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.460
 do anywhere where we see that 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.620
 there like this style of vats that are 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.569
 let's say that on the walls many times 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.309
 with these barricades as you realize 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.649
 are maybe those bids then we go 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.750
 to throw a firecracker there let's wait 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.090
 to let the zombies alert not to mention 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.860
 that are going to pursue the sound of 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.290
 bananas after we launched a good 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.820
 and finally we are going to prepare the zombies 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.430
