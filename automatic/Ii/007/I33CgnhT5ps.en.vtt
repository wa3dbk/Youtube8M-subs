pedal<00:00:34.140> board<00:00:34.320> down<00:00:34.500> building<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.730> I'm<00:00:35.820> hoping

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
pedal board down building so I'm hoping

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.430 
pedal board down building so I'm hoping
that<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:36.930> big<00:00:37.140> enough

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
that this is going to be big enough

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.190 
possibly get to get two smaller ones on
here<00:02:39.200> anyway<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:41.150> still<00:02:41.600> groom<00:02:41.870> here

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
here anyway and and still groom here

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.830 
here anyway and and still groom here
again<00:02:42.530> another<00:02:43.430> small<00:02:43.820> another<00:02:44.450> couple<00:02:44.780> of

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
again another small another couple of

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.300 
again another small another couple of
small<00:02:45.110> ones<00:02:45.260> on<00:02:45.530> if<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.769> didn't<00:02:46.040> have<00:02:46.160> this

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
small ones on if you didn't have this

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.550 
small ones on if you didn't have this
big<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:47.260> TC<00:02:48.260> unit<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:50.120> no<00:02:50.780> i<00:02:51.019> think<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.470> a

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
big and TC unit so no i think it's a

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.830 
big and TC unit so no i think it's a
good<00:02:51.680> port<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.760> had<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.090> mortar<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.570> little

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
good port and I had to mortar a little

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.550 
good port and I had to mortar a little
bit<00:02:54.640> I<00:02:55.640> didn't<00:02:56.420> use<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.810> power<00:02:57.049> supply<00:02:57.530> that

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
bit I didn't use the power supply that

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.680 
bit I didn't use the power supply that
comes<00:02:58.040> with<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.120> gear<00:02:59.329> at<00:02:59.450> all<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:02.510> power

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
comes with the gear at all and the power

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.030 
comes with the gear at all and the power
requirements<00:03:03.500> for<00:03:04.220> all<00:03:04.340> these<00:03:04.489> pedals<00:03:04.970> and

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
requirements for all these pedals and

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.590 
requirements for all these pedals and
meant<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.400> had<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.519> use<00:03:07.880> this<00:03:08.120> tea<00:03:08.359> bags

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
meant that I had to use this tea bags

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.740 
meant that I had to use this tea bags
fuel<00:03:08.930> tank<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.700> it's<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.060> little<00:03:11.239> bit<00:03:11.480> bigger

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
fuel tank and it's a little bit bigger

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.569 
fuel tank and it's a little bit bigger
than<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.920> gear<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.160> power<00:03:13.489> supply<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.579> found

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
than the gear a power supply so I found

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.630 
than the gear a power supply so I found
that<00:03:17.410> if<00:03:18.410> I<00:03:18.560> put<00:03:18.769> these<00:03:18.890> little<00:03:19.100> rubber<00:03:19.310> feet

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
that if I put these little rubber feet

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.319 
that if I put these little rubber feet
on<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.850> here<00:03:20.739> then<00:03:21.739> in<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:22.790> gives<00:03:23.030> me<00:03:23.150> enough

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
on the here then in that gives me enough

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.060 
on the here then in that gives me enough
clearance<00:03:23.720> off<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.170> ground<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.560> get<00:03:24.680> that's<00:03:24.950> a

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
clearance off the ground to get that's a

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.810 
clearance off the ground to get that's a
t-rex<00:03:25.519> fuel<00:03:25.850> tank<00:03:26.090> in<00:03:26.329> there<00:03:26.570> and<00:03:27.070> then<00:03:28.070> I<00:03:28.370> had

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
t-rex fuel tank in there and then I had

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.890 
t-rex fuel tank in there and then I had
to<00:03:28.940> draw<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.150> couple<00:03:29.390> of<00:03:29.570> holes<00:03:31.540> just<00:03:32.540> on<00:03:32.690> here

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
to draw a couple of holes just on here

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.500 
to draw a couple of holes just on here
in<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.170> board<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.739> just<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:34.880> get<00:03:35.030> my<00:03:35.180> cable

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
in the board and just to get my cable

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.400 
in the board and just to get my cable
ties<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:36.019> just<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.380> hold<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.709> on<00:03:37.180> but<00:03:38.410> didn't

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
ties to just to hold that on but didn't

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.530 
ties to just to hold that on but didn't
take<00:03:39.530> very<00:03:39.590> long<00:03:39.799> and<00:03:40.160> then<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:40.940> board<00:03:41.150> set<00:03:41.420> up

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
take very long and then the board set up

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.440 
take very long and then the board set up
just<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.840> way<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.019> wanted<00:03:42.380> I<00:03:42.560> so<00:03:43.239> I'm<00:03:44.239> quite

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
just the way I wanted I so I'm quite

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.670 
just the way I wanted I so I'm quite
happy<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.959> save<00:03:45.440> a<00:03:45.650> poster<00:03:46.069> to<00:03:46.129> allow

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
happy I save a poster to allow

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:58.660 
happy I save a poster to allow
this<00:03:48.680> is<00:03:48.830> the<00:03:48.920> case<00:03:49.100> nice<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.950> go<00:03:58.100> where<00:03:58.550> they

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
this is the case nice and go where they
