fitness<00:00:44.010> level<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> was<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:44.850> when<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.270> was

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
fitness level that I was at when I was

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.600 
fitness level that I was at when I was
in<00:00:45.570> school<00:00:45.840> but<00:00:46.590> when<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.010> work<00:00:47.820> out<00:00:48.030> now<00:00:48.780> I

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
in school but when I do work out now I

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.500 
in school but when I do work out now I
basically<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.969> 20<00:00:51.930> minutes<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:53.210> cardio<00:00:54.210> so

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
basically do 20 minutes of cardio so

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.310 
basically do 20 minutes of cardio so
like<00:00:54.690> running<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> treadmill<00:00:55.520> or<00:00:56.520> running

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
like running on a treadmill or running

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.599 
like running on a treadmill or running
down<00:00:58.320> by<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.879> river<00:00:59.879> there<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.460> if<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
down by the river there and if the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.690 
down by the river there and if the
weather<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.879> nice<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.539> then<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:04.049> will<00:01:04.890> usually

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
weather is nice and then I will usually

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.800 
weather is nice and then I will usually
do<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> mixture<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.250> like<00:01:08.479> cardio<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
do a mixture of like cardio and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.380 
do a mixture of like cardio and
strength-training<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.610> think<00:01:12.060> that's

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
strength-training so I think that's

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.130 
strength-training so I think that's
still<00:01:12.540> interval<00:01:13.170> training<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.830> think<00:01:14.810> I'm<00:01:15.810> not

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
still interval training I think I'm not

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.380 
still interval training I think I'm not
really<00:01:16.350> sure<00:01:16.610> because<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.759> think<00:01:17.820> interval

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
really sure because I think interval

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.700 
really sure because I think interval
training<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.810> where<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.500> take

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
training is where you like to take

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.850 
training is where you like to take
breaks<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.220> stuff<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.439> we're<00:01:22.439> alternate

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
breaks and stuff so we're alternate

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.980 
breaks and stuff so we're alternate
between<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.310> fast<00:01:23.670> cardio<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:24.600> some

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
between like fast cardio and then some

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.880 
between like fast cardio and then some
other<00:01:25.560> stuff<00:01:26.570> anyway<00:01:27.570> thank<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.500> Q<00:01:28.740> in

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
other stuff anyway thank you so I Q in

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.270 
other stuff anyway thank you so I Q in
40<00:01:29.640> minutes<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.590> that<00:01:31.590> kind<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.950> things<00:01:32.130> I

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
40 minutes of that kind of things I

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.950 
40 minutes of that kind of things I
alternate<00:01:33.049> between<00:01:34.070> upper<00:01:35.070> body<00:01:35.750> muscles<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
alternate between upper body muscles and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.350
