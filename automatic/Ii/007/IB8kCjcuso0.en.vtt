00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
 with a wonderful pass 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.230
 As I said the HSV stormed further increased at times a true 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:07.690
 game noise 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.000
 Breul 4 there is a corner kick from the left side and the corner bumps from 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.180
 register with both sides of the German master 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.839
 Felix Magath 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.839
 from the left side 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:31.820
 there is nothing to hold 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.170
 six to one the replacement 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.900
 that is team captain 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.950
 from the hamburger 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.210
 clear winner decay duel against his opponent Stichler 6 1 and now pop 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.580
 stay the Schalke 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.440
 already sorry 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.660
 without attacking their Villingen attack their defense but too much 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.510
 that's what you can do against a concentrated playing HSV 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.410
 in the even more 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.600
 Spectators the 25 breaks 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.810
 But thank the Schalke that they especially in this second half of the game 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 made rhino search open game offered 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.570
 TÃ¼fekci the Turk 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.570
 Pluta Simon 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.400
 and then again Wolfram Wuttke 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.630
 and the 25,000 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.800
 I can tell you and the skimpy second gate that I can say 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.310
 again Wulff have a goal by Wuttke 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.310
 obviously in Schalke Dress again Philipp Roloff 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.970
 six to two that was also the end result with the HSV good with it 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.670
 Probably the best team the unofficial half-time championship 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.200
 and if we want to move the games on the gas before the Bundesliga 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.250
 unbeaten it was today the number 35 over which the in the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.240
 Final minute still injured captain from the report with his comrades 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.380
 could look back six to two for HSV
