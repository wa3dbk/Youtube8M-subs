nice<00:02:18.040> to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
nice to

Simba<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:21.040> me<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.340> combat<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:21.970> the

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
Simba and to me the combat is the

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.850 
Simba and to me the combat is the
weakest<00:02:22.569> point<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:22.959> game<00:02:22.989> overall<00:02:23.739> this

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
weakest point of the game overall this

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.649 
weakest point of the game overall this
is<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:24.069> great<00:02:24.370> platform<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.970> game<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.360> is

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
is a great platform in game and is

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.119 
is a great platform in game and is
certainly<00:02:25.930> worth<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.140> play<00:02:26.470> however<00:02:26.950> is

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
certainly worth the play however is

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.009 
certainly worth the play however is
probably<00:02:27.400> worth<00:02:27.580> noting<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.390> not<00:02:28.840> the

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
probably worth noting that it's not the

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.630 
probably worth noting that it's not the
easiest<00:02:29.290> game<00:02:29.530> in<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.769> world<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.250> will<00:02:30.370> take<00:02:30.580> a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
easiest game in the world it will take a

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.430 
easiest game in the world it will take a
bit<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.879> practice<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.450> get<00:02:31.599> through<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.019> and<00:02:32.200> I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
bit of practice to get through it and I

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.259 
bit of practice to get through it and I
remember<00:02:32.890> being<00:02:33.069> very<00:02:33.159> critical<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.849> how<00:02:34.030> hard

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
remember being very critical of how hard

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.940 
remember being very critical of how hard
the<00:02:34.569> game<00:02:34.750> was<00:02:35.019> when<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:35.440> was<00:02:35.590> first<00:02:35.799> released

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
the game was when it was first released

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.979 
the game was when it was first released
with<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.819> exception<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.540> last<00:02:37.569> boss

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
with the exception of the last boss

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.020 
with the exception of the last boss
which<00:02:38.290> has<00:02:38.440> got<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.829> be<00:02:38.980> one<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> easiest

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
which has got to be one of the easiest

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.270 
which has got to be one of the easiest
and<00:02:40.329> bosses<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:41.079> gaming<00:02:41.470> history<00:02:41.620> but

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
and bosses in gaming history but

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.130 
and bosses in gaming history but
thankfully<00:02:42.909> it's<00:02:43.120> for<00:02:43.329> good<00:02:43.480> reason<00:02:43.840> as<00:02:43.989> it

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
thankfully it's for good reason as it

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.839 
thankfully it's for good reason as it
ties<00:02:44.349> in<00:02:44.560> nicely<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.129> ending<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.760> the

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
ties in nicely with the ending of the

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.460 
ties in nicely with the ending of the
movie<00:02:46.000> which<00:02:46.390> as<00:02:46.569> I<00:02:46.720> said<00:02:46.900> earlier<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.409> a

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
movie which as I said earlier is a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.350 
movie which as I said earlier is a
recurring<00:02:47.950> theme<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.549> game<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:49.120> think

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
recurring theme in this game and I think

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.360 
recurring theme in this game and I think
it<00:02:49.690> actually<00:02:49.900> being<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.440> movie<00:02:50.769> game<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.160> ties

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
it actually being a movie game that ties

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.009 
it actually being a movie game that ties
in<00:02:51.519> with<00:02:51.579> the<00:02:51.700> movie<00:02:52.060> kind<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.480> elevates<00:02:52.900> it

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
in with the movie kind of elevates it

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.569 
in with the movie kind of elevates it
status<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.650> gives<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.099> point<00:02:54.430> of

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
status and gives it a point of

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.490 
status and gives it a point of
respectability<00:02:55.180> because<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.840> for<00:02:55.900> one<00:02:56.170> cannot

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
respectability because I for one cannot

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.440 
respectability because I for one cannot
stand<00:02:56.829> playing<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.370> movie<00:02:57.519> game<00:02:57.910> that's<00:02:58.180> got

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
stand playing a movie game that's got

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.210 
stand playing a movie game that's got
absolutely<00:02:59.079> nothing<00:02:59.349> to<00:02:59.620> do<00:02:59.769> with<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.980> film

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
absolutely nothing to do with the film

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.979 
absolutely nothing to do with the film
especially<00:03:00.400> if<00:03:00.819> as<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:00.970> fan<00:03:01.269> of<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:01.480> film<00:03:01.720> and

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
especially if as a fan of the film and

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.420 
especially if as a fan of the film and
it's<00:03:02.140> great<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.410> see<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.620> done<00:03:02.769> so<00:03:02.980> well<00:03:03.159> here

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
it's great to see it done so well here

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.190 
it's great to see it done so well here
so<00:03:03.819> that's<00:03:03.970> about<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.599> lion<00:03:04.810> king<00:03:05.049> I
