Hi, Scott from Retro Planet here.   Why is it that most of us never think of decorating

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.130
our garage, barn or workshop?  These are areas where you might be spending lots of time in, so go ahead and liven

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.490
them up just a little.   Make them even more fun to hang out and work in...

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.050
That's what this Retro Decorating Ideas video is all about.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.769
The spot where you do most of your tinkering, doesn't have to be dull or boring.

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.510
A fresh coat of bright colored paint along with some vintage metal sign and other
decorations like these,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.260
can look great right along with your tools, parts and supplies.  Don't feel like painting?  Hey, no problem!

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.010
Nail up some sheets of galvanized steel and stick some lighter weight signs up using magnets.
Now, you can rearrange them whenever you like!

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.280
Just hanging signs is a super quick way
to liven things up with lots of

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.500
color and  interests and with minimal effort.
And, no one ever said that you have to  tackle the entire room.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.879
The beauty of it is, decorating just a single wall or corner in these areas, never looks out of place.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.320
So start out simple and let the room evolve.  You'll have fun adding things over time.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.400
On the other hand, you can go wild with a complete Retro themed room makeover.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.040
Sticking with a theme can be a fun tribute to the past or you can highlight a special interest you have.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.540
Either way it gives a unified look to what's usually a messy, cluttered area.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.180
For the garage... consider an old time filling station idea. Many of our wall signs and retro decor items reflect

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.780
old-time branding programs, and look great when placed together in groups.
For the barn, you can easily adopt a

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.869
vintage tractor or farm equipment theme just like we've shown here. And here's a really cool look for all

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:49.820
you "motor heads" out there.   You can go with a hot rod magazine or drag racing theme using metal signs.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.610
Mopar, Ford, Chevy, Foreign... you name it! You're passionate about your favorite and you probably have a friendly rivalry going on with your friends.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.060
So why not play it up and really show your colors.  The similar theme ties all of the items together, giving a ton of impact to the entire garage.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.970
Signs will bring the most visual interest and color to these rooms, and really we have thousands of them.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:17.670
These signs depict anything from garage and automotive, to vintage tools and farm environment.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.200
We have hundreds of clocks that are an excellent double that provides colorful decoration and practicality.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.430
You can also round out the decorating theme with wall switch plates and vintage style thermometers.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.379
Our durable old style metal trash cans and paper towel dispensers are probably necessities in any workshop.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.810
It's very easy to add a touch of nostalgia to your work area. Stack some of these reproduction oil cans on a shelf for a truly authentic look.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.239
And if you really want to trick out your garage, retro style...

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.709
we carry a fine selection of reproduction gas pumps, air meters and gas pump globes.

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.010
So as you can see there are lots of
different ways to bring that retro look

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.430
to your garage, barn or workshop. These are areas that most people don't even think about decorating.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.799
But you're really wow your friends with your sense of style the next time

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.989
they come over and help with a
project.  And... you'll enjoy these areas

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.851
even more in the times are you there by yourself!

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:18.460
Until next time,  thanks for watching  RetroPlanet.com
