00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.839
 p 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.699
 I am very good at just showing 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.699
 how can they shoot while the hard drive 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.390
 through it system symbol 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.249
 as everyone knows if we are going to for example not run 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:29.300
 world equipped itself 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.610
 d efe 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.610
 social exclusion is about a disc 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.490
 then only 2m 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.180
 He emphasized mentioning the hard drives with the partitions that we do inside 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.900
 our system 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.830
 very limited by set we can only bury final 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.390
 and schedule it 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.480
 the date with that 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.480
 fragmented defragment the disk 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.900
 as announced a few weeks ago and what to do 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.910
 at the beginning 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.940
 at the moment 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.480
 and they have done it and right 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.630
 simÃ³ the system that is interpreted commands and then export 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.810
 the following concello the command for that increases in the system this exemplary 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.200
 and you put diagonal space 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.190
 i signes bridge relationship 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.190
 ismael all the parameters that we can use 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.990
 ironically 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.300
 this works very simple but it took the franky commander 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.240
 these arguments the volume 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.580
 we carry up 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.800
 the shakhtar 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 and after putting a parameter 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.110
 and if it is planned it gets second according to 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.350
 an extra parameter 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.350
 after it is exposed as long as you have chosen 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.820
 if I want is to fragment 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.130
 look at it a thousand casey records 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.270
 the comedian fracc 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.990
 and it is that he gets 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.990
 points 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.990
 I just want to analyze I do not think it's so slow and it's going to put 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.090
 to analyze it 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.909
 this has started in zanni 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.839
 volume 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.839
 it started to take a long time for my level 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.569
 policemen 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.349
 but it only works like this 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.039
 yes steve colima 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.039
 simone system 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.429
 Quique made acts 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:31.889
 and I put for example 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.369
 my life 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.369
 with milk with that eva gonzÃ¡lez 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.809
 and to heaven he shows this 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:44.880
 basically 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.930
 are we start the command conti frank crespo moscoso texts are put with the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.930
 volume simplicity shakhtar 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.509
 the seventh list of the parameters that will be able to session 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.339
 and so simple is not much science 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.709
 to be this time after commenting on a computer 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:11.079
 we already hear hidden files on your computer 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.939
 the driver are nothing more than nothing 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.039
 in one fell swoop in sets 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:18.249
 fragmented divides us 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.549
 in different parts of the Argentine like hard 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.249
 then when elected 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.390
 by the head of him indicated 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.780
 is looking for information because we are invoking an area near the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.519
 River 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.820
 it takes a little longer because it's jumping 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.249
 information segments to get 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.619
 to all the parties the file and be able to count it again 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:40.579
 because it is fragmented 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.780
 so the highlight that we are really doing is that we are 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:48.149
 putting back point tom document a file 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.929
 because this time because it is fragmented at the moment we are defragmenting 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:53.319
 deep 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.579
 and that's just three spaces left on the disk 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.180
 when we are for example delete training by moving file putting 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.599
 records 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.259
 and with the time 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:06.689
 we urge to do this we look for that computer is fragmented to be able 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:10.650
 besides leaving a little due to the little speed to the disc 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.719
 so good 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:16.769
 despite all having a good question leave a comment as I have time what 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:17.609
 I followed 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.229
 very simple video a very short practical reutemann a lot to say that it is very 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.809
 counselor that we're going to do nothing more was show them how to 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:29.189
 enter reader parameters for this command 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.800
 and already after his ex-wife angelita 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.229
 we suspect that it sits
