 words thread to start on the story 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.510
 of the solo mode of this first marble lego 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:48.149
 ok superhero we really wanted to create 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.460
 a story of money arrives on earth 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.690
 and in fact he is shot and his surf is 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.520
 breaks in many small blocks 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.960
 kosmicki this cross what's going on 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.190
 next is that the super villains are going 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.600
 to start collecting these bricks 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.879
 cosmic to build something 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.649
 of devastating and so it will be to the super 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.059
 hero to hunt down super villains from 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.920
 understand what these are going to serve them 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.780
 smic blocks and take the measure of the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.970
 threat to them then obviously 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.520
 we will find all the superheroes of 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.909
 marvel we see in the gameplay that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.590
 can be a group of superheroes 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.939
 is this group imposed by 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.100
 the story or so have chosen to 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.619
 constitute his group with the characters 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.060
 that we want to act what you play 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.119
 in the story mode and because one 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.020
 wish we can get in and out 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.130
 characters that launches the story by 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.030
 example when you play first 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.920
 story mode level 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.930
 she will be forced to play hawk iron 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.360
 Man and Spider Man but if you 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.490
 replay in the freeplay mag choose the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.720
 characters to wish you 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.009
 for example tell you like if I 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.799
 refused the first level with the kit 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.869
 gold black widow provided you have 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.250
 unlocked this allows to leave the field 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.780
 free to some extent 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.130
 obviously everyone wants to have the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.110
 opportunity to play the bad guys and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.909
 it's possible in the game that is 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.259
 playable but it's not the only one 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.549
 domination and trace of man's blood 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.810
 back there are more than 100 characters 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.759
 playable in the game thoroughly 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.259
 we wanted to have the greatest number of 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.849
 possible characters to represent at 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.679
 better all the big family marvel 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.780

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.760
 an x-men where i want to embody iron man or 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.750

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.550

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.780
 we really have a lot of characters 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.190
 in the game and I think everyone 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.190
 can find his favorite 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.890
 with obviously the recipe that made the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.200
 success of all these games a lot 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.520
 humor of the kop where we go in and out 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.410

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.060
