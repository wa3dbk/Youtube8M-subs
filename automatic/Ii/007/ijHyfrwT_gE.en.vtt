00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
these types of implementations before so

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.310 
these types of implementations before so
we<00:03:58.060> feel<00:03:58.360> where<00:03:58.630> it's<00:03:58.780> prepared<00:03:59.170> at<00:03:59.290> this

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
we feel where it's prepared at this

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.500 
we feel where it's prepared at this
point<00:03:59.470> as<00:03:59.740> we<00:03:59.890> can<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.340> we<00:04:00.880> can't<00:04:01.120> wait<00:04:01.210> to<00:04:01.330> get
