00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
know it from their own life but that is

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.190

but yeah I think it's a good idea I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.679 
but yeah I think it's a good idea I
think<00:01:36.439> like<00:01:37.610> especially<00:01:38.610> conservative<00:01:39.360> sort

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
think like especially conservative sort

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.420

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
universities trying to come up with ways

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
universities trying to come up with ways
to<00:01:43.710> teach<00:01:43.920> sex<00:01:44.220> ed<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.700> sort<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.390> new

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
to teach sex ed in sort of a new

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.109 
to teach sex ed in sort of a new
progressive<00:01:46.259> sort<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.860> interesting<00:01:47.280> way<00:01:47.460> but

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
progressive sort of interesting way but

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.870 
progressive sort of interesting way but
like<00:01:48.299> sex<00:01:49.049> ed<00:01:49.290> by<00:01:49.649> itself<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.280> not<00:01:50.490> usually

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
like sex ed by itself is not usually

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.310 
like sex ed by itself is not usually
something<00:01:51.060> people<00:01:51.299> think<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.630> as<00:01:51.750> very<00:01:51.780> sexy

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
something people think of as very sexy

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.530 
something people think of as very sexy
and<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.399> bring<00:01:53.640> people<00:01:53.670> into<00:01:54.240> it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and so you have to bring people into it

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.510 
and so you have to bring people into it
and<00:01:54.720> people<00:01:54.869> love<00:01:55.170> Harry<00:01:55.530> Potter<00:01:55.590> I'm<00:01:56.070> sure

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
and people love Harry Potter I'm sure

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.330 
and people love Harry Potter I'm sure
that<00:01:56.729> if<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.000> fifty<00:01:57.360> Shades<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.689> Grey<00:01:57.750> or

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
that if you have fifty Shades of Grey or

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.069 
that if you have fifty Shades of Grey or
hunger<00:01:59.340> games<00:01:59.579> like<00:02:00.210> maybe<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.630> teach<00:02:00.869> you

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
hunger games like maybe you teach you

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.020 
hunger games like maybe you teach you
know<00:02:01.200> how<00:02:01.409> people<00:02:01.680> express<00:02:02.070> their<00:02:02.250> hunger<00:02:02.700> for

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
know how people express their hunger for

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.149 
know how people express their hunger for
each<00:02:03.149> other<00:02:03.360> with<00:02:03.960> some<00:02:04.200> oral<00:02:04.500> sex<00:02:04.740> class<00:02:04.979> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
each other with some oral sex class and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.139 
each other with some oral sex class and
stuff<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:05.759> that's<00:02:05.939> how<00:02:06.119> you

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
stuff like that like that's how you

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.370 
stuff like that like that's how you
bring<00:02:06.390> people<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> think<00:02:07.049> that's<00:02:07.290> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
bring people in and so I think that's a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.730 
bring people in and so I think that's a
good<00:02:07.469> idea

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
good idea

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.169 
good idea
yeah<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.220> also<00:02:08.369> think<00:02:08.580> another<00:02:08.910> point<00:02:09.149> that

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
yeah but I also think another point that

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.400 
yeah but I also think another point that
they<00:02:09.330> made<00:02:09.479> there<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:09.959> was<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.170> big

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
they made there is like it was a big

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.930 
they made there is like it was a big
thing<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.890> she<00:02:11.069> left<00:02:11.250> out<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.700> books

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
thing that she left out of the books

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.070 
thing that she left out of the books
yeah

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
yeah

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.270 
yeah
but<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.680> think<00:02:13.860> that's<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.220> great

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
but and I think that's a really great

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.160 
but and I think that's a really great
because<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.850> do<00:02:14.910> think<00:02:15.360> for<00:02:15.420> people<00:02:15.870> who<00:02:15.990> are<00:02:16.080> in

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
because I do think for people who are in

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.210 
because I do think for people who are in
middle<00:02:16.350> school<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.650> high<00:02:16.770> school<00:02:17.010> who<00:02:17.100> have

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
middle school in high school who have

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.980 
middle school in high school who have
two<00:02:17.340> who<00:02:17.610> need<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.060> learn<00:02:18.210> about<00:02:18.390> sex<00:02:18.630> at<00:02:18.840> that

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
two who need to learn about sex at that

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.890 
two who need to learn about sex at that
point<00:02:19.880> there's<00:02:20.880> no<00:02:21.090> really<00:02:21.360> wait<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.540> remember

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
point there's no really wait I remember

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.350 
point there's no really wait I remember
we<00:02:22.020> used<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.290> watch<00:02:22.560> these<00:02:22.860> videos<00:02:23.330> where<00:02:24.330> I

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
we used to watch these videos where I

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.510 
we used to watch these videos where I
would<00:02:24.630> be<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:24.960> oh<00:02:25.140> these<00:02:25.320> awful<00:02:25.890> videos<00:02:26.310> and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
would be like oh these awful videos and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.770 
would be like oh these awful videos and
I<00:02:26.550> went<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.820> really<00:02:27.060> progressive<00:02:27.210> school

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
I went to a really progressive school

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.600 
I went to a really progressive school
and<00:02:27.960> they<00:02:28.050> were<00:02:28.140> still<00:02:28.470> really<00:02:28.740> bad<00:02:29.070> videos

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
and they were still really bad videos

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.250 
and they were still really bad videos
where<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> was<00:02:29.880> like<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.780> still<00:02:31.080> don't

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
where I was like but I still don't

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.370 
where I was like but I still don't
understand<00:02:32.190> how<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.700> works<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.360> like<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.810> still

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
understand how it works and like I still

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.050 
understand how it works and like I still
didn't<00:02:34.620> understand<00:02:35.160> like<00:02:35.340> how<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.670> whole

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
didn't understand like how the whole

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.630 
didn't understand like how the whole
thing<00:02:36.480> happened<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.500> they<00:02:37.770> were<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.160> they

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
thing happened because they were so they

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.170 
thing happened because they were so they

that whole thing they skirted around the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.710 
that whole thing they skirted around the
issue<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.820> much<00:02:45.030> because<00:02:45.300> they<00:02:45.390> were<00:02:45.480> trying

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
issue so much because they were trying

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.940 
issue so much because they were trying
to<00:02:45.750> be<00:02:45.870> politically<00:02:46.320> correct<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:46.860> yeah

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
to be politically correct and so yeah

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.650 
to be politically correct and so yeah
that's<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.550> had<00:02:47.670> no<00:02:47.970> idea<00:02:48.000> what<00:02:48.570> was

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
that's that you had no idea what was

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.930 
that's that you had no idea what was
going<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:49.110> yeah<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:49.830> if<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.040> find<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.520> way<00:02:50.670> that

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
going on yeah so if you find a way that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.210 
going on yeah so if you find a way that
you<00:02:51.060> can<00:02:51.240> communicate<00:02:51.420> what's<00:02:52.140> going<00:02:52.470> on<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.890> a

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
you can communicate what's going on in a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.880 
you can communicate what's going on in a
way<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:54.480> guess<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:55.140> brings<00:02:55.440> people<00:02:55.680> in

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
way that I guess is brings people in

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.120 
way that I guess is brings people in
that's<00:02:56.160> engaging<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:57.650> yeah<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.860> that's<00:02:58.980> why

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
that's engaging and yeah and that's why

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.380 
that's engaging and yeah and that's why
a<00:02:59.160> lot<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.460> these<00:02:59.610> events<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.270> have

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
a lot of these events you have to have

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.990 
a lot of these events you have to have
outside<00:03:00.660> people<00:03:01.410> or<00:03:01.620> even<00:03:01.980> students<00:03:02.550> leading

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
outside people or even students leading

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.700 
outside people or even students leading
the<00:03:03.180> events<00:03:03.540> because<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:04.110> administrators

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
the events because the administrators

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.110 
the events because the administrators
often<00:03:04.890> are<00:03:05.130> not<00:03:05.280> gonna<00:03:05.370> get<00:03:05.580> involved<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:06.000> that

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
often are not gonna get involved in that
