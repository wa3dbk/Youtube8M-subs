00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
so it sits up here and kind of collapses

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.539 
so it sits up here and kind of collapses
this<00:02:15.630> whole<00:02:15.810> section<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.980> comes<00:02:17.310> up<00:02:17.430> and

and<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.660> can<00:02:37.380> flip<00:02:37.560> these<00:02:37.740> up<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.160> official

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
and you can flip these up the official

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.830 
and you can flip these up the official
transformation<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.209> flip<00:02:39.420> these<00:02:39.600> rear

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
transformation is to flip these rear

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.070 
transformation is to flip these rear

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
pieces up to bring this detail in

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.000 
pieces up to bring this detail in
although<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.230> leaves<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.530> legs<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.800> little

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010

although it leaves the legs a little
hollow<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.580> love<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.390> shape<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.020> leg<00:02:46.260> with

something to fill in this part cuz this
makes<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.050> look<00:02:52.110> very<00:02:52.230> empty<00:02:53.120> there<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.270> a

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
makes it look very empty there is a

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.560 
makes it look very empty there is a
little<00:02:54.930> bit<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.340> transformation<00:02:56.340> joint<00:02:57.180> here

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
little bit of transformation joint here

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.500 
little bit of transformation joint here
as<00:02:57.690> well<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.770> do<00:02:59.550> feel<00:02:59.850> like<00:02:59.880> if<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.209> bring<00:03:00.390> this

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
as well I do feel like if you bring this

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.270 
as well I do feel like if you bring this
down<00:03:00.750> this<00:03:00.959> helps<00:03:01.260> complete<00:03:01.440> let's<00:03:02.010> make<00:03:02.160> the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
down this helps complete let's make the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.400 
down this helps complete let's make the
leg<00:03:02.430> look<00:03:02.610> complete<00:03:03.650> although<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:05.040> does<00:03:06.410> it

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
leg look complete although it does it

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.320 
leg look complete although it does it
does<00:03:07.620> give<00:03:08.040> some<00:03:08.070> gaps<00:03:08.459> here<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:08.970> legs<00:03:09.209> but

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
does give some gaps here in the legs but

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.760 
does give some gaps here in the legs but
there<00:03:09.780> were<00:03:09.840> already<00:03:10.080> some<00:03:10.290> gaps<00:03:10.530> there<00:03:10.709> in

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
there were already some gaps there in

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.710 
there were already some gaps there in
the<00:03:10.830> legs<00:03:11.010> even<00:03:11.310> with<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.640> flipped<00:03:11.940> up<00:03:12.120> it

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
the legs even with that flipped up it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.150 
the legs even with that flipped up it
just<00:03:12.840> changes<00:03:13.230> which<00:03:13.410> side<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.830> leg<00:03:14.010> it's

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
just changes which side of the leg it's

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.310 
just changes which side of the leg it's
on<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.209> think<00:03:15.300> from<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.690> side<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.080> gives<00:03:16.170> it

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
on and I think from the side it gives it

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.530 
on and I think from the side it gives it
a<00:03:16.410> much<00:03:16.590> better<00:03:17.030> filled<00:03:18.030> in<00:03:18.180> silhouette

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
a much better filled in silhouette

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.720 
a much better filled in silhouette
although<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.780> do<00:03:18.900> like<00:03:19.350> having<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.370> come<00:03:20.610> up

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
although I do like having that come up

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.060 
although I do like having that come up
on<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.000> cap<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.450> just<00:03:21.630> wish<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.840> was<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.110> little

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
on the cap I just wish it was a little

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.670 
on the cap I just wish it was a little
bit<00:03:23.160> more<00:03:23.310> filled<00:03:23.670> in<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.959> figure<00:03:25.200> itself<00:03:25.320> is

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
bit more filled in the figure itself is

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.259 
bit more filled in the figure itself is
actually<00:03:26.040> pretty<00:03:26.730> nice<00:03:26.940> there's<00:03:27.750> some

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
actually pretty nice there's some

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.100 
actually pretty nice there's some
proportions<00:03:30.269> are<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.420> little<00:03:30.570> off<00:03:30.780> like<00:03:30.989> his

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
proportions are a little off like his

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.960 
proportions are a little off like his
upper<00:03:31.260> arms<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:31.950> upper<00:03:32.190> legs<00:03:32.400> seem<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> little

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
upper arms and upper legs seem a little

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.479 
upper arms and upper legs seem a little
shorter<00:03:33.420> for<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.840> lower<00:03:34.290> appendages<00:03:34.890> but

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
shorter for the lower appendages but

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.490 
shorter for the lower appendages but
there's<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.730> nice<00:03:35.910> sense<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.300> dynamic<00:03:36.989> like

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
there's a nice sense of dynamic like

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.110 
there's a nice sense of dynamic like
even<00:03:37.769> just<00:03:37.799> standing<00:03:38.100> still<00:03:38.549> he<00:03:38.790> looks<00:03:39.000> like

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
even just standing still he looks like

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.530 
even just standing still he looks like
he's<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:39.600> action<00:03:40.320> he<00:03:40.470> looks<00:03:40.620> natural<00:03:41.540> like

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
he's in action he looks natural like

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.199 
he's in action he looks natural like
there's<00:03:42.900> some<00:03:43.049> sort<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.350> curve<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.860> him<00:03:44.209> bring

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209

when<00:03:56.220> he<00:03:56.310> can<00:03:56.430> sit<00:03:56.640> like<00:03:56.820> most<00:03:57.360> of<00:03:57.480> his<00:03:57.570> car

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
when he can sit like most of his car

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.620 
when he can sit like most of his car

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
does form the backpack again but but

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.210 
does form the backpack again but but
although<00:04:00.780> it's<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.230> much<00:04:01.470> nicer<00:04:01.500> bumblebee

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
although it's a much nicer bumblebee

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.190 
although it's a much nicer bumblebee
further<00:04:02.459> than<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.640> expected<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.720> head<00:04:03.870> sculpt

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
further than I expected the head sculpt

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.380 
further than I expected the head sculpt
is<00:04:04.260> really<00:04:04.470> great<00:04:04.880> he<00:04:05.880> does<00:04:06.030> have<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.209> little

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
is really great he does have a little

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.090 
is really great he does have a little
bit<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:07.079> ball<00:04:07.290> joint<00:04:07.530> in<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.709> neck<00:04:07.860> there

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
bit of a ball joint in the neck there

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.770 
bit of a ball joint in the neck there
again<00:04:08.730> with<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:08.910> ratchet<00:04:09.060> II<00:04:09.269> shoulders<00:04:09.660> as

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
again with the ratchet II shoulders as

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.860 
again with the ratchet II shoulders as
well<00:04:09.959> as<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.200> transformation<00:04:10.650> hinge

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
well as the transformation hinge

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.800 
well as the transformation hinge
Universal<00:04:12.870> hips<00:04:13.160> thighs<00:04:14.160> swivel<00:04:14.640> hinge<00:04:15.510> knees

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
Universal hips thighs swivel hinge knees

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.880 
Universal hips thighs swivel hinge knees
and<00:04:16.049> then<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.200> can<00:04:16.320> like<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.500> said<00:04:16.530> there's<00:04:16.799> a

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
and then you can like I said there's a

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.729 
and then you can like I said there's a
transformation<00:04:17.250> joint<00:04:17.700> here<00:04:18.260> as<00:04:19.260> well<00:04:19.500> as<00:04:19.620> the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
transformation joint here as well as the

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.620 
transformation joint here as well as the
ankle<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.370> get<00:04:20.519> some<00:04:20.669> decent<00:04:21.150> range<00:04:21.479> of

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
ankle so you get some decent range of

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.510 
ankle so you get some decent range of
movement<00:04:21.900> out<00:04:21.959> of<00:04:22.019> them<00:04:22.200> it's<00:04:23.100> not<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.340> best

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
movement out of them it's not the best

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.270 
movement out of them it's not the best
bumblebee<00:04:24.000> ever<00:04:24.660> made<00:04:24.900> but<00:04:25.289> I'm<00:04:25.620> really<00:04:26.070> kind

bumblebee ever made but I'm really kind

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.560 
bumblebee ever made but I'm really kind
of<00:04:26.340> happy<00:04:26.580> with<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.820> I've<00:04:26.910> bought<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.330> for<00:04:27.539> a

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
of happy with it I've bought it for a

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.000 
of happy with it I've bought it for a
got<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:27.990> for<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.200> vehicle<00:04:28.560> mode<00:04:28.680> which<00:04:28.890> I
