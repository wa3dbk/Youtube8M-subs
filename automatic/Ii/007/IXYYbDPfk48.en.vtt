aren't<00:01:00.520> part<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:01.090> the<00:01:01.210> firmware<00:01:01.480> so<00:01:02.230> you<00:01:02.320> can

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
aren't part of the firmware so you can

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.290 
aren't part of the firmware so you can
do<00:01:02.620> one<00:01:02.770> of<00:01:02.800> two<00:01:02.920> things<00:01:03.220> you<00:01:03.370> can<00:01:03.550> either<00:01:03.610> edit

the firmware or edit the scatter and
just<00:01:07.060> remove<00:01:07.600> those<00:01:07.930> portions<00:01:08.350> from<00:01:08.890> the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
just remove those portions from the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.070 
just remove those portions from the
scatter<00:01:09.400> just<00:01:09.760> edit<00:01:10.030> in<00:01:10.120> a<00:01:10.210> text<00:01:10.600> file<00:01:10.780> you'll

are<00:02:19.840> selected<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.700> use<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.120> firmware

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
are selected you can use the firmware

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.240 
are selected you can use the firmware
upgrade<00:02:22.690> option<00:02:23.820> ok<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:26.380> reason<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.769> can't<00:02:27.040> use

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
upgrade option ok the reason I can't use

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.850 
upgrade option ok the reason I can't use
that<00:02:27.459> now<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.940> because<00:02:28.330> these<00:02:28.600> are<00:02:29.140> not<00:02:29.590> part

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
that now is because these are not part

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.979 
that now is because these are not part
of<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.040> firm<00:02:30.250> not<00:02:30.519> part<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.820> the<00:02:30.940> ROM<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:31.660> if<00:02:31.840> I

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
of the firm not part of the ROM so if I

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.930 
of the firm not part of the ROM so if I
wanted<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.320> use<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:32.860> again<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.610> would<00:02:33.910> just

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
wanted to use this again I would just

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.240 
wanted to use this again I would just
open<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.600> scatter<00:02:34.900> remove<00:02:35.829> these<00:02:36.040> two
