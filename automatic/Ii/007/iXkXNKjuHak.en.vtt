I think we're gonna have a very good

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.289 
I think we're gonna have a very good
match<00:01:49.920> between<00:01:50.189> these<00:01:50.340> two<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> enjoyed<00:01:50.880> their

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.760 
match between these two I enjoyed their
match<00:01:51.509> at<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> great<00:01:51.990> American<00:01:52.409> bash<00:01:52.439> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
match at the great American bash that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.440 
match at the great American bash that
opened<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.130> show<00:01:53.310> other<00:01:53.759> than<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.090> fact<00:01:54.270> that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
opened the show other than the fact that

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.480 
opened the show other than the fact that
MVP<00:01:54.840> botched<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.570> play<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.860> play<00:01:58.890> maker<00:01:59.310> or

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.920 
MVP botched the play the play maker or
whatever<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.060> called<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.329> think<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:00.810> what

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
whatever it's called I think that's what

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
whatever it's called I think that's what
it's<00:02:01.049> called<00:02:01.110> but<00:02:01.500> my<00:02:01.979> prediction<00:02:02.460> for<00:02:02.490> this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
it's called but my prediction for this

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.510 
it's called but my prediction for this
will<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.420> MVP<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.259> we'll<00:02:04.829> get<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> wrestling

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
himself to win I'm going with steel cage

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.620 
himself to win I'm going with steel cage
because<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:35.160> haven't<00:02:35.400> had<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.550> real<00:02:35.970> good<00:02:36.270> steel

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
because we haven't had a real good steel

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.380 
because we haven't had a real good steel
cage<00:02:36.900> match<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.590> at<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.800> time<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.400> see<00:02:39.210> what

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
cage match in so at a time and see what

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.990 
cage match in so at a time and see what
my<00:02:39.660> they<00:02:39.870> put<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.740> mob<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.370> there<00:02:41.580> with<00:02:41.790> other

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
my they put a mob in there with other

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.150 
my they put a mob in there with other
against<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.720> job<00:02:43.020> or<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.380> steel<00:02:43.620> cage<00:02:43.650> I

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
against the job or in a steel cage I

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.200 
against the job or in a steel cage I
just<00:02:44.580> think<00:02:45.240> that'd<00:02:45.450> be<00:02:45.540> pretty<00:02:45.720> good<00:02:46.140> or<00:02:46.860> cool

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
just think that'd be pretty good or cool

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.060 
just think that'd be pretty good or cool
III<00:02:48.210> don't<00:02:48.600> know<00:02:48.780> i<00:02:48.960> think<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.680> steel<00:02:49.890> cage

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
III don't know i think the steel cage

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.190 
III don't know i think the steel cage
will<00:02:50.250> be<00:02:50.340> good<00:02:50.520> because<00:02:50.970> i<00:02:51.120> think<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.990> first

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
will be good because i think the first

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.720 
will be good because i think the first
blood<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:52.710> don't<00:02:52.890> really<00:02:53.100> need<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.520> see<00:02:53.700> a

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
blood we don't really need to see a

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.460 
blood we don't really need to see a
first<00:02:54.000> blood<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.630> i<00:02:54.990> think<00:02:55.200> we've<00:02:55.320> seen

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
first blood and i think we've seen

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.230 
first blood and i think we've seen
enough<00:02:55.530> street<00:02:56.010> fights<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.670> brawls<00:02:56.910> and

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
enough street fights and brawls and

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.150 
enough street fights and brawls and
stuff<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.750> year<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:58.200> steel<00:02:58.650> cage<00:02:58.890> would<00:02:59.070> be

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
stuff this year a steel cage would be

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.460 
stuff this year a steel cage would be
good<00:02:59.340> so<00:03:00.000> yeah<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.600> think<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.960> steel<00:03:01.140> cage<00:03:01.290> will

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
good so yeah I think the steel cage will

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.050 
good so yeah I think the steel cage will
suit<00:03:01.620> please<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> while<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.460> it'll<00:03:02.910> be<00:03:02.970> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
suit please to a while and it'll be the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.670 
suit please to a while and it'll be the
feud<00:03:03.360> ender<00:03:03.660> here<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.080> Triple<00:03:04.320> H<00:03:04.350> will<00:03:04.560> get

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
feud ender here and Triple H will get

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.610 
feud ender here and Triple H will get
the<00:03:04.800> win<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.930> think<00:03:06.930> kamagra<00:03:07.230> could<00:03:07.530> do

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
the win I think kamagra could do

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.310 
the win I think kamagra could do
something<00:03:07.830> crazy<00:03:08.070> in<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.430> cage<00:03:09.080> then<00:03:10.080> we<00:03:10.200> go

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
something crazy in this cage then we go

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.040 
something crazy in this cage then we go
on<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.500> our<00:03:10.830> first<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.670> three<00:03:12.390> title<00:03:12.870> matches

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050

Royal Rumble nozomi showed I think he'd

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.350

and<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.910> Undertaker<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:58.660> I<00:04:59.440> guess<00:05:00.070> JBL

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
and the Undertaker and I guess JBL

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.590 
and the Undertaker and I guess JBL
something<00:05:00.790> to<00:05:00.850> do<00:05:00.940> other<00:05:01.030> they'd<00:05:01.270> have<00:05:01.420> to

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
something to do other they'd have to

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.040 
something to do other they'd have to
work<00:05:02.200> with<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.830> retarded<00:05:03.610> Michael<00:05:03.940> Cole<00:05:04.150> so

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
work with the retarded Michael Cole so

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.790 
work with the retarded Michael Cole so
my<00:05:05.680> prediction<00:05:06.190> will<00:05:06.400> be<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:07.140> say<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.200> t<00:05:08.590> cell

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
my prediction will be I say the t cell

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800 
my prediction will be I say the t cell
to<00:05:09.040> win<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.580> Belton<00:05:09.880> this<00:05:10.030> retain<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.660> belt

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
to win the Belton this retain the belt

to win the Belton this retain the belt
in<00:05:10.930> this<00:05:11.080> match<00:05:11.320> and<00:05:11.680> we<00:05:12.220> have<00:05:12.340> JBL<00:05:12.850> being<00:05:13.120> the

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
in this match and we have JBL being the

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.990 
in this match and we have JBL being the
ref<00:05:13.420> I<00:05:13.720> mean<00:05:14.380> he'll<00:05:14.710> just<00:05:14.920> overcome<00:05:15.730> the<00:05:15.880> odds

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
ref I mean he'll just overcome the odds

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.330 
ref I mean he'll just overcome the odds
or<00:05:16.240> something<00:05:16.660> like<00:05:16.750> that<00:05:16.810> for<00:05:17.470> a<00:05:17.530> chokeslam

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
see something like that I don't think

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.830
