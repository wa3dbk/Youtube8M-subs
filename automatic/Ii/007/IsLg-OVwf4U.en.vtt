00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:12.149
 welcome to the Hanoverian and four Oreal operates in this new 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:13.189
 See tutorial 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:17.289
 Peter Huber a little deeper around the long-awaited on the shore to 0 4 a 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.529
 We feel it with the creators on the tooth and want to know what's new to you 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.759
 gripping build strategy game with expected in Germany 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.359
 We chose the Exit or Polisher Christopher Schmitz and the lead 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.379
 Game designer Dirk Riegert met at Related Designs in Mainz and got him 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.580
 Asked questions about the economic system 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.970
 our first question goes directly to Dirk Riegert we want to know from them what 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.100
 has changed in structure and complexity in the game 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.890
 this has always been a building game and that's why we decided for a 14 04 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.560
 again very focused on the construction 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.610
 In order for the beginners that percent means that we are a very simple one 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.270
 Have chosen entry so that in principle of anno 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.820
 Percent very clearly and came to Vettel is carried in the later 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.430
 Gameplay is far from the game due to the new system required 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.730
 more complex 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.770
 and then stays for the profiles 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.770
 demanding and interesting later hours 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.960
 okay then the entry would be clarified but what does it actually with the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.170
 Project on itself 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.200
 what role does the Orient play and what kind of technologies can you use there? 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 We asked for help with Christopher Schmitz 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.479
 in a puddle 04 wanted to go new ways we have a new one 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.700
 Culture introduced the FOC the donor's desire is the word is percent 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.050
 lie down press 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.610
 and that does not do anything we hit a new three broken players 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.870
 In the course of the game the Orient came to know him as a culture with them 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.080
 interact to learn his technologies 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.010
 For example, at the end of the day, the only person who has not recognized it is the one who has the percentage 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.010
 In just seven of the Western Conference you had to grow it 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.700
 Of course, one does not need the winner of the clientele of sweets 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.050
 my inhabitants in my blog cities in the occident 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.859
 That sounds like a new exciting and meaningful extension 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.319
 new and useful is the need system with the new super may eat 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.039
 but why was there any need to improve this? 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.749
 Let us educate you about BirdLife at 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:12.939
 The key point of the year is still the need systems 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:17.209
 as we have for the first time with anno 1404 a substantial changes 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.389
 made this system 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.619
 through the introduction of super must 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.149
 for example 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:27.839
 the residents a need for clothing 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:32.419
 all citizens are always satisfied with simple linen customers later 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:37.249
 they also need fur coats or brocade robes - that is the ones they need 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.660
 Claims are rising 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.480
 But this is the way we needed it 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.370
 and to keep the number of needs low so that they too can 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.190
 Beginners stay manageable but later for the pro I give new ones 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.140
 to introduce very challenging chains of goods without us having one 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.140
 have to generate huge numbers of needs 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:00.259
 we hope we could meet your need for knowledge and 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:04.479
 refer to our next tutorial for the new anno 14 04
