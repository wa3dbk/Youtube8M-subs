00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.240
 Hi, I 'm going to tell you more and talk to you. 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.210
 today about the difference between floors 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.220
 ceramics and the good postulates 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.939
 the main difference between them is the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.779
 composition in a porcelain tile we have a 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:36.730
 mix of porcelain and minerals 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:39.940
 already in the ceramic floor we have 70% of 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.629
 composition of clay with other minerals 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.629
 only that covers the balcony of the porcelanato is 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.530
 that it and with the absorption of water almost 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.430
 want to 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.850
 this occurs due to the burning of the part 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.660
 ask her to be burned at 1250 degrees 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.039
 Celsius 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.500
 already the ceramics is of the screen does the burning in 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.940
 850 degrees celsius 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.270
 on the flip side it 's just you want to get up 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.350
 from a background of it when you see a background 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.930
 more color land koroki thing is 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.500
 porcelain tile floor you gave a 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:21.010
 beige right in one mass field 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.710
 only a single one is compact the issue of 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.670
 loss of resistance it is directly 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.380
 linked to the burning of the material 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.780
 then the lower the water absorption 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.360
 the bigger the burn, right? 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.800
 but there is your product why the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.840
 porcelain tiles and has a very 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.540
 big and you can feel it 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.840
 picking up the material because the pottery is 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.300
 much lighter than the born, then it is 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.460
 a great difference between one and another 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.730
 another question you can work on is 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.610
 the higher the lower resistance 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:01.330
 this relationship is directly related to the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.680
 proportionality is already in our 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.410
 investment 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.450
 the resistance is denominated through 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.580
 a symbology we call ipi 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.070
 ranging from 1 to 5 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.370
 the greater the number more resistant to 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:19.450
 piece should can work 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.060
 The product is better on 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.610
 ceramic tiles for each 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.010
 situation for each typology you 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.980
 play inside you can use in the part 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.629
 external or internal use of 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.670
 few struggles of the environments seeking 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.340
 design by residential as commercial 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.940
 we found the market possible 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.739
 napoli's that shiny right and that 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.519
 can not be used in the areas 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.200
 external 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.019
 you can use both the floor and the 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.900
 wall it is natural that this sim can 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.870
 be used in any area that is 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.579
 that more joy there are the specifics 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.040
 for external areas 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.640
 then you can choose according to your 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.310
 need to put the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.209
 coatings both ceramic and 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.019
 porcelain tile 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:11.379
 You'll need mortar. 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.599
 spacers to display the 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.870
 the correct way the risk of 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.389
 and also the grout to give the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.609
 finish of the mortar has a 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.889
 spacer that gives the correct structure of the 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.639
 grout and the shift scheme in 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:29.109
 finishing 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:34.290
 ok do not forget in case of the color of dodo 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:38.590
 warned porcelain tile is key you 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.440
 keep at least 15 days and healing 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.730
 contract because because a part does not 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.669
 just water 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.669
 She was the one who wanted to go out on Saturday so she 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:50.590
 will end up going to the grout he's k or 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.590
 school white 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:59.079
 this is called in its essence nothing more 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.060
 is the healing occurring after the settlement is 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.739
 that's because you did not care 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.590
 previously so beware of this 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.079
 because it will be fundamental of the project okay 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.840
 I hope I got a big kiss from you. 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:15.389
