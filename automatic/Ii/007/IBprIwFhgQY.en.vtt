00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.020
 ran 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.240
 re 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.220
 Hmmm 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.529
 Business trip powerful professional baseball begins 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.960
 Hello everyone 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:30.529
 This 20th anniversary to mark the 2008 season 62 save 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.130
 Major League Save King Heal Big Brewers' Francisco 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:39.970
 I will make Rodriguez 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:40.480
 Rodriguez is at the age of 16 years old at the age of 16 in 1998 at the age of the key jersey baseball team 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.070
 End 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:49.090
 Joined Los Angeles Angels with a contract fee of approximately 100 million yen 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:54.879
 Zuu a major at the time of the 2000 20-year-old joined the fourth year 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:01:00.780
 The pitching itself was five games, but it records eight consecutive strikeouts that become a team Thailand record 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:03.930
 Great success in the post season, and won the world's youngest victory ever in the World Series 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.720
 When changing to a pillow in 2005, the fourth year of majors 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:15.150
 Mark the 45 save, I was the angel of the first title of the most save 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:21.770
 We marked 62 saves in several tens of eight years and updated the season's most-saved records 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.770
 By the way, this 62 Seibu 2 record seems to have been certified as a Guinness record 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:30.690
 With a moving ball with an average convergence of 148 km, a slider with a large drop and two types of war-time up 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:35.040
 A pitching style that builds a mountain of strikeouts 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.820
 Sun 's strikeout rate is over 10% and strikeout is called a tired rod 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.880
 It seems like 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.880
 This time I make such a Rodriguez player 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.980
 Let's keep grades 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:58.410
 First of all, I will explain how to count results 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:04.540
 Relief investment corrects the results of the season in which there was over 20 years old 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:10.330
 Dorifesu pitcher has compiled the results of the season of 2014 from 2003 kindergartens 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.020
 Fujikawa pitcher Settsu Chapman of Uenohara pitchers Rangers of Red Sox as a plan this time 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.600
 pitcher 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.600
 We also count results of ç¬¹ 4 pitchers in Yokohama 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.060
 Next, I will average the season 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.709
 In terms of the last 144 games Mars 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.840
 Asthma looks like this 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:58.530
 The top speed of the regular season has been posted 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:04.489
 Rodriguez's self-fastest is 167km, but it is uneven rapidly and the average speed is 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.489
 The ball speed was set at 155 km at 148 km south 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:17.610
 Control is like winning market is given four-ball rate 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:17.610
 The extra budget is the one that shows how much the earth is put out to Takagi in management . 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.180
 Such a feeling to the second place 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.180
 We considered based on the number of boarding and average pitching inning 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.030
 Such a feeling during change 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:48.710
 Rodriguez's slider seems to say that this house is a slider 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.730
 Because the speed is slower than the slider and the head is large, the batter who played is said to curve 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.569
 It is 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:56.439
 Why do it take a break 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:01.859
 Change-up has a normal change-up and a change-up that sinks in the shoot direction 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.859
 Another wartime up was done during a circle war like so 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:10.770
 Finally it is a special ability 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:17.030
 Using the document is not a home run and a strikeout rate and lob 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:20.780
 Strikeout rate represents how much strikeout can be taken when throwing 9 innings 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:26.270
 mod might have quite some people there is no be had 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.370
 The lob 2's simply expressed the probability of not returning the runners who have run out to home 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.840
 It is a thing 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:36.530
 If this is high, it will be a strong pitcher 2 in the pinch scene 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.750
 It's a dance The pitcher is a major 14 year veteran in this year 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.590
 All numbers are at a very high level 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.590
 That's right 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.540
 Rodriguez's ability calculated by this program at 6 o'clock is here. 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.540
 I think the difficulty is standard 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.330
 In the next video you will actually play success 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:18.159
 There are 12 universities to play
