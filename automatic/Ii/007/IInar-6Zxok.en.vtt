00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.119
 we have a seashore around 1 4 after which 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.079
 bears were done guys 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.570
 such as at least 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.310

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.289

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.159
 more important points 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.079
 last in the eagle 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.189

 last fall area 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.220

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.050

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.050
 what tons 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.620
 we got confirmation 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.300
 that it depends on many articles 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 well done is on the chilean side of the andes 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.190
 the researchers 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.710
 run the plants 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.270
 from April 20 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.710
 most likely last year exactly 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.710

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.210
 that's all 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.490

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.490
 in scale damage 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.320
 no sign of life 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 take photos or take samples 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 can't imagine what this evening 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.020
 it means you are not a summer resident 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.310
