what you want but but when you look at

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.900 
what you want but but when you look at
what<00:01:01.300> we<00:01:01.510> was<00:01:01.660> able<00:01:01.809> to<00:01:02.109> do<00:01:02.379> we<00:01:03.160> addressed<00:01:03.730> a

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
what we was able to do we addressed a

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.480 
what we was able to do we addressed a
lot<00:01:04.119> of<00:01:04.269> area<00:01:04.660> that<00:01:04.869> I<00:01:04.899> think<00:01:04.989> that<00:01:05.440> in<00:01:06.340> order

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
lot of area that I think that in order

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.820 
lot of area that I think that in order
to<00:01:06.729> have<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.940> good<00:01:07.210> football<00:01:07.600> team<00:01:07.630> those<00:01:08.619> the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
to have a good football team those the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.380 
to have a good football team those the
people<00:01:09.070> that<00:01:09.190> you<00:01:09.340> got<00:01:09.460> put<00:01:09.700> in<00:01:09.820> place<00:01:10.090> and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
people that you got put in place and

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.139 
people that you got put in place and
that's<00:01:10.479> was<00:01:10.899> in<00:01:11.649> the<00:01:12.070> trenches<00:01:12.460> on<00:01:12.640> both<00:01:12.850> sides

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
that's was in the trenches on both sides

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.440 
that's was in the trenches on both sides
of<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.479> ball<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:14.770> said<00:01:15.070> I<00:01:15.100> think<00:01:15.909> a<00:01:15.970> total<00:01:16.330> of

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
of the ball we said I think a total of

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.690 
of the ball we said I think a total of
about<00:01:16.509> eleven<00:01:16.720> guys<00:01:17.200> that<00:01:18.189> either<00:01:18.369> played

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
about eleven guys that either played

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.940 
about eleven guys that either played
offensive<00:01:19.000> offensive<00:01:19.540> line<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.560> I<00:01:20.890> think

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
offensive offensive line and I think

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.700 
offensive offensive line and I think
that<00:01:21.250> inner<00:01:21.549> self<00:01:21.820> addressed<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:23.170> most<00:01:23.380> team

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
that inner self addressed what most team

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.450 
that inner self addressed what most team
would<00:01:23.950> like<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.310> hell<00:01:24.520> is<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:25.750> fumble<00:01:26.560> trenches

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
would like the hell is a fumble trenches

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.789 
would like the hell is a fumble trenches
on<00:01:27.610> both<00:01:27.790> sides<00:01:28.090> of<00:01:28.299> ball<00:01:28.450> we<00:01:28.689> did<00:01:28.900> that<00:01:29.200> with

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
on both sides of ball we did that with

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.310 
on both sides of ball we did that with
some<00:01:30.100> athletic<00:01:30.880> guys<00:01:31.060> I<00:01:31.390> think<00:01:31.689> that's<00:01:32.140> what

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
some athletic guys I think that's what

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.960 
some athletic guys I think that's what
we<00:01:32.439> was<00:01:32.560> missing<00:01:32.979> more<00:01:33.159> than<00:01:33.189> anything<00:01:33.490> was

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
we was missing more than anything was

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.740 
we was missing more than anything was
some<00:01:34.659> peer<00:01:35.079> athletic<00:01:36.090> interior<00:01:37.090> guys<00:01:37.299> and<00:01:37.689> I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
some peer athletic interior guys and I

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.179 
some peer athletic interior guys and I
think<00:01:37.990> we<00:01:38.110> were<00:01:38.229> fortunate<00:01:38.530> enough<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.890> do

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
think we were fortunate enough to do

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.810 
think we were fortunate enough to do
that<00:01:39.450> coach<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:40.720> know<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.710> seeds<00:01:42.220> offseason

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
that coach I know the seeds offseason

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.429 
that coach I know the seeds offseason
had<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.000> coaching<00:01:43.659> change<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:44.020> defensive
