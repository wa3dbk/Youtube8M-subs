00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.029
 don't you want to be a concrete mixer when you 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.680

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.739
 start removing the concrete tank 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.550
 because in its place will be a huge crane and 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.980
 the platform is also no longer useful 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.920
