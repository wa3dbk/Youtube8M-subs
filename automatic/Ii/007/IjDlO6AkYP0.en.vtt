by Nico you da Gama SOA watch organizer
so<00:00:26.369> Nico<00:00:26.670> first<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.090> all<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.210> think<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.539> lot<00:00:27.570> of

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
so Nico first of all I think a lot of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.300 
so Nico first of all I think a lot of
people<00:00:27.840> might<00:00:28.230> not<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.529> familiar<00:00:28.710> with<00:00:29.039> these

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
people might not be familiar with these

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.919 
people might not be familiar with these
massacres<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.090> think<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.630> would<00:00:30.900> be

happening in Colombia the the justice
system<00:04:02.670> is<00:04:02.970> very<00:04:03.180> bogged<00:04:03.959> down<00:04:04.140> with<00:04:04.290> many

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
system is very bogged down with many

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.150 
system is very bogged down with many
many<00:04:06.090> generations<00:04:06.470> of<00:04:07.470> human<00:04:07.709> rights<00:04:07.769> abuses

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
many generations of human rights abuses

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.509 
many generations of human rights abuses
and<00:04:09.019> there's<00:04:10.019> just<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:10.320> lot<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.650> pressure<00:04:11.220> from

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
and there's just a lot of pressure from

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.039 
and there's just a lot of pressure from
the<00:04:11.670> government<00:04:12.060> not<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.239> investigate<00:04:12.780> these

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
the government not to investigate these

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.080 
the government not to investigate these
so<00:04:13.260> it<00:04:13.380> takes<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.739> lot<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:13.980> pressure<00:04:14.760> from<00:04:14.940> the

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
so it takes a lot of pressure from the

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.550 
so it takes a lot of pressure from the
social<00:04:15.450> movements<00:04:15.870> on<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.169> ground<00:04:16.380> in

social movements on the ground in

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.900 
social movements on the ground in
Colombia<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.130> international<00:04:17.729> solidarity

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
Colombia and international solidarity

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.240 
Colombia and international solidarity
movements<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.630> really<00:04:18.870> get<00:04:19.019> these<00:04:19.260> cases

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
movements to really get these cases

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.190 
movements to really get these cases
moving<00:04:20.579> forward<00:04:20.940> well<00:04:21.150> I<00:04:21.180> guess<00:04:21.390> justice<00:04:21.930> is

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
moving forward well I guess justice is

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.870 
moving forward well I guess justice is
better<00:04:22.500> late<00:04:22.860> than<00:04:23.070> never<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.430> guess<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.849> could

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880
