00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.659 

okay<00:00:04.490> so<00:00:04.549> here<00:00:05.210> is<00:00:05.450> the<00:00:05.990> resistor<00:00:06.620> box<00:00:06.830> so<00:00:07.279> the

00:00:07.659 --> 00:00:07.669 
okay so here is the resistor box so the

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.140 
okay so here is the resistor box so the
interface<00:00:08.059> is<00:00:08.330> an<00:00:08.450> old<00:00:08.830> Bulgin<00:00:09.830> plug<00:00:10.150> and

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
interface is an old Bulgin plug and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.209 
interface is an old Bulgin plug and
here's<00:00:11.449> the<00:00:11.629> directions<00:00:12.320> and<00:00:12.650> here's<00:00:13.039> the

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
here's the directions and here's the

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.430 
here's the directions and here's the
switches<00:00:13.670> and<00:00:13.910> really<00:00:14.180> all<00:00:14.299> these<00:00:14.480> are<00:00:14.750> is<00:00:15.379> a

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
switches and really all these are is a

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.330 
switches and really all these are is a
bunch<00:00:15.740> of<00:00:15.859> resistors<00:00:16.219> that<00:00:16.789> are<00:00:17.210> set<00:00:17.859> I<00:00:18.859> guess

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
bunch of resistors that are set I guess

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.160 
bunch of resistors that are set I guess
in<00:00:19.550> series<00:00:19.910> with<00:00:20.120> each<00:00:20.150> other<00:00:20.600> they're

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
in series with each other they're

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.370 
in series with each other they're
switchable<00:00:21.620> in<00:00:21.740> and<00:00:21.890> out<00:00:21.980> of<00:00:22.130> that<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:23.380> this

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
switchable in and out of that and this

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.930 
switchable in and out of that and this
is<00:00:24.560> how<00:00:24.680> it<00:00:24.800> works<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.250> if<00:00:25.340> you<00:00:25.430> switched<00:00:25.760> on

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
is how it works so if you switched on

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.460 
is how it works so if you switched on
like<00:00:26.180> one<00:00:26.420> and<00:00:26.570> two<00:00:26.660> you'd<00:00:26.990> have<00:00:27.140> a<00:00:27.170> hundred

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
like one and two you'd have a hundred

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.439 
like one and two you'd have a hundred
and<00:00:27.650> seventy<00:00:28.039> five<00:00:28.180> K<00:00:29.180> or<00:00:29.600> skinny<00:00:29.930> 175<00:00:30.650> ohms

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
and seventy five K or skinny 175 ohms

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.119 
and seventy five K or skinny 175 ohms
you<00:00:32.449> know<00:00:32.539> in<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.899> circuit<00:00:33.289> so<00:00:33.710> what<00:00:33.949> does<00:00:34.039> it

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
you know in the circuit so what does it

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.860 
you know in the circuit so what does it
look<00:00:34.160> like<00:00:34.280> on<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.699> back<00:00:34.850> well<00:00:35.510> with<00:00:35.780> the

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
look like on the back well with the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.229 
look like on the back well with the
cover<00:00:36.109> off<00:00:36.350> what<00:00:37.190> you<00:00:37.339> got<00:00:37.519> is<00:00:37.850> you<00:00:38.089> got<00:00:38.210> a

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
cover off what you got is you got a

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.809 
cover off what you got is you got a
whole<00:00:38.539> bunch<00:00:39.319> of<00:00:39.499> resistors<00:00:39.980> on<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:40.309> heatsink

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:40.819 
whole bunch of resistors on the heatsink

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:42.729 
whole bunch of resistors on the heatsink
and<00:00:41.120> a<00:00:41.629> whole<00:00:41.780> bunch<00:00:41.809> of<00:00:42.170> double<00:00:42.530> pole<00:00:42.710> double

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
and a whole bunch of double pole double

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.739 
and a whole bunch of double pole double
throw<00:00:43.010> switches<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.149> what<00:00:44.569> are<00:00:44.659> these

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:44.749 
throw switches so what are these

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.259 
throw switches so what are these
resistors<00:00:45.399> well<00:00:46.399> starting<00:00:46.789> from<00:00:46.969> left<00:00:47.149> to

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
resistors well starting from left to

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.879 
resistors well starting from left to
right<00:00:47.479> there<00:00:47.749> you<00:00:47.899> got<00:00:48.019> a<00:00:48.219> 1.5<00:00:49.219> K<00:00:49.579> a<00:00:49.609> 1k<00:00:50.239> a<00:00:50.899> 680

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:51.889 
right there you got a 1.5 K a 1k a 680

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:54.579 
right there you got a 1.5 K a 1k a 680
ohm<00:00:51.979> of<00:00:52.309> 560<00:00:52.879> ohm<00:00:53.059> a<00:00:53.179> 470<00:00:53.929> ohm<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.319> those<00:00:54.440> are

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
ohm of 560 ohm a 470 ohm and those are

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.189 
ohm of 560 ohm a 470 ohm and those are
all<00:00:54.710> are<00:00:55.039> called<00:00:55.280> 50<00:00:55.879> watt<00:00:56.059> chassis<00:00:56.960> mount

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
all are called 50 watt chassis mount

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.449 
all are called 50 watt chassis mount
resistors<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.219> then<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:58.969> one<00:00:59.210> right<00:00:59.449> here

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:00.459 
resistors and then this one right here

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:06.160 
resistors and then this one right here
that's<00:01:01.459> the<00:01:03.309> 75<00:01:04.309> ohm<00:01:04.840> resistor<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:05.870> this

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
that's the 75 ohm resistor and this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.840 
that's the 75 ohm resistor and this
one's<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.500> hundred<00:01:06.799> ohm<00:01:07.070> resistor<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.729> those

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
one's the hundred ohm resistor and those

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.469 
one's the hundred ohm resistor and those
are<00:01:07.969> both<00:01:08.060> Daly's<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:08.780> they're<00:01:08.869> 25<00:01:09.350> watts<00:01:10.479> so

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
are both Daly's and they're 25 watts so

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.510 
are both Daly's and they're 25 watts so
what<00:01:11.689> is<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.930> test<00:01:12.140> subject<00:01:12.619> okay<00:01:13.009> well<00:01:13.280> here

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
what is the test subject okay well here

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.350 
what is the test subject okay well here
we<00:01:13.640> have<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.789> fairly<00:01:14.119> nondescript<00:01:14.509> jcm<00:01:15.469> 900<00:01:16.360> for

turned into a four hole super lead it's

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.490 
turned into a four hole super lead it's
point-to-point<00:01:39.500> inside<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:41.200> this<00:01:42.200> is<00:01:42.380> what

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
point-to-point inside and this is what

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.010 
point-to-point inside and this is what
it<00:01:42.590> looks<00:01:42.740> like<00:01:42.920> on<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.250> back<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:43.880> really<00:01:44.240> it's

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
it looks like on the back so really it's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.349 
it looks like on the back so really it's
about<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.350> stock<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:45.920> stock<00:01:46.159> can<00:01:46.369> get<00:01:46.579> I<00:01:46.789> know

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
about a stock to stock can get I know

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:48.819 
about a stock to stock can get I know
that<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.749> mains<00:01:47.960> transformer<00:01:48.649> has<00:01:48.710> been

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
that the mains transformer has been

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:49.539 
that the mains transformer has been
replaced

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
replaced

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.340 
replaced
probably<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:50.270> output<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.749> transformer<00:01:51.289> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
probably the output to transformer and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.469 
probably the output to transformer and
obviously<00:01:51.679> the<00:01:52.219> caps<00:01:52.579> are<00:01:52.759> not<00:01:52.969> original<00:01:53.390> as

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
obviously the caps are not original as

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.679 
obviously the caps are not original as
well<00:01:53.630> these<00:01:54.499> are<00:01:54.679> just<00:01:54.859> some<00:01:55.299> el34s<00:01:56.299> that<00:01:56.630> I

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
well these are just some el34s that I

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.380 
well these are just some el34s that I
got<00:01:56.840> from<00:01:57.049> I<00:01:57.439> guess<00:01:57.829> lured<00:01:58.070> valve<00:01:58.340> or<00:01:58.609> somebody

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
got from I guess lured valve or somebody

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.209 
got from I guess lured valve or somebody
like<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.600> now<00:02:00.499> here's<00:02:00.799> how<00:02:00.979> we're<00:02:01.130> getting

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
like that now here's how we're getting

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.370 
like that now here's how we're getting
to<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.609> pin<00:02:01.789> threes<00:02:02.119> we<00:02:02.299> could<00:02:02.509> solder<00:02:03.170> them

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
to the pin threes we could solder them

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.080 
to the pin threes we could solder them
underneath<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.950> chassis<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.399> course<00:02:04.729> and

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
underneath the chassis of course and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.700 
underneath the chassis of course and
bring<00:02:05.210> them<00:02:05.719> bring<00:02:05.840> them<00:02:05.990> out<00:02:06.079> through<00:02:06.289> there

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
bring them bring them out through there

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.639 
bring them bring them out through there
yeah<00:02:07.130> it's<00:02:07.280> not<00:02:07.429> so<00:02:07.609> good<00:02:07.750> so<00:02:08.750> here<00:02:09.289> are<00:02:09.440> some

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
yeah it's not so good so here are some

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.850 
yeah it's not so good so here are some
old<00:02:09.940> octal<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.240> test<00:02:11.630> basis<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.380> then<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.650> can

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
old octal to test basis and then you can

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.600 
old octal to test basis and then you can
see<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.190> they<00:02:13.250> each<00:02:13.370> have<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.610> little<00:02:13.670> teeny

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
see that they each have a little teeny

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.430 
see that they each have a little teeny
little<00:02:14.970> place<00:02:15.660> where<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.020> stick<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.230> pin

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
little place where you can stick a pin

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.150 
little place where you can stick a pin
ha<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:17.280> it's<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.520> thin<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.390> those<00:02:19.020> are<00:02:19.260> 364

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
ha but it's so thin so those are 364

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.870 
ha but it's so thin so those are 364
inch<00:02:20.400> drill<00:02:20.580> bits<00:02:20.790> stuck<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.150> there<00:02:21.300> safe<00:02:21.960> huh

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
inch drill bits stuck in there safe huh

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.040 
inch drill bits stuck in there safe huh
then<00:02:23.880> what<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.150> do<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.420> we<00:02:24.540> hook<00:02:24.690> up<00:02:24.840> these

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
then what we do is we hook up these

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.530 
then what we do is we hook up these
alligator<00:02:25.710> clips<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:27.090> other<00:02:27.240> end<00:02:27.450> of

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
alligator clips to it the other end of

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.720 
alligator clips to it the other end of
this<00:02:27.660> wire<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:28.260> course<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.640> other<00:02:30.410> bullion

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
this wire of course is the other bullion

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.430 
this wire of course is the other bullion
plug<00:02:32.730> or<00:02:32.910> whatever<00:02:33.210> that<00:02:33.600> goes<00:02:33.780> into<00:02:34.050> the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
plug or whatever that goes into the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.560 
plug or whatever that goes into the
resistor<00:02:34.920> box<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.030> only<00:02:36.150> reason<00:02:36.330> why<00:02:36.540> I

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
resistor box and the only reason why I

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.810 
resistor box and the only reason why I
use<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.080> plug<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.500> because<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.160> thought<00:02:38.670> it

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
use that plug is because I thought it

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.620 
use that plug is because I thought it
was<00:02:38.940> trendy

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
was trendy

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.620 
was trendy
so<00:02:40.050> let's<00:02:40.260> hook<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.440> up<00:02:40.670> okay<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.090> now<00:02:42.420> we're

don't try this at home this is really

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.820 
don't try this at home this is really
stupid<00:03:02.190> because<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:03.570> was<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.230> might<00:03:04.590> be

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
stupid because this was this might be

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.410 
stupid because this was this might be
what<00:03:05.040> would<00:03:05.130> happen<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.730> if<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:06.120> screw<00:03:06.390> up

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
what would happen to you if you screw up

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.910 
what would happen to you if you screw up
you<00:03:06.870> might<00:03:07.020> end<00:03:07.200> up<00:03:07.260> looking<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.590> Kenny

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
you might end up looking like Kenny

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.490 
you might end up looking like Kenny
Chesney<00:03:08.370> fate<00:03:08.820> worse<00:03:09.030> than<00:03:09.060> death<00:03:09.300> so<00:03:10.140> let's

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
Chesney fate worse than death so let's

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.610 
Chesney fate worse than death so let's
try<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.800> here

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
try it here

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
try it here
I've<00:03:13.620> got<00:03:14.450> looks<00:03:15.450> like<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.760> 560<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.640> 470

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
I've got looks like the the 560 the 470

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.789 
I've got looks like the the 560 the 470
and<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.820> hundred<00:03:21.120> ohm<00:03:21.239> kicked<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.810> which

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
and the hundred ohm kicked in which

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:23.930 
and the hundred ohm kicked in which
doesn't<00:03:23.160> make<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> lot<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.549> sense

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
doesn't make a lot of sense

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.330 
doesn't make a lot of sense
maybe<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.630> wired<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.110> wrong<00:03:25.350> anyways<00:03:25.830> there's

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
maybe I wired it wrong anyways there's

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.130 
maybe I wired it wrong anyways there's
resistors<00:03:26.820> in<00:03:27.000> there<00:03:27.180> between<00:03:27.299> amp<00:03:27.660> injuries

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
resistors in there between amp injuries

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.990 
resistors in there between amp injuries
we're<00:03:29.040> gonna<00:03:29.160> play<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:30.019> with<00:03:31.019> this<00:03:31.970> warmoth

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
we're gonna play this with this warmoth

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.210 
we're gonna play this with this warmoth
thing<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.720> built<00:03:33.989> which<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:34.769> fairly

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
thing that I built which is fairly

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.610 
thing that I built which is fairly
nondescript<00:03:35.400> that's<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.120> Gibson<00:03:36.780> pickup<00:03:37.290> some

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
nondescript that's a Gibson pickup some

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.520 
nondescript that's a Gibson pickup some
sort<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.070> picked<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.370> up<00:03:38.459> at<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:39.140> music<00:03:40.140> shop<00:03:40.320> here

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
sort I picked it up at a music shop here

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.650 
sort I picked it up at a music shop here
in<00:03:40.560> Nashville<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.880> anyways<00:03:42.269> this<00:03:42.390> junk

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
in Nashville and so anyways this junk

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.030 
in Nashville and so anyways this junk
that<00:03:42.840> pickups<00:03:43.230> not<00:03:43.350> even<00:03:43.530> hooked<00:03:43.680> up<00:03:43.830> it's

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
that pickups not even hooked up it's

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.740 
that pickups not even hooked up it's
just<00:03:44.220> there<00:03:44.370> for<00:03:44.580> looks<00:03:44.730> cuz<00:03:45.060> I'm<00:03:45.209> too<00:03:45.360> lazy<00:03:45.570> to

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
just there for looks cuz I'm too lazy to

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.520 
just there for looks cuz I'm too lazy to
fix<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.709> Kenny

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
fix it Kenny

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.560 
fix it Kenny
alright<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:49.860> here<00:03:50.400> we<00:03:50.430> go<00:03:50.519> so<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.239> is<00:03:51.299> what<00:03:51.480> it

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
alright so here we go so this is what it

00:03:51.570 --> 00:05:27.059 
alright so here we go so this is what it
sounds<00:03:51.810> like

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.019 

so<00:05:28.069> that's<00:05:28.249> pretty<00:05:28.489> much<00:05:28.639> what<00:05:28.879> it<00:05:28.999> sounds

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029 
so that's pretty much what it sounds

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.989 
so that's pretty much what it sounds
like<00:05:30.339> there<00:05:31.339> you<00:05:31.459> have<00:05:31.669> it

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:31.999 
like there you have it

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.359 
like there you have it
serums<00:05:32.509> mod<00:05:32.689> and<00:05:33.079> it's<00:05:33.469> somewhat

00:05:34.359 --> 00:05:34.369 
serums mod and it's somewhat

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:39.519 
serums mod and it's somewhat
unadulterated<00:05:35.239> glory<00:05:36.309> so<00:05:37.309> this<00:05:37.489> is<00:05:38.409> with<00:05:39.409> no

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:39.529 
unadulterated glory so this is with no

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:41.529 
unadulterated glory so this is with no
effects<00:05:39.889> there's<00:05:40.459> no<00:05:40.699> phase<00:05:40.909> 90<00:05:41.089> there's<00:05:41.419> no

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
effects there's no phase 90 there's no

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.989 
effects there's no phase 90 there's no
flans<00:05:41.899> there's<00:05:42.259> no<00:05:42.379> Echoplex<00:05:42.849> there's<00:05:43.849> no

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:43.999 
flans there's no Echoplex there's no

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:45.669 
flans there's no Echoplex there's no
mysterious<00:05:44.360> capacitor<00:05:45.199> that<00:05:45.349> I<00:05:45.439> don't<00:05:45.589> know

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:45.679 
mysterious capacitor that I don't know

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.319 
mysterious capacitor that I don't know
what<00:05:45.799> it<00:05:45.919> does<00:05:45.949> there's<00:05:46.429> no<00:05:46.549> very<00:05:46.819> act<00:05:47.089> about

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:47.329 
what it does there's no very act about

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:49.029 
what it does there's no very act about
running<00:05:47.659> this<00:05:47.749> at<00:05:47.929> 90<00:05:48.169> volts<00:05:48.349> I'm<00:05:48.619> running<00:05:48.919> it

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
running this at 90 volts I'm running it

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:55.689 
running this at 90 volts I'm running it
out<00:05:49.249> of<00:05:49.519> that<00:05:50.209> they're<00:05:51.459> crushing<00:05:52.459> plug<00:05:54.399> so<00:05:55.399> I

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
out of that they're crushing plug so I

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.669 
out of that they're crushing plug so I
think<00:05:55.999> what<00:05:56.209> I'll<00:05:56.329> probably<00:05:56.449> do<00:05:56.929> is<00:05:56.959> we'll<00:05:57.499> use

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:57.679 
think what I'll probably do is we'll use

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:59.199 
think what I'll probably do is we'll use
this<00:05:57.829> as<00:05:57.889> sort<00:05:58.339> of<00:05:58.459> like<00:05:58.549> a<00:05:58.579> base<00:05:58.909> reference

00:05:59.199 --> 00:05:59.209 
this as sort of like a base reference

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:01.929 
this as sort of like a base reference
tone<00:05:59.659> and<00:05:59.929> then<00:06:00.019> I'll<00:06:00.139> drag<00:06:00.409> the<00:06:00.739> old<00:06:01.489> crappy

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:01.939 
tone and then I'll drag the old crappy

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:03.579 
tone and then I'll drag the old crappy
pedal<00:06:02.239> board<00:06:02.389> over<00:06:02.629> here<00:06:02.839> from<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:03.289> practice

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:03.589 
pedal board over here from the practice

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:06.399 
pedal board over here from the practice
area<00:06:03.739> and<00:06:04.189> then<00:06:04.969> we'll<00:06:05.779> try<00:06:05.989> out<00:06:06.079> with<00:06:06.229> some

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
area and then we'll try out with some

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:07.959 
area and then we'll try out with some
effects<00:06:06.739> and<00:06:07.039> see<00:06:07.279> if<00:06:07.339> we<00:06:07.429> can<00:06:07.549> get<00:06:07.639> a<00:06:07.669> little

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969 
effects and see if we can get a little

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.409 
effects and see if we can get a little
closer<00:06:08.629> to<00:06:08.959> yon<00:06:09.649> Brown<00:06:09.979> sound<00:06:10.399> and<00:06:10.849> everything

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
closer to yon Brown sound and everything

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.579 
closer to yon Brown sound and everything
and<00:06:11.719> so<00:06:12.259> anyways<00:06:12.679> hope<00:06:13.249> you<00:06:13.309> enjoyed
