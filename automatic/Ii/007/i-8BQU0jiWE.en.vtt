00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 11 2 0 that would be enough for the second leg 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.340
 because no away gegentor cashed 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.570
 if we meet again 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.889
 we should get a good one 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.200
 provide starting position 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.320
 that's right what do we take with us 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.300
 All in all , it's just like that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.400
 I think it's always important 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.680
 to watch how it works 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.260
 All in all what you want what 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.550
 one gives out beforehand we have in 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.349
 Koblenz saw that so much too far 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.910
 have stood apart then so 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.869
 the back four chain was way too far 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.329
 away from the six 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.630
 that was much better in both games 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.350
 against sends that and also now 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.000
 here today in the vertical play what 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.070
 already much better than in the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Last season does not stop that yet 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.530
 everything is still running 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.899
 There are also voting problems 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.149
 quite normal but I believe that it 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.670
 Two very good opponents have been opponents 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.219
 are and be satisfied for the two 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.809
 can get a bit tired playing today 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.250
 one had the impression but normal 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.859
 because it is only to the end of the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.199
 We went to training campers 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.790
 Yesterday a lot done that one has 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.780
 shut up with one or the other 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.159
 It's always like that in the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.750
 preparation there is the one or 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.010
 others just to different 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.130
 then time points stop also times by a 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.780
 small deep the spurt is now 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.080
 not decide yet or not 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.940
 important and 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.740
 you have to it all now a 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.480
 then imagine a bit more sparkling then 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.670
 will certainly be even better 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.260
 be christa krementz today 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.730
 damn lively I found when he was 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.310
 even faster then it is good 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.330
 Having prepared two goals he has a lot 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.950
 goes well when he arrived and that 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.750
 Of course, that takes you a step 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.340
 further and joy and it pleases me 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.110
 of course , that he will stop too 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.110
 could put these short accents 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.789
 yes gives already such a short conclusion of the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.799
 training camps and still too early 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.020
 He would rather wait for tomorrow 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.920
 highlight blue white night and from there 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.920
 you should wait for that
