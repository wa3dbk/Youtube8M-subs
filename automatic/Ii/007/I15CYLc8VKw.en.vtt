00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.740 
want to take is the heel to toe the heel
to<00:00:40.110> toe<00:00:40.260> measurement<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:42.360> easiest

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
to toe measurement is the easiest

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.819 
to toe measurement is the easiest
measurement<00:00:43.379> you're<00:00:43.500> going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> look

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
measurement you're going to look

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.430 
measurement you're going to look
directly<00:00:44.129> down<00:00:44.450> on<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.629> patient's<00:00:46.050> foot<00:00:46.260> as

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
directly down on the patient's foot as

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.810 
directly down on the patient's foot as
an<00:00:46.710> angle<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.340> cause<00:00:47.870> miss<00:00:48.870> reading<00:00:49.350> in

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
an angle can cause miss reading in

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.420 
an angle can cause miss reading in
reading<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.149> I'm<00:00:51.449> reading<00:00:51.870> her<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.860> six

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
reading this I'm reading her as a six

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.000 
reading this I'm reading her as a six
and<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.699> half<00:00:53.879> plus<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.570> mean<00:00:55.020> she's<00:00:55.260> over<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.770> six

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and a half plus I mean she's over to six

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.139 
and a half plus I mean she's over to six
and<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> half<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.640> she's<00:00:56.789> not<00:00:56.940> point<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.420> seven

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
and a half but she's not point to seven

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.580 
and a half but she's not point to seven
now<00:01:00.149> we're<00:01:00.239> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> measure<00:01:00.570> her<00:01:00.899> heel<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
now we're going to measure her heel the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.609 
now we're going to measure her heel the
ball<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.160> I'm<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.359> slide<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.290> arch

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
ball and I'm going to slide the arch

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.560 
ball and I'm going to slide the arch
length<00:01:04.920> indicator<00:01:05.519> up<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> widest

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
length indicator up to the widest

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.960 
length indicator up to the widest
portion<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.260> her<00:01:07.409> foot<00:01:07.650> at<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.920> first<00:01:08.159> mpj

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
portion of her foot at this first mpj

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.230 
portion of her foot at this first mpj
I'm<00:01:09.840> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.470> make<00:01:10.650> sure<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.159> I'm<00:01:11.340> getting

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
I'm going to make sure that I'm getting

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.539 
I'm going to make sure that I'm getting
it<00:01:12.360> dead-on<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.650> I'm<00:01:13.770> measuring<00:01:14.010> her<00:01:14.340> arch

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
it dead-on and so I'm measuring her arch

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.090 
it dead-on and so I'm measuring her arch
length<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.150> seven<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.770> her<00:01:16.920> heel

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
length as a seven this is her heel

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.499 
length as a seven this is her heel
de-ball<00:01:17.430> measurement<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
de-ball measurement and what this is

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
de-ball measurement and what this is
doing<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.140> taking<00:01:19.320> her<00:01:19.740> arch<00:01:20.040> and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
doing is it's taking her arch and

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.580 
doing is it's taking her arch and
putting<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> predetermined<00:01:22.170> arch<00:01:22.380> of

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
putting it in the predetermined arch of

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.039 
putting it in the predetermined arch of
the<00:01:22.619> shoe<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.700> putting<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> widest<00:01:24.780> portion

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the shoe it's putting the widest portion

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.190 
the shoe it's putting the widest portion
of<00:01:25.500> her<00:01:25.740> foot<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.850> widest<00:01:27.420> portion<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:28.049> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
of her foot at the widest portion of the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.069 
of her foot at the widest portion of the
shoe<00:01:28.670> it's<00:01:29.670> also<00:01:29.850> allowing<00:01:30.270> her<00:01:30.570> foot<00:01:30.869> where

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
shoe it's also allowing her foot where

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.280 
shoe it's also allowing her foot where
it<00:01:31.170> bends<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.770> flexes<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:33.329> sit<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.020> part

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
it bends and flexes to sit in the part

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.020 
it bends and flexes to sit in the part
of<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> shoe<00:01:34.740> that's<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.369> bend<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.850> flex

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
of the shoe that's one to bend and flex

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.690 
of the shoe that's one to bend and flex
so<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.259> put<00:01:37.500> her<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.860> shoe<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.310> too

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
so if I put her on a shoe that's too

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.270 
so if I put her on a shoe that's too
short<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.229> put<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.560> up<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
short it's going to put it up here and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.609 
short it's going to put it up here and
is<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.909> feel<00:01:42.090> too<00:01:42.270> tight<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.409> put

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
is going to feel too tight and if I put

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.960 
is going to feel too tight and if I put
her<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.860> shoe<00:01:44.130> that's<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.399> little<00:01:44.610> too<00:01:44.759> long

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
her on a shoe that's a little too long

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.639 
her on a shoe that's a little too long
it's<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> put<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.840> further<00:01:46.049> back<00:01:46.350> so

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
it's going to put it further back so

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.789 
it's going to put it further back so
this<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:48.119> oftentimes<00:01:48.780> you'll<00:01:48.990> notice<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
this here oftentimes you'll notice that

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.319 
this here oftentimes you'll notice that
on<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> patient<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> house<00:01:50.820> valgus

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
on a patient with a house valgus

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.600 
on a patient with a house valgus
deformity<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:52.079> judy<00:01:52.439> has<00:01:52.619> you're<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
deformity as judy has you're going to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.639 
deformity as judy has you're going to
find<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.000> longer<00:01:54.299> healed<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.810> ball<00:01:54.990> length<00:01:55.290> than

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
find a longer healed a ball length than

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.819 
find a longer healed a ball length than
the<00:01:55.799> heel<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.130> toe<00:01:56.280> length<00:01:56.659> so<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:58.140> example<00:01:58.590> if

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829

first<00:02:11.489> would<00:02:11.819> not<00:02:12.000> mean<00:02:12.269> that<00:02:12.299> I<00:02:12.450> could<00:02:12.659> fit

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
first would not mean that I could fit

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.309 
first would not mean that I could fit
into<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.080> child-size<00:02:13.709> glove<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.849> in<00:02:15.750> patients

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
into a child-size glove so in patients

instep have not changed and so they

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.339 
instep have not changed and so they
would<00:02:25.590> still<00:02:25.920> need<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.580> adult<00:02:26.940> size<00:02:27.450> glove<00:02:28.079> or

touching the foot when I'm squeezing it
too<00:02:41.069> tightly<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.700> also<00:02:42.239> keep<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.930> heel<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
too tightly I also keep the heel the

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.009 
too tightly I also keep the heel the

ball indicator position doesn't work I'm

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.110 
ball indicator position doesn't work I'm
looking<00:02:46.739> at<00:02:46.950> her<00:02:47.160> heel<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.489> toe<00:02:47.670> which<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.090> a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
looking at her heel to toe which is a

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.119 
looking at her heel to toe which is a
six<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.599> half<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:49.140> I'm<00:02:49.650> finding<00:02:49.950> that

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
six and a half and I'm finding that

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.979 
six and a half and I'm finding that
across<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:51.000> bar

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
across the bar

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.920 
across the bar
I<00:02:52.019> find<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> six<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.459> half<00:02:53.489> here<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.209> that

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
I find the six and a half here and that

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.380 
I find the six and a half here and that
then<00:02:55.200> relates<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> width<00:02:56.579> measurement<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.239> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
then relates to a width measurement of a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.050 
then relates to a width measurement of a
C<00:02:57.690> now<00:02:58.379> if<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.709> were<00:02:58.859> in<00:02:59.069> between<00:02:59.250> two<00:02:59.819> I

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
C now if that were in between two I

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.830 
C now if that were in between two I
would<00:03:00.269> mark<00:03:00.569> that<00:03:00.780> C<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.349> be<00:03:01.530> or<00:03:02.540> whatever<00:03:03.540> that

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
would mark that C to be or whatever that

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.979 
would mark that C to be or whatever that
would<00:03:03.959> be<00:03:04.190> now<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.970> measurement<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.750> two

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
would be now this measurement is a two

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.899 
would be now this measurement is a two
dimensional<00:03:07.140> measurement<00:03:07.980> it's<00:03:08.489> measuring

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
dimensional measurement it's measuring

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.059 
dimensional measurement it's measuring
her<00:03:09.060> foot<00:03:09.299> size<00:03:09.510> another<00:03:09.780> shoe<00:03:10.049> size<00:03:10.349> it's

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
her foot size another shoe size it's

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.789 
her foot size another shoe size it's
also<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.790> proportion<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.540> her<00:03:12.840> length<00:03:13.109> so<00:03:13.560> if

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
also in proportion to her length so if

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.339 
also in proportion to her length so if
she<00:03:14.010> were<00:03:14.159> to<00:03:14.310> measure<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.819> nine<00:03:15.480> for<00:03:15.900> instance

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
she were to measure a nine for instance

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.440 
she were to measure a nine for instance
and<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.769> look<00:03:16.950> at<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.160> nine<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.700> would<00:03:18.150> say<00:03:18.269> that

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
and I look at the nine I would say that

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.420 
and I look at the nine I would say that
the<00:03:18.540> nine<00:03:18.720> she<00:03:19.470> would<00:03:19.590> be<00:03:19.739> measuring<00:03:20.099> an<00:03:20.250> a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
the nine she would be measuring an a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.360 
the nine she would be measuring an a
width<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.000> if<00:03:21.450> she<00:03:21.599> measured<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.049> five<00:03:22.349> a<00:03:22.889> five

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
width and if she measured a five a five

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.599 
width and if she measured a five a five
would<00:03:23.609> be<00:03:23.730> measuring<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.239> D<00:03:24.450> with<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.609> next

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
measure between a five and a six

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.150 
measure between a five and a six
most<00:03:54.569> men<00:03:54.870> usually<00:03:55.290> measure<00:03:55.470> between<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.859> six

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
most men usually measure between a six

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.309 
most men usually measure between a six
and<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.370> seven<00:03:56.760> this<00:03:57.269> helps<00:03:57.569> us<00:03:57.629> give<00:03:57.840> an<00:03:57.959> idea

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
and a seven this helps us give an idea

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.240 
and a seven this helps us give an idea
of<00:03:58.530> how<00:03:58.709> thick<00:03:59.099> or<00:03:59.310> Grothe<00:03:59.879> the<00:04:00.030> foot<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:01.250> to

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
of how thick or Grothe the foot is to

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.900 
of how thick or Grothe the foot is to
get<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.400> better<00:04:02.609> three-dimensional<00:04:03.599> idea<00:04:04.910> on

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
get a better three-dimensional idea on

get a better three-dimensional idea on
patients<00:04:06.449> that<00:04:06.510> are<00:04:06.690> wearing<00:04:06.959> an<00:04:07.049> AFO<00:04:07.500> you

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
patients that are wearing an AFO you

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.229 
patients that are wearing an AFO you
want<00:04:07.980> to<00:04:08.069> do<00:04:08.160> all<00:04:08.400> your<00:04:08.669> measurements<00:04:08.819> without

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
want to do all your measurements without

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.000 
want to do all your measurements without
the<00:04:09.510> brace<00:04:09.720> first<00:04:10.049> but<00:04:10.440> do<00:04:10.590> one<00:04:10.829> more

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
the brace first but do one more

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.730 
the brace first but do one more
measurement<00:04:11.400> with<00:04:11.609> a<00:04:11.639> brace<00:04:11.940> on<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.540> ever

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
measurement with a brace on and ever

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.320 
measurement with a brace on and ever
is<00:04:13.800> going<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.040> be<00:04:14.100> a<00:04:14.130> heel<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.610> toe<00:04:14.790> measurement

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
is going to be a heel to toe measurement

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.430 
is going to be a heel to toe measurement
so<00:04:15.900> I'm<00:04:16.650> measuring<00:04:17.130> her<00:04:17.310> heel<00:04:17.550> to<00:04:17.760> toe<00:04:18.000> as<00:04:18.360> a

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
so I'm measuring her heel to toe as a

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.560 
so I'm measuring her heel to toe as a
seven<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.650> half<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.820> measurement

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
seven and a half and that measurement

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.780 
seven and a half and that measurement
has<00:04:21.870> now<00:04:22.050> changed<00:04:22.410> because<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:22.980> the<00:04:23.220> brace<00:04:23.430> so

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
has now changed because of the brace so

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.250 
has now changed because of the brace so
the<00:04:23.910> posterior<00:04:24.300> aspect<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:24.960> brace<00:04:25.230> is

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
the posterior aspect of the brace is

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.440 
the posterior aspect of the brace is
pushing<00:04:25.800> her<00:04:25.890> forward<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.550> it's<00:04:26.970> changing

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
pushing her forward and it's changing

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.140 
pushing her forward and it's changing
the<00:04:27.570> size<00:04:27.780> shoe<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:28.320> she<00:04:28.470> would<00:04:28.620> need

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
the size shoe that she would need

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.570 
the size shoe that she would need
patients<00:04:30.150> that<00:04:30.360> measure<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.810> size<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:32.250> a<00:04:32.280> size

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
patients that measure a size to a size

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.940 
patients that measure a size to a size
and<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:32.880> half<00:04:32.910> difference<00:04:33.630> I<00:04:33.870> typically<00:04:34.680> don't

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
and a half difference I typically don't

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.920 
and a half difference I typically don't
need<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.280> mixed<00:04:35.700> pair<00:04:35.940> four<00:04:36.270> but<00:04:36.660> if<00:04:36.750> they're

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
need a mixed pair four but if they're

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.230 
need a mixed pair four but if they're
measuring<00:04:37.290> a<00:04:37.350> size<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.860> half<00:04:37.890> or<00:04:38.370> more<00:04:38.400> you

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
measuring a size and a half or more you

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.910 
measuring a size and a half or more you
may<00:04:39.270> want<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.660> consider<00:04:39.990> a<00:04:40.110> mixed<00:04:40.470> pair<00:04:40.740> which

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
may want to consider a mixed pair which

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.530 
may want to consider a mixed pair which
would<00:04:41.070> be<00:04:41.190> two<00:04:41.370> different<00:04:41.520> size<00:04:41.880> shoes<00:04:42.210> to

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
would be two different size shoes to

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.160 
would be two different size shoes to
accommodate<00:04:43.020> two<00:04:43.230> different<00:04:43.560> sized<00:04:43.770> feet
