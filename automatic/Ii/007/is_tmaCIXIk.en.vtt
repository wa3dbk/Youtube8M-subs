a headphone jack dual microphones on the
left<00:06:07.500> side<00:06:07.680> which<00:06:08.220> is<00:06:08.430> really<00:06:08.460> how<00:06:08.970> you

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
left side which is really how you

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.930 
left side which is really how you
distinguish<00:06:09.660> this<00:06:09.870> between<00:06:10.229> the<00:06:10.710> 2014<00:06:11.550> model

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
distinguish this between the 2014 model

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.200 
distinguish this between the 2014 model
and<00:06:12.180> the<00:06:12.360> 2013<00:06:13.140> model<00:06:13.560> because<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.340> 2013

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
and the 2013 model because the 2013

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.540 
and the 2013 model because the 2013
model<00:06:15.390> only<00:06:15.750> has<00:06:16.020> one<00:06:16.440> microphone<00:06:17.040> hole<00:06:17.280> on

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
model only has one microphone hole on

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.420 
model only has one microphone hole on
the<00:06:17.940> left<00:06:17.970> side<00:06:18.360> whereas<00:06:18.870> the<00:06:19.110> 2014<00:06:19.979> model<00:06:20.280> has

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
the left side whereas the 2014 model has

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.219 
the left side whereas the 2014 model has
two<00:06:20.700> of<00:06:20.820> them<00:06:21.000> it<00:06:21.270> also<00:06:21.360> has<00:06:21.570> a<00:06:21.600> map<00:06:21.930> safe

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
two of them it also has a map safe

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.020 
two of them it also has a map safe
connection<00:06:22.740> port<00:06:22.919> used<00:06:23.190> for<00:06:23.460> charging<00:06:23.850> which

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
connection port used for charging which

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.870 
connection port used for charging which
basically<00:06:24.390> means<00:06:24.750> that<00:06:24.990> it<00:06:25.410> is<00:06:25.650> magnetized<00:06:26.400> so

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
basically means that it is magnetized so

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.450 
basically means that it is magnetized so
if<00:06:27.000> someone<00:06:27.270> walks<00:06:27.570> by<00:06:27.720> and<00:06:28.380> rips<00:06:29.040> the<00:06:29.220> cord

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
if someone walks by and rips the cord

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.430 
if someone walks by and rips the cord
out<00:06:29.580> it's<00:06:29.880> not<00:06:30.000> gonna<00:06:30.210> snap<00:06:30.540> the<00:06:30.810> laptop<00:06:31.200> is
