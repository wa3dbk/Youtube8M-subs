a<00:03:08.060> tricky<00:03:08.510> situation

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
a tricky situation

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.030 
a tricky situation
typical<00:03:10.660> driving<00:03:11.660> or<00:03:11.960> riding<00:03:12.040> situation

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
where you look oh there's nobody coming

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.570 
where you look oh there's nobody coming
you<00:03:16.280> nearly<00:03:16.520> stop<00:03:16.910> open<00:03:17.480> up<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.720> buckle<00:03:18.110> again

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
you nearly stop open up the buckle again

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.910 
you nearly stop open up the buckle again
vehicle<00:03:19.580> stays<00:03:19.790> perfectly<00:03:20.570> stable<00:03:20.810> down<00:03:21.590> to

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
vehicle stays perfectly stable down to

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.940 
vehicle stays perfectly stable down to
what<00:03:23.290> five<00:03:24.290> miles<00:03:24.650> per<00:03:24.830> hour<00:03:24.950> or<00:03:25.430> even<00:03:25.700> lower

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.150 

so<00:03:29.550> once<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.910> get<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.740> you<00:03:31.740> hardly<00:03:32.040> use

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
so once you get it you hardly use

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.750 
so once you get it you hardly use
retract<00:03:33.030> anymore<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:35.190> answers<00:03:35.670> your

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
retract anymore that answers your

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.380 
retract anymore that answers your
question<00:03:36.709> are<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.950> retracts<00:03:38.370> automatic<00:03:39.150> no

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
question are the retracts automatic no

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.490 
question are the retracts automatic no
they<00:03:39.750> aren't<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.440> would<00:03:41.069> be<00:03:41.360> annoying<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.840> say

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
they aren't it would be annoying to say

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.000 
they aren't it would be annoying to say
the<00:03:43.680> least<00:03:44.120> they<00:03:45.120> always<00:03:45.390> come<00:03:45.750> down<00:03:45.780> go<00:03:46.709> up

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
the least they always come down go up

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.479 
the least they always come down go up
would<00:03:48.000> make<00:03:48.590> riding<00:03:49.590> really<00:03:50.370> really<00:03:50.760> ugly

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
would make riding really really ugly

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.520 
would make riding really really ugly
this<00:03:53.489> is<00:03:53.700> an<00:03:53.850> elegant<00:03:54.390> vehicle<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.080> we<00:03:55.290> want

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
this is an elegant vehicle and we want

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.400 
this is an elegant vehicle and we want
to<00:03:55.910> use<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.150> in<00:03:57.300> a<00:03:57.420> very<00:03:57.600> elegant<00:03:58.560> way<00:03:58.880> so<00:04:00.410> we

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
to use it in a very elegant way so we

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.509 
to use it in a very elegant way so we
always<00:04:01.590> keep<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.190> feet<00:04:03.180> up

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.490 

let's<00:04:06.090> go<00:04:06.269> looking<00:04:06.600> for<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.780> parking<00:04:07.260> space

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
let's go looking for a parking space

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.380 
let's go looking for a parking space
here

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.690 

I<00:04:16.060> think<00:04:17.060> there<00:04:17.269> is<00:04:17.359> arcing<00:04:17.989> space<00:04:18.290> here

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
I think there is arcing space here

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.400 
I think there is arcing space here
parking<00:04:19.700> spaces<00:04:19.970> are<00:04:20.299> easy<00:04:20.480> to<00:04:20.780> find<00:04:20.930> with<00:04:21.260> the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
parking spaces are easy to find with the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.120 
parking spaces are easy to find with the
monotracer<00:04:21.890> here<00:04:22.340> in<00:04:22.400> Switzerland<00:04:22.580> because

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
monotracer here in Switzerland because

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.050 
monotracer here in Switzerland because
it's<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.310> bike<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:25.940> as<00:04:26.860> long<00:04:27.860> as<00:04:28.160> people<00:04:28.610> can

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
it's a bike and as long as people can

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.950 
it's a bike and as long as people can
still<00:04:29.590> walk<00:04:30.700> through<00:04:32.410> then<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:34.010> can<00:04:34.780> park<00:04:35.780> it

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
still walk through then you can park it

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.520 
still walk through then you can park it
on<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.110> sidewalks<00:04:37.180> I<00:04:38.180> think<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:39.050> rule<00:04:39.260> is

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
on the sidewalks I think the rule is

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.310 
on the sidewalks I think the rule is
that<00:04:39.740> there<00:04:40.040> is<00:04:40.250> at<00:04:40.730> least<00:04:40.970> three<00:04:41.810> or<00:04:42.260> four

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
that there is at least three or four

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.790 
that there is at least three or four
feet<00:04:42.980> of<00:04:43.730> leeway<00:04:44.419> for<00:04:44.720> the<00:04:45.169> people<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.650> walk

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
feet of leeway for the people to walk

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.700 
feet of leeway for the people to walk
through<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:48.370> now<00:04:49.370> there's<00:04:49.840> two<00:04:50.840> metal<00:04:51.290> posts

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
through and now there's two metal posts

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.980 
through and now there's two metal posts
here<00:04:51.860> in<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.130> back<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.180> try<00:04:53.480> to<00:04:53.540> maneuver

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
here in the back and I try to maneuver

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.130 
here in the back and I try to maneuver
between<00:04:54.380> them<00:04:54.890> without<00:04:55.550> hitting<00:04:56.180> them<00:04:56.360> with

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
between them without hitting them with

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.140 
between them without hitting them with
the<00:04:57.260> outriggers<00:04:57.770> they<00:04:58.040> stick<00:04:58.370> a<00:04:58.400> little<00:04:59.000> bit

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
the outriggers they stick a little bit

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.150 
the outriggers they stick a little bit
further<00:04:59.540> out<00:04:59.630> than<00:04:59.990> the<00:05:00.200> wing<00:05:00.890> mirrors<00:05:01.370> but

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
further out than the wing mirrors but

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.740 
further out than the wing mirrors but
there<00:05:04.160> we<00:05:04.280> go

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
there we go

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.820 
there we go
perfect<00:05:05.750> parking<00:05:05.990> spot<00:05:06.970> and<00:05:08.350> now<00:05:09.350> for<00:05:09.650> some
