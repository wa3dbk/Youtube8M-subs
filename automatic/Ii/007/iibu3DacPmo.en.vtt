00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
want to take a hair tie and you're just

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.039

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
to do this style every single day

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.440 
to do this style every single day
because<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.490> cause<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> lot<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:29.970> tension

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
because it can cause a lot of tension

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.389 
because it can cause a lot of tension
around<00:01:30.720> your<00:01:30.960> hairline<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.220> cause

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
around your hairline and that can cause

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.130 
around your hairline and that can cause
breakage<00:01:32.790> right<00:01:33.210> around<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> hairline<00:01:33.750> so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
breakage right around the hairline so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.130 
breakage right around the hairline so
try<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.189> every<00:01:35.460> now<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:36.140> I'm

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
try and do it every now and then I'm

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.080

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
just going to lightly twist the ends of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.960 
just going to lightly twist the ends of
my<00:01:39.119> hair<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> fuller<00:01:41.579> bun

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
my hair so that I can have a fuller bun

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.480 
my hair so that I can have a fuller bun
and<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.020> don't<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.649> much<00:01:43.829> hair<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.159> I
