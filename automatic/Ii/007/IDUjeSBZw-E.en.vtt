basically I am excited yes what what
made<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.519> decide<00:00:59.640> on<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.150> design<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:01.110> think

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
made you decide on that design I think

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.579 
made you decide on that design I think
about<00:01:01.860> it<00:01:02.210> how<00:01:03.210> did<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.540> come<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:04.409> made

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
about it how did you come to what made

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.580 
about it how did you come to what made
you<00:01:04.739> decide<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.159> design<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> speaker<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.540> that

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
you decide to design a speaker in that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.480 
you decide to design a speaker in that
calculation

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.600 

local<00:01:11.490> frequency<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:13.380> size<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
local frequency the size of the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.550 
local frequency the size of the
loudspeaker<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.720> other<00:01:15.840> characteristics<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
loudspeaker the other characteristics of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.020 
loudspeaker the other characteristics of
the<00:01:16.649> loudspeaker<00:01:16.800> it's<00:01:17.340> build<00:01:17.580> just

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the loudspeaker it's build just

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.900 
the loudspeaker it's build just
automatics<00:01:19.399> give<00:01:20.399> everybody<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.789> little

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
automatics give everybody a little

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:39.890 
automatics give everybody a little
closer<00:01:21.240> look

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:02:11.250 

now<00:01:40.900> they<00:01:41.080> are<00:01:41.140> taller<00:01:41.440> than<00:02:09.720> does<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.750> final

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
now they are taller than does a final

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.230 
now they are taller than does a final
design<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:13.350> quote<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.470> continue<00:02:14.860> existing

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
design I quote to continue existing

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.140 
design I quote to continue existing
