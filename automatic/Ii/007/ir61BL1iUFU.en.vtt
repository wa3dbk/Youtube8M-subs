doctor chaos off to warp zone nine now I
think<00:00:59.780> it<00:01:00.020> is<00:01:00.080> yeah<00:01:03.610> why<00:01:04.610> did<00:01:04.790> that<00:01:04.910> happen

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
think it is yeah why did that happen

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.320 
think it is yeah why did that happen
okay<00:01:06.980> that's<00:01:07.160> definitely<00:01:07.490> not<00:01:07.640> me<00:01:07.700> pushing

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
okay that's definitely not me pushing

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.100 
okay that's definitely not me pushing
buttons<00:01:08.690> I<00:01:09.550> don't<00:01:10.550> know<00:01:10.610> why<00:01:10.760> it<00:01:10.820> did<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.110> or

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
buttons I don't know why it did that or

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.430 
buttons I don't know why it did that or
maybe<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:12.500> is<00:01:12.620> I<00:01:13.220> don't<00:01:13.790> know<00:01:13.850> I'm<00:01:14.810> not<00:01:15.170> playing

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
maybe it is I don't know I'm not playing

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.620 
maybe it is I don't know I'm not playing
with<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:17.050> across<00:01:18.050> PAB<00:01:18.470> or<00:01:19.180> directional<00:01:20.180> pad<00:01:20.450> and

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
with a across PAB or directional pad and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.680 
with a across PAB or directional pad and
playing<00:01:20.810> with<00:01:20.960> a<00:01:20.990> joystick<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:22.690> think

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
playing with a joystick so I think

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.080 
playing with a joystick so I think
sometimes<00:01:24.080> I<00:01:24.440> hit<00:01:24.650> random<00:01:25.130> directions<00:01:25.280> on<00:01:25.790> it

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.030 

let's<00:01:29.090> see<00:01:29.360> I<00:01:29.780> know<00:01:30.350> it's<00:01:30.650> around<00:01:30.860> here

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
let's see I know it's around here

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.570 
let's see I know it's around here
somewhere<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:33.229> by<00:01:33.830> that<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:34.070> mean<00:01:34.190> I<00:01:34.340> have<00:01:34.490> no

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
somewhere and by that I mean I have no

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.780 
somewhere and by that I mean I have no
idea<00:01:34.670> where<00:01:34.940> it<00:01:35.000> is<00:01:35.090> I<00:01:36.369> just<00:01:37.369> don't<00:01:37.520> want<00:01:37.700> you

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
idea where it is I just don't want you

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.300 
idea where it is I just don't want you
to<00:01:37.880> think<00:01:37.970> I'm<00:01:38.150> wasting<00:01:38.390> your<00:01:38.750> time<00:01:39.160> there<00:01:40.160> we

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
to think I'm wasting your time there we

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.560 
to think I'm wasting your time there we
go<00:01:41.530> once<00:01:42.530> more<00:01:42.770> into<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:43.040> basement

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.300 

yeah<00:01:48.350> that's<00:01:48.650> different<00:01:48.950> part<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:49.250> time

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
yeah that's different part this time

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.010 
yeah that's different part this time
they'll<00:01:50.170> work<00:01:51.170> with<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.440> hits<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.680> line<00:01:51.830> in<00:01:52.070> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
they'll work with a hits a line in the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.750 
they'll work with a hits a line in the
closets<00:01:54.020> which<00:01:54.800> is<00:01:54.950> I<00:01:55.040> guess<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.220> good<00:01:55.460> place<00:01:55.640> to

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
closets which is I guess a good place to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.950 
closets which is I guess a good place to
keep<00:01:55.940> them<00:01:56.150> if<00:01:56.360> you're<00:01:56.510> going<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.690> have<00:01:56.840> them

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
keep them if you're going to have them

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.070 
keep them if you're going to have them
in<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.170> house<00:01:58.090> I'm<00:01:59.090> guessing<00:01:59.540> dr.<00:01:59.840> chaos

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
in the house I'm guessing dr. chaos

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.229 
in the house I'm guessing dr. chaos
doesn't<00:02:00.410> have<00:02:00.530> kids

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.239

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
believe yes here we go the hyperspace

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.309

sensor<00:02:29.120> says<00:02:29.330> there's<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.599> warp<00:02:29.810> zone<00:02:30.050> in<00:02:30.200> this

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
sensor says there's a warp zone in this

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.330 
sensor says there's a warp zone in this
room<00:02:31.450> let's<00:02:32.450> go<00:02:32.660> through<00:02:33.019> it<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:36.069> see<00:02:37.069> I

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
room let's go through it and see I

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.830 
room let's go through it and see I
wasn't<00:02:37.700> lying<00:02:37.819> when<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.060> said<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.330> all<00:02:38.690> the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
wasn't lying when I said that all the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.090 
wasn't lying when I said that all the
levels<00:02:39.019> are<00:02:39.200> gonna<00:02:39.290> look<00:02:39.440> pretty<00:02:39.799> much<00:02:40.040> the

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
levels are gonna look pretty much the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.720 
levels are gonna look pretty much the
same<00:02:40.690> beyond<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:41.840> point<00:02:42.130> with<00:02:43.130> just<00:02:43.459> slight

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
same beyond this point with just slight

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.059 
same beyond this point with just slight
variations<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:47.590> one<00:02:48.590> thing<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.799> forgot<00:02:48.830> to

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
variations I one thing I forgot to

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.380 
variations I one thing I forgot to
mention<00:02:49.130> last<00:02:49.459> time<00:02:49.760> when<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:49.910> saw<00:02:50.120> him<00:02:50.239> at<00:02:50.360> the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
mention last time when I saw him at the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.710 
mention last time when I saw him at the
game<00:02:50.630> on<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:50.959> famicom<00:02:51.950> disk<00:02:51.980> system<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:53.660> that

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
game on the famicom disk system is that

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.020 
game on the famicom disk system is that
the<00:02:54.200> japanese<00:02:54.739> title<00:02:55.250> was<00:02:55.580> g<00:02:56.209> Goku<00:02:56.630> no<00:02:56.959> tobira

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
the japanese title was g Goku no tobira

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.120 
the japanese title was g Goku no tobira
which<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.269> believe<00:02:59.540> translates<00:02:59.840> loosely<00:03:00.470> into

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
which I believe translates loosely into

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.880 
which I believe translates loosely into
a<00:03:01.280> cross<00:03:01.640> hell's<00:03:01.970> door<00:03:02.560> there's<00:03:03.560> actually<00:03:03.860> a

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
a cross hell's door there's actually a

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.809 
a cross hell's door there's actually a
pretty<00:03:04.040> cool<00:03:04.100> title<00:03:04.430> I<00:03:06.400> think<00:03:07.400> if<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.640> game

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
pretty cool title I think if the game

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.050 
pretty cool title I think if the game
had<00:03:07.849> kept<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.630> name<00:03:09.099> was<00:03:10.099> ported<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:10.850> the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
had kept that name was ported to the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.020 
had kept that name was ported to the
United<00:03:11.420> States<00:03:11.630> might've<00:03:12.640> sold<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.790> little

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
United States might've sold a little

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.910 
United States might've sold a little
bitter<00:03:14.239> then<00:03:14.900> again<00:03:15.019> maybe<00:03:15.260> not<00:03:15.410> but

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.610 

it's<00:03:19.520> hard<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.819> know<00:03:19.940> i<00:03:19.970> mean<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:21.080> arcade<00:03:21.410> game

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
it's hard to know i mean the arcade game

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.120 
it's hard to know i mean the arcade game
chiller<00:03:22.660> was<00:03:23.660> ported<00:03:24.080> to<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.230> nes<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:24.980> was<00:03:25.099> a

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
chiller was ported to the nes it was a

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.270 
chiller was ported to the nes it was a
zapper<00:03:25.670> game<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:27.530> whole<00:03:27.680> point<00:03:27.830> of<00:03:28.010> that

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
zapper game and the whole point of that

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.210 
zapper game and the whole point of that
was<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:29.050> shoot<00:03:30.050> people<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.500> torture<00:03:30.980> them<00:03:31.010> to

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
was to shoot people and torture them to

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.820 
was to shoot people and torture them to
death<00:03:32.110> although<00:03:33.110> i'm<00:03:33.200> guessing<00:03:33.650> there<00:03:33.770> were

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
death although i'm guessing there were

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.309 
death although i'm guessing there were
probably<00:03:34.040> some<00:03:34.190> parental<00:03:34.580> complaints

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
probably some parental complaints

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.100 
probably some parental complaints
regarding<00:03:36.319> that<00:03:36.709> one<00:03:36.890> but<00:03:37.190> i<00:03:37.930> mean<00:03:38.930> that

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
regarding that one but i mean that

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.300 
regarding that one but i mean that

didn't stop them so i'm sure you could
have<00:03:40.430> had<00:03:40.550> hell<00:03:40.790> in<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.060> title<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:43.010> here<00:03:43.430> we

I'm a little tired so there's a slight
chance<00:04:03.769> that<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.310> words<00:04:04.519> coming<00:04:04.850> out<00:04:04.970> of<00:04:05.030> my

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
chance that the words coming out of my

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.740 
chance that the words coming out of my
mouth<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:05.360> not<00:04:05.720> gonna<00:04:05.900> be<00:04:06.110> right

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.200 

you<00:04:10.320> know<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.710> just<00:04:11.520> throw<00:04:11.760> grenades<00:04:12.090> and

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
you know the just throw grenades and

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.030 
you know the just throw grenades and
everything<00:04:12.570> approaches<00:04:13.290> sort<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:13.920> walking

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
everything approaches sort of walking

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:22.360 
everything approaches sort of walking
out

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.620 

and<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.400> actually<00:04:23.640> liked<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.090> design<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.390> this

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
and I actually liked the design of this

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.100 
and I actually liked the design of this
ball<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.340> you<00:04:26.340> see<00:04:26.520> in<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.640> minute<00:04:26.760> how<00:04:27.690> he<00:04:27.750> works

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
ball so you see in a minute how he works

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.030 
ball so you see in a minute how he works
I<00:04:28.820> got<00:04:29.820> worried<00:04:30.030> when<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.240> first<00:04:30.450> fine<00:04:30.920> cuz<00:04:31.920> I

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
I got worried when I first fine cuz I

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.830 
I got worried when I first fine cuz I
thought<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.790> had<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:33.000> shoot<00:04:33.210> him<00:04:33.270> when<00:04:33.750> the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
thought you had to shoot him when the

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.240 
thought you had to shoot him when the
bones<00:04:34.020> flew<00:04:34.290> away<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.680> there<00:04:34.860> was<00:04:34.950> no<00:04:35.100> way<00:04:35.220> to

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
bones flew away and there was no way to

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.150 
bones flew away and there was no way to
damage<00:04:35.640> it<00:04:35.730> but<00:04:36.710> actually<00:04:37.710> he<00:04:37.800> takes<00:04:37.980> damage

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
damage it but actually he takes damage

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.180 
damage it but actually he takes damage
any<00:04:38.460> time<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.700> shoot<00:04:38.820> him<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:40.680> flying<00:04:40.950> bones

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
any time you shoot him the flying bones

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.439 
any time you shoot him the flying bones
are<00:04:41.370> just<00:04:41.520> an<00:04:41.610> attack

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.499 

and<00:04:46.979> if<00:04:47.979> I<00:04:48.129> knew<00:04:48.219> the<00:04:48.340> boss<00:04:48.490> names<00:04:48.819> I<00:04:49.090> would

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
and if I knew the boss names I would

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.269 
and if I knew the boss names I would
tell<00:04:49.659> you<00:04:49.779> but<00:04:50.020> I<00:04:50.499> haven't<00:04:50.710> been<00:04:50.889> able<00:04:50.979> to<00:04:51.099> find

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:09.339 
in some way that's actually more

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.929 
in some way that's actually more
realistic<00:05:10.650> yeah<00:05:11.650> I<00:05:11.949> can't<00:05:12.550> believe<00:05:12.669> that<00:05:12.789> I'm

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:12.939 
realistic yeah I can't believe that I'm

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:14.159 
realistic yeah I can't believe that I'm
actually<00:05:13.029> praising<00:05:13.599> the<00:05:13.689> game<00:05:13.839> for<00:05:14.080> its

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
actually praising the game for its

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.119 
actually praising the game for its
realism<00:05:14.529> but<00:05:15.809> I<00:05:16.809> mean<00:05:17.379> the<00:05:17.499> truth<00:05:17.650> is<00:05:17.830> if<00:05:18.009> you

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:18.129 
realism but I mean the truth is if you

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:21.269 
realism but I mean the truth is if you
were<00:05:18.249> to<00:05:18.370> go<00:05:18.520> into<00:05:18.729> a<00:05:18.909> house<00:05:19.889> that<00:05:20.889> has<00:05:21.129> been

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
overrun with otherworldly monsters you

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.779 
overrun with otherworldly monsters you
would<00:05:24.069> know<00:05:24.219> the<00:05:24.339> names<00:05:24.520> of<00:05:25.060> any<00:05:25.389> of<00:05:25.449> them<00:05:26.789> they

entertainment system in 1990 it was an
unlicensed<00:06:19.599> port<00:06:19.839> anyway<00:06:20.830> this<00:06:21.129> is<00:06:21.339> exactly

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:21.939 
unlicensed port anyway this is exactly

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.420 
unlicensed port anyway this is exactly
what<00:06:22.330> it<00:06:22.360> looks<00:06:22.629> like<00:06:22.810> is<00:06:23.709> this<00:06:23.889> is<00:06:24.069> a<00:06:24.249> per-game

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430

what<00:06:25.089> we're<00:06:25.270> supposed<00:06:25.569> to<00:06:25.629> be<00:06:25.689> doing<00:06:25.779> is

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 
what we're supposed to be doing is

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:28.219 
what we're supposed to be doing is
shooting<00:06:27.069> everything<00:06:27.279> on<00:06:27.520> the<00:06:27.639> screen<00:06:27.729> that
