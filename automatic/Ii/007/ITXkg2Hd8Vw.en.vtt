00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
reason for this is because the after man

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.740 
reason for this is because the after man
has<00:01:55.799> been<00:01:55.920> split<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.310> two<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.850> far<00:01:57.060> two<00:01:57.299> records

going to be the four parts for the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.750 
going to be the four parts for the
tracks<00:02:58.440> which<00:02:58.680> are<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.980> key<00:02:59.220> entity

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
tracks which are the key entity

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.050 
tracks which are the key entity
extraction<00:03:00.480> points<00:03:01.549> this<00:03:02.549> is<00:03:02.670> called<00:03:02.849> key

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
extraction points this is called key

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.640 
extraction points this is called key
entity<00:03:03.420> extraction<00:03:03.540> but<00:03:04.140> i<00:03:04.170> like<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.530> call

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
entity extraction but i like to call

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.259 
entity extraction but i like to call
them<00:03:04.709> extraction<00:03:05.519> points<00:03:05.790> because<00:03:06.090> it's

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
them extraction points because it's

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.449 
them extraction points because it's
individually<00:03:07.019> chronicling<00:03:07.680> four<00:03:08.160> different

that their music has been kind of

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.039

a little bit more of a cinematic idea

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.539 
a little bit more of a cinematic idea

cinematic<00:04:50.250> approach<00:04:50.370> by<00:04:50.730> this<00:04:50.910> band<00:04:51.150> while<00:04:51.690> at

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
cinematic approach by this band while at

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.830 
cinematic approach by this band while at
the<00:04:51.870> same<00:04:52.080> time<00:04:52.140> the<00:04:53.000> intense<00:04:54.000> complexity<00:04:54.720> of

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
the same time the intense complexity of

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.500 
the same time the intense complexity of
their<00:04:55.110> signatures<00:04:55.620> as<00:04:55.890> perhaps<00:04:56.360> waned<00:04:57.360> a

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
their signatures as perhaps waned a

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.180 
their signatures as perhaps waned a
little<00:04:57.750> bit<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.050> kind<00:04:58.200> of<00:04:58.380> become<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.650> little

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
little bit and kind of become a little

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.240 
little bit and kind of become a little
bit<00:04:59.390> more<00:05:00.390> discernible<00:05:01.230> so<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:01.440> speak<00:05:01.710> I<00:05:01.980> know

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
bit more discernible so to speak I know

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.040 
bit more discernible so to speak I know
on<00:05:02.550> year<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:02.970> rainbow<00:05:03.360> this<00:05:03.540> was<00:05:03.720> definitely

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
on year the rainbow this was definitely

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.230 
on year the rainbow this was definitely
true<00:05:04.590> where<00:05:04.830> it<00:05:04.920> seems<00:05:05.160> like<00:05:05.460> on<00:05:05.700> some<00:05:06.060> tracks

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
true where it seems like on some tracks

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.730 
true where it seems like on some tracks
they<00:05:06.480> took<00:05:06.660> a<00:05:06.690> little<00:05:06.930> bit<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.170> a<00:05:07.380> simpler

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
they took a little bit of a simpler

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.770 
they took a little bit of a simpler
approach<00:05:07.890> and<00:05:08.370> this<00:05:08.880> was<00:05:09.030> met<00:05:09.240> with<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.420> little

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
approach and this was met with a little

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.450 
approach and this was met with a little
bit<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:10.080> polarizing<00:05:10.680> opinion<00:05:11.100> but<00:05:11.220> let's

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
bit of a polarizing opinion but let's

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.150 
bit of a polarizing opinion but let's
face<00:05:11.610> it<00:05:11.850> what<00:05:12.630> is<00:05:12.810> done<00:05:13.170> that<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:13.740> not<00:05:13.890> met

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
face it what is done that is not met

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.130 
face it what is done that is not met
with<00:05:14.640> polarizing<00:05:15.270> opinion<00:05:15.660> there's<00:05:16.080> a

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
with polarizing opinion there's a

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.660 
with polarizing opinion there's a
 values<00:05:16.740> presidential<00:05:17.220> debate<00:05:17.520> on

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
 values presidential debate on

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.300 
 values presidential debate on
right<00:05:17.910> now<00:05:18.290> but<00:05:19.290> at<00:05:19.380> any<00:05:19.500> rate<00:05:19.620> this<00:05:19.920> album

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
right now but at any rate this album

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.400 
right now but at any rate this album
definitely<00:05:20.910> is<00:05:21.090> very<00:05:21.270> solid<00:05:21.960> but<00:05:22.080> I<00:05:22.110> think

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
definitely is very solid but I think

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.100 
definitely is very solid but I think
that<00:05:22.560> what<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:22.830> lacks<00:05:23.160> is<00:05:23.460> what<00:05:24.210> most<00:05:24.660> people

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
that what it lacks is what most people

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.420 
that what it lacks is what most people
are<00:05:25.200> going<00:05:25.350> to<00:05:25.470> complain<00:05:25.800> about<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:26.340> that's

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
are going to complain about and that's

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.740 
are going to complain about and that's
the<00:05:26.670> fact<00:05:26.820> that<00:05:27.000> the<00:05:27.210> length<00:05:27.420> of<00:05:27.570> it

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
the fact that the length of it

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.530 
the fact that the length of it
definitely<00:05:28.400> gives<00:05:29.400> you<00:05:29.640> that<00:05:29.760> feeling<00:05:30.090> that<00:05:30.330> a

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
definitely gives you that feeling that a

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.080 
definitely gives you that feeling that a
lot<00:05:30.840> more<00:05:30.870> needs<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.350> be<00:05:31.470> said<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:32.040> whenever<00:05:32.940> I

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
lot more needs to be said and whenever I

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.210 
lot more needs to be said and whenever I
was<00:05:33.300> describing<00:05:33.600> this<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.170> my<00:05:34.410> co-worker<00:05:34.920> a

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
was describing this to my co-worker a

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.400 
was describing this to my co-worker a
few<00:05:35.790> days<00:05:35.940> ago<00:05:36.150> whenever<00:05:36.480> I<00:05:36.630> had<00:05:36.960> this<00:05:37.080> popped

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
few days ago whenever I had this popped

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.190 
few days ago whenever I had this popped
on<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:38.190> way<00:05:38.340> that<00:05:38.550> I<00:05:38.580> felt<00:05:38.970> was<00:05:39.150> it<00:05:39.210> reminded

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
on the way that I felt was it reminded

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.990 
on the way that I felt was it reminded
me<00:05:40.290> a<00:05:40.380> lot<00:05:40.590> of<00:05:40.650> between<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.430> buried<00:05:41.700> it<00:05:41.850> means

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
me a lot of between the buried it means

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.510 
me a lot of between the buried it means
the<00:05:42.090> parallax<00:05:42.630> we're<00:05:43.050> on<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:43.800> EP<00:05:43.980> that<00:05:44.400> was

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
the parallax we're on the EP that was

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.330 
the parallax we're on the EP that was
released<00:05:44.820> in<00:05:45.000> 2011<00:05:45.690> we<00:05:46.380> got<00:05:46.560> a<00:05:46.590> little<00:05:46.800> taste<00:05:47.070> a

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
released in 2011 we got a little taste a

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.550 
released in 2011 we got a little taste a
30<00:05:47.640> minute<00:05:47.880> taste<00:05:48.210> for<00:05:48.510> over<00:05:48.750> three<00:05:48.990> tracks<00:05:49.320> of

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
what this whole entire situation is

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.070 
what this whole entire situation is
endeavor<00:05:52.590> this<00:05:52.950> you<00:05:53.730> know<00:05:53.850> large<00:05:54.210> writing

process was all about but was once we

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.480 
process was all about but was once we
got<00:05:57.870> to<00:05:57.930> the<00:05:58.290> parallax<00:05:58.740> part<00:05:58.980> 2<00:05:59.160> which<00:05:59.340> was

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
got to the parallax part 2 which was

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.710 
got to the parallax part 2 which was
just<00:05:59.640> released<00:05:59.760> a<00:06:00.060> couple<00:06:00.210> of<00:06:00.420> weeks<00:06:00.540> ago

the endeavor and really got to tell what
the<00:06:12.990> parallax<00:06:13.500> was<00:06:13.680> all<00:06:13.800> about<00:06:14.040> I<00:06:14.280> really<00:06:14.880> feel

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
the parallax was all about I really feel

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.000 
the parallax was all about I really feel
that<00:06:15.150> this<00:06:15.480> is<00:06:15.660> going<00:06:15.900> I'm<00:06:16.410> going<00:06:16.590> to<00:06:16.680> kind<00:06:16.950> of

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
that this is going I'm going to kind of

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.820 
that this is going I'm going to kind of
be<00:06:17.160> the<00:06:17.280> same<00:06:17.550> almost<00:06:18.120> this<00:06:18.570> though<00:06:18.780> this<00:06:19.200> near

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
be the same almost this though this near

be the same almost this though this near
40<00:06:20.190> minute<00:06:20.490> long<00:06:20.640> taste<00:06:21.090> of<00:06:21.590> the<00:06:22.590> after<00:06:22.950> man

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 
40 minute long taste of the after man

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.550 
40 minute long taste of the after man
was<00:06:23.760> sort<00:06:24.180> of<00:06:24.270> a<00:06:24.390> little<00:06:24.540> teaser<00:06:24.930> like<00:06:25.320> maybe

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
was sort of a little teaser like maybe

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.440 
was sort of a little teaser like maybe
they<00:06:25.860> had<00:06:26.070> a<00:06:26.340> little<00:06:26.670> bit<00:06:26.880> more<00:06:27.120> that<00:06:27.330> they

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
they had a little bit more that they

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.360 
they had a little bit more that they
could<00:06:27.630> have<00:06:27.720> offered<00:06:27.870> us<00:06:28.200> on<00:06:28.380> this<00:06:28.530> album<00:06:28.740> but
