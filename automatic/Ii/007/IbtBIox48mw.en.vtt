00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.310
 very good to all kids here febres 

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.200
 and good in this new level of seeds 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.809
 the playing hardcore factions known 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.269
 as hf or also known as the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.269
 Factor plugin that work with de tr 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.490
 the name itself says the plugin is from 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.130
 easy but it's hardcore and this plugin 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.390
 they work with you 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.840
 it came out that it is of tr 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.970
 I'm not more or less worthy but it's very 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.460
 similar to power is very very very 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.410
 similar to power to realize that 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.059
 good me in my case three years ago or 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.140
 something like that when I started doing 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.329
 followers 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.920
 I always used the normal fashion cell 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.440
 that you can find on a bus that is worth 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.070
 and that project works with power was 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.140
 pretty good 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.670
 although he had his mistakes things 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.890
 communicates things as they are had 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.570
 mistakes but it was very good because this 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.940
 plugin in green works with power 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.679
 they work with dtr and this little one what 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.059
 they want many servers in many 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.059
 networks I think they have it 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.900
 because the dt r can be made compatible 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.690
 with other plugins then it's super 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.910
 well super good and also be your plugin 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.290
 pretty well developed vale is a 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.290
 plugin that does not usually have many failures 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.920
 I'm not going to roll up more good this 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.650
 payment plugin we are here in self and it is 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.630
 a page I've created Agosta 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.190
 really good on this page, because you 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.500
 you can sell anything and I in my 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.810
 case 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.940
 I created it to sell plugins for 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.190
 things like they are because I have a lot a 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.530
 heap a lot of prince that gives me the 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.920
 people and sand the developers for 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.630
 I post them on my channel but they to 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.270
 change then leave me this 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.400
 distribute them and things like that and I always 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.740
 I usually put half the price 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.890
 even less so because on top of that 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.860
 give them away I will not ask what it costs 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.360
 is not expected to ask for something smaller and the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.950
 this kid has given me have me 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.850
 said that he would sell it for eight euros 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.610
 it's worth it because he bought it at 25 euros or 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.170
 something like that and he told me to fuck since 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.970
 you have enjoyed it because you enjoy it 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.370
 other people I see it pretty well 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.500
 the truth even I do not understand how 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.200
 there are people so they spend so much 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.450
 money is worth it because it is money and that 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.220
 On top of that, give less and then sell it 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.000
 to this to eight euros he told me that what 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.489
 will sell eight euros 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.610
 then I admire this kind of people 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.170
 and I'm super proud to have 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.489
 subscribers like that but well I'm not going to 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.519
 roll up better guys if I go to 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.370
 teach how to plugin plugin fuck 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.790
 is crying I say crying 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.370
 now you 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.459
 the plugin is very similar to the factor 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.549
 normal if we put efe because they are going to come 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.560
 here that aid aids 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.800
 still although there are not few here 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.350
 commands is valid if you buy the plugin 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.960
 I will try to give them a notebook 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.760
 where many come but many many 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.799
 more commands 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.720
 but good if we can or with the chat see 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.829
 new exits and the chat we are in a 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.900
 new point 8 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.260
 so this functional plugin to 1.8 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.739
 and to 1.7 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.569
 1.7 and peak also worked 1.7 and 10 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.239
 1.7 x also worked good vale 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.920
 let's create a faction is the one that 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.409
 try sp and then come here what 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.069
 cool is to put on show and here then you 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.810
 they're going to say the rd r this I do not have 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.689
 idea that I think this is for the 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.180
 of the rt r here good what clay more and 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:38.909
 such planning is like the normal factor of 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.669
 flake line is worth and as you see me klein ya 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.629
 that part is worth and I just left 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:47.069
 s &amp; p and now I'm entering wiltern is 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.190
 this because as it is not there is not 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:54.750
 changing vale came here 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.670
 then for here I stop here and see for 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.850
 here entering sp 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.850
 if we put efe ma will not say good 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.880
 efe map map I will not say that you see there 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.920
 there is a line that is tackled and that 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.930
 that is changed by me there is also the 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.330
 date plan but only talks to the 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.390
 alliance f fashion to just talk 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.640
 with the people of the fashion in plan the 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.130
 members of the faction and the boss another 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.790
 time forgiveness etc for the public is 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.670
 Super good 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.760
 there are even faction plugins that this 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.470
 they do not bring it for example if on my channel 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.000
 I uploaded plugin's fashion and 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.490
 I always have to upload plugins in plan 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.080
 complementary because the normal plugin 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.720
 faction of bukit does not enter the factor 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.300
 is 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.940
 this has it all in truth is that it is 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.630
 very good and then you can modify it 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.780
 here as here good in the energy all 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.870
 this 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.340
 the dt r you can configure it can 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.040
 modify you can do a lot of 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.350
 things like seen this can change is 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.240
 say you can put the brackets of another 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.919
 tr color and all this time 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.470
 super cool the truth and then well then 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.460
 the normal was invited so well this 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.080
 I hope you liked this one 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.760
 plugin of you know that I asked it if 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.310
 that you want to buy or want to buy 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.420
 some other plugin you can enter in my 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.000
 FICA is the page overview 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.430

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.400

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.100
 that has been thanks to the guys bar like that 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.990
