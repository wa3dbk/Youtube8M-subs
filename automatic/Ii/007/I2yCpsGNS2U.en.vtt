 what good 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.099
 welcome to another blog more than mister 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.849
 curry ce blogs today I'll see with 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.710
 you a council and it's how to save 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.770
 in times of crisis to Mr. Curry 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.199
 is presented with chiki chiki chiki chiki 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.449
 pum pum pum 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.580
 Well today we are going to see in times of 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.140
 crisis when there is little money how 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.420
 get save how to get there 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.180
 being in 'red numbers' is worth the thing 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.489
 is sucked 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.129
 the only thing you have to get is 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.899
 spend less of the money you already enter 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.850
 either because you work either because you 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.309
 give your parents whatever it 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.980
 important is knowing or controlling 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.960
 how much money are you entering into your 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.149
 account already rise as in your account 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.699
 from your pocket in your shower and how much money 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.210
 you are like that said it seems a dumb 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.039
 because it is how it is but if you never 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.469
 you stop to think about it and you spies to calculate it 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.329
 A little bit is when we get the accounts 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.449
 you can already be earning 100 euros per month 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.520
 or ten thousand euros per month 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.579
 If what you spend is more what you get 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.890
 you're out of money that's why it's 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.259
 important to calculate the money that 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.380
 you enter and so you can do a calculation 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.329
 of the money that you can always spend 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.460
 trying not to spend everything 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.350
 important is not to spend all of spending 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.840
 less than what you enter and in that way 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.850
 You can save even five euros 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.590
 even if it's two euros if every month 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.460
 You can save a little bit of market 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.319
 a few months 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.750
 You have saved something that did not 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.789
 you had either much either little but already 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.729
 it is money with which not having it 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.099
 thought before I would not count so if I 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.399
 for example I get twenty euros to the 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:48.560
 week because then I'll have to see me 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.920
 I spend it on this in this and in 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.049
 this but it left me a bit is to say that 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.899
 I have 20 euros I know that to leave 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.119
 weekends on Friday I spent 5 and 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.099
 On Saturday, I spent 5 because I have 10 left 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.679
 Well now I know that for the rest of the 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:06.380
 week I should not spend more than five 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.660
 or seven euros to be able to save 53 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.819
 euros and believe me even if it seems like a 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.909
 foolishness what I'm saying is idea 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.599
 you think and you do it seriously you go to 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.370

 it does not matter that copper is very little 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.299
 just like you get very little money if 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.920
 you are well administered you can always 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.400
