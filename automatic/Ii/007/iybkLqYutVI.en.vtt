00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 i 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.889
 what excited me most this year in 3 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.100
 2015 from ubisoft was up to your registration 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.890
 from kate last year we could not play 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.480
 the one and he has three and this year I thought 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.820
 it's going to be the same as what we're going to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.580
 see trailers and the demo but not what 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.470
 we can play but if they could 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.690
 he seemed to play those syndicate scripts 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.910
 For the first time I can play the 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:36.140
 unity in the last time I say I believe that you 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.140
 no, but I mean, it was not either 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.830
 I wanted to paste there are enough good things 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 and new of ours is to include the 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.350
 síndic eight one of them is the zip line 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.940
 that now is like a hook that you use 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.170
 to reach the most distant places and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.019
 higher in a faster way 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.659
 I also believe that the mobility modality 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.239
 sorry because emery had as many 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.890
 three-part problems I think all 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.159
 have had like that problem not that 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.049
 you love 3 paris 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.580
 and roads like this in this I think that already 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.210
 something improved 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.140
 and well I do not know how I see it alcapán let's go 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.990
 to discover how he sees the capon 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.420
 I quite like because today is not that 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.490
 state played losada is inscribed I think 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.710
 that gives a very important turn to the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.080
 story and that time they focus on 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.110
 emblematic places like Paris in 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.300
 unity on this occasion and it's england 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.430
 this london etcetera that that gives you a 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.200
 very important turn a game and it makes 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.300
 the basis of its history is more solid and 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.979
 stronger than I could say and have a 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.009
 very strong history between Templar and 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.560
 murderers already with this is going to be something super 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.770
 solid super amazing and apart the 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.890
 adaptation to the time at 1800 is 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.690
 super good the wagons in clouds or that 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.580
 You can walk by climbing on the 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.950
 jumping carts you can remove the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.960
 this driver and you walk like crazy 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.030
 hitting the horse on all sides the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.070
 I think they are integrations that make a 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.259
 more dynamic game and how I have a 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.179
 more solid story means and said things 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.130
 chidas not like the flight that was 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.140
 and the simple 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.300
 that is also has to because all the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.250
 Inscribed knowledge has its time and that 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.200
 era and the characters that come out all 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.090
 the enrolled aces have characters that 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.860
 yes they did exist that if they are real and the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.830
 epoch has to do with everything then 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.040
 apart from playing and having some fun 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.130
 although you do not want to learn and apart 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.870
 we will be able to play for the first time 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.030
 for the first time because we already played with 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.070
 aveline but for the first time one of the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.830
 main characters is a woman 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.990
 we want to know also what it looked like to 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.090
 you assassin's creed syndicate the 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.490
 trailers the new gameplay trailers 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.980

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.180

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.670
 see also the interview he did 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.990

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.870

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.880
