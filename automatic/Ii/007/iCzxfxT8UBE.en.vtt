they're having is the need for LTE these
devices<00:02:13.420> are<00:02:13.630> hspa+<00:02:14.560> which<00:02:15.310> means<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.700> GSM

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
devices are hspa+ which means the GSM

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.830 
devices are hspa+ which means the GSM
and<00:02:16.930> kind<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.290> limits<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.740> carriers<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.840> it

LTE<00:02:23.730> we're<00:02:24.730> going<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:24.880> keep<00:02:25.000> our<00:02:25.120> fingers

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
LTE we're going to keep our fingers

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.150 
LTE we're going to keep our fingers
crossed<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.720> we<00:02:25.870> see<00:02:26.020> this<00:02:26.170> stateside<00:02:26.830> soon

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
crossed that we see this stateside soon

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.040 
crossed that we see this stateside soon
because<00:02:27.910> like<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.180> said<00:02:28.240> this<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.570> a<00:02:28.690> really
