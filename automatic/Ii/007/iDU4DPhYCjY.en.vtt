have to get caught up in the scope and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.740 
have to get caught up in the scope and
you're<00:01:45.270> less<00:01:45.479> likely<00:01:45.509> likely<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:47.540> slam<00:01:48.540> it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
you really need only 22 unless you're

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.390 
you really need only 22 unless you're
trying<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.099> reach<00:02:41.430> out<00:02:41.670> longer<00:02:42.299> distances<00:02:42.840> but

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
trying to reach out longer distances but

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.479 
trying to reach out longer distances but
who<00:02:44.400> really<00:02:44.580> needs<00:02:44.849> that<00:02:44.910> for<00:02:45.209> 22<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.489> the

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
who really needs that for 22 and the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.610 
who really needs that for 22 and the
thing<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.760> like<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:48.150> lot<00:02:48.540> about<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.959> scope<00:02:49.290> is

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
thing I like a lot about this scope is

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.670 
thing I like a lot about this scope is
that<00:02:50.519> if<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.060> turn<00:02:51.269> this<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:52.290> can<00:02:52.470> either<00:02:52.560> go

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
that if you turn this it can either go

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.610 
that if you turn this it can either go
thicker<00:02:53.099> or<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:54.599> crosshairs<00:02:55.079> can<00:02:55.290> either<00:02:55.470> be

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
thicker or the crosshairs can either be

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.809 
thicker or the crosshairs can either be
thicker<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.190> darker<00:02:56.690> or<00:02:57.690> they<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:57.989> be<00:02:58.110> more

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
thicker and darker or they can be more

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.380 
thicker and darker or they can be more
hairline<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.769> very<00:03:01.769> thin<00:03:02.099> I<00:03:02.430> like<00:03:02.970> mine<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.180> be

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
hairline and very thin I like mine to be

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.420 
hairline and very thin I like mine to be
thicker<00:03:03.660> because<00:03:04.019> when<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.470> pull<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.130> up<00:03:05.250> to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
thicker because when you pull it up to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.780 
thicker because when you pull it up to
shoot<00:03:05.870> it's<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.989> lot<00:03:07.170> easier<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.650> see<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.340> lot

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
shoot it's a lot easier to see a lot

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.750 
shoot it's a lot easier to see a lot
easier<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.329> acquire<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:10.890> on<00:03:11.130> your<00:03:11.340> target

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
easier to acquire it on your target

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.460 
easier to acquire it on your target
especially<00:03:11.940> in<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.390> sunlight<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:15.380> it's<00:03:16.380> a

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
especially in the sunlight and it's a

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.830 
especially in the sunlight and it's a
good<00:03:16.590> gun<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:17.040> highly<00:03:18.000> recommend<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.630> for

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
good gun I highly recommend it for

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:41.030 
good gun I highly recommend it for
people<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.620> are<00:03:19.709> looking<00:03:19.889> for<00:03:20.220> 22<00:03:38.900> but<00:03:40.040> there

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
people that are looking for 22 but there

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.940 
people that are looking for 22 but there
it's<00:03:41.370> not<00:03:41.519> a<00:03:41.579> perfect<00:03:42.269> gun<00:03:42.500> like<00:03:43.500> I<00:03:43.590> said<00:03:43.829> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
it's not a perfect gun like I said the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.910 
it's not a perfect gun like I said the
safety<00:03:44.190> bothers<00:03:44.760> me<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.000> little<00:03:45.150> bit<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.920> how

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
safety bothers me a little bit and how

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.069 
safety bothers me a little bit and how
you<00:03:46.980> have<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.370> go<00:03:47.519> like<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:47.940> if<00:03:48.870> you're

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
you have to go like that if you're

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.240 
you have to go like that if you're
walking<00:03:49.470> through<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.620> woods<00:03:49.829> trying<00:03:50.160> to

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
walking through the woods trying to

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.970 
walking through the woods trying to
squirrel<00:03:50.489> hunt<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.930> just<00:03:52.170> loaded<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.769> and

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
squirrel hunt and you just loaded it and

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.250 
squirrel hunt and you just loaded it and
there<00:03:53.280> comes<00:03:53.519> out<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.760> squirrel<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:55.019> think

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
there comes out a squirrel and you think

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.750 
there comes out a squirrel and you think
you're<00:03:55.380> ready<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.739> shoot<00:03:55.920> just<00:03:56.370> because<00:03:56.489> of

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
you're ready to shoot just because of

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.780 
you're ready to shoot just because of
