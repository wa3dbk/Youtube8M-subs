00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.720 
should have been up there I skated great
all<00:03:31.140> week<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.620> was<00:03:31.709> just<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:32.010> long<00:03:32.190> wait<00:03:32.430> at

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
all week and it was just a long wait at

all week and it was just a long wait at
the<00:03:32.910> end<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.630> guess<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.989> felt<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.260> little<00:03:34.320> more

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
did feel that pressure because you were

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.449 
did feel that pressure because you were
trying<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.190> do<00:03:41.400> not<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:42.030> deny<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:43.250> well<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.280> just
