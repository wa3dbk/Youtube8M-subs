00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.130
 And then, I'll review your blog again. 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.660
 game life episode 10 guys this 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.490
 I feel like a lot of things happened. 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.560
 unnecessary mainly the beginning of 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.710
 line that part of the bath and such 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.150
 cerci was necessary because it is different 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.449
 of the battle against Diego 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.589
 had a purpose of distracting her from 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.900
 then proceed with the 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.089
 victory 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.489
 In this case you did not have to say that it's for you. 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:53.040
 to know better and such but besteirol 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:56.089
 salary and did not say it was anything 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.369
 just played like that just for playing 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:02.430
 I believe that it has been 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:07.229
 placed on account of the number of 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.080
 episodes of ali né so things 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.340
 so that at the end of the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.729
 Episode 12 has a close 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.710
 I hope it's not the right closure, then. 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.960
 maybe it was just to complement 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.429
 even to get a little better, right? 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.109
 end of the bid is because we're already 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.939
 arriving at the end of the line I believe that 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:32.909
 It was because of this, it's not because 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.119
 It was more from the end even if it was 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.969
 of relevance was that it was the beginning of the game 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.319
 practically there the personnel going apart 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:47.069
 the game but apart from that we have the 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:49.109
 This was not a good explanation. 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.090
 I consider it irrelevant how it was 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.909
 bath funcef 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.700
 I think it's cool 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.240
 the last of healing me with explanation 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.429
 It is interesting to know how she 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.679
 has met and we also see a bit of 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.479
 healing relationship comforts me 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.900
 you are understanding this, right? 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.360
 the two know 2 know now 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.980
 memories of each other so they 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.260
 They play with it a little, so it was 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.640
 interesting these two parts there of the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.700
 it is best to know is the color 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.980
 telling her past with the afe 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.230
 konami getting better now console now 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.480
 that he has a memory of the time she 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.590
 has the soil memory and can now 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.320
 trust him 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.420
 it was nice this part and one thing 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.290
 show some of the diminished in action 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.950
 even she is shown in the great war 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.489
 She's putting it to power and I'm 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.209
 wondering is that her potential 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.610
 will be explored further because 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.630
 We're coming in at the end it will be 12 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.989
 episodes 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.370
 and I really wanted to see her put it on 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.100
 hold drink because she has too much 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.800
 potential to be explored and this was 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.930
 exploited at the time of the Great 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.209
 battles she put it to fuck 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.910
 only now she stays there like 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.070
 even aid is like a support for the sun 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.920
 for scent and I really wanted to see her 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.880
 being best used 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:30.459
 now the question is about magic 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:34.540
 that was put in the steffi the others are there 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:39.040
 with a plan involving astef to place 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.680
 a window something like this and I believe that 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.430
 this will be a key point for more 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.610
 front 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.320
 in the match you are entering now 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:52.000
 Because a lot of people always say that, huh? 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.720
 if it is defined even before 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.600
 begin 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.220
 so maybe this has great 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.340
 importance for what he has 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.540
 planned for this battle a thing 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.120
 that the iso in which it is one of the orbits mec 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.870
 is entering the battle against the hours 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.260
 chile the staff she at the beginning when she 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.940
 She's going to get into the game, she's kind of like this. 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.500
 Give me an impression, I'll just ask her. 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.479
 when was the last time you were 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.600
 have fun playing 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.280
 she looks a bit like Akon in a way 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.919
 kind of weird 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.560
 I think this has to be the one going. 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.540
 to be most likely 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.220
 even further explored, right? 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:38.400
 because there's a certain one that the fuck is 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.470
 this, maybe some 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.060
 her feelings about games 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.120
 maybe she does not like, I do not know if she does not 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.480
 likes games like that as soon as 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.750
 have to be explained that it was very 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.510
 quickly make that exchange 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.080
 What do you talk about when you cry? 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.730
 she 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.419
 and we have 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.419
 they entering the game 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:11.820
 It is a very intriguing thing that they 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:14.460
 They stopped in Tokyo right now because they 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:20.160
 entered the game where the game gets 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:23.430
 simulate the city of tokyo and this is something 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.800
 that indicates comfort and prejudice 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.020
 the soil and the china because they are 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.180
 called nittis né 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.190
 are social networks is that thing not 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.760
 they like to stay in public are very 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:40.289
 closed all the time, right? 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.390
 alone playing and such a thing then 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.960
 I was thinking, will this machine 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:50.700
 she can guess he is not 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:53.850
 slowly leave the people 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.970
 somehow know what the fears are 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.729
 nor the weaknesses of their opponents and 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.530
 so use all this against them 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.389
 I was thinking about this because the fuck 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.430
 it can not be coincidence that he falls into 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.039
 album in Tokyo, right? 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.289
 But that's it, let's wait and see what 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:14.460
 will happen but you will review the 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:16.169
 episode 11 so close to the end and that's it 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.710
