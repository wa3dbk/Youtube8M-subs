okay<00:00:00.630> so<00:00:00.690> now<00:00:01.020> we're<00:00:01.170> gonna<00:00:01.260> make<00:00:01.620> we're<00:00:01.979> going

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
okay so now we're gonna make we're going

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.480 
okay so now we're gonna make we're going
to<00:00:02.129> copy<00:00:02.429> an<00:00:02.939> original<00:00:03.090> VW<00:00:03.959> key<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.529> make<00:00:05.460> a

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
to copy an original VW key and make a

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.680 
to copy an original VW key and make a
duplicate<00:00:06.000> okay<00:00:06.690> so<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.460> software<00:00:09.000> which

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
duplicate okay so in the software which

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:20.779 
duplicate okay so in the software which
shoes<00:00:11.090> Volkswagen<00:00:16.640> let's<00:00:17.640> find<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.970> Jetta<00:00:19.789> in

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
shoes Volkswagen let's find a Jetta in

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.310 
shoes Volkswagen let's find a Jetta in
2005

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.560 

it<00:00:24.800> finds<00:00:25.130> it<00:00:25.460> as<00:00:25.610> a<00:00:25.640> hu<00:00:25.970> 60-66<00:00:26.930> and<00:00:28.570> notice

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
it finds it as a hu 60-66 and notice

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.990 
it finds it as a hu 60-66 and notice
that<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.740> cuts<00:00:30.949> are<00:00:31.130> blank<00:00:31.369> because<00:00:31.730> we

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
that the the cuts are blank because we

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.920 
that the the cuts are blank because we
didn't<00:00:32.210> do<00:00:32.270> anything<00:00:32.480> yet

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
didn't do anything yet

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.510 
didn't do anything yet
right<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:33.470> with<00:00:34.129> VW<00:00:34.520> we<00:00:34.670> is<00:00:34.790> an<00:00:35.210> adapter<00:00:36.520> just

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
right so with VW we is an adapter just

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.650 
right so with VW we is an adapter just
slide<00:00:37.790> that<00:00:37.970> in<00:00:38.030> it<00:00:38.300> only<00:00:38.420> goes<00:00:38.629> in<00:00:38.780> one<00:00:38.809> way

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
slide that in it only goes in one way

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.150 
slide that in it only goes in one way
all<00:00:41.660> right<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.290> we<00:00:42.410> grabbed<00:00:42.650> the<00:00:42.860> original<00:00:43.400> key

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.360 

it's<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.250> shoulder<00:00:49.460> stop<00:00:49.820> with<00:00:50.150> VW<00:00:51.040> and<00:00:52.040> tighten

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
it's a shoulder stop with VW and tighten

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.890 
it's a shoulder stop with VW and tighten
it<00:00:52.430> down<00:00:52.489> you<00:00:53.089> don't<00:00:53.239> need<00:00:53.330> to<00:00:53.449> clamp<00:00:53.660> it<00:00:53.750> too

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
it down you don't need to clamp it too

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.670 
it down you don't need to clamp it too
hard<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.440> then<00:00:55.329> in<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.450> software<00:00:56.870> here<00:00:57.320> we<00:00:57.500> go

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
hard and then in the software here we go

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.220 
hard and then in the software here we go
true<00:00:58.640> actually<00:00:59.059> we<00:00:59.480> need<00:00:59.660> to<00:00:59.809> lower<00:01:00.140> the

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
true actually we need to lower the

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.380 
true actually we need to lower the
tracer<00:01:00.860> all<00:01:01.610> right<00:01:01.730> go<00:01:01.940> ahead<00:01:03.039> and<00:01:04.119> then<00:01:05.119> in

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
tracer all right go ahead and then in

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:14.770 
tracer all right go ahead and then in
the<00:01:05.479> software<00:01:05.810> now<00:01:06.110> we<00:01:06.170> can<00:01:06.380> just<00:01:06.560> trace<00:01:13.690> so<00:01:14.690> it

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
the software now we can just trace so it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:25.740 
the software now we can just trace so it
calibrates<00:01:15.229> itself

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.450 

so<00:01:26.750> now<00:01:26.900> I'm<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.140> software<00:01:27.620> it<00:01:27.920> fills<00:01:28.190> in<00:01:28.340> all

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
so now I'm the software it fills in all

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.130 
so now I'm the software it fills in all
the<00:01:28.880> holes<00:01:29.060> there<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:29.570> now<00:01:29.690> we<00:01:29.750> know<00:01:29.960> what<00:01:30.110> the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
the holes there so now we know what the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.000 
the holes there so now we know what the
cuts<00:01:30.380> were<00:01:30.530> for<00:01:30.800> that<00:01:30.830> original<00:01:31.370> key<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.920> we

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
cuts were for that original key so we

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.780 
cuts were for that original key so we
take<00:01:34.190> out<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.460> original<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:36.170> put<00:01:36.380> in<00:01:36.500> the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
take out the original and put in the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.969 
take out the original and put in the
lift<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.940> tracer<00:01:38.330> and<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.560> head<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:39.710> put<00:01:39.950> it

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
lift the tracer and the head and put it

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.120 
lift the tracer and the head and put it
into<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.880> new<00:01:40.910> key<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.770> blank<00:01:44.770> push<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.920> up<00:01:46.010> to

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
into the new key a blank push it up to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.600 
into the new key a blank push it up to
the<00:01:46.220> shoulder<00:01:46.250> stop<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.920> really<00:01:49.130> all<00:01:49.310> we<00:01:49.460> need

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
the shoulder stop and really all we need

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:00.660 
the shoulder stop and really all we need
to<00:01:49.640> do<00:01:49.850> now<00:01:50.090> is<00:01:50.390> click<00:01:51.200> enter<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:51.770> click<00:01:52.700> start

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:49.730 

calibrates<00:02:01.670> itself<00:02:01.850> every<00:02:02.840> time

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.170 

all<00:02:50.740> right<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.100> let's<00:02:51.280> flip<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.700> key<00:02:51.880> over<00:02:52.030> to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
all right so let's flip the key over to

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:03.559 
all right so let's flip the key over to
the<00:02:52.390> other<00:02:52.450> side

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:04:10.980 

and<00:03:04.569> we<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:04.930> click<00:03:05.140> start

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.050
