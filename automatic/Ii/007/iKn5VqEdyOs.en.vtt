00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:05.629
 wander though a grazing APA 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.759
 van Gaal 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:14.809
 a willow van Gaal ob Klopp 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.359
 everything 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.609
 the Grazer run so alone 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.359
 the rest of the time droves are standing at the front door 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.869
 and just waiting for it 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.669
 that starts again 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:27.779
 and 4 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.130
 if you are proud of something so without pants 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.930
 never 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.469
 those are tested in the wind tunnel, the second main prize 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.660
 as you say 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.030
 TA Nea 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.629
 functional and caught 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.270
 why works 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.690
 that the sweat drips practically drop by drop from the skin 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.120
 is thrown away through the tissue after a break 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.420
 Contributed to the Polo 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.750
 integrated with the curvature of the earth to overlap the lighthouse function 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.940
 Guaranteed, so to speak 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.020
 to see that in the entire Wetterau because when I run into this 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.380
 and headlamp 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.780
 with automatic and penetrating connection 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.600
 Mainz 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.430
 Almost forgetting Mitchell 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.090
 in fact 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.540
 Place frequency Wesel 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.560
 pass over 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.560
 if I can not say anything today, first time 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.720
 No one more than Amore met 3 4 had to take time 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.100
 and the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.190
 87 functions 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.790
 then work through Sofron that the basic functions 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.770
 at least under control 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.800
 but now first rolls up 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.440
 today nine Toft OVAG 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.350
 110 got 3 which means in the last weeks 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.370
 300 grams round 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.249
 it was not so good grade degrees though it happened 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:52.960
 quite simply last Saturday was once invited to the person 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.150
 when friends couple times wife and I and there was gypsy schnitzel 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.150
 with fries 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.150
 So a completely clear situation 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.380
 how else does Pensen have command where do I just have to worry she learns a little 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.299
 here in this situation 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.979
 especially as these schnitzel 1a 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.079
 threatened them 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.179
 baked in the pont 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.089
 There was no holding back 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:18.019
 each 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.700
 holding back would be an insult 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.229
 for the hosts so at the KAC 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.879
 there will always be between by tight it will give for me again 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.169
 and for them too 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.509
 and the only VII stinks that you can handle it 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.479
 that are useful at the moment Chen Kaige lets 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.780
 much more important 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.229
 that one the next morning 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:45.319
 keep doing that bones I do not like letting go like that days 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.269
 petrified 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.029
 the next day with us 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.209
 with SaaS degrees at breakfast 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.099
 Harman on television Marathon SID 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.619
 Frankfurt 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:56.389
 I told him how it was 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.300
 i have until i bad sense 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.299
 because of her on the 8th 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.890
 it had grown more again 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.810
 I said to the woman hop hitch of our car and Rohner to the marathon 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.389
 "That will do us good 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.609
 arrived there 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.450
 Of course, Hamann no longer sees the pencils so he calls them more 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.499
 Runners running in the front 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:21.269
 the erasures that means meeting the people i can be happy when i go 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.239
 this may include raven 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.969
 MÃ¼ller also marathon will be so far it is nice or still 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:33.579
 not if I was here today at the marathon quake then that's why Falsone 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.049
 marathon 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.359
 is very similar to our slimming project, Palmer 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.170
 in both a certain distance behind us so Leahy the more but not from 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.150
 now be dealt with in the same way but we have to see if have 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.749
 divide it and it needs a certain discipline 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.069
 at the marathon it is so 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.979
 Let's make those 42 kilometers each one kilometer after that 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:05.399
 to run for others as we write Euro for Volvo and a note 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:07.610
 the us then the goal 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.670
 The next stage is accompanied by the discipline of the marathon itself 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.620
 the new very strict 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.739
 must meet its timelines 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.760
 because at the beginning it has been well trained and is totally endangered too 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:23.800
 to run fast 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.970
 only one and a half times as fast on but in the last part of the track has 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.270
 this actually gamer fatal consequences speak one breaks in and 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.590
 at worst you do not reach the goal 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.289
 This is exactly how SMIM behaves 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.710
 in the past Heidi Schommer in the first week 4 now became three 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.009
 Kilo decreased but then it was 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.229
 it has dead 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.870
 because the body has reacted very sensitively to this lack of situation 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.979
 means I have to in narrow FrÃ¶se and has afterwards more kilos on the stairs 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.939
 as before, if so thought 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.769
 whether the amount of her weight loss is not too little like her 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.379
 that looks like she's more on the project 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.669
 the largest share 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.669
 now it seems to save 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.680
 then there are many 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.580
 and he does not run too fast 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.719
 namely the danger exists 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.270
 the goal 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.309
 to reach 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:25.029
 and they want to reach the goal as well 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:27.689
 the guests 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.469
 and what else is there to say about this trip to Frankfurt 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:33.689
 never do that again 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:38.559
 The marathon fair is the marathon fair that is practically in the 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:43.139
 Sale of all sites that have to deal with and 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.479
 it's the total bargain prices 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.029
 3 Frankfurt Poser Ate the disaster 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.740
 therefore get to 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.740
 as we old 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.809
 who bought beautiful new things 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:06:06.369
 We are optimistic because no lighter a bike this increase 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:08.189
 Come on this marathon 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:13.110
 there are a few he was a great place is Arnold bodyguard running 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.919
 There you would also join in and maybe 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.099
 rather a next year here the area 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:20.819
 and now about homework 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.409
 What moves you Young, please go to Lakis until the next market 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.809
 to do a super-combo Enser Tor tables boosting as you say 

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:31.229
 in fact 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:32.520
 20 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.439
 25 and 30 minutes each move 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:39.439
 What's she saying goes on three days of DAX 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.069
 meat 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:46.550
 also three days exp and alcohol if they otherwise drink some 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:49.469
 Smoot Fahrenheit 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:53.389
 Wish you nice weeks until next Saturday when it's time again 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.330
 slim and fit with even stopping 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.610
 Wow 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.419
 wander a pasture
