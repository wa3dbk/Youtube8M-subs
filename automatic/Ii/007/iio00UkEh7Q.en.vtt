00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.800 
result what was wondering what exactly
happens<00:01:38.159> when<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.460> never<00:01:38.790> knew<00:01:38.970> what<00:01:39.509> happens<00:01:39.780> a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
happens when I never knew what happens a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.780 
happens when I never knew what happens a
little<00:01:39.869> bit<00:01:40.110> he<00:01:40.860> reappears<00:01:41.340> all<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.579> sudden

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
little bit he reappears all the sudden

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.270 
little bit he reappears all the sudden
so<00:01:42.060> its<00:01:42.329> variants<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.950> I'm<00:01:44.100> just

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
so its variants and see that so I'm just

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.789 
so its variants and see that so I'm just
saying<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.549> kind<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.930> makes<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.170> theory<00:01:46.439> more

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
saying it kind of makes that theory more

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.010 
saying it kind of makes that theory more
plausible<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:47.610> maybe<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.149> possibly<00:01:48.659> anyway

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
plausible now maybe but possibly anyway

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.950 
plausible now maybe but possibly anyway
so<00:01:49.079> I'm<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.860> saying<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.850> could<00:01:50.880> that's<00:01:51.810> like

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
so I'm just saying it could that's like

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.600 
so I'm just saying it could that's like
I<00:01:52.049> still<00:01:52.290> fly<00:01:52.439> more<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.829> obito's<00:01:53.250> character

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
I still fly more to obito's character

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.130 
I still fly more to obito's character

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
to get a healer because thing is the

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.010 
to get a healer because thing is the
reason<00:04:51.090> why<00:04:51.180> he<00:04:51.300> went<00:04:51.449> over<00:04:51.660> that's<00:04:51.840> that

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
reason why he went over that's that

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.510 
reason why he went over that's that
battlefield<00:04:52.289> to<00:04:52.650> go<00:04:52.770> get<00:04:52.919> healer<00:04:53.250> because

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
battlefield to go get healer because

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.249 
battlefield to go get healer because
he's<00:04:53.669> going<00:04:53.880> to<00:04:54.000> stabilize<00:04:54.479> not<00:04:54.810> so<00:04:55.020> for<00:04:55.199> the

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
he's going to stabilize not so for the

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.960 
he's going to stabilize not so for the
time<00:04:55.440> being<00:04:55.800> until<00:04:56.039> he<00:04:56.340> probably<00:04:56.580> gets<00:04:56.789> you

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
time being until he probably gets you

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.510 
time being until he probably gets you
not<00:04:57.180> so<00:04:57.419> so<00:04:57.630> you<00:04:57.930> got<00:04:58.050> something<00:04:58.380> give<00:04:58.560> him<00:04:58.830> the

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
not so so you got something give him the

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.430 
not so so you got something give him the
other<00:04:59.610> part<00:04:59.910> of<00:05:00.060> chroma<00:05:00.330> chakra<00:05:00.840> so<00:05:01.289> I<00:05:01.320> think

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
other part of chroma chakra so I think

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.779 
other part of chroma chakra so I think
that's<00:05:01.800> why<00:05:02.009> I<00:05:02.039> went<00:05:02.190> over<00:05:02.400> there<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.610> first

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
that's why I went over there the first

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.279 
that's why I went over there the first
place<00:05:02.970> me<00:05:03.180> trying<00:05:03.360> it's<00:05:03.539> not<00:05:03.599> a<00:05:03.810> person<00:05:04.199> either

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289
