00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:08.309
 greetings youtubers today's video 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:13.190
 will try to change the password of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.609
 any user of windows 8 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.020
 if you do not know the key through the 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:24.700
 system or cmd symbol 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.370
 let's see this method involves drinking 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.980
 talk let's go to the video first of all 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.750
 I already have this user with a 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.040
 password 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:39.420
 as you can see and your password is fire 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.420
 and I do not care they can not enter 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.200
 then close the session and I will make an account 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.920
 he does not see the six whether that has me 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.780
 forgotten or because my sister has come 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.170
 to annoy patience and has changed me 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.600
 the key so that he does not use the computer 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.600
 easy being in another user 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.480
 example in the administrator 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.760
 I go to the command prompt and executed him 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.660
 as administrator 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.900
 and 1st use the following command net 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:17.320
 poster of reality not necessary since 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.930
 it's actually called ism in 1992 but 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.430
 I may have previously 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.800
 changed the name of this user and that 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.160
 the main name and it has been smile for 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.870
 example and now it's called in 1992 in this 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.850
 case the computer will recognize this 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.290
 user like ismael alone so 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.979
 to change the password simply 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.670
 We have to do this 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.330
 write net user 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.840
 in 1992 it does not matter if you created a 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.840
 uppercase or lowercase 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.890
 space 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.659
 and asterisk 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.740
 as you can see it says I write a 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.899
 password for the user 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.939
 When you type the password, do not 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.229
 will show but if you are 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.729
 rewriting the password so 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.340
 they have to think about it when they are 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.179
 writing I will write one more name 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.179
 long for what 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.960
 so you can notice fire had 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.360
 five characters now this will have more 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.360
 I will put architecture 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.610
 if I give a enter it tells me that it 's going back to 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.610
 write to confirm 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.810
 the command has been completed 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.810
 correctly 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.400
 and now I'm going 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.370
 I close session or trying to access the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.709
 user if I write fire 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.709
 nothing happens but if I write here 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.770
 architecture 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.000
 has entered 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:59.270
 youtubers the use they give you 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.890
 it will depend on you already know so 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.930
 less if it served you as a comment there 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.790
 although it 's a like something lets leave 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.990
 something see you in a next video 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.490
 remember to share it also in your 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.490
 social networks until next time
