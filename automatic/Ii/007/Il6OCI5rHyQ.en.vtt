 b 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.549
 ddp 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:19.579
 I think we are on one 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.999
 Horton «We need to banks in Oschersleben or 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:24.950
 Rainer Bogs 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.189
 with the pain-relieving 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.970
 and rained as Gloria 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.319
 yes and there 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.400
 that may seem pretty 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.840
 Dan, it's really sad 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.490
 every time it is said so it is still no longer a compromise 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.499
 but now 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:43.519
 Geithner in the full and make everything that goes once 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.600
 and 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 14 times shortly before the finish 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.220
 or they had everything prepared for today are already before others in the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.060
 following 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.390
 are for this purpose and to assemble 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.720
 Fenders and we are on it 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.770
 Fri. 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.440
 Jansen know 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.680
 it is like always here in Neuenkirchen everyone helps everybody and then just before 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.640
 Others do not call staff killed while growing up and then come 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.640
 Although I found application, I think he will be all right 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.670
 apparently knew 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.740
 I did everything else 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.740
 So he has spoken to me that it is out now unfortunately 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.000
 that made ours complete the title of the book. No we can 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.360
 also in writing in peace 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.830
 important here is actually 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.810
 that's a splash 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.710
 not far away 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.150
 immediately stood 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.000
 Children will find trillions of interactive platforms 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.320
 and 93 it can 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.320
 the design should actually be melted 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.200
 she is said to have stood for 40 years Anneliese's son in the sun 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.210
 that would have happened 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.060
 really experienced a lot 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.060
 and now Aubert 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.380
 combined with 1 6 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.350
 this mixture 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.119
 we've been busy with success so many 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.369
 slow down 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:14.709
 the continuation so everything we wanted what us 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.969
 al Bundy Menker footrests our 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.790
 I have the motto Rad in Hamburg also good of others you can then first 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.839
 be supported immediately and then do everything else 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.629
 who made a lot of handcraft very very diverse needs to know it 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.459
 So save ahead 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.450
 Löhr wanted to start driving laps 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.530
 This courage was necessarily driven where the engines and technology 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.219
 I immediately felt at ease on the retreat when you got on the play 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:44.899
 already stuff is sat 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:46.079
 but of course know 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:46.810
 even though 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.699
 precise steering 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:52.420
 Per cent really that and the engine is a poem that you had to 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.780
 how much because as a man I had the impression that he was not with the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.780
 Internet is connected and if you call the name then you call Tel 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.939
 One would have wanted this incredible thing so that it does not follow suit 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.939
 ahead 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:08.939
 he does not want to be on the 2nd 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.169
 the advantage 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:11.989
 all people to the World Cup 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.779
 have worked with the medal winning project 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.009
 a year 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.009
 Notes under Tel 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:22.659
 Andrä traffic is 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.719
 in this connection 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.719
 PPR 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:32.119
 The about 80 euros ready 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.869
 the word mark 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.869
 Michael harmful 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.169
 continues to receive 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.989
 de Maizière I hold 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.139
 who necessarily held a long speech 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.609
 expect the same 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.609
 Chevrolet Volt 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.889
 the environment 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:04.579
