serious<00:03:10.710> will<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.280> know<00:03:11.460> as<00:03:11.610> forest<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.240> by

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
serious will you know as forest and by

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.940 
serious will you know as forest and by
the<00:03:12.360> way<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.570> think<00:03:12.750> magic<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.410> just<00:03:13.650> trying<00:03:13.890> to

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
the way I think magic is just trying to

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.550 
the way I think magic is just trying to
go<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.490> ladies<00:03:14.940> into<00:03:15.540> responding<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:16.470> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
go the ladies into responding to the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.950 
go the ladies into responding to the
Clippers<00:03:16.920> maybe<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.330> wouldn't<00:03:18.330> go<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.600> far<00:03:18.660> he

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
Clippers maybe I wouldn't go that far he

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.360 
Clippers maybe I wouldn't go that far he
definitely<00:03:19.350> wants<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.620> Lakers<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.010> respond

definitely wants the Lakers to respond

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.580 
definitely wants the Lakers to respond
to<00:03:20.520> the<00:03:20.610> Clippers<00:03:20.970> but<00:03:21.240> they<00:03:21.540> are<00:03:21.720> not<00:03:21.960> just<00:03:22.380> a

to the Clippers but they are not just a

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.530 
to the Clippers but they are not just a

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
playoff team they won't win the excuse

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.150
