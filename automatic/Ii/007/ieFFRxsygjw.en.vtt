and send them on missions to kind of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.750 
and send them on missions to kind of
guard<00:00:39.899> different<00:00:40.320> strongholds<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.040> kind<00:00:41.700> of

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
guard different strongholds and kind of

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.910 
guard different strongholds and kind of
look<00:00:42.000> after<00:00:42.450> different<00:00:42.780> areas<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.739> that's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
look after different areas so that's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.290 
look after different areas so that's
pretty<00:00:44.129> cool<00:00:44.340> similar<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> throwback<00:00:45.120> I

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
pretty cool similar to a throwback I

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.760 
pretty cool similar to a throwback I
guess<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> Brotherhood<00:00:46.350> system<00:00:46.649> in

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
guess to the Brotherhood system in

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.080 
guess to the Brotherhood system in
Revelations<00:00:47.430> where<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.670> could<00:00:47.789> assign

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
Revelations where you could assign

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.930 
Revelations where you could assign
master<00:00:48.629> assassins<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.800> certain<00:00:50.460> assassin

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
master assassins to certain assassin

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.760 
master assassins to certain assassin
towers<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.050> way<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.410> kind<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.649> I'm

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
towers so this way you can kind of I'm

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.139 
towers so this way you can kind of I'm
not<00:00:52.920> sure<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.340> single<00:00:53.699> person<00:00:54.120> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
not sure if it's a single person you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.420 
not sure if it's a single person you
send<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.989> your<00:00:55.050> gang<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.590> hold<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.399> a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
send in your gang to hold it on to a

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.799 
send in your gang to hold it on to a
stronghold<00:00:56.670> kind<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> little<00:00:57.449> gang

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
stronghold kind of like a little gang

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.930 
stronghold kind of like a little gang
squad<00:00:58.199> I'm<00:00:58.980> not<00:00:59.190> sure<00:00:59.370> how<00:00:59.550> that's<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.879> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
squad I'm not sure how that's going to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.760 
squad I'm not sure how that's going to
work<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.270> its<00:01:00.449> individual<00:01:01.020> squad<00:01:01.440> members

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
work with its individual squad members

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.009 
work with its individual squad members
or<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> whole<00:01:02.760> group<00:01:03.030> because<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> seems<00:01:03.930> like

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
or a whole group because it seems like

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.780 
or a whole group because it seems like
you<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.290> more<00:01:04.589> squad<00:01:05.070> members<00:01:05.430> than<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you have more squad members than you

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.090 
you have more squad members than you
would<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.439> previous<00:01:07.439> Assassin's<00:01:07.860> Creed's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
would in previous Assassin's Creed's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.830 
would in previous Assassin's Creed's
that<00:01:08.280> you'd<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.520> Brotherhood<00:01:09.119> assassins

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
that you'd have Brotherhood assassins

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.929 
that you'd have Brotherhood assassins
with<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.979> most<00:01:11.130> you've<00:01:11.310> ever<00:01:11.400> had<00:01:11.640> like

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
15 12 to 15 or something when in this it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.380 
15 12 to 15 or something when in this it
looks<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.670> there<00:01:14.790> might<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:14.939> even<00:01:15.150> more

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
looks like there might be even more

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.240 
looks like there might be even more
which<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.600> very<00:01:15.869> interesting<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.560> you'll

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
be able to pick them up I guess through

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.090 
be able to pick them up I guess through
our<00:01:19.049> missions<00:01:19.409> I'm<00:01:19.530> not<00:01:19.650> sure<00:01:19.770> whether<00:01:19.890> it's

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
our missions I'm not sure whether it's

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.859

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
Creed 3 had so that's going to be

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.270 
Creed 3 had so that's going to be
interesting<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:28.650> how<00:01:28.680> actually<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.189> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
interesting to see how actually going to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.620
