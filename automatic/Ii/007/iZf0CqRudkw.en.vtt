00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.719 
watch it start to finish it's 100% run
and<00:01:45.680> we<00:01:46.680> show<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.579> everything

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
and we show a little of everything

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.319 
and we show a little of everything
although<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.390> don't<00:01:48.509> show<00:01:48.780> every<00:01:49.170> single<00:01:50.329> like

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
although we don't show every single like

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.030 
although we don't show every single like
side<00:01:51.720> mission<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.649> they<00:01:52.890> get<00:01:53.009> a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
side mission because they they get a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.410 
side mission because they they get a
little<00:01:53.250> repetitive<00:01:53.369> that's<00:01:54.090> one<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
little repetitive that's one of the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510 
little repetitive that's one of the
advantages<00:01:54.509> you'll<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.399> won't
