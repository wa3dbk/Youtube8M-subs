00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that was my bug-out bag on and I liked

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.760 
that was my bug-out bag on and I liked
because<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.120> was<00:00:45.210> really<00:00:45.450> flat<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.620> only

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
because it was really flat it's only

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.650

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
little bit more reliable than a kel-tec

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.910

you<00:02:04.060> know<00:02:04.179> short<00:02:04.739> distance<00:02:05.739> it<00:02:05.860> has<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:06.009> broader

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
you know short distance it has a broader

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.539 
you know short distance it has a broader
head<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:06.880> on<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.470> flatter<00:02:08.470> nose<00:02:08.829> so<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.399> has

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
head and on it flatter nose so it has

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:15.150

itself with the gun weighs right around
8<00:04:09.799> pounds<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.519> think<00:04:10.700> something<00:04:11.180> like<00:04:11.269> that

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
8 pounds I think something like that

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.819 
8 pounds I think something like that
with<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.840> ammo<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.230> everything<00:04:12.680> you're

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
with the ammo and everything you're

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.360 
with the ammo and everything you're
probably<00:04:13.010> going<00:04:13.250> closer<00:04:13.579> to<00:04:13.760> 15<00:04:14.120> pounds<00:04:14.690> so<00:04:15.370> I

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
probably going closer to 15 pounds so I

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.589 
probably going closer to 15 pounds so I
need<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.090> get<00:04:17.239> my<00:04:17.799> bug-out<00:04:18.799> bag<00:04:19.070> down<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:20.450> about

wanted<00:05:15.080> enough<00:05:15.409> to<00:05:15.849> make<00:05:16.849> sure<00:05:16.999> when<00:05:17.209> I<00:05:17.240> got<00:05:17.419> to

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
wanted enough to make sure when I got to

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.269

where<00:05:17.659> I<00:05:17.689> was<00:05:17.839> going<00:05:18.169> I<00:05:18.259> still<00:05:18.469> had<00:05:18.589> ammo<00:05:19.009> and

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:19.279 
where I was going I still had ammo and

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.689 
where I was going I still had ammo and
because<00:05:20.149> I<00:05:20.240> don't<00:05:20.389> have<00:05:20.649> any<00:05:21.649> 10<00:05:21.919> 22s<00:05:22.429> on<00:05:22.580> our

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
because I don't have any 10 22s on our

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.339 
because I don't have any 10 22s on our
