 rather unusual situation of stripes 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.190
 of a screen but there are situations 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.590
 much more common as 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:48.629

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.530
 bottom of a bag the rubbing of your 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.059

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.040
 it's simple here's how to proceed 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.720
 start by turning off your device and 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.910
 let it cool for a few 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.020
 minutes 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.150
 clean with microfiber cloth 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.630
 the dusts that are arranged on 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.190
 your screen otherwise you take the 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.200
 armand liquid wipe and you 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.570
 apply it on your screen for ten 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.700
 at twenty seconds basic in water is 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.800
 always in the same direction 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.290
 you only have to wait one night 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.830
 for the product to take effect and the 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.390
 you're done 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.850
 leaked armor acts as a protection 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.860
 invisible and very effective screen your 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.360
 phone is completely protected from 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.040
 shocks and stripes and here you are 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.560

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.710
 in other words pead is like board to 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.710
