00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.959
 if one with her cat from Glems next to it 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:19.400
 Nowhere is Dorsten Bosnier cutting off hair for more than 20 years 

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:20.359
 also good 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.630
 the straight 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.519
 APA 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.480
 So I like him for a long time I have too much beautiful 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.130
 that is expressiveness in East Hessen of the potential of 4 lifework 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.580
 the first right to talk about debt relief and he 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.400
 The hairdresser recognized this comparison 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.450
 Â«Pulled by the hairÂ» 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.920
 if it somehow enacted with schools and then I can do this 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 Not to understand at all, termed and not understood 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.180
 Basically, therefore, things also have to be trivialized 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.460
 At the Hertie School of Governance, a study on Herkert 12 was in progress 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.120
 Christof Trepesch has for the first time all state failures of the past 40 years 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.850
 examined 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.180
 and initially reassure that the series found out that they are too 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.120
 a debt crisis in addition to much higher than often assumed 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.880
 In the view of the judge leadership has been around since the 80s 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.000
 we see that it 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.520
 in many countries this year 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.020
 even in many countries this crisis could be overcome 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.990
 even the barber had to cope with some problems 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.390
 that gave months into my life where i did not have camera for the money and that 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.490
 what is not finished with wanted 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.800
 Background could have come from the outside 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.950
 that does not exist all there was no help I had to watch as I did so 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.500
 klarkomme and Herne 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.850
 and I've often stood at the hind legs and tried this 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.690
 Debt due to the long needed 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.580
 I am Goodman debt free today and I would never go back to school 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.690
 do 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.680
 and he is fisherman stabbing one's hair namely his customers 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 like only a little 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.320
 it's better for business 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.450
 to come to natural gas to cut off routine cut off too much 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.839
 and to come less often 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.839
 I'm an entrepreneur, of course, watching that I come back 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.459
 what year 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.459
 is unimportant 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.569
 From this method is the debt expert 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.359
 but not convinced 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.359
 that certainly does not make it a salami tactic 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.559
 one calls oneself the 60 decides 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.519
 reschedule 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.939
 that our appeals are great "but for Greece 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.599
 is certainly the donor newspaper he had decided Asia 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.589
 too low 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.569
 in the long term, a solution to the problem 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.989
 to bring about debt problems 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.879
 is not carried in the grave 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.879
 and really the television sustainability to secure financing 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:02.750
 the big Viennese chamber recommends the expert as exactly in the debtor then 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.620
 for years 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.569
 no longer creditworthy 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.479
 if it should be so and he measures that totally because he has problems 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.929
 and I should have succeeded again I certainly do not want to do that of course 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:15.759
 do not do 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.759
 So I put it on if but it is probably not one 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.959
 That's exactly what the expert found out in his study 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:26.819
 the countries that have made a big debt cut 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.580
 had to wait an average of 20 years before returning money in the capital market 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.119
 to get 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.199
 if my heart pates are more than 60 percent 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.689
 So losses the players are 60 percent that much closer than you 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.669
 Losses she has only 30 percent or less 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:43.729
 if so 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.369
 the speeds in which one hand hangs back on fresh capital hangs 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:48.519
 very much off 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.299
 Georgen is ill 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.299
 The frieze advises, for example, in Greek 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.290
 Be optimistic about what I've heard 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.629
 the symbol of corruption takes place 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.629
 and I think that should be eliminated first 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.569
 Balve everything not so easy in debt countries 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.629
 with and without debt restructuring 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.059
 the master craftsman definitely wishes them
