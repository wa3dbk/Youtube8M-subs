nice thing where it's a nice thick joint

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.400 
nice thing where it's a nice thick joint
going<00:02:17.180> in<00:02:17.300> how<00:02:17.450> many<00:02:17.600> times<00:02:17.780> did<00:02:17.960> I<00:02:18.020> say<00:02:18.170> nice

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
going in how many times did I say nice

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.340 
going in how many times did I say nice
there<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.580> also<00:02:19.610> get<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.420> hinge<00:02:21.020> at<00:02:21.260> the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
there and you also get this hinge at the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.220 
there and you also get this hinge at the
wrist<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.700> like<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.180> because<00:02:23.420> when<00:02:24.110> you

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
wrist and I like that because when you

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.520 
wrist and I like that because when you
do<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:24.590> he's<00:02:25.520> got<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:26.000> bit<00:02:26.450> more<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.960> I'm

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
do this he's got a bit more of a I'm

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.040 
do this he's got a bit more of a I'm
about<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.100> do<00:02:28.280> something<00:02:28.580> look<00:02:29.000> with<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.510> I've

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
about to do something look with the I've

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.670 
about to do something look with the I've
got<00:02:30.350> fingers<00:02:30.800> hands<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:32.270> can

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
got fingers hands and you can

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.750 
got fingers hands and you can
approximate<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.710> pose<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.250> which<00:02:34.400> you'd<00:02:34.610> be

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
approximate a pose in which you'd be

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.410 
approximate a pose in which you'd be
deploying<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.750> getter<00:02:36.080> Wing<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:37.210> these<00:02:38.210> get

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
deploying the getter Wing and these get

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.480 
deploying the getter Wing and these get
her<00:02:38.540> wing<00:02:38.750> pieces<00:02:39.020> very<00:02:39.800> interesting<00:02:40.310> design

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
her wing pieces very interesting design

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.670 
her wing pieces very interesting design
it's<00:02:41.150> very<00:02:41.390> practical<00:02:41.630> they<00:02:42.080> just<00:02:42.260> peg<00:02:42.470> right

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
it's very practical they just peg right

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.890 
it's very practical they just peg right
in<00:02:42.860> here<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.390> unfortunately<00:02:44.390> due<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.720> the

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
in here and unfortunately due to the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.530 
in here and unfortunately due to the
plastic<00:02:45.290> tolerances<00:02:46.120> sometimes<00:02:47.120> they<00:02:47.270> go<00:02:47.390> and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
plastic tolerances sometimes they go and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.930 
plastic tolerances sometimes they go and
flush<00:02:47.870> like<00:02:48.140> this<00:02:48.410> which<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.680> nice<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.400> then

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
flush like this which is nice and then

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.560 
flush like this which is nice and then
sometimes<00:02:50.510> it's<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.620> little<00:02:52.010> bit<00:02:52.100> more<00:02:52.250> work

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
sometimes it's a little bit more work

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.229 
sometimes it's a little bit more work
I've<00:02:53.570> pushed<00:02:53.840> these<00:02:54.050> in<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.620> out<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:55.220> lot<00:02:55.520> but

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
I've pushed these in and out a lot but

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.030 
I've pushed these in and out a lot but
sometimes<00:02:56.630> I<00:02:56.750> still<00:02:56.870> get<00:02:57.020> like<00:02:57.200> a<00:02:57.230> gap<00:02:57.530> here

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
sometimes I still get like a gap here

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.770 
sometimes I still get like a gap here
which<00:02:58.310> is<00:02:58.459> bigger<00:02:58.700> than<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.000> gap<00:02:59.150> here<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.720> I

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
which is bigger than the gap here and I

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.570 
which is bigger than the gap here and I
kind<00:03:00.440> of<00:03:00.560> wish<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:00.860> didn't<00:03:01.130> but<00:03:01.280> at<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.400> same

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
kind of wish I didn't but at the same

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.449 
kind of wish I didn't but at the same
time<00:03:01.880> these<00:03:02.300> are<00:03:03.340> relatively<00:03:04.340> inexpensive

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
time these are relatively inexpensive

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.340 
time these are relatively inexpensive
for<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.270> sheer<00:03:05.450> amount<00:03:05.540> of<00:03:05.720> plastic<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.230> you

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
for the sheer amount of plastic that you

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.440 
for the sheer amount of plastic that you
get<00:03:06.560> he's<00:03:07.100> got<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:07.400> incredible<00:03:08.090> silhouette

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
get he's got this incredible silhouette

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.560 
get he's got this incredible silhouette
on<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.810> back<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.260> if<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:10.310> use<00:03:10.610> him<00:03:10.850> in<00:03:11.090> tandem

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
on the back and if you use him in tandem

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.800 
on the back and if you use him in tandem
with<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:12.080> base<00:03:12.290> then<00:03:13.130> this<00:03:13.580> dude<00:03:13.820> is<00:03:14.120> floating

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
with the base then this dude is floating

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.320 
with the base then this dude is floating
ready<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.830> deliver<00:03:16.190> one<00:03:16.489> of<00:03:16.670> his<00:03:16.820> ultimate

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
attacks the getter beam and since he

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.570 
attacks the getter beam and since he
doesn't<00:03:20.420> have<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.660> giant<00:03:21.230> horrifying<00:03:21.890> peg<00:03:22.310> hole

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
very painless head swap I was afraid it

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
make sure it's angled up so it doesn't

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.400 
make sure it's angled up so it doesn't
just<00:05:29.920> fall<00:05:30.310> off<00:05:30.520> and<00:05:30.880> it<00:05:31.570> sits<00:05:31.810> very<00:05:31.990> loosely

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
just fall off and it sits very loosely

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.070 
just fall off and it sits very loosely
so<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.800> can<00:05:32.980> literally<00:05:33.490> spin<00:05:34.270> it<00:05:34.420> and

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
so that you can literally spin it and

this actually kind of works until you do

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.800 
this actually kind of works until you do

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
that it's very loose some might ask why

that it's very loose some might ask why
are<00:05:40.840> there<00:05:41.050> two<00:05:41.200> blades<00:05:41.530> on<00:05:41.710> there<00:05:41.890> this<00:05:42.040> is

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
are there two blades on there this is

I<00:05:43.090> don't<00:05:43.270> think<00:05:43.770> both<00:05:44.770> tomahawks<00:05:45.400> put

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
I don't think both tomahawks put

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.100 
I don't think both tomahawks put
together<00:05:45.730> it's<00:05:46.060> just<00:05:46.150> that<00:05:46.390> this<00:05:46.570> way<00:05:46.810> you<00:05:46.870> can

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
together it's just that this way you can

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.860 
together it's just that this way you can
more<00:05:47.440> so<00:05:47.680> approximate<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:49.150> look<00:05:49.390> of<00:05:49.690> a

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870
