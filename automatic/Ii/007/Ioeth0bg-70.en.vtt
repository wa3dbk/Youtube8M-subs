00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:11.240
 well here we have the images of the 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.969
 recording that we made specifically 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:20.050
 this past Friday they can be 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:22.630
 see several objects vibrating in the distance 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.570
 finally and after several months 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.120
 investigating the area we have achieved 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.210
 get this recording this recording 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.750
 born from an effort to have been there 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.030
 enough hours with witnesses people who 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.950
 had the opportunity to see it and what in 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.680
 she appears are several objects in the 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.590
 distance vibrating 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.940
 I know there are many images on the internet 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.560
 some of them are generated by 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.580
 computer and other of them are 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.380
 Fraudulent Made with Light Effects 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.430
 but what you are seeing here is what 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.510
 We could see last Friday 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.150
 specifically on the line of 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.320
 horizon in which some lights appear 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.030
 dancing the image is focused is the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.130
 camera that was being recorded 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.979
 is ready to record in the 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.290
 infinite at long distance with what 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.899
 which does not exist blur if you see a 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:23.890
 strong vibration is because we are 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:26.020
 recording with a zoom by 36 optical 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.490
 with a camera specifically with the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.380
 500 coolpix model is not a camera 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.680
 that allows us to record so 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.479
 optimally night but yes that has 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.780
 given the opportunity to record this light 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.170
 Here we see how the light or the lights 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.170
 luminaires 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.770
 they dance they produce a kind of dance 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.380
 among them are merged in some 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.940
 occasions generating a more vivid color 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.190
 maybe reddish those lights are separated into 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.940
 some moments like the one we 're going to see 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.330
 right now and you get good then a 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.790
 strange effect that really not 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.950
 we know what corresponds we have been 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.050
 investigating the area and it is true that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.060
 from time immemorial on the site in 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.480
 question are already seen and 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.970
 reporting strange lights finally 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.280
 thanks to the collaboration of some 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.500
 people of the area and of course the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.989
 work of approaching late hours of 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.540
 the early morning for several months to be able 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.660
 and finally to observe them as 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.520
 you are watching record them well then we 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.360
 show everyone 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.930
 what what can be a first 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.680
 recording of a luminaire or a light 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.170
 of mafasca or the light of the pardal or the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.310
 sucks that they call some in 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.790
 sudamÃ©rica the famous luminaires 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.150
 see the entire Iberian Peninsula 'well this 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.130
 It is the first recording of one of them 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.170
 we have tried what we try to obtain 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.590
 photographs we have some interesting 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.880
 that we will also show the image 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.850
 what are you watching 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.970
 well then 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.730
 you see like a kind of nervous dance 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.100
 that exist between these lights were 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.140
 a considerable distance but the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.220
 powerful camera zoom allowed us 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.040
 record it 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.330
 the light appeared and disappeared 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.350
 intermittently , it cost us a lot 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.360
 be able to locate the location of the light 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.820
 until finally we have been able 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.340
 record the the mount on a tripod 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.750
 a tripod that is not a 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.000
 wonder but yes that allowed us 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.490
 handle one relatively 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.770
 static is the image the movement 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.810
 fast you see right to left 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.450
 is produced by video editing 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.850
 since this what you are seeing is 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.520
 only one magnification of the 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.830
 original recording we have not touched 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.160
 absolutely nothing nor have we modified 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:05.790
 nothing a recording there is clearly seen 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.180
 the people of the area have asked us not to 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.430
 let's give the location where these lights 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.700
 they are or where these lights 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.640
 appear likewise we have deleted the 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.560
 original audio in which among others 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.680
 people I appear and two others 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.060
 researchers that good because of the 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.920
 degree of excitement 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.770
 Well, we are quite surprised 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.770
 and really we find it a bit until 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.180
 uncomfortable to show you the recording 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.350
 original maybe over time what 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:41.060
 let's do it but well observe these 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.060
 lights that dance that occurs 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.010
 in order that you know that from our more 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.980
 sincere our only credit is our 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.810
 obviously 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.450
 but tell them that this recording and these 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.990
 images are totally original here 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:59.090
 there is no fake here there is no there is no 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.160
 kind of cg and no nonsense of these 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.440
 that is dynamiting the phenomenon every 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.529
 more time inside the internet 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.229
 all right 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:11.979
 here already at this moment of the recording 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:14.949
 totally lost light light 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.229
 changed we went with the 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.339
 camera to another location we went towards 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.339
 another site where they were appearing 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:23.019
 other dim lights we try 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.719
 record them because we thought they were 

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:28.929
 closer but the camera because 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:31.829
 it does not have good contrast and a lot does not have 

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:35.319
 a great sensitivity did not allow us 

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:38.409
 properly locate the other lights 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.509
 of which we spoke finally decided 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:43.179
 point to the moon to look for a point 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:46.419
 reference and then at that time 

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:48.519
 the lights stop showing up you can 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:52.600
 observe the moon how is it going to look at 

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:55.060
 brief moments trying to recover 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.190
 the location of what the camera was 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.460
 recording and here you can clearly see 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:03.750
 how he tried to focus the moon I focus 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.500
 you see that there is no 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.300
 blur the camera was infinity 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.910
 and you can see with this camera with a 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.740
 zoom x 36 that have a wonderful tone 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.860
 optical you can see perfectly the 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.110
 moon and its craters well there there 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.720
 you have it 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.380
 and in short all this that I am telling the 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.940
 truth to us it turned out to be quite 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.920
 spectacular we had not had the 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.140
 opportunity to record to make a 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.390
 UFO recording like the one we have 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.780
 shown although it is true that we had 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.100
 had the opportunity to see UFOs as 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.110
 throughout our lives in certain 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.170
 circumstances we had never had the 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.660
 opportunity to record them so 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.040
 clear and so obvious here you can 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.810
 appreciate how the camera is capable of 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.090
 record the moon with a certain degree of 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.710
 sharpness with enough interest is a 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.300
 camera as I said I have a 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.430
 very powerful zoom 'possibly from the 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.490
 compact cameras is the one that has the 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:02.370
 zoom more powerful and good then after 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.850
 be brave told all this well 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:07.740
 without saying goodbye to you and we 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.160
 we see until the next video program 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.160
 goodbye
