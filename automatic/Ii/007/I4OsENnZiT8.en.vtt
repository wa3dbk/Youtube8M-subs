00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
three three elements are being worked at

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.130 
three three elements are being worked at
the<00:03:49.829> same<00:03:50.040> time<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.900> that<00:03:53.690> getting<00:03:54.690> rid<00:03:55.019> of

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
the same time and that getting rid of

the same time and that getting rid of
the<00:03:55.260> diet<00:03:55.560> mentality<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.700> not<00:03:56.879> worrying<00:03:57.269> so

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
the diet mentality and not worrying so

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.410 
the diet mentality and not worrying so
much<00:03:57.540> about<00:03:57.660> numbers<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:59.209> probably<00:04:00.209> the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
much about numbers is probably the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.849 
much about numbers is probably the
greatest<00:04:01.849> freedom<00:04:02.849> that<00:04:03.120> I've<00:04:03.239> had<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.959> it's

greatest freedom that I've had and it's

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:15.119 
greatest freedom that I've had and it's
resulted<00:04:05.579> in<00:04:05.849> positive<00:04:06.799> changes<00:04:07.799> for<00:04:08.340> me

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.930 

the<00:04:16.030> greatest<00:04:16.299> thing<00:04:16.660> has<00:04:16.840> been<00:04:17.049> knowledge

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
the greatest thing has been knowledge
