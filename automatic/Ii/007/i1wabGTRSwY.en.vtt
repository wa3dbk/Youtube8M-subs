okay<00:00:01.319> here's<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.850> mathematical<00:00:02.850> induction

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
okay here's a mathematical induction

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.410 
okay here's a mathematical induction
problem<00:00:04.049> that<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:04.710> was<00:00:05.040> asked<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.549> solve<00:00:06.029> and

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
problem that I was asked to solve and

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.540 
problem that I was asked to solve and
I've<00:00:06.899> got<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.080> solution<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:07.740> it's<00:00:07.950> not<00:00:08.160> too

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
I've got a solution to this it's not too

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.459 
I've got a solution to this it's not too
hard<00:00:08.910> we're<00:00:09.599> going<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.750> solve<00:00:09.990> this<00:00:10.139> in<00:00:10.320> two

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
hard we're going to solve this in two

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.530 
hard we're going to solve this in two
steps<00:00:10.769> as<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:11.670> typically<00:00:12.030> do<00:00:12.300> with

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
steps as we typically do with

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.110 
steps as we typically do with
mathematical<00:00:13.380> induction<00:00:13.500> problems<00:00:14.219> step<00:00:14.820> 1

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
mathematical induction problems step 1

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.300 
mathematical induction problems step 1
we're<00:00:15.630> going<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.839> show<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.410> works<00:00:16.800> for

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
we're going to show that this works for

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.429 
we're going to show that this works for
any<00:00:17.520> number<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:18.510> any<00:00:18.630> number<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.050> any<00:00:19.230> number

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
any number for any number and any number

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.080 
any number for any number and any number
of<00:00:19.590> our<00:00:19.859> choosing<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.699> I'm<00:00:20.760> just<00:00:20.880> going<00:00:21.029> to

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
of our choosing so I'm just going to

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.050 
of our choosing so I'm just going to
take<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.300> simple<00:00:21.660> one<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.109> equals<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.369> if

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
take a simple one in equals one and if

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.060 
take a simple one in equals one and if
in<00:00:24.180> equals<00:00:24.449> one<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.869> left<00:00:25.140> side<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.830> is

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
in equals one the left side of this is

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.540 
in equals one the left side of this is
just<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.680> then<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> right<00:00:29.010> side<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.400> this

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
just one and then the right side of this

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.889 
just one and then the right side of this
is<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:30.060> 1<00:00:30.359> times<00:00:30.800> 1<00:00:31.800> plus<00:00:31.830> 1<00:00:32.340> over<00:00:32.640> 2<00:00:33.090> which<00:00:33.840> is

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
is just 1 times 1 plus 1 over 2 which is

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.260 
is just 1 times 1 plus 1 over 2 which is
going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.590> 2<00:00:35.340> over<00:00:35.700> 2<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:37.050> works<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:39.090> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
going to be 2 over 2 so that works so it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.729 
going to be 2 over 2 so that works so it
works<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.750> n<00:00:39.899> equals<00:00:39.930> 1<00:00:41.059> then<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.329> step<00:00:42.540> two<00:00:42.840> we

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
works if n equals 1 then for step two we

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.440 
works if n equals 1 then for step two we
want<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> assume<00:00:46.610> that<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.760> works<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.239> some

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
want to assume that this works for some

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.880 
want to assume that this works for some
number<00:00:48.750> K<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:50.010> I'll<00:00:50.160> say<00:00:50.430> 1<00:00:51.300> plus<00:00:51.780> 2<00:00:52.230> Plus<00:00:52.860> 3

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
number K so I'll say 1 plus 2 Plus 3

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.130 
number K so I'll say 1 plus 2 Plus 3
plus<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.079> plus<00:00:55.469> k<00:00:56.840> is<00:00:57.840> equal<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.710> k<00:00:59.250> times<00:01:00.140> k

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
plus so on plus k is equal to k times k

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.160 
plus so on plus k is equal to k times k
plus<00:01:01.170> 1<00:01:01.800> over<00:01:01.829> 2<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:03.359> want<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.660> show<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
plus 1 over 2 and we want to show that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.000 
plus 1 over 2 and we want to show that
if<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.070> works<00:01:05.309> for<00:01:05.580> k<00:01:06.030> then<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.869> also<00:01:07.170> must<00:01:07.680> work

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
if it works for k then it also must work

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.539 
if it works for k then it also must work
for<00:01:08.280> k<00:01:08.490> plus<00:01:08.790> 1<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:10.500> now<00:01:10.680> let's<00:01:10.890> imagine<00:01:11.159> that

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
for k plus 1 so now let's imagine that

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.850 
for k plus 1 so now let's imagine that
our<00:01:12.240> number<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.860> k<00:01:14.159> plus<00:01:14.189> 1<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:16.470> if

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
our number in here is k plus 1 and if

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.969 
our number in here is k plus 1 and if
it's<00:01:17.009> k<00:01:17.220> plus<00:01:17.580> 1<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.840> left<00:01:19.140> side<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.920> to

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it's k plus 1 the left side is going to

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.039 
it's k plus 1 the left side is going to
go<00:01:20.100> all<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.340> way<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.909> value<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.540> k<00:01:21.750> plus

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
go all the way out to a value of k plus

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.679 
go all the way out to a value of k plus
1<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> left<00:01:22.799> side<00:01:23.009> will<00:01:23.220> look<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.689> 1

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
1 so the left side will look like this 1

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.679 
1 so the left side will look like this 1
+<00:01:25.049> 2<00:01:25.080> +<00:01:25.350> 3<00:01:25.770> +<00:01:26.540> on<00:01:27.540> up<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.590> k<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.340> then<00:01:29.520> 2k<00:01:30.180> plus<00:01:30.570> 1

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
+ 2 + 3 + on up to k and then 2k plus 1

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.429 
+ 2 + 3 + on up to k and then 2k plus 1
and<00:01:31.460> then<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> right<00:01:32.759> side<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.750> k<00:01:34.110> plus

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and then the right side will have k plus

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.560 
and then the right side will have k plus
1<00:01:34.770> plugged<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.790> there<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.409> have

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
1 plugged in there for the in so we have

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.800 
1 plugged in there for the in so we have
k<00:01:39.570> plus<00:01:39.900> 1<00:01:40.229> times<00:01:41.240> k<00:01:42.240> plus<00:01:42.270> 1<00:01:42.810> plus<00:01:43.290> 1<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:44.640> over

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
k plus 1 times k plus 1 plus 1 all over

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.450 
k plus 1 times k plus 1 plus 1 all over
2<00:01:47.420> now<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.479> trick<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.619> notice<00:01:50.220> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
2 now the trick here is to notice that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.330 
2 now the trick here is to notice that
this<00:01:50.790> right<00:01:51.329> here<00:01:51.689> 1<00:01:52.049> +<00:01:52.439> 2<00:01:52.470> +<00:01:52.680> 3<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.430> up<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.119> k<00:01:54.420> is

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
this right here 1 + 2 + 3 on up to k is

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.649 
this right here 1 + 2 + 3 on up to k is
the<00:01:56.340> same<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:58.310> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.579> equal<00:01:59.969> to

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the same as this and this is equal to

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.929 
the same as this and this is equal to
that<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.390> I'm<00:02:03.600> going<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.810> take<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
that so I'm going to take this and

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.240 
that so I'm going to take this and
substitute<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.479> right<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:08.160> i'm

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
substitute it in right there so i'm

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.880 
substitute it in right there so i'm
going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> rewrite<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.940> left<00:02:09.390> side<00:02:09.720> now<00:02:10.110> but

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
going to rewrite the left side now but

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.320 
going to rewrite the left side now but
instead<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.550> piece<00:02:11.849> here<00:02:12.090> that's

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
instead of this piece here that's

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
instead of this piece here that's
underlined<00:02:12.810> i'm<00:02:13.080> going<00:02:13.230> to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
underlined i'm going to

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.230 
underlined i'm going to
put<00:02:13.500> in<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.330> K<00:02:16.130> times<00:02:17.130> k<00:02:17.610> plus<00:02:17.640> 1

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
put in that so I have K times k plus 1

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.470 
put in that so I have K times k plus 1
over<00:02:18.480> 2<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.290> then<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.130> still<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:20.820> plus<00:02:21.210> k

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
over 2 and then I still have this plus k

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.100 
over 2 and then I still have this plus k
plus<00:02:21.750> one<00:02:21.990> right<00:02:22.020> there<00:02:25.250> plus<00:02:26.250> k<00:02:26.520> plus<00:02:26.820> 1

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
plus one right there plus k plus 1

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.090 
plus one right there plus k plus 1
equals<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.260> on<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.440> right<00:02:28.620> side<00:02:28.860> I'm<00:02:29.070> going

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
equals and on the right side I'm going

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.760 
equals and on the right side I'm going
to<00:02:29.280> work<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.670> out<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.060> k<00:02:30.390> plus<00:02:30.420> 1<00:02:30.900> times

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
to work this out this is k plus 1 times

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.860 
to work this out this is k plus 1 times
k<00:02:32.280> plus<00:02:32.310> 2<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:34.520> let's<00:02:35.520> do<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> foil<00:02:36.120> on<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.630> and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
k plus 2 and let's do a foil on that and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.140 
k plus 2 and let's do a foil on that and
that<00:02:36.990> gives<00:02:37.170> us<00:02:37.380> k<00:02:37.770> squared<00:02:38.420> plus<00:02:40.100> 3k<00:02:41.100> plus<00:02:41.670> 2

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
that gives us k squared plus 3k plus 2

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.440 
that gives us k squared plus 3k plus 2
and<00:02:42.650> all<00:02:43.650> that's<00:02:43.800> over<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.340> now<00:02:44.610> are<00:02:44.820> these<00:02:45.030> are

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
and all that's over to now are these are

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.580 
and all that's over to now are these are
these<00:02:46.110> two<00:02:46.680> sides<00:02:46.980> equal<00:02:47.840> well<00:02:48.840> over<00:02:49.020> here<00:02:49.170> we

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
these two sides equal well over here we

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.360 
these two sides equal well over here we
have<00:02:49.620> let's<00:02:50.610> distribute<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.330> K<00:02:51.600> on<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:53.130> left

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
have let's distribute the K on the left

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.250 
have let's distribute the K on the left
and<00:02:53.550> divide<00:02:53.820> by<00:02:53.850> 2<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:54.750> on<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.900> Left<00:02:55.110> we

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
and divide by 2 and so on the Left we

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.180 
and divide by 2 and so on the Left we
have<00:02:55.290> K<00:02:56.130> squared<00:02:56.550> over<00:02:56.790> 2<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:58.190> distributing

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
have K squared over 2 and distributing

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.890 
have K squared over 2 and distributing
the<00:02:59.340> K<00:02:59.520> here<00:02:59.790> we<00:02:59.940> also<00:03:00.090> have<00:03:00.420> plus<00:03:00.900> K<00:03:01.410> over<00:03:01.710> 2

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
the K here we also have plus K over 2

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.460 
the K here we also have plus K over 2
plus<00:03:03.900> k<00:03:04.350> plus<00:03:04.740> 1<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.810> then<00:03:06.810> over<00:03:07.110> here<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.320> the

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
plus k plus 1 and then over here on the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.620 
plus k plus 1 and then over here on the
right<00:03:07.650> if<00:03:07.890> we<00:03:08.580> just<00:03:08.910> break<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.300> up<00:03:09.480> into

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
right if we just break this up into

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.450 
right if we just break this up into
pieces<00:03:10.050> we<00:03:10.470> have<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.680> k<00:03:11.520> squared<00:03:13.790> over<00:03:14.790> 2<00:03:15.240> plus<00:03:16.460> 3

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
pieces we have a k squared over 2 plus 3

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.320 
pieces we have a k squared over 2 plus 3
K<00:03:17.700> over<00:03:17.940> 2<00:03:18.140> plus<00:03:19.140> 2<00:03:19.500> over<00:03:19.530> 2<00:03:19.950> which<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.250> 1<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.910> n

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
K over 2 plus 2 over 2 which is 1 and n

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.440 
K over 2 plus 2 over 2 which is 1 and n
this<00:03:21.600> works<00:03:21.870> k<00:03:22.620> squared<00:03:22.920> over<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:24.270> K

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
this works k squared over to the K

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.480 
this works k squared over to the K
squared<00:03:24.720> terms<00:03:25.020> are<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.320> same<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.830> one<00:03:26.190> is

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
squared terms are the same the one is

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.090 
squared terms are the same the one is
the<00:03:26.730> same<00:03:27.000> on<00:03:27.240> each<00:03:27.570> side<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:28.050> this<00:03:28.590> K<00:03:28.830> over<00:03:28.980> 2

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
the same on each side and this K over 2

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.550 
the same on each side and this K over 2
plus<00:03:29.400> K<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.260> 3k<00:03:31.260> over<00:03:31.530> 2<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:34.080> we've<00:03:34.230> shown<00:03:34.530> that

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
plus K is 3k over 2 so we've shown that

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.420 
plus K is 3k over 2 so we've shown that
if<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.280> works<00:03:35.550> for<00:03:35.880> some<00:03:36.360> number<00:03:37.220> where<00:03:38.220> N

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
if it works for some number where N

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.420 
if it works for some number where N
equals<00:03:38.760> 1<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.270> then<00:03:39.990> if<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.890> works<00:03:41.130> for<00:03:41.370> some

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
equals 1 and then if it works for some

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.390 
equals 1 and then if it works for some
number<00:03:41.880> K<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.110> also<00:03:43.380> works<00:03:43.950> for<00:03:44.130> some

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
number K that it also works for some

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.010 
number K that it also works for some
number<00:03:44.670> k<00:03:44.910> plus<00:03:45.210> 1<00:03:47.030> then<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.210> follows<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.720> it

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
number k plus 1 then it follows that it

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.590 
number k plus 1 then it follows that it
works<00:03:49.200> for<00:03:49.440> every<00:03:49.710> single<00:03:49.950> number<00:03:50.250> n<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:51.240> this

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
works for every single number n so this

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.600 
works for every single number n so this
has<00:03:51.960> now<00:03:52.110> been<00:03:52.470> established<00:03:53.160> using

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
has now been established using

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.510 
has now been established using
mathematical<00:03:54.390> induction
