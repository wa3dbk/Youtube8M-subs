 talk about series I spend my life watching 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.540
 series like 'el / decilitro 15 this one 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.650
 preferred 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:28.990
 so the number 15 designing jane is 20 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:31.419
 and I liked nothing and the song and I 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.460
 suffer the loss very much was a 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:38.890
 girl that in the afternoon 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.890
 I did internships on sites like 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.739
 14th place 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.430
 in fact it would not be very old 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.129
 in the 2000 few the company see this 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.500
 summer and the truth is that it is 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.710
 liking a lot because it reminds me of a 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:05.180
 little to music and I like I like me 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.520
 it seems it is entertaining in 13th place or 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.740
 it is managed as soul collections of 10 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.720
 days a girl a lot of people like and 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.830
 which is very good but they are a 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.539
 beautiful 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.560
 over seen single chapters never the 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:20.479
 I followed in a chapter by capi and if 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.729
 I like mind has makes me laugh that 's 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.570
 everything in the position number 12 we are of 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.159
 family and that I started the chapters 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.840
 followed in my life two first 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.909
 seasons and the truth that I like 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.110
 very much and that I want to continue 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:40.730
 seeing the number of what is 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.730
 it's scientists who live together 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.730
 friends 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.310
 in the 10th place would be bots players that 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.900
 it's some drawings that are great 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.090
 It's drawings of a family that 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.729
 they made the hamburger and every 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.370
 Character is great even though I got lost 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.770
 destiny that is the older girl of the 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.810
 family and it's like my dollar is serious is 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.910
 the life of that girl rising in the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.520
 put number 9 would be daily cali 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.970
 which is like the prequel to a new section 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.959
 york 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.180
 the truth is that I've never seen 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.489

 have a girl that separates from her 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:04.340
 husband or whatever because we caught him and 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.709
 is going to live with three guys at a 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.440
 apartment and it's the seriousness of the 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.709
 things that happen to them and seriously 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.970

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.360

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.730
 that all go out and throw but 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.240
 that has fallen out of the shower and is very 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.240
 fast 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.890
 at number 5 and we would have 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.990
 skins is easy and it's also old and it's 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.090
 our universe but it is English in 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:52.300
 This series deal with adolescence 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:55.630
 the problems drug alcohol sex party 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.400
 every two seasons they change 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.290
 generation to change my character and 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.030
 seriously that series that is talked about 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.660
 Preferred forever I've seen it 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.760
 many times but many times and 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.370
 I really like my characters 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.370
 nervous almost 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.549
 put 14 star little liars 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.340
 37 years as inspiration from the 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.980
 first chapter of the sun and carries about 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.620
 we say that one of them disappears and the 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.840
 they give for dead and then others the 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.730
 four others are separated and after a 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.010
 year they come together again and return to 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.110
 receive anonymous messages from someone 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.050
 who knows all their secrets the 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.200
 threats to do what that 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.230
 person want 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:49.580
 the American I 'm not I do not know if it's not 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.950
 this series still so if it will give you a 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.350
 little bit of fear but gave many and is 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.890
 the first season if it's more scary 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.780
 second to me I did not like it very much everything says 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.850
 that 's the best way we have of 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.970
 season but to me it is the least 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.200
 He liked for its own sake and not squeamish 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:13.620
 I like to see 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.800
 I want to know if the season also 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.550
 disgusting 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.500
 but I like the subject ma 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.500
 I do not know and also because sugar 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.630
 season does not know taissa farmiga and today 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.300
 I love that actress and I love the 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.250
 couple to 5 where it competes if I love them 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.040
 very much and the fourth season so 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:45.690
 caixanova to leave and already this gives me 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:45.690
 very much the truth but yes that is 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:54.390
 it's all the same has nothing to do 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.650
 with twilight but nothing I love is 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:02.180
 as perfect everything that happens 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.180
 but I like it 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.869
 and the bryan look at the scratches 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:16.800
 and 11th place winner 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.530
 Ranking the sango zipper with yes or yes but 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.260
 I started seeing it since it started 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.150
 from the first season or so I 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.630
 waiting for each chapter to come out 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.350
 Crazy two brothers and the series 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.660
 waiting for the most 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.550
 prepared this series has six 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.040
 seasons and I've seen myself at six o'clock 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.500
 seasons at least 10 times more 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.530
 normal professional these series about 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:45.289
 fixed children who live in haste between 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:47.659
 older and there is a girl an anonymous guy 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:51.349

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:57.050
 they are famous as it were and treat 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.659

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:03.559
 I do not know to me this series I love it because 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:06.139

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:09.139
 favorite are charly blair as if to 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:11.960
 me for my taste and I think it was finished 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:14.689
 badly fast and running not old 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.669
 frame season and decontrol do not know to me 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:19.490
 I was quite disappointed at the end 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:21.050
 very much disappointed me very much but 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.770
 still it's still my designs 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:27.050

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:30.409

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:38.200
 some series to recommend me to see 

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:41.900
 that I can recommend because these 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:46.000
 I can add shorter 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.000
 and that's why since the next video 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:54.020
 It would be when with dolls 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:57.610
 at 10 years of this 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:08:01.099
 It does not look very directive I had a good time 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:05.949
 play with total dolls that I do I'm going to 

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:05.949
