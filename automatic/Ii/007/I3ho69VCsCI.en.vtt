00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 Yes 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.220
 i am at aviapartner and what i do is 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.650
 actually the downside is for freight 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.660
 yet it because the coffin inside because you 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.510
 you must start before the blocks 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.700
 place first and then the pilot can 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.720
 achieving say so brake 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.640
 and when you're done that have blocks 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.290
 you sit the pure around it to the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.980
 box or middle engine and that we are safe 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.840
 stays after that biologist 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.700
 you open the door you open the 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.700
 kick and then you go class 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.400
 you have to get some for him all flats 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.470
 so as you can see here that the pressure 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.729
 everyone's the thing to do 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.159
 and if you don't pay attention to your grip 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.540
 environments dies 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.030
 there are such accident sizes and 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.910
 of course your work over next to a chest 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.070
 you may also not damage 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.000
 so I am spending time consecutively 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.000
 must leave pallet box 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.810
 now i am going to collect buddies for the van 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.280
 the link is that bowl 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.870
 once that record the profession can but 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.040
 that you drive away you have to see if everything 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.010
 stuck 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.850
 say if this read is a row and it 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.420
 was good 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.420
 it's definitely a problem 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.070
 in nineteen should once again that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.210
 a 12 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.210
 picked up on which day right 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.900
 what i actually like is it 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.010
 is actually your colleagues who help you 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.600
 if you need help 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.250
 yes it was outside here and if it was beautiful 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.150
 again it is nice to have the lesson of both 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.150
 work with your colleagues 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.200
