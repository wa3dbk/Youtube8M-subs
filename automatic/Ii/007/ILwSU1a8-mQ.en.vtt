00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
really like about this is that it

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.010 
really like about this is that it
actually<00:00:32.369> came<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:32.790> G<00:00:33.180> apps<00:00:33.329> installed<00:00:33.809> I

actually came with G apps installed I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.280 
actually came with G apps installed I
didn't<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.680> flash<00:00:35.149> a<00:00:36.149> GX<00:00:36.870> package

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
didn't have to flash a GX package

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.660 
didn't have to flash a GX package
afterwards<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.129> was<00:00:38.250> really<00:00:38.280> really

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
afterwards so that was really really

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.700 
afterwards so that was really really
convenient<00:00:39.120> also<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> Raum<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.930> odex<00:00:40.379> though

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
convenient also the Raum is odex though

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.709 
convenient also the Raum is odex though
it<00:00:40.890> doesn't<00:00:41.070> have<00:00:41.280> superuser<00:00:41.700> injected<00:00:42.480> into

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it doesn't have superuser injected into

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.990 
it doesn't have superuser injected into
it<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.649> um<00:00:44.040> everything<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.760> you're<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:44.940> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
need is actually on the XDA developers

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.569

be<00:04:19.590> something<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:20.040> little<00:04:20.220> bit<00:04:20.370> buggy<00:04:20.549> with

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
be something a little bit buggy with

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.670 
be something a little bit buggy with

this camera application on the Nexus 4

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.190 
this camera application on the Nexus 4
because<00:04:22.919> as<00:04:23.040> you<00:04:23.190> can<00:04:23.220> see<00:04:23.840> even<00:04:24.840> though<00:04:25.050> I'm

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
because as you can see even though I'm

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.900 
because as you can see even though I'm
you<00:04:25.590> know

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
you know

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.760 
you know
close<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.300> it's<00:04:26.450> trying<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.750> focus<00:04:26.960> constantly

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
close so it's trying to focus constantly

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.010 
close so it's trying to focus constantly
continuous<00:04:28.370> focus<00:04:28.550> on<00:04:28.970> something<00:04:29.480> there<00:04:29.720> even

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
continuous focus on something there even

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.600 
continuous focus on something there even
when<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.140> bring<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.650> up<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.040> say<00:04:31.190> friends<00:04:31.460> as<00:04:31.550> I

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
when I bring it up and say friends as I

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.430 
when I bring it up and say friends as I
kind<00:04:31.820> of<00:04:31.850> just<00:04:31.970> face<00:04:32.150> it<00:04:32.180> down<00:04:32.480> it<00:04:33.290> will

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
kind of just face it down it will

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.380 
kind of just face it down it will
continue<00:04:33.950> to<00:04:34.070> try<00:04:34.100> and<00:04:34.430> focus<00:04:34.640> over<00:04:35.120> and<00:04:35.270> over

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
continue to try and focus over and over

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.490 
continue to try and focus over and over
and<00:04:35.570> over<00:04:35.690> again<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.170> was<00:04:36.290> really

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
and over again and it was really

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.620 
and over again and it was really
difficult<00:04:36.770> for<00:04:37.100> me<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:37.370> get<00:04:37.700> it<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:38.000> stay

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
difficult for me to get it to stay

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.210 
difficult for me to get it to stay
focused<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.260> that<00:04:39.290> I<00:04:39.410> can<00:04:39.470> take<00:04:39.740> a<00:04:39.770> shot<00:04:40.040> though

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
focused so that I can take a shot though

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.590 
focused so that I can take a shot though
it<00:04:40.490> looks<00:04:40.700> like<00:04:40.850> it's<00:04:41.000> staying<00:04:41.210> focused

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
it looks like it's staying focused

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.770 
it looks like it's staying focused
