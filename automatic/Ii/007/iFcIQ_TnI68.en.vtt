 blood just do it superficially 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.240
 but behind this protective screen 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.190
 an artist known as doctor red is 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.230
 about to go beyond 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.630
 is about to put his life at risk 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.929
 in the man of art 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.910
 I will make a painting with the blood that 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.960
 will come out of my arm cause in black 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.750
 graphic 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.660
 I just hope he does not kill me instead of 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.760
 feed your vital organs the blood 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.990
 network is about to paint a nice 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.880
 picture 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.550
 while he prepares for the 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.290
 action a crowd surrounds him anxious to 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.480
 see the show 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.640
 and you have to ask are they there for 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.910
 see you paint or are there to see you 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.910
 die 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.230
 the blood is about to flow and only 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.060
 three people are allowed to go behind 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.220
 of the protective screen you will present 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.950
 here 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.440
 the doctor is not his wife Maria and a 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.480
 nurse with a good needle is all 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.700
 You already know what you should do only 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.990
 do it 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.439
 the cannula goes from his arm to the airbrush and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.170
 network is ready to paint directly from your 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.530
 vena very well the first shot of the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.939
 airbrush makes him feel dusky when 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.450
 I'm connected I feel an agony 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.360
 constant 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.299
 The standard width of the cannula is 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.299
 dot 8 millimeters but the network needle 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.460
 is twice that size that means 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.850
 that twice as much blood comes out twice as much 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.850
 Quick 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.920
 need water 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.930
 You want me to help you, you want something more 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.720
 I'm not living it 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.659
 for four long hours the blood network 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.700
 illuminates 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.290
 if you pateras me the stomach that is 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.990
 would compare with how I feel 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.630
 which brings us to the question why 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.080
 this is done 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.730
 this is touching or extreme art is 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.160
 doing things that make it stand out 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.960
 from the crowd when you over salts of 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.580
 the crowd you feel psychologically 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.630
 good about yourself because you do something 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.630
 that nobody else can do
