think of coming to Richard's place to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.810 
think of coming to Richard's place to
come<00:00:56.899> recognize<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.350> honor<00:00:58.890> those<00:00:59.460> who<00:00:59.699> have

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
truly gone above and beyond I think the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.060 
truly gone above and beyond I think the
number<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.430> attribute<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.809> desire<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.799> do

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
number one attribute is a desire to do

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.520 
number one attribute is a desire to do
even<00:01:05.339> better<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.909> think<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.110> vision<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
even better I think the vision I

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.560 
even better I think the vision I
achieved<00:01:07.860> comes<00:01:08.130> from<00:01:08.430> pride<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> brand<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
achieved comes from pride in the brand I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.539 
achieved comes from pride in the brand I
