00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
little more subtle which is quite nice

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.920 
little more subtle which is quite nice
the<00:04:16.560> tone<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:17.040> doesn't<00:04:17.130> really<00:04:17.400> like<00:04:17.610> you<00:04:17.730> know

actually<00:04:39.410> a<00:04:39.470> little<00:04:39.560> bit<00:04:39.710> influence<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.280> me

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
actually a little bit influence to me

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.530 
actually a little bit influence to me
and<00:04:42.700> everything<00:04:43.700> else<00:04:43.820> is<00:04:43.940> pretty<00:04:44.090> much<00:04:44.300> stock

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
and everything else is pretty much stock

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.920 
and everything else is pretty much stock
as<00:04:45.100> for<00:04:46.100> driving<00:04:46.490> this<00:04:47.000> car<00:04:47.270> has<00:04:47.450> been<00:04:47.570> pretty

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
as for driving this car has been pretty

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.630 
as for driving this car has been pretty
smooth<00:04:48.230> really<00:04:48.650> it's<00:04:49.130> funny<00:04:49.400> because<00:04:49.550> you

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
smooth really it's funny because you

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.130 
smooth really it's funny because you
started<00:04:49.970> out<00:04:50.120> but<00:04:50.210> just<00:04:50.390> to<00:04:50.510> psycho<00:04:50.960> look

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
started out but just to psycho look

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.870 
started out but just to psycho look

sure<00:04:56.510> I've<00:04:56.660> made<00:04:56.840> any<00:04:57.050> videos<00:04:57.080> but<00:04:57.650> I've<00:04:58.370> had

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
sure I've made any videos but I've had

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.730 
sure I've made any videos but I've had
like<00:04:58.730> 15<00:04:59.480> skylines<00:05:00.080> in<00:05:00.230> the<00:05:00.290> past<00:05:00.470> couple<00:05:00.650> of

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
like 15 skylines in the past couple of

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.860 
like 15 skylines in the past couple of
years<00:05:00.800> I<00:05:01.220> have<00:05:01.400> an<00:05:01.520> RB<00:05:01.790> 25<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.480> then<00:05:02.570> shop

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
years I have an RB 25 and then shop

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.350 
years I have an RB 25 and then shop
right<00:05:03.050> now<00:05:03.200> anyway<00:05:03.800> so<00:05:04.730> it<00:05:04.940> sounds<00:05:05.210> like<00:05:05.240> a

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
right now anyway so it sounds like a

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.470 
right now anyway so it sounds like a
skyline<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.670> I<00:05:07.670> mean<00:05:07.820> I've<00:05:07.970> never<00:05:08.090> driven<00:05:08.300> an

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
skyline and I mean I've never driven an

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.500 
skyline and I mean I've never driven an
automatic<00:05:08.840> skyline<00:05:09.230> so<00:05:10.090> this<00:05:11.090> was<00:05:11.240> driving

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
automatic skyline so this was driving

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.150 
automatic skyline so this was driving
our<00:05:11.630> backs<00:05:11.840> common<00:05:12.200> is<00:05:12.320> it's<00:05:12.650> not<00:05:12.800> too

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
our backs common is it's not too

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.110 
our backs common is it's not too
terrible<00:05:15.340> it<00:05:16.340> definitely<00:05:16.700> doesn't<00:05:16.850> shift

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
terrible it definitely doesn't shift

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.340 
terrible it definitely doesn't shift
what<00:05:17.270> I'd<00:05:17.360> want<00:05:17.600> it<00:05:17.660> to<00:05:17.690> shift

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
what I'd want it to shift

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.310 
what I'd want it to shift
it<00:05:19.280> pulls<00:05:19.700> as<00:05:20.180> I<00:05:20.360> would<00:05:20.480> expect<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:20.930> stock

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
it pulls as I would expect to stock

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.770 
it pulls as I would expect to stock
every<00:05:21.800> 25<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.430> pull<00:05:22.670> which<00:05:22.880> I<00:05:23.180> have<00:05:23.480> a<00:05:23.510> stock

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
every 25 to pull which I have a stock

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.590 
every 25 to pull which I have a stock
over<00:05:23.930> 25<00:05:24.320> right<00:05:24.500> now<00:05:24.650> so<00:05:25.010> it<00:05:25.880> pulls<00:05:26.120> exactly

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
over 25 right now so it pulls exactly

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.190 
over 25 right now so it pulls exactly
like<00:05:26.750> that<00:05:27.910> it's<00:05:28.910> been<00:05:29.090> heavy<00:05:29.330> on<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:30.050> heavy

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
like that it's been heavy on the heavy

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.780 
like that it's been heavy on the heavy
side<00:05:30.320> right<00:05:30.740> so<00:05:30.950> you<00:05:31.010> can<00:05:31.190> imagine<00:05:31.370> that<00:05:31.580> it's

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
side right so you can imagine that it's

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.040 
side right so you can imagine that it's
