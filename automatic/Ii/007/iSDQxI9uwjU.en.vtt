00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.759 
society-wide acquiescence to this partly
I<00:02:33.090> think<00:02:33.120> because<00:02:33.599> people<00:02:33.959> don't<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.469> the

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
I think because people don't have the

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.679 
I think because people don't have the
tools<00:02:35.189> and<00:02:35.579> information<00:02:35.730> make<00:02:36.209> decisions

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
tools and information make decisions

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.209 
tools and information make decisions
otherwise<00:02:37.019> we<00:02:37.290> really<00:02:37.650> would<00:02:37.799> love<00:02:37.980> for

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
otherwise we really would love for

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.729 
otherwise we really would love for
people<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.609> come<00:02:38.760> away<00:02:38.909> with<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.780> feeling<00:02:40.590> that

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
people to come away with a feeling that

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.459 
people to come away with a feeling that
there's<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.219> strong<00:02:41.879> case<00:02:42.269> here<00:02:42.659> to<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.930> made<00:02:43.139> in

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:43.469 
there's a strong case here to be made in

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:44.720 
there's a strong case here to be made in

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
favor of the Whole Foods plant-based

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.610 
favor of the Whole Foods plant-based
diet<00:02:45.359> and<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:47.069> know<00:02:47.189> for<00:02:47.489> them<00:02:47.639> to<00:02:48.469> give<00:02:49.469> it<00:02:49.560> a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
diet and you know for them to give it a

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.849 
diet and you know for them to give it a
try<00:02:49.859> or<00:02:50.159> at<00:02:51.000> least<00:02:51.030> be<00:02:51.480> open<00:02:51.689> to<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.109> idea<00:02:52.500> and

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
try or at least be open to the idea and

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.149 
try or at least be open to the idea and
doing<00:02:53.669> more<00:02:54.269> research<00:02:54.449> themselves<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.889> try

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
doing more research themselves to try

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.020 
doing more research themselves to try
and<00:02:57.019> hopefully<00:02:58.019> try<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.219> the<00:02:59.849> more

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
and hopefully try this and and the more

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.000 
and hopefully try this and and the more
people<00:03:00.329> that<00:03:00.359> try<00:03:00.659> it<00:03:00.719> but<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.530> think<00:03:01.560> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
people that try it but I think the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.949 
people that try it but I think the
better<00:03:02.310> it's<00:03:02.489> going<00:03:02.699> to<00:03:02.849> be<00:03:02.969> that<00:03:03.599> was<00:03:03.719> really

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
better it's going to be that was really

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.750 
better it's going to be that was really
a<00:03:03.989> cool<00:03:04.199> movie<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.680> we<00:03:04.739> just<00:03:04.919> saw<00:03:05.129> oh<00:03:05.430> my

about<00:03:13.919> what<00:03:14.069> they're<00:03:14.189> hearing<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.760> thought<00:03:15.090> it

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
about what they're hearing I thought it

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.729 
about what they're hearing I thought it
was<00:03:15.269> neat<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.569> way<00:03:15.599> they<00:03:15.810> had<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.079> charts<00:03:16.530> I

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
was neat the way they had the charts I

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.979 
was neat the way they had the charts I
mean<00:03:16.889> they<00:03:17.010> actually<00:03:17.040> showed<00:03:17.989> correlations

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
mean they actually showed correlations

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.530 
mean they actually showed correlations
between<00:03:19.549> animal<00:03:20.549> product<00:03:20.879> consumption<00:03:21.239> and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
between animal product consumption and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.390 
between animal product consumption and
disease<00:03:21.870> right<00:03:22.500> there<00:03:22.709> on<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.829> screen<00:03:22.979> I'm<00:03:23.280> it

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
disease right there on the screen I'm it

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.499 
disease right there on the screen I'm it
was<00:03:23.519> really<00:03:23.819> neat<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> way<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.329> came

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:24.509 
was really neat the way that came

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:26.119 
was really neat the way that came
together<00:03:24.659> well<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:25.139> I<00:03:25.259> really<00:03:25.290> like<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.949> fact

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
together well and I really like the fact

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.800 
together well and I really like the fact
that<00:03:26.250> there<00:03:26.430> was<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.609> medical<00:03:26.879> doctor<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.569> a

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
that there was a medical doctor and a

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.679 
that there was a medical doctor and a
PhD<00:03:28.519> approximately<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.669> same<00:03:29.849> age<00:03:30.060> coming

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:30.689 
PhD approximately the same age coming

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.869 
PhD approximately the same age coming
from<00:03:30.810> both<00:03:30.989> sides<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.099> spectrum<00:03:32.189> but

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
from both sides of the spectrum but

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.999 
from both sides of the spectrum but
combining<00:03:33.540> their<00:03:33.870> efforts<00:03:34.199> and<00:03:34.319> that's<00:03:34.829> what

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:35.009 
combining their efforts and that's what

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.649 
combining their efforts and that's what
this<00:03:35.129> movie<00:03:35.430> was<00:03:35.579> about<00:03:35.699> and<00:03:36.000> ironically

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
this movie was about and ironically

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.599 
this movie was about and ironically
