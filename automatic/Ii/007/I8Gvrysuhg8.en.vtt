despite<00:00:00.510> traveling<00:00:01.079> at<00:00:01.199> really<00:00:01.380> high<00:00:01.620> speeds

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
despite traveling at really high speeds

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.800 
despite traveling at really high speeds
driving<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.669> manual<00:00:03.060> on<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.179> highway<00:00:03.600> is

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
driving a manual on the highway is

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.829 
driving a manual on the highway is
actually<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.589> easiest<00:00:05.160> place<00:00:05.839> there's

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
actually the easiest place there's

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.299 
actually the easiest place there's
really<00:00:07.020> only<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.350> couple<00:00:07.440> things<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:08.069> have<00:00:08.220> to

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
really only a couple things you have to

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.749 
really only a couple things you have to
look<00:00:08.519> out<00:00:08.670> for<00:00:08.970> one<00:00:09.630> on<00:00:09.990> ramps<00:00:10.679> two<00:00:10.950> off<00:00:11.250> ramps

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
look out for one on ramps two off ramps

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.030 
look out for one on ramps two off ramps
then<00:00:12.420> if<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.599> hit<00:00:12.690> traffic<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.980> to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
then if you hit traffic so to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.350 
then if you hit traffic so to
demonstrate<00:00:14.250> we'll<00:00:14.820> get<00:00:14.969> on<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.210> highway

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
demonstrate we'll get on the highway

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.540 
demonstrate we'll get on the highway
we'll<00:00:16.139> cruise<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.619> while<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.310> then<00:00:17.460> we'll

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
we'll cruise for a while and then we'll

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.120 
we'll cruise for a while and then we'll
get<00:00:17.699> off<00:00:18.230> getting<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> freeway<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.920> not

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
get off getting on the freeway is not

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.529 
get off getting on the freeway is not
that<00:00:20.310> difficult<00:00:20.490> if<00:00:20.910> you're<00:00:21.090> familiar<00:00:21.270> with

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
that difficult if you're familiar with

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.509 
that difficult if you're familiar with
the<00:00:21.720> basics<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.199> how<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.320> drive<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> manual<00:00:22.920> it's

the basics of how to drive a manual it's

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.599 
the basics of how to drive a manual it's
simply<00:00:23.970> just<00:00:24.000> up<00:00:24.570> shifts<00:00:25.010> so<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.580> ramp

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
simply just up shifts so on the on ramp

really<00:00:57.150> not<00:00:57.449> difficult<00:00:57.720> you<00:00:58.470> should<00:00:58.500> maintain

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
really not difficult you should maintain

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.650 
really not difficult you should maintain
a<00:00:59.070> safe<00:00:59.370> distance<00:00:59.550> from<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> person<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.510> front

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.719 
of you in case of emergencies and of
course<00:01:03.480> drive<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.900> speed<00:01:04.110> limit<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.890> really

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
course drive the speed limit but really

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.510 
course drive the speed limit but really
if<00:01:06.630> there's<00:01:06.810> not<00:01:06.930> any<00:01:06.990> traffic<00:01:07.470> you're<00:01:08.310> just

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
if there's not any traffic you're just

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100 
if there's not any traffic you're just
cruising<00:01:08.940> you're<00:01:09.090> doing<00:01:09.300> minor<00:01:09.540> inputs<00:01:09.990> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
cruising you're doing minor inputs of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.830 
cruising you're doing minor inputs of
the<00:01:10.170> gas<00:01:10.410> and<00:01:10.710> minor<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.160> the<00:01:11.250> brake<00:01:11.460> and

the gas and minor of the brake and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.290 
the gas and minor of the brake and
there's<00:01:12.840> very<00:01:13.350> very<00:01:13.920> rarely<00:01:14.340> any<00:01:14.700> instances

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
there's very very rarely any instances

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.370 
there's very very rarely any instances
that<00:01:15.479> you're<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.110> change

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
that you're going to have to change

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.980 
that you're going to have to change
gears<00:01:16.770> at<00:01:17.009> all<00:01:17.250> unless<00:01:17.940> there's<00:01:18.240> bad<00:01:18.450> traffic

gears at all unless there's bad traffic

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.230 
gears at all unless there's bad traffic
then<00:01:19.440> you're<00:01:19.590> gonna<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.950> slow<00:01:20.280> down<00:01:20.310> put

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
then you're gonna have to slow down put

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.050 
then you're gonna have to slow down put
the<00:01:21.330> clutch<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.680> fifth<00:01:22.680> gear<00:01:23.009> maybe<00:01:23.580> downshift

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the clutch in fifth gear maybe downshift

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.560 
the clutch in fifth gear maybe downshift
fourth<00:01:24.800> but<00:01:25.800> unlikely<00:01:26.190> if<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.240> remember<00:01:27.479> going

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
fourth but unlikely if I remember going

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.660 
fourth but unlikely if I remember going
up<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> hill<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.770> freeway<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:29.460> going

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
up a hill on the freeway and I'm going

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.940 
up a hill on the freeway and I'm going
relatively<00:01:30.180> slow<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.780> usually<00:01:31.470> drop<00:01:31.649> it<00:01:31.830> down

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
relatively slow I usually drop it down

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.680 
relatively slow I usually drop it down
to<00:01:32.009> gear<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.550> not<00:01:32.700> put<00:01:32.880> too<00:01:32.910> much<00:01:33.240> load<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.840 
engine if I'm going below 2,000 rpms and
sixth<00:01:36.450> gear<00:01:36.600> I'll<00:01:36.780> probably<00:01:36.990> put<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.440> fifth

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
sixth gear I'll probably put it in fifth

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.770 
sixth gear I'll probably put it in fifth
downshifting<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> critical<00:01:39.450> part<00:01:39.660> of

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780

driving<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> manual<00:01:40.350> many<00:01:41.010> people<00:01:41.340> find<00:01:41.460> it

driving a manual many people find it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.399 
driving a manual many people find it
difficult<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.390> driving<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> freeway<00:01:42.960> is

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
difficult but driving on the freeway is

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.770 
difficult but driving on the freeway is
a<00:01:43.439> great<00:01:43.830> way<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.070> experiment<00:01:44.880> with<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.180> when

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
a great way to experiment with that when

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.480 
a great way to experiment with that when
you<00:01:45.869> go<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.049> off-ramp<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.010> can<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.460> your
