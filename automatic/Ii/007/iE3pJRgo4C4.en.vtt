00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:06.000 

that's<00:00:56.210> probably<00:00:56.390> where<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:56.690> needs<00:00:56.840> to<00:00:56.900> be

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.150 

all<00:01:06.580> right<00:01:06.820> rewind<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.860> was<00:01:08.980> really

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
all right rewind and that was really

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.130 
all right rewind and that was really
hopeful<00:01:09.670> that<00:01:09.970> was<00:01:10.270> really<00:01:10.450> wishful<00:01:10.630> thinking

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
hopeful that was really wishful thinking

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.340 
hopeful that was really wishful thinking
on<00:01:11.320> my<00:01:11.620> part

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.270 

and<00:01:15.620> that<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.400> raises<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.880> platform<00:01:21.070> I'm<00:01:22.070> sure

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
and that just raises a platform I'm sure

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.020 
and that just raises a platform I'm sure
we'll<00:01:22.430> forget<00:01:22.880> sooner<00:01:23.240> or<00:01:23.360> later<00:01:23.479> Oh<00:01:26.200> Prince

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:58.340 

it's<00:02:48.590> definitely<00:02:49.900> tricky

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.500 

I<00:02:58.440> just<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.220> jump<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.700> poll<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.300> that

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
I just have to jump to the poll is that

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.010 
I just have to jump to the poll is that
what<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.870> want<00:03:01.050> me<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.230> do

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:14.550 

it<00:03:08.020> could<00:03:08.230> be<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.380> possibility<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.840> suppose

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.110 

all<00:03:14.980> right<00:03:15.130> that's<00:03:15.310> all<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.550> wanted<00:03:15.819> me<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:15.940> do

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
all right that's all you wanted me to do

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.600 
all right that's all you wanted me to do
get<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.720> pole<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:18.340> makes<00:03:18.550> sense

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
get to the pole it makes sense

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.710 
get to the pole it makes sense
it's<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.300> little<00:03:21.570> column

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.930 

be<00:03:27.720> God<00:03:27.960> player<00:03:28.260> Prince<00:03:28.710> we<00:03:29.460> got<00:03:29.730> Blair

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.550 

I<00:03:34.970> think<00:03:35.570> what<00:03:35.660> I'm<00:03:35.750> gonna<00:03:35.870> get<00:03:36.050> is<00:03:36.110> another<00:03:38.560> is

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
I think what I'm gonna get is another is

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.990 
I think what I'm gonna get is another is
another<00:03:39.830> one<00:03:40.040> of<00:03:40.070> those<00:03:41.830> slots<00:03:42.830> or<00:03:43.550> three

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
wines and maybe if I upgrade that it

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.270 
wines and maybe if I upgrade that it
will<00:03:49.610> give<00:03:49.760> me<00:03:50.200> five<00:03:51.200> energy<00:03:51.440> things<00:03:54.280> that

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280
