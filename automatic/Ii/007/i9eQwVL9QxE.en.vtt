kept it in and just slept in it and the
actual<00:00:28.590> thing<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.640> chipping<00:00:30.240> away

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330

actual thing was just like chipping away
and<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:31.740> supposed<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.219> quite<00:00:32.399> good

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.400 
and it was supposed to be quite good
jewellery<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.090> my<00:00:33.239> Pearson<00:00:33.690> suggested<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
jewellery like my Pearson suggested the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.319 
jewellery like my Pearson suggested the
shop<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.920> got<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.190> from<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.579> obviously<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
shop that I got it from but obviously it

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.229 
shop that I got it from but obviously it
wasn't<00:00:36.809> good<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.430> thing<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.969> metal

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
wasn't good and the thing the metal

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.630 
wasn't good and the thing the metal
started<00:00:39.600> flaking<00:00:39.870> away<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.559> many<00:00:41.370> actually

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
started flaking away and many actually

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.830 
started flaking away and many actually
made<00:00:42.090> my<00:00:42.300> belly<00:00:42.660> reject<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.420> went<00:00:45.690> back

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
made my belly reject and so I went back

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.990 
made my belly reject and so I went back
and<00:00:46.079> I've<00:00:46.289> had<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.559> done<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> few<00:00:47.309> more<00:00:47.520> times

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
and I've had it done a few more times

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.760 
and I've had it done a few more times
like<00:00:48.329> two<00:00:48.629> times<00:00:48.899> I've<00:00:49.110> had<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> repaired

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
like two times I've had it repaired

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.119 
like two times I've had it repaired
since<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.050> both<00:00:52.050> times<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.649> rejected

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
since then and both times it rejected

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.569 
since then and both times it rejected
again<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.829> this<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> second<00:00:56.430> time

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
again and and this is the second time

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.160 
again and and this is the second time
and<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.210> rejecting<00:00:57.780> again<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.079> not

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and it's it's rejecting again it's not

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.560 
and it's it's rejecting again it's not
affected<00:00:58.590> than<00:00:58.710> nothing's<00:00:59.210> wrong<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
affected than nothing's wrong with it

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.750 
affected than nothing's wrong with it
it's<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.050> fact<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:02.480> it's<00:01:03.480> done<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
it's just the fact that it's done it

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.800 
it's just the fact that it's done it
it's<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.060> I'm<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.210> leaving<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
it's because I'm not leaving the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.500 
it's because I'm not leaving the
scarring<00:01:07.380> long<00:01:07.560> enough<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.420> because<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
scarring long enough and because I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.800 
scarring long enough and because I
really<00:01:09.540> wanted<00:01:10.110> my<00:01:10.409> belly<00:01:10.710> post<00:01:10.950> again<00:01:11.220> and

what ejected belly button looks like and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.730 
what ejected belly button looks like and
obviously<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.570> lot<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.049> yours<00:01:22.259> very<00:01:22.290> night<00:01:22.590> like

this

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.590 
this
because<00:01:23.460> I've<00:01:23.580> got<00:01:23.610> scarring<00:01:24.210> all<00:01:24.299> around<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
because I've got scarring all around it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.590 
because I've got scarring all around it
is<00:01:24.810> not<00:01:24.990> infection<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.619> scarring<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.600> if

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
is not infection that is scarring and if

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600 
is not infection that is scarring and if
yours<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.350> rejecting<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.979> might<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.400> red

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
yours is rejecting it might be red

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.240 
yours is rejecting it might be red
because<00:01:29.970> obviously<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.810> about<00:01:31.020> scar<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:32.130> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
because obviously it's about scar but it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.890 
because obviously it's about scar but it
could<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.640> rejection<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.390> infected

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
could be rejection because it's infected

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.080 
could be rejection because it's infected
as<00:01:34.020> well<00:01:34.049> mine<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.070> infected<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.790> just
