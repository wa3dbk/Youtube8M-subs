turn face down now I'll leave the force
base<00:01:21.150> for<00:01:21.420> last<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> hardest

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
base for last because it's the hardest

vote for cars to turn face down the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.679 
vote for cars to turn face down the
reason<00:01:26.280> why<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> hardest<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.330> because

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
reason why it's the hardest is because

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.690 
reason why it's the hardest is because
actually<00:01:28.579> it's<00:01:29.579> four<00:01:29.939> hearts<00:01:31.280> now<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.520> give

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
something interesting happens the hearts

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
something interesting happens the hearts
melt<00:01:38.670> into<00:01:39.090> all<00:01:40.100> four<00:01:41.100> cards<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:43.110> i<00:01:43.170> don't

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
melt into all four cards so now i don't

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.429

have the ace23 m four spades anymore i

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.980 
have the ace23 m four spades anymore i
actually<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.729> age<00:01:47.820> 23<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.570> four<00:01:48.840> of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
actually have the age 23 and four of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.670 
actually have the age 23 and four of
hearts<00:01:49.549> but<00:01:50.549> that's<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.000> craziest<00:01:51.149> part

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
hearts but that's not the craziest part

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.499 
hearts but that's not the craziest part
craziest<00:01:52.680> part<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.759> i<00:01:53.909> put<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> cards<00:01:54.450> back

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
craziest part is if i put the cards back

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.319 
craziest part is if i put the cards back
together<00:01:55.399> give<00:01:56.399> them<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.729> more<00:01:56.759> shake<00:01:57.180> like

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
together give them one more shake like

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.139 
together give them one more shake like
that<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:58.380> reading<00:01:58.649> from<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> card<00:01:59.460> actually

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
that the reading from the card actually

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.539 
that the reading from the card actually
bleeds<00:02:00.630> through<00:02:00.869> onto<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.439> back<00:02:01.649> so<00:02:02.369> now<00:02:02.490> two

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
bleeds through onto the back so now two

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.669 
bleeds through onto the back so now two
one<00:02:02.850> two<00:02:03.590> three<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.969> four<00:02:06.469> red-backed<00:02:08.179> cards

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
one two three and four red-backed cards

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.980 
one two three and four red-backed cards
and<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:12.140> final<00:02:12.620> twist
