00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
relaxing I think is the color of the

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.079 
relaxing I think is the color of the
walls<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.380> chose<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> really<00:00:14.040> pale<00:00:14.280> lavender<00:00:14.580> and

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
walls I chose a really pale lavender and

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.700 
walls I chose a really pale lavender and
the<00:00:15.480> way<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.750> light<00:00:15.929> comes<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.500> through<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
the way the light comes in through the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.820 
the way the light comes in through the
windows<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:18.480> comfort<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.140> tranquility

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
windows and the comfort and tranquility

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.710 
windows and the comfort and tranquility
is<00:00:19.890> really<00:00:20.130> added<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.910> think<00:00:20.939> by<00:00:21.330> these<00:00:21.510> house

is really added I think by these house
plants<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.350> love<00:00:22.380> having<00:00:22.800> them<00:00:23.070> around<00:00:23.220> you

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
plants I love having them around you

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.279 
plants I love having them around you
know<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.000> think<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.359> often<00:00:24.570> when<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:24.960> think

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
know I think so often when we think

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.320 
know I think so often when we think
about<00:00:25.439> having<00:00:25.859> plants<00:00:26.460> indoors<00:00:26.699> we<00:00:27.060> or

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
about having plants indoors we or

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.599 
about having plants indoors we or
outdoors<00:00:27.930> even<00:00:28.590> more<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.340> think<00:00:29.550> about

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
outdoors even more so we think about

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.299 
outdoors even more so we think about
blooms<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.359> not<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.050> much<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.349> foliage<00:00:32.130> and

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
blooms and not so much about foliage and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.280 
blooms and not so much about foliage and
these<00:00:32.460> are<00:00:32.610> very<00:00:32.790> simple<00:00:33.090> foliage<00:00:33.719> plants

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
these are very simple foliage plants

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.709 
these are very simple foliage plants
look<00:00:35.250> at<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> variation<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.540> on

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
look at the variation that we have on

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.750 
look at the variation that we have on
this<00:00:36.899> one<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.710> one's<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.280> simple

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
this one and this one's just a simple

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.709 
this one and this one's just a simple
green<00:00:39.090> plant

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
green plant

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.139 
green plant
I'd<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.530> choose<00:00:40.770> plants<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.940> sort

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
I'd like to choose plants that have sort

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.690 
I'd like to choose plants that have sort
of<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.329> thick<00:00:42.660> succulent<00:00:43.050> like<00:00:43.620> leaf<00:00:43.980> typically

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
of a thick succulent like leaf typically

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.220 
of a thick succulent like leaf typically
that<00:00:44.879> means<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.390> plant<00:00:45.600> doesn't<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.110> be

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
that means that plant doesn't have to be

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.040 
that means that plant doesn't have to be
watered<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.920> often<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:48.539> really<00:00:48.840> not

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
watered so often and it's really not

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.600 
watered so often and it's really not
that<00:00:49.110> important<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.950> even<00:00:50.070> know<00:00:50.370> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
that important that you even know the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.279 
that important that you even know the
names<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.270> plants<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.050> more

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
names of the plants but it's more

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.619 
names of the plants but it's more
important<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> me<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.309> understand<00:00:53.910> what

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
important to me that you understand what

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.900
