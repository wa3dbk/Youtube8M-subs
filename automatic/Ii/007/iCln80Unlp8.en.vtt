here<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:20.160> blue<00:00:20.340> up<00:00:20.490> there<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.590> think<00:00:22.590> he<00:00:22.680> had

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
here to blue up there I think he had

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:32.089 
here to blue up there I think he had
some<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:24.830> can't<00:00:25.830> remember<00:00:27.710> anyway<00:00:30.500> he's<00:00:31.500> pretty

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
some I can't remember anyway he's pretty

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.920 
some I can't remember anyway he's pretty
cool<00:00:34.700> his<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:37.440> he<00:00:38.010> has<00:00:38.100> very<00:00:38.370> unique

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
cool his I think he has very unique

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.150 
cool his I think he has very unique
features<00:00:42.739> one<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.860> them<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.420> his<00:00:45.420> landing<00:00:45.840> gear

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
features one of them is his landing gear

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.010 
features one of them is his landing gear
they're<00:00:47.160> probably<00:00:47.370> thinking<00:00:47.750> why<00:00:48.750> his

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
they're probably thinking why his

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.830 
they're probably thinking why his
landing<00:00:49.530> gear<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.640> because<00:00:51.030> his<00:00:51.390> landing

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
landing gear this is because his landing

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.799 
landing gear this is because his landing
gear<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.170> actually<00:00:52.350> his<00:00:53.039> Minicon<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.090> his

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
gear is actually his Minicon and his

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.310 
gear is actually his Minicon and his
shield<00:00:55.969> which<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.180> that's<00:00:57.809> pretty<00:00:58.050> cool<00:00:58.170> I

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
shield which is a that's pretty cool I

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.030 
shield which is a that's pretty cool I
think<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> um<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:01.039> can't<00:01:02.039> remember<00:01:02.129> his<00:01:02.550> uh<00:01:02.579> his

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
think so um I can't remember his uh his

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:16.160 
think so um I can't remember his uh his
mini-cons<00:01:05.040> name<00:01:10.939> there's<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.060> little<00:01:14.840> mini<00:01:15.840> con

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
mini-cons name there's a little mini con

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.460 
mini-cons name there's a little mini con
inside<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.710> his<00:01:16.920> well<00:01:17.490> underneath<00:01:18.470> his

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
inside of his well underneath his

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.120 
inside of his well underneath his
cockpit<00:01:20.630> like<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.200> area<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
cockpit like right in this area you

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.499 
cockpit like right in this area you
can't<00:01:23.340> see<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.549> because<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.970> all<00:01:24.090> black<00:01:24.299> in

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
can't see it because it's all black in

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.710 
can't see it because it's all black in
there<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:25.009> it's<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.189> there<00:01:29.119> his<00:01:30.119> many<00:01:30.360> kinds

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
there but it's in there his many kinds

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.670 
there but it's in there his many kinds
of<00:01:30.750> vehicle<00:01:31.110> form<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:33.439> want<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.530> say

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
of vehicle form is like a I want to say

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.080 
of vehicle form is like a I want to say
a<00:01:35.040> Mars<00:01:35.400> rover

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.490 

I<00:01:39.119> think<00:01:39.540> that's<00:01:39.689> whenever<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.229> first

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
I think that's whenever it was first

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.819 
I think that's whenever it was first
seen<00:01:41.060> whenever<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.680> made<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> trip<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.220> Mars

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
seen whenever they made a trip to Mars

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.160 
seen whenever they made a trip to Mars
with<00:01:46.829> Starscream<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.659> generally<00:01:48.930> looks

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
with Starscream so it generally looks

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.510 
with Starscream so it generally looks
like<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> original<00:01:49.979> version<00:01:50.310> looks

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
like this the original version looks

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.719 
like this the original version looks
blue<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.920> red<00:01:53.990> it's<00:01:54.990> not<00:01:55.170> as<00:01:55.500> dark<00:01:56.009> red<00:01:56.430> as

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
blue and red it's not as dark red as

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.780 
blue and red it's not as dark red as
this<00:01:56.909> is

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
this is

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.950 
this is
but<00:01:58.390> uh<00:01:58.560> that's<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.800> general<00:02:00.450> thing<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.690> guess

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
but uh that's the general thing I guess

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.910 
but uh that's the general thing I guess
there's<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:02.980> many<00:02:03.190> constable<00:02:03.670> right<00:02:03.970> there<00:02:04.240> and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.960

Jetfire<00:02:41.470> which<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:41.920> wanted<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:43.920> take<00:02:44.920> off<00:02:45.100> his

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.010 

these<00:03:07.120> pieces<00:03:07.360> are<00:03:07.660> supposed<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.930> be

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
these pieces are supposed to be

connected but I didn't connect them

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.680 
connected but I didn't connect them
because<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.489> just<00:03:09.580> makes<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:10.000> easier<00:03:12.690> pull

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
because it just makes it easier pull

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:22.220 
because it just makes it easier pull
this<00:03:13.930> back<00:03:14.560> just<00:03:15.540> like<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.600> and<00:03:20.220> split<00:03:21.220> that

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
this back just like that and split that

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.560 
this back just like that and split that
apart<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.350> this<00:03:23.410> becomes<00:03:23.800> is<00:03:23.920> again<00:03:24.570> sounds

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
apart and this becomes is again sounds

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.290 
apart and this becomes is again sounds

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
now he does have an actual seat in there

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.580 
now he does have an actual seat in there
I<00:04:40.810> didn't<00:04:41.110> eat<00:04:41.199> that<00:04:41.229> so<00:04:42.070> that's<00:04:42.280> pretty<00:04:42.490> cool

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
I didn't eat that so that's pretty cool

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.879 
I didn't eat that so that's pretty cool
he's<00:04:44.590> not<00:04:44.770> just<00:04:44.919> like<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.550> know<00:04:49.110> his<00:04:50.110> gun<00:04:50.440> can

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
he's not just like you know his gun can

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.580 
he's not just like you know his gun can
connect<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.310> this<00:04:51.430> little<00:04:51.729> hole<00:04:51.909> here<00:04:52.150> so<00:04:52.590> he

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
connect to this little hole here so he

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.339 
connect to this little hole here so he
doesn't<00:04:53.860> have<00:04:53.919> to<00:04:53.979> hold<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.370> in<00:04:54.460> robot<00:04:54.789> mode

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
doesn't have to hold it in robot mode

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.680 
doesn't have to hold it in robot mode
just<00:04:56.349> have<00:04:56.500> it<00:04:56.620> comes<00:04:56.800> on<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:58.060> this<00:04:58.419> piece

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
just have it comes on and this piece

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.680 
just have it comes on and this piece
there's<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.080> little<00:04:59.289> hole<00:04:59.470> right<00:04:59.680> there

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
there's a little hole right there

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:12.659 
there's a little hole right there
that<00:05:01.690> you<00:05:01.870> can<00:05:02.050> connect<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:06.849> mini<00:05:07.060> con<00:05:07.300> port

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.939 

and<00:05:13.780> then<00:05:14.780> you<00:05:15.680> can<00:05:15.830> take<00:05:16.009> as<00:05:16.159> many<00:05:16.310> Kahn<00:05:16.610> and

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
and then you can take as many Kahn and

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:25.739 
and then you can take as many Kahn and
transform<00:05:18.949> him<00:05:19.099> back<00:05:19.159> into<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.819> vehicle<00:05:20.150> mode

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:25.749 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:28.059 

sometimes<00:05:26.749> this<00:05:26.900> likes<00:05:27.710> to<00:05:27.860> give<00:05:27.949> you<00:05:28.039> a

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
sometimes this likes to give you a

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:28.839 
sometimes this likes to give you a
little<00:05:28.189> bit<00:05:28.370> of<00:05:28.400> trouble

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
little bit of trouble

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.390 
little bit of trouble
so<00:05:29.539> it<00:05:29.689> just<00:05:29.840> just<00:05:30.439> requires<00:05:30.830> just<00:05:31.039> a<00:05:31.099> small

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
so it just just requires just a small

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.779 
so it just just requires just a small
bit<00:05:31.669> of<00:05:31.789> force<00:05:32.060> to<00:05:32.360> get<00:05:32.749> it<00:05:32.810> in<00:05:33.259> there<00:05:33.639> not<00:05:34.639> too

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
bit of force to get it in there not too

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:40.260 
bit of force to get it in there not too
much<00:05:34.939> because<00:05:35.120> you'll<00:05:35.389> end<00:05:35.419> up<00:05:35.569> breaking<00:05:35.779> it

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.230 

and<00:05:41.270> then<00:05:41.449> just<00:05:41.659> click<00:05:41.930> as<00:05:42.110> many<00:05:42.349> time<00:05:42.560> I<00:05:42.590> guess

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
and then just click as many time I guess

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:56.820 
and then just click as many time I guess
we'll<00:05:44.240> plug<00:05:44.419> them<00:05:44.569> in<00:05:44.719> right<00:05:44.900> up<00:05:45.020> here<00:05:51.430> yeah

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.830 

this<00:05:57.310> was<00:05:57.580> transformers<00:05:58.270> Armada

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
this was transformers Armada
