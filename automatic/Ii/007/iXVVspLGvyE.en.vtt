yeah<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.260> think<00:00:19.320> he<00:00:19.560> could<00:00:19.740> get<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.920> cramp<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
yeah I think he could get a cramp and

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.560 
yeah I think he could get a cramp and
killed<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.760> think<00:00:20.970> changed<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.300> cooldown

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
killed I think changed on cooldown

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.140 
killed I think changed on cooldown
though<00:00:21.930> disrupt<00:00:22.920> her<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.430> run<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.850> he

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
though disrupt her on the run and he

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.759 
though disrupt her on the run and he
should<00:00:24.510> make<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.900> home<00:00:25.050> keep<00:00:25.289> mine<00:00:25.439> dragging

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
should make it home keep mine dragging

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.410 
should make it home keep mine dragging
out<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.039> theory<00:00:26.519> could<00:00:26.550> buy<00:00:26.789> back<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> soil<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
out in theory could buy back a soil and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.580 
out in theory could buy back a soil and
join<00:00:27.539> fight<00:00:27.810> but<00:00:27.990> looks<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.320> he's<00:00:28.439> gonna

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
join fight but looks like he's gonna

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.650 
join fight but looks like he's gonna
