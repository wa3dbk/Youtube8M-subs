 our site 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.000
 you the world of us comes many questions after 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.790
 watching our videos and 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.590
 We had a video about how 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.189
 plant heather crops 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.599
 we showed how to plant heathers 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.710
 rhododendron how do i care for them like 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:32.439
 feed and here they write to us gardener 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.100
 that on your advice they planted heathers 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.430
 this year they have a very bad winter 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.460
 it seems to be good out of the snow 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.129
 then quickly began to dry out in 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.650
 general bushes all dry paragraph had 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.650
 pull them out here dear gardeners i 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.940
 Now tell you how this is the case the field 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.670
 walls in my garden 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.890
 I live in Nizhny Novgorod under the lower 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.379
 Novgorod changes from is that is 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.220
 this is the middle plaza 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.100
 and here is a condition like most 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.530
 Gardeners who are watching us now just 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.310
 exactly what happened this year 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.200
 is generally heathers that are sold in 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.530
 our stores they are mostly 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:23.440
 winter-hardy enough and shelter like 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:26.230
 such from cold and I need me 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.690
 planted last year three varieties 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.510
 that were bought in large garden 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.590
 center all these three varieties are good 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.290
 wintered 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.110
 and feels great on that 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.300
 turned out this year this year was 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.640
 very unfavorable spring 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.030
 if you remember from February 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.880
 started a very strong thaw for a long time 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.720
 they held on so much but how was 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.180
 during the day it was warm and during the night it was still earth 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.979
 5 grabbed 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:02.260
 heathers they are forever green plants then 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.960
 there are these leaves 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.920
 small boots are small 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.739
 leaves they remain under the snow 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.019
 green and out of the ground green 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.510
 here look here them more here you can see 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.390
 here are all the bushes they go 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.430
 from under the winter not only are they still some 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.510
 and with buds here with these that is and 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.760
 buds save 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.909
 kid's some unique plants 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.150
 here see another type of michi 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:34.120
 what a nice green salad y 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.420
 this variety and here these leaves during 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.599
 thaws in warm air begin immediately 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.599
 evaporate moisture and since 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.870
 from the ground from the frozen ground it is moisture 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:51.370
 comes here and it turns out that the bushes 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.730
 dry in fact they burn here under 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.480
 the sun during these thaws i am not 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.629
 First year 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.549
 I grow heathers and never have I 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.400
 hid and all the time for all the sound 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.470
 Here it is received only this spring 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.829
 it happened to me very much too 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.220
 these bushes have dried here 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.650
 if you knew them as they say 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.379
 fall there straw planted yes here in 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.019
 this year it would be necessary to hide them but 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:22.989
 cover not from the frost exactly a pretty 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.569
 night some kind of mesh burlap on them 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.930
 throw or something here if you will 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:32.500
 to build such shelters only 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.340
 be sure to make a box for example 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.340
 put 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.699
 well for an apple there some kind of trellised 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.069
 box put it too on him some 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:45.579
 thats from pretty night stuff or there 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.980
 spunbond or something so under weight 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:51.250
 this snow here spunbond he does not 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.410
 crushed your bushes and so I say 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.349
 I have been growing heathers for several years 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.889
 I was the first time such a well and so too have 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.109
 me these bushes withered and what I did 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:05.079
 I am very short 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:08.349
 cut off these plants here 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:12.579
 I literally left where I was still 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:15.519
 the little green ones are on the border of snow and 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.289
 air here for example i 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.229
 showing not very good twig 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:25.389
 it was established there was snow 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:27.820
 there was already a warm atmosphere of air 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.770
 warm was and here above it all 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.550
 I burned like this 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.960
 cut the hair 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.100
 and look what new shoots I have 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.860
 here you see the branches 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.280
 all benefit 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.820
 over the current season has grown and so was 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.140
 With all my bushes, I want to say that 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.290
 old bushes 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.580
 they have suffered worse such pruning and such 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.650
 here is the anomalous spring 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.140
 You see this old one 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.070
 heather he even has such twigs there 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:02.560
 already rude here down there already rude 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.110
 branches but the bushes are younger 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.910
 here and here these here now see they are young 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.010
 and they are perfectly fine themselves 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.590
 feel and now are gaining such 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.680
 its decorativeness that is not to be afraid 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.530
 do this and do this and pruning 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.140
 continue watering and watering and 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.840
 then another for fattening points who love 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.390
 heathers that is it is a sour fertilizer for 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.570
 azaleas we have already talked about this and 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:31.000
 look here again this season 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.820
 charming klum tank again my 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.530
 Velsky bloom delight and they still will 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.530
 only become more beautiful and more beautiful
