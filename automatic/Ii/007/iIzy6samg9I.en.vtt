there then you

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.970 
there then you
so<00:02:08.250> once<00:02:08.460> you<00:02:08.640> put<00:02:09.630> some<00:02:09.840> butter<00:02:09.870> on<00:02:10.320> these

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
so once you put some butter on these

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.650 
so once you put some butter on these
little<00:02:11.280> ones<00:02:11.460> here<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.880> just<00:02:12.180> generally<00:02:12.360> took<00:02:12.630> a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
little ones here I just generally took a

little ones here I just generally took a
big<00:02:12.870> blob<00:02:13.400> like<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.670> not<00:02:14.940> too<00:02:15.120> much<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.600> then

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
big blob like that not too much and then

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.860 
big blob like that not too much and then
when<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.500> chuck<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> front<00:02:17.250> hand<00:02:17.870> which

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
when I chuck it in the front hand which

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.020 
when I chuck it in the front hand which
is<00:02:19.140> getting<00:02:20.070> hot<00:02:20.310> because<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.580> can<00:02:20.760> see<00:02:20.910> the

is getting hot because you can see the
oil<00:02:21.470> being<00:02:22.470> circular<00:02:23.010> around<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.430> pin<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.720> we

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
oil being circular around the pin and we

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.830 
oil being circular around the pin and we
can<00:02:25.230> throw<00:02:25.500> them<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.280> basically<00:02:26.810> how<00:02:27.810> to
