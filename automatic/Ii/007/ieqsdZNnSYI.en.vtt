00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.179
 in this fun activity with the 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:12.380
 kids see how to make a 

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:16.450
 puppet reigned in cloth and this in 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:21.619
 ten minutes you need a fall 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:26.080
 of yellow cloth a bowl of diameter between 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:30.500
 10 and 12 cm what to cover the hand 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:35.050
 a pair of scissors from the sewing thread or 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:40.190
 if you prefer a stapler a pen 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:42.139
 a red caroline leaf and the 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.440
 decoration such as for example 

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:44.440
 stickers 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.510
 for how 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.120
 it's let's take the yellow fabric drop and 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:58.050
 the bowl will draw you round then you 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.050
 cut them out 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:10.860
 now take the map all in and 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:16.580
 cut eight legs in an arc on 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.580
 a width of 1 cm and a length of 8 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 cm 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.720
 now let's resume the two pieces of 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.080
 yellow fabric 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:39.630
 we are going to graffer 3 to engrave at 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.990
 on top one next to the other then on the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.710
 side or at least on each side bag 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.060
 staples separated from each other 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.440
 1 cm this inside so these holes 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.440
 that we will pass the paws 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:05.830
 stapling finished return the tc 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.970
 yellow outside inwards 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.250
 this step is tricky place them 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:21.360
 legs between the staples on the sides 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.360
 and stapled them in two in fabric 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.109
 you now have to decorate 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:33.500
 paws either with stickers from the 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:36.250
 paint or a little glue with some 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.250
 cotton for example 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.409
 it's time to take care of the head of 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.099
 our spider cuts and two 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:50.049
 pieces of white scotch to achieve 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.489
 the eyes you can do it too 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:59.190
 cardboard and collar and then place a 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.190
 dark sticker for each eye 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.060
 and here is your regnier is over there 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.400
