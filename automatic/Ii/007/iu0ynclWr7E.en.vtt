00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
reasons first of all tariffs tariffs are

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.340 
reasons first of all tariffs tariffs are
basically<00:00:33.600> taxes<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.440> imports<00:00:36.110> so<00:00:37.110> things

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
basically taxes on imports so things

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.100 
basically taxes on imports so things
that<00:00:37.500> are<00:00:37.590> coming<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.850> colonies

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.959 
for example the Stamp Act taxed printed
matter<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.649> things<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:43.980> newspapers<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
matter so things like newspapers and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.020 
matter so things like newspapers and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
of different goods and one of the goods

was<00:00:55.050> tea<00:00:55.760> they<00:00:56.760> basically<00:00:57.180> repealed<00:00:57.870> later

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
was tea they basically repealed later

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.189 
was tea they basically repealed later
the<00:00:58.530> Townsend<00:00:58.980> Act<00:00:59.190> except<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.750> tax<00:01:00.989> on

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
colonists continued to rebel and protest

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.200 
colonists continued to rebel and protest
that<00:01:09.260> that<00:01:10.260> particular<00:01:10.500> tariff<00:01:11.400> most

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
that that particular tariff most

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.789 
that that particular tariff most
famously<00:01:12.750> through<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> Boston<00:01:13.350> Tea<00:01:13.770> Party

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
famously through the Boston Tea Party

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.429 
famously through the Boston Tea Party
where<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.369> took<00:01:14.549> they<00:01:15.119> taxed<00:01:15.630> tea<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.320> they

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
where they took they taxed tea and they

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.260 
where they took they taxed tea and they
dumped<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.860> into<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> Boston<00:01:17.340> Harbor<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
dumped it into the Boston Harbor as a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.190 
dumped it into the Boston Harbor as a
protest<00:01:18.840> um<00:01:19.970> another<00:01:20.970> factor<00:01:21.659> was<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.900> lack

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
protest um another factor was the lack

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.190 
protest um another factor was the lack
of<00:01:22.409> representation<00:01:23.750> there<00:01:24.750> was<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> sort<00:01:25.170> of

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
of representation there was a sort of

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.440 
of representation there was a sort of
rallying<00:01:25.770> cry<00:01:26.130> amongst<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> colonists<00:01:27.210> that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
rallying cry amongst the colonists that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.140 
rallying cry amongst the colonists that
was<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:28.530> was<00:01:28.740> no<00:01:29.220> taxation<00:01:29.729> without

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
was that was no taxation without

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.359 
was that was no taxation without
representation<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.500> basically<00:01:31.920> they<00:01:32.250> were

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
representation so basically they were

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.620 
representation so basically they were
saying<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:32.850> we're<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> pay<00:01:33.360> these<00:01:33.570> high

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
saying if we're going to pay these high

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.620 
saying if we're going to pay these high
tariffs<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:35.250> should<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.670> equal<00:01:35.909> represented

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
tariffs we should have equal represented

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.179 
tariffs we should have equal represented
representation<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> British<00:01:38.159> government

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
representation in the British government

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.249 
representation in the British government
and<00:01:38.729> they<00:01:38.880> had<00:01:39.060> no<00:01:39.270> representation<00:01:39.659> in

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and they had no representation in

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.380 
and they had no representation in
Parliament<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> they<00:01:41.759> felt<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.299> they

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
Parliament so they felt that if they

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.700 
Parliament so they felt that if they
were<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.630> tax<00:01:42.960> they<00:01:43.229> should<00:01:43.439> also<00:01:43.560> have

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
were going to tax they should also have

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.429 
were going to tax they should also have
representation<00:01:44.659> another<00:01:45.659> issue<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
representation another issue was the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.030 
representation another issue was the
quartering<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.130> British<00:01:47.399> soldiers<00:01:47.670> um

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
quartering of British soldiers um

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.710 
quartering of British soldiers um
initially<00:01:50.040> they<00:01:50.490> were<00:01:50.549> being<00:01:51.210> quartered

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
initially they were being quartered

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.920 
initially they were being quartered
because<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.439> British<00:01:53.399> expansion<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.360> North

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
because of British expansion in North

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.480 
because of British expansion in North
America<00:01:55.380> following<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.950> territories<00:01:56.460> they

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
America following the territories they

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.340 
America following the territories they
got<00:01:56.820> after<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> French<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.689> Indian<00:01:57.990> War<00:01:58.320> and

got after the French and Indian War and
their<00:01:58.649> victory<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.130> war<00:01:59.250> they<00:02:00.149> needed

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
their victory in that war they needed

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.380 
their victory in that war they needed
his<00:02:00.570> house<00:02:00.899> troops<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:02.280> sort<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.579> run<00:02:03.180> those

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
the Patriots so that they could sort of

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.420 
the Patriots so that they could sort of
weaken<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.840> British<00:04:58.230> who<00:04:58.800> they<00:04:58.950> had<00:04:59.100> lots<00:04:59.310> of

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
weaken the British who they had lots of

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.080 
weaken the British who they had lots of
conflict<00:04:59.970> with<00:05:01.310> but<00:05:02.310> they<00:05:02.460> were<00:05:02.520> waiting<00:05:03.000> to

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
conflict with but they were waiting to

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.120 
conflict with but they were waiting to
see<00:05:03.120> if<00:05:03.630> it<00:05:03.870> seemed<00:05:04.200> viable<00:05:04.740> if<00:05:04.830> they<00:05:04.950> thought

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
see if it seemed viable if they thought

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.770 
see if it seemed viable if they thought
the<00:05:05.340> Patriots<00:05:05.730> really<00:05:05.970> stood<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.210> chance<00:05:06.270> and

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
the Patriots really stood a chance and

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.240 
the Patriots really stood a chance and
when<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.080> Patriots<00:05:07.560> won<00:05:07.740> this<00:05:07.890> Battle<00:05:08.220> of

when the Patriots won this Battle of

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.220 
when the Patriots won this Battle of
Saratoga<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:09.240> French<00:05:09.510> decided<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:10.080> they

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
Saratoga the French decided that they

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.770 
Saratoga the French decided that they
did<00:05:10.470> and<00:05:10.710> then<00:05:10.800> they<00:05:10.950> put<00:05:11.190> economic<00:05:11.940> support

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
did and then they put economic support

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.840 
did and then they put economic support
behind<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.290> Patriots<00:05:13.770> they<00:05:14.100> also<00:05:14.400> started<00:05:14.760> to

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
behind the Patriots they also started to

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.370 
behind the Patriots they also started to
give<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.090> weapons<00:05:15.600> and<00:05:15.810> all<00:05:15.870> sorts<00:05:16.170> of<00:05:16.230> other

give the weapons and all sorts of other
military<00:05:16.650> support<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:18.630> a<00:05:18.930> lot<00:05:19.290> of<00:05:19.320> people

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
military support so a lot of people

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.140 
military support so a lot of people
argue<00:05:20.010> a<00:05:20.160> lot<00:05:20.310> of<00:05:20.400> historians<00:05:20.850> argue<00:05:21.000> that

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
argue a lot of historians argue that

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.360 
argue a lot of historians argue that
without<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.870> French<00:05:22.140> aid<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.890> Patriot

without the French aid the Patriot

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.830 
without the French aid the Patriot
armies<00:05:23.700> might<00:05:23.910> not<00:05:24.120> have<00:05:24.360> been<00:05:24.510> able<00:05:24.720> to

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
armies might not have been able to

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.870 
armies might not have been able to
defeat<00:05:25.170> the<00:05:25.380> British<00:05:25.500> so<00:05:25.890> this<00:05:26.340> aid<00:05:26.610> from<00:05:26.820> the
