located on the solder board here and

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.780 
located on the solder board here and
then<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.560> also<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> user<00:00:32.189> interface<00:00:32.610> here

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
then we also have a user interface here

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.370 
then we also have a user interface here
with<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.000> keypad<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.390> LCD<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.170> see

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
with a keypad and LCD so here we see

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.490 
with a keypad and LCD so here we see
like<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.950> welcome<00:00:38.340> screen<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.940> here

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
like this is a welcome screen so here

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.400 
like this is a welcome screen so here
and<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.620> stethoscope<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.700> put<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.260> at<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
and this stethoscope is put to a at the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.350 
and this stethoscope is put to a at the
heart<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:44.010> clear<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.760> real<00:00:44.910> time<00:00:45.149> using

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
heart we can clear it in real time using

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.750 
heart we can clear it in real time using
a<00:00:45.510> headphone<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.550> several

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
a headphone and we have several

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.549 
a headphone and we have several
functions<00:00:47.940> here<00:00:48.360> such<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:48.960> recording<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
functions here such as recording a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.459 
functions here such as recording a
waveform<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.850> collect<00:00:51.270> ten<00:00:51.510> seconds<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
waveform we collect ten seconds of

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.160 
waveform we collect ten seconds of
cardiac<00:00:52.770> signal<00:00:53.039> forms<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:54.239> also<00:00:54.390> play<00:00:54.780> rate

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
cardiac signal forms we also play rate

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.319 
cardiac signal forms we also play rate
these<00:00:55.289> recording<00:00:55.680> waveforms<00:00:56.239> adjust<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
these recording waveforms adjust the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.479 
these recording waveforms adjust the
volume<00:00:57.570> settings<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> headphone<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
volume settings for the headphone and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.209 
volume settings for the headphone and
view<00:01:00.270> settings<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:01.320> how<00:01:01.649> many<00:01:01.710> waveforms

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
view settings like how many waveforms

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.729 
view settings like how many waveforms
were<00:01:02.309> saved<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> let's<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.409> go<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
were saved and so let's just go to that

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.270 
were saved and so let's just go to that
mode<00:01:04.979> right<00:01:05.100> now

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
mode right now

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.700 
mode right now
so<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> volume<00:01:06.119> level<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
so like the volume level in the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.060 
so like the volume level in the
waveforms<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.740> are<00:01:07.920> saved<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:10.070> we

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
waveforms that are saved and then we

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.300 
waveforms that are saved and then we
also<00:01:11.220> didn't<00:01:12.030> erase<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> flash<00:01:12.510> memory<00:01:12.810> like

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
also didn't erase the flash memory like

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.810 
also didn't erase the flash memory like
here<00:01:14.509> memory<00:01:16.790> is<00:01:18.560> underneath<00:01:19.560> MCU<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> flash

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
here memory is underneath MCU a flash

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.030 
here memory is underneath MCU a flash
memory<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.360> actually<00:01:21.689> right<00:01:22.560> who<00:01:22.830> actually

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
memory is actually right who actually

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.609 
memory is actually right who actually
should<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> flash<00:01:24.330> ram<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.049> yeah

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
should have a flash ram on there yeah

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.830 
should have a flash ram on there yeah
it's<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.009> megabyte<00:01:26.280> flash<00:01:26.549> memory<00:01:27.330> ICT

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it's a one megabyte flash memory ICT

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.899 
it's a one megabyte flash memory ICT
which<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.290> communicate<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.860> using<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> SPI

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
which we communicate with using the SPI

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.760 
which we communicate with using the SPI
okay<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:31.500> also<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.979> MATLAB<00:01:32.310> GUI<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.229> use

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
okay we also have MATLAB GUI so we use

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.920 
okay we also have MATLAB GUI so we use
the<00:01:34.979> serial<00:01:35.509> port<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:36.810> too

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.480 

transmitted<00:01:40.930> heart<00:01:41.619> measurement<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.159> math

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
transmitted heart measurement to math

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.859 
transmitted heart measurement to math
and<00:01:43.090> detect<00:01:44.430> heart<00:01:45.430> rate<00:01:45.549> using<00:01:45.790> VDP<00:01:46.330> on<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.630> so

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
and detect heart rate using VDP on it so

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.920 
and detect heart rate using VDP on it so
very<00:01:47.200> so<00:01:48.159> so<00:01:48.490> now<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.729> have<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.540> have<00:01:49.689> the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
very so so now you have the you have the

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.969 
very so so now you have the you have the
sensor<00:01:50.320> on<00:01:50.470> your<00:01:50.500> chest<00:01:50.950> there<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.799> you're

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
sensor on your chest there and you're

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:07.260 
sensor on your chest there and you're
setting<00:01:54.280> it<00:01:54.490> up<00:02:04.770> oh<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:06.100> see<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.640> it's<00:02:06.789> locking

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
setting it up oh I see and it's locking

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.090 
setting it up oh I see and it's locking
in<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.479> rate<00:02:08.229> of<00:02:09.099> about<00:02:09.310> 77<00:02:10.299> or<00:02:10.539> 78<00:02:10.799> and<00:02:11.799> how<00:02:12.040> are

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
in a rate of about 77 or 78 and how are

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.620 
in a rate of about 77 or 78 and how are
you<00:02:12.220> getting<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.640> heart<00:02:12.850> rate<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:13.090> this<00:02:13.390> by

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
you getting the heart rate is this by

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.740 
you getting the heart rate is this by
using<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.580> first<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.000> second<00:02:16.209> derivative<00:02:16.569> of

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
using the first and second derivative of

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.990 
using the first and second derivative of
the<00:02:17.170> real-time<00:02:17.860> signal<00:02:18.250> here<00:02:18.430> do<00:02:18.610> we<00:02:18.730> do<00:02:18.880> the

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
the real-time signal here do we do the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.220 
the real-time signal here do we do the
first<00:02:19.150> derivative<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.569> determine<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.989> spike

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
first derivative to determine the spike

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.390 
first derivative to determine the spike
and<00:02:20.440> then<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.680> second<00:02:20.920> derivative<00:02:21.010> to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
and then the second derivative to

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.470 
and then the second derivative to
determine<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:22.000> exact<00:02:22.269> second<00:02:22.630> aware<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:24.480> so

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
determine the exact second aware that so

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.960 
determine the exact second aware that so
it's<00:02:25.600> it's<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:26.049> fully<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.730> time<00:02:27.730> domain<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:32.970> seems

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
it's it's a fully a time domain it seems

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:44.430 
it's it's a fully a time domain it seems
pretty<00:02:34.239> stable<00:02:34.630> we<00:02:34.959> can<00:02:35.080> also<00:02:35.200> here<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:43.440> give

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
pretty stable we can also here just give

00:02:44.440 --> 00:03:07.780 
pretty stable we can also here just give
you<00:02:44.620> some<00:02:44.799> feedback<00:02:45.010> with<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.430> sensor<00:02:45.880> there

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.160 

thank<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.090> think<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.480> sound<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.019> little

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
thank you I think the sound is a little

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.830 
thank you I think the sound is a little
bit<00:03:11.629> that's<00:03:14.209> really<00:03:15.209> late<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.390> it's<00:03:15.690> just

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
bit that's really late so it's just

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.539 
bit that's really late so it's just
right<00:03:16.170> before<00:03:18.349> so<00:03:19.349> then<00:03:19.769> we<00:03:19.890> can<00:03:20.010> record

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
right before so then we can record

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.850 
right before so then we can record
10-second<00:03:21.150> samples<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:22.260> then<00:03:22.530> play<00:03:22.769> them

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
10-second samples and then play them

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.759 
10-second samples and then play them
back<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.610> delete<00:03:24.510> them<00:03:24.630> whenever<00:03:25.319> we<00:03:25.410> want

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
back and delete them whenever we want

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.010 
back and delete them whenever we want
so<00:03:26.810> very<00:03:27.810> cool<00:03:27.989> thank<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.500> thank<00:03:28.860> you
