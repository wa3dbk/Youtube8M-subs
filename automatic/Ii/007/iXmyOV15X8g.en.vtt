00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.740
 which is a difficult video to make but is 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.510
 a very exciting and very cool video 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:26.400
 also that this is a moment 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.279
 very important in my career . 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.349
 division a moment of news moment 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.149
 You know where I have to break with 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.260
 something of the past to give a 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.260
 step into the future 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:47.199
 then to do it 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:49.989
 ah I had I thought too much, I talked 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.499
 with a lot of people I advised a lot 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.350
 people and finally what's happening 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:01:01.120
 here is the following I'm leaving for 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:04.960

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.890
 dose - guitar then from that 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.979
 Moment I 'm not in the dorms anymore. 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.539
 rapper guitars used here are 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.780
 phenomenal 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:20.350
 the kléber continues to link my face 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.990
 which I greatly enjoy having been four years of 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.380
 A very cool job, well done. 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.899
 and what I'm proud of most was great 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.399
 has a lot of video playing there with the 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:35.710

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:45.880
 I am proud and pleased to have done more 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.359
 now I 'm taking a new step in the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.859
 my career for something that I 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:59.369
 I suspect it will be great that it's mine. 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.369
 dosse prevent new strain 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.470
 but in forró 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:16.310
 the queen ladies and gentlemen i am new 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:18.590
 indoor from eagle guitars and then 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.560
 A lot of talk in the daytime 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.560
 one of the things that drew me to 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.280
 they knew they were super partners 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.230
 Is that what we're going to do then the guitar? 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.450
 it's not going to be late now, it's no use 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.820
 to rush to leave is not all done 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.750
 calm down but the model guitar 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.959
 business marks and something that is so 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:46.430
 indispensable in avoiding to dictate 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.260
 business model is exactly the same as 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.870
 that use I'll get a guitar from 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.209
 line is not his like suddenly have 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.519
 I've heard that we have to ask the 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:00.010
 wait with a different way not to 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:03.709
 mine is with the wood x ac by the shop no 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.640
 is exactly the same as the store if not 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.709
 Make the Difference of Guitar Guitars 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.720
 particularly for the guitars that will be 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.209
 sold to be sold in the store is 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.890
 I'm going to pick up guitar 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.720
 adjustable like it was the most quota 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.670
 low by the highest rope 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.700
 I want the pickup closest to the 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.110
 rope but the parts everything has to be 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.510
 exactly the same 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.390
 so wait it will be a long time 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.120
 yet we have no hurry but will 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.690
 roll to dictate the signature template frames 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.810
 veloso 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.870
 however while not seeing them I 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.810
 they sent a guitar and dude I'm 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:47.049
 crazy to see what this video is then 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.680
 has turned out to be 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:54.079
 box 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:57.019
 I was not going to do it, I did not do much. 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.549
 video you know how to say I felt that 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.280
 I 'm crazy to do it because I want to 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.920
 see this guitar once then 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:19.489
 Let's see if the staff at Iquego 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:19.489
 I am sending to you my sky god I think 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:43.680
 What I want, I do not know, but I 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:59.990
 I'm nervous about this story that we have 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:59.990
 here comes my friend she's packed 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:21.580
 the same as the magician and the child who 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:21.580
 looking great from the new is the a look over there 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:47.610
 damn near and far 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:49.879
 she comes out of tune 11 baby does not go there 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.620
 I'll have to send it back to fine-tune. 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:57.300
 we have the following before you 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:06:01.020
 ask me about guitar review 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.719
 goals and it's obvious what I'm going to do is expensive 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.460
 but the first moment I found it 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:15.569
 she's pretty magic 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:17.610
 The one who is the famous friend is the famous one. 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.349
 guitar I do not know the model I go 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.940
 leave written down here because still 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:26.460
 I do not know why you have not got anything yet. 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.020
 Oh, man, we'll find out so ladies. 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.449
 and gentlemen this is what I had to 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:35.939
 saying new endorsement of eagle guitars and 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.779
 promoting what is the sound of this little beauty 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:40.710

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:43.250

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.250
