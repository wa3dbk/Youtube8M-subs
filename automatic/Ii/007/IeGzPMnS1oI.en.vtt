open<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.240> sender<00:00:03.629> up<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.929> little<00:00:04.140> bit<00:00:04.380> but<00:00:05.160> once

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
open the sender up a little bit but once

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.560 
open the sender up a little bit but once
we<00:00:05.609> have<00:00:05.819> these<00:00:05.970> two<00:00:06.270> curves<00:00:06.620> with<00:00:07.620> our<00:00:11.570> well

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
we have these two curves with our well

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.120 
we have these two curves with our well
this<00:00:12.780> one<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.230> double<00:00:13.440> taper<00:00:13.830> mandrel<00:00:15.890> we<00:00:16.890> can

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
this one the double taper mandrel we can

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.519 
this one the double taper mandrel we can
use<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.670> tool<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.359> pull<00:00:18.869> these<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.350> together

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
use this tool and pull these in together

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.070 
use this tool and pull these in together
to<00:00:20.279> squeeze<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.820> close<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.510> we've<00:00:21.660> got<00:00:21.810> two

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
to squeeze it close so we've got two

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.920 
to squeeze it close so we've got two
perfect<00:00:22.590> little<00:00:22.710> spots<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.550> fits<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:24.060> we

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
perfect little spots that it fits in we

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.470 
perfect little spots that it fits in we
can<00:00:25.109> also<00:00:25.260> use<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.920> double<00:00:26.369> tapered<00:00:26.789> mandrel

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
can also use this double tapered mandrel

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.650 
can also use this double tapered mandrel
to<00:00:27.720> hold<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:29.220> such<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> way<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.449> can

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
to hold it in such a way that we can

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.700 
to hold it in such a way that we can
lightly<00:00:30.900> tap<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.769> form<00:00:32.309> right<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:33.710> to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
lightly tap and form right on here to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.549 
lightly tap and form right on here to
make<00:00:34.890> them<00:00:35.070> even<00:00:35.719> here<00:00:36.719> again<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.350> have

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
make them even here again if you have

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.500 
make them even here again if you have
registration<00:00:38.100> marks<00:00:38.730> or<00:00:38.969> at<00:00:39.090> least<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.480> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
registration marks or at least so that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.420 
registration marks or at least so that
you<00:00:39.780> know<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:39.989> each<00:00:40.350> curl<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.190> same

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
you know that each curl is the same

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.880 
you know that each curl is the same
length<00:00:41.790> then<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.180> can<00:00:42.480> tell<00:00:42.719> when<00:00:42.899> event<00:00:43.230> but

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
length then we can tell when event but

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
length then we can tell when event but
this<00:00:44.070> kind<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.430> forming<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.120> will<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.510> quite

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
this kind of forming I will do quite

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.380 
this kind of forming I will do quite
frequently<00:00:46.190> right<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> bench<00:00:47.879> so

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
frequently right here at the bench so

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.690 
frequently right here at the bench so
we've<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:48.690> got<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> much<00:00:49.410> smaller<00:00:49.800> bezel

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
we've just got a much smaller bezel

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.240 
we've just got a much smaller bezel
mandrel<00:00:51.360> instead<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.899> ring<00:00:52.110> mandrel<00:00:52.379> really

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
mandrel instead of a ring mandrel really

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.920 
mandrel instead of a ring mandrel really
it's<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.520> an<00:00:53.820> anvil<00:00:54.030> we're<00:00:54.480> just<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.840> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it's just an anvil we're just going to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.950 
it's just an anvil we're just going to
use<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> round<00:00:55.440> anvil<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.340> put<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.600> now

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
use a round anvil and put it in and now

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.049 
use a round anvil and put it in and now
if<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.260> needed<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> adjust<00:00:58.890> these<00:00:59.430> I'd<00:00:59.879> have

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
if I needed to adjust these I'd have

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.299 
if I needed to adjust these I'd have
this<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.510> was<00:01:00.690> locked<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.199> place<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:02.160> I

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
this so it was locked in place but I

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.580 
this so it was locked in place but I
didn't<00:01:02.840> form<00:01:03.840> these<00:01:04.049> over<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.489> stationary

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
didn't form these over this stationary

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.280 
didn't form these over this stationary
anvil<00:01:07.590> slash<00:01:07.890> mandrel<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.850> needed<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.390> if<00:01:10.170> we

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
anvil slash mandrel if I needed to if we

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.050 
anvil slash mandrel if I needed to if we
wanted<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> flare<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> ends<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.549> could<00:01:11.729> put<00:01:11.939> it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
wanted to flare the ends we could put it

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.969 
wanted to flare the ends we could put it
on<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:12.960> could<00:01:13.110> Forge<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.799> end

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
on here and then we could Forge the end

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.730 
on here and then we could Forge the end
if<00:01:14.520> we're<00:01:14.790> using<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.210> steel<00:01:15.509> hammer<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.500> the

technically<00:01:19.470> we'd<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.920> forging<00:01:20.490> or

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
technically we'd be forging or

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.510 
technically we'd be forging or
planishing<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.960> we<00:01:22.140> curved<00:01:22.439> them<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:23.280> was<00:01:23.490> a

is<00:01:43.049> an<00:01:43.200> old<00:01:43.439> pair<00:01:44.329> I'd<00:01:45.329> probably<00:01:45.689> not<00:01:46.229> be

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
is an old pair I'd probably not be

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.499 
is an old pair I'd probably not be
opposed<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.100> doing<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> really

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
opposed to doing this if it was a really

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.230 
opposed to doing this if it was a really
good<00:01:48.840> pair<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> make<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> different<00:01:50.100> tool<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:51.119> if

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
good pair I make a different tool but if

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.969 
good pair I make a different tool but if
we<00:01:51.390> turn<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.689> around<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.350> work<00:01:52.530> from<00:01:52.710> both

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
we turn it around and work from both

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.880 
we turn it around and work from both
sides<00:01:53.360> we<00:01:54.360> just<00:01:54.630> look<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> radius<00:01:55.619> the

sides we just look for the radius the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.380 
sides we just look for the radius the
curve<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.549> wanted

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.090 

adjust<00:02:00.390> them<00:02:00.659> as<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.229> adjust<00:02:01.380> them<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:01.979> it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
adjust them as we adjust them and it

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.860 
adjust them as we adjust them and it
pulls<00:02:02.370> it<00:02:02.610> together<00:02:02.760> it's<00:02:03.270> gonna<00:02:03.450> make<00:02:03.690> the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
pulls it together it's gonna make the

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.650 
pulls it together it's gonna make the
ring<00:02:04.080> smaller<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.540> work<00:02:07.009> in<00:02:08.009> four<00:02:08.660> then

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
ring smaller so just work in four then

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.130 
ring smaller so just work in four then
we<00:02:09.810> put<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.350> here<00:02:10.740> readjust<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.850> shape<00:02:12.140> as

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
we put it on here readjust the shape as

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.970 
we put it on here readjust the shape as
it<00:02:13.410> pulls<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.830> open<00:02:15.170> readjust<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.350> shape<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
it pulls it open readjust this shape and

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.980 
it pulls it open readjust this shape and
you've<00:02:17.670> notice<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.209> lot<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.510> stuff<00:02:18.690> we're<00:02:18.870> doing

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
you've notice a lot of stuff we're doing

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.020 
you've notice a lot of stuff we're doing
it's<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.860> process<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.400> working<00:02:20.760> in<00:02:20.880> this

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
it's a process of working in this

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.180 
it's a process of working in this
direction<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.720> preventing<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.440> we're<00:02:22.950> kind

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
direction and preventing it we're kind

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.090 
direction and preventing it we're kind
of<00:02:23.310> working<00:02:23.670> two<00:02:23.880> different<00:02:24.360> things<00:02:25.100> it

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
of working two different things it

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.460 
of working two different things it
sequentially<00:02:27.060> once<00:02:27.600> we<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.170> here

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
sequentially once we have it on here

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.970 
sequentially once we have it on here
really<00:02:28.830> easy<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.370> pull<00:02:29.640> them<00:02:29.819> together

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
really easy to pull them together

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.680 
really easy to pull them together
pulling<00:02:31.980> them<00:02:32.130> together<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.760> combination<00:02:33.450> of

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
pulling them together the combination of

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.910 
pulling them together the combination of
this<00:02:34.020> double<00:02:34.890> tapered<00:02:35.280> mandrel<00:02:35.910> tool<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:37.019> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
this double tapered mandrel tool and the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.280 
this double tapered mandrel tool and the
ring<00:02:38.190> mandrel<00:02:38.489> we<00:02:39.269> can<00:02:39.480> keep<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.900> center<00:02:40.260> of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
ring mandrel we can keep the center of

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.470 
ring mandrel we can keep the center of
the<00:02:40.500> ring<00:02:40.709> round<00:02:41.010> as<00:02:41.430> we<00:02:41.820> squeeze<00:02:42.180> these

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the ring round as we squeeze these

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.190 
the ring round as we squeeze these
together<00:02:43.370> if<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.610> squeeze<00:02:44.940> too<00:02:45.360> far<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.989> can

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
together if we squeeze too far you can

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.440 
together if we squeeze too far you can
see<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.680> would<00:02:46.920> take<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.430> curves<00:02:47.760> out<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
see it would take the curves out and

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.540 
see it would take the curves out and
they<00:02:48.540> would<00:02:48.720> open<00:02:48.840> up<00:02:49.110> again<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:50.400> it's

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
they would open up again and so it's

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.130 
they would open up again and so it's
little<00:02:50.880> adjustments<00:02:51.570> making<00:02:51.930> little

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
little adjustments making little

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.790 
little adjustments making little
adjustments<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:54.390> I'm<00:02:55.140> not<00:02:55.350> guaranteeing

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
adjustments and I'm not guaranteeing

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.009 
adjustments and I'm not guaranteeing
that<00:02:55.860> perfect<00:02:56.459> it's<00:02:56.640> only<00:02:56.820> it's<00:02:57.420> pretty<00:02:57.780> near

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
that perfect it's only it's pretty near

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.140 
that perfect it's only it's pretty near
but<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.830> can<00:02:59.010> see<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.340> if<00:02:59.489> we<00:02:59.519> if<00:02:59.820> we<00:02:59.850> have

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
but you can see that if we if we have

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.090 
but you can see that if we if we have
round<00:03:00.480> tools<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.230> we<00:03:01.320> have<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> lot<00:03:01.769> of<00:03:01.920> round

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
round tools and we have a lot of round

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.979 
round tools and we have a lot of round
taper<00:03:02.370> tools<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.910> makes<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.269> really<00:03:03.480> easy<00:03:03.600> to

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
taper tools it makes it really easy to

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.920 
taper tools it makes it really easy to
make<00:03:04.320> things<00:03:04.590> matches<00:03:05.130> thanks<00:03:05.579> -<00:03:05.850> not<00:03:06.360> pulled

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
make things matches thanks - not pulled

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.020 
make things matches thanks - not pulled
together<00:03:07.140> it's<00:03:07.680> my<00:03:07.890> childhood<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.640> pull<00:03:08.910> it

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
together it's my childhood I pull it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.670 
together it's my childhood I pull it
together<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.690> this<00:03:09.840> one<00:03:10.049> we<00:03:10.200> could<00:03:10.380> do<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
together so this one we could do the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.740 
together so this one we could do the
same<00:03:10.890> way<00:03:11.160> if<00:03:11.489> we<00:03:11.670> could<00:03:11.850> put<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.269> on<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
same way if we could put it on the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.170 
same way if we could put it on the
mantel<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.769> this<00:03:13.920> similar<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.910> right

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
mantel and is this similar to the right

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.780 
mantel and is this similar to the right
sides<00:03:15.510> inside<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.829> we<00:03:17.040> just<00:03:17.220> need<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.579> close

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
sides inside so we just need to close

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.150 
sides inside so we just need to close
this<00:03:18.060> up<00:03:18.299> so<00:03:18.720> if<00:03:18.840> we<00:03:18.989> find<00:03:19.290> where<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.680> goes<00:03:19.860> on

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
this up so if we find where it goes on

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:28.310 
this up so if we find where it goes on
the<00:03:20.280> mandrel<00:03:20.670> if<00:03:21.660> we<00:03:21.870> could<00:03:22.049> do<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.260> just<00:03:27.320> so

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
the mandrel if we could do it just so

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.920 
the mandrel if we could do it just so
here's<00:03:28.560> another<00:03:28.920> tip<00:03:29.220> that's<00:03:29.489> helpful<00:03:29.930> as

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
here's another tip that's helpful as

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.400 
here's another tip that's helpful as
we're<00:03:31.290> doing<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.829> it<00:03:32.100> doesn't<00:03:32.519> hurt<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:33.410> to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
we're doing that it doesn't hurt to to

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.310 
we're doing that it doesn't hurt to to
each<00:03:35.070> stage<00:03:35.549> just<00:03:36.060> trace<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.450> on<00:03:36.870> your<00:03:37.110> paper

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
each stage just trace it on your paper

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.380 
each stage just trace it on your paper
real<00:03:37.680> quickly<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.459> then<00:03:38.640> you've<00:03:38.790> got<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.000> little

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
real quickly so then you've got a little

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.500 
real quickly so then you've got a little
evolutionary<00:03:40.260> diagramming<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.430> it<00:03:41.610> also<00:03:42.180> as

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
evolutionary diagramming of it also as

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.479 
evolutionary diagramming of it also as
we<00:03:42.750> as<00:03:43.049> we<00:03:43.260> adjust<00:03:43.560> these<00:03:44.070> in<00:03:44.310> they're<00:03:44.459> not

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
we as we adjust these in they're not

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.910 
we as we adjust these in they're not
quite<00:03:44.910> straight<00:03:45.299> we<00:03:46.019> could<00:03:46.230> take<00:03:46.440> two<00:03:46.680> pairs

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
quite straight we could take two pairs

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.979 
quite straight we could take two pairs
of<00:03:47.130> pliers<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.640> grab<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.090> like<00:03:48.269> this<00:03:48.450> and

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
of pliers and grab it like this and

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.229 
of pliers and grab it like this and
adjust<00:03:49.350> them<00:03:49.620> or<00:03:50.070> we<00:03:50.220> could<00:03:50.400> just<00:03:50.610> put<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:50.970> up

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
adjust them or we could just put it up

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.180 
adjust them or we could just put it up
on<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.540> bench<00:03:51.750> pin<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.320> using<00:03:52.680> our<00:03:52.890> best

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
on the bench pin and using our best

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.569 
on the bench pin and using our best
friend<00:03:53.519> leverage<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.810> can<00:03:55.049> just<00:03:55.320> gently<00:03:56.010> push

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
friend leverage you can just gently push

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.030 
friend leverage you can just gently push
which<00:03:56.880> side<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.209> we<00:03:57.540> need<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:58.019> if<00:03:58.380> we<00:03:58.739> had<00:03:58.920> to

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
which side that we need to if we had to
