00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
stove you want to do about two or three

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.100 
stove you want to do about two or three
minutes<00:04:11.900> on<00:04:11.990> each<00:04:12.140> side<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:13.280> know<00:04:13.400> with<00:04:13.610> a

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
minutes on each side you know with a

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.479 
minutes on each side you know with a
this<00:04:15.110> type<00:04:15.350> of<00:04:15.380> cooking<00:04:15.890> you<00:04:16.010> got<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.250> kind<00:04:16.400> of

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
this type of cooking you got to kind of

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.560 
this type of cooking you got to kind of
eyeball<00:04:16.850> it<00:04:18.520> see<00:04:19.520> it's<00:04:19.670> sizzling<00:04:19.880> there<00:04:20.330> so

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
eyeball it see it's sizzling there so

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.500 
eyeball it see it's sizzling there so

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
it because I can't regulate my heat on

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.839 
it because I can't regulate my heat on
this<00:04:25.310> so

stoves I would suggest that you go with

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.800 
stoves I would suggest that you go with
just<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.370> basic<00:04:57.500> sheet<00:04:58.500> metal<00:04:58.919> type<00:04:59.430> 1<00:04:59.810> this

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
just the basic sheet metal type 1 this

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.550 
just the basic sheet metal type 1 this
one<00:05:01.020> here<00:05:01.580> called<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.879> frontiersman<00:05:03.810> model

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
one here called the frontiersman model

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.469 
one here called the frontiersman model
and<00:05:05.550> there's<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.120> model<00:05:06.509> number<00:05:06.840> but<00:05:07.770> a<00:05:08.479> lot

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
and there's the model number but a lot

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.089 
and there's the model number but a lot
of<00:05:09.509> these<00:05:09.659> wood<00:05:09.870> stoves<00:05:10.199> nowadays<00:05:10.860> because

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
of these wood stoves nowadays because

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.439 
of these wood stoves nowadays because
the<00:05:11.370> safety<00:05:11.759> and<00:05:11.819> steps<00:05:12.060> are<00:05:12.210> kind<00:05:12.389> of

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
the safety and steps are kind of

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.089 
the safety and steps are kind of
insulated<00:05:13.110> so<00:05:13.229> little<00:05:13.469> kids<00:05:13.680> don't<00:05:13.919> burn

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
insulated so little kids don't burn

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.219 
insulated so little kids don't burn
themselves<00:05:14.310> but<00:05:14.789> if<00:05:15.509> you're<00:05:15.719> going<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:15.930> use<00:05:16.199> a

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
stove for cooking you want it to be just

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.719 
stove for cooking you want it to be just
the<00:05:19.199> sheet<00:05:19.469> metal<00:05:19.650> just<00:05:19.949> the<00:05:20.099> basic<00:05:20.520> sheet

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
the sheet metal just the basic sheet

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.399 
the sheet metal just the basic sheet
metal<00:05:21.000> so<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:21.180> heats<00:05:21.479> on<00:05:21.690> what<00:05:21.900> I<00:05:21.930> do<00:05:22.080> is<00:05:22.289> why

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:22.409 
metal so it heats on what I do is why

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.200 
metal so it heats on what I do is why
