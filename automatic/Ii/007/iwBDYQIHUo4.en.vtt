00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
about how hot she is but I thought that

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.089 
about how hot she is but I thought that
would<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:27.000> little<00:00:27.330> bit<00:00:27.390> weird<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.590> thought

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
would be a little bit weird so I thought

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.179 
would be a little bit weird so I thought
I<00:00:29.130> would<00:00:29.490> kind<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.910> make<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.050> video<00:00:31.320> around

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189

I would kind of make the video around
her<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.700> spread<00:00:33.030> out<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.420> hope<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.840> it

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
her and spread out and hope that it

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.370 
her and spread out and hope that it
seems<00:00:34.230> legitimate<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.149> Clara<00:00:36.149> works<00:00:36.660> with<00:00:37.110> or

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380
