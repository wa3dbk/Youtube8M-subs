going to stick my ohms probe in the pink
wire<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> other<00:01:03.210> probe<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.780> the

back<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.350> car<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.890> check<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.220> resistance

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729

back of the car to check the resistance
in<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:05.939> wire<00:01:06.500> this<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.710> difficult<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.430> on

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
in this wire this is difficult to see on

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.030 
in this wire this is difficult to see on
video<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.630> I've<00:01:09.780> made<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.020> short<00:01:10.409> piece<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.650> wire

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
video so I've made a short piece of wire

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.880 
video so I've made a short piece of wire
that<00:01:11.970> we'll<00:01:12.150> pretend<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.810> our<00:01:13.080> fuel<00:01:13.409> circuit

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that we'll pretend is our fuel circuit

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.530 
that we'll pretend is our fuel circuit
if<00:01:14.130> we<00:01:14.520> own<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.970> circuit<00:01:15.390> from<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> fuel<00:01:16.740> pump

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
if we own the circuit from the fuel pump

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.100 
if we own the circuit from the fuel pump
to<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> relay<00:01:19.820> we<00:01:20.820> should<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.299> continuity

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
to the relay we should have continuity

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.980 
to the relay we should have continuity
or<00:01:22.530> no<00:01:23.130> resistance<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.939> our<00:01:24.270> meter<00:01:24.450> indicates

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.980 
or no resistance and our meter indicates
that<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.680> no<00:01:26.520> resistance<00:01:27.119> or<00:01:27.509> continuity

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
that we have no resistance or continuity

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.069 
that we have no resistance or continuity
that<00:01:28.590> means<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> circuit<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.670> good<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.240> I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that means that the circuit is good if I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.429 
that means that the circuit is good if I
had<00:01:31.320> poor<00:01:31.680> resistance<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.909> no<00:01:33.299> continuity<00:01:33.689> you

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
had poor resistance or no continuity you

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.890 
had poor resistance or no continuity you
would<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> break<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.790> circuit<00:01:36.180> or<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
would have a break in the circuit or you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.690 
would have a break in the circuit or you
could<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.560> connector<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.159> corroded

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
could have a connector that's corroded

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.450 
could have a connector that's corroded
