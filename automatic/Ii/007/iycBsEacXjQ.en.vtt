00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
Latvia Kazakhstan in the another team

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.590 
Latvia Kazakhstan in the another team
remember

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
remember

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.150 
remember
and<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.970> win<00:01:38.150> against<00:01:38.590> Latvia<00:01:39.590> lost

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
and the the win against Latvia lost

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.400 
and the the win against Latvia lost
against<00:01:40.460> Kazakhstan<00:01:41.060> but<00:01:41.510> cassings

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
against Kazakhstan but cassings

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.560 
against Kazakhstan but cassings
Kazakhstan<00:01:43.340> has<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.700> go<00:01:43.850> or<00:01:44.060> something<00:01:44.270> like

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
Kazakhstan has to go or something like

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.560 
Kazakhstan has to go or something like
that<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.110> that's<00:01:45.830> what<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:47.000> thought<00:01:47.300> if<00:01:47.420> it's

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
that so that's what I thought if it's

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.390 
that so that's what I thought if it's
the<00:01:47.720> Olympics<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.260> just<00:01:48.530> show<00:01:48.860> up<00:01:49.100> with<00:01:49.310> the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
the Olympics you just show up with the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.640 
the Olympics you just show up with the
team<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.820> say<00:01:49.910> all<00:01:50.090> right<00:01:50.270> well<00:01:51.170> because<00:01:51.500> of

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
team and say all right well because of

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.090 
team and say all right well because of
the<00:01:51.800> women<00:01:52.610> Olympics<00:01:53.120> now<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.930> they<00:01:54.710> cut<00:01:54.980> the
