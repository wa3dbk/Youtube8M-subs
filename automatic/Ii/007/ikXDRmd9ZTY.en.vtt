00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
think about it late you can also set up

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.659 
think about it late you can also set up
the<00:04:19.959> software<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.500> backup<00:04:20.680> your<00:04:20.919> computer<00:04:21.430> say

the software to backup your computer say

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.460 
the software to backup your computer say
at<00:04:21.909> midnight<00:04:22.330> midnight<00:04:22.840> my<00:04:23.080> computers<00:04:23.380> going

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
at midnight midnight my computers going

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.930 
at midnight midnight my computers going
to<00:04:23.560> come<00:04:23.680> on<00:04:23.770> back<00:04:23.919> itself<00:04:24.250> up<00:04:24.430> right<00:04:24.760> and

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
to come on back itself up right and

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.040 
to come on back itself up right and
you're<00:04:25.090> done<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.390> never<00:04:25.570> really<00:04:25.810> have<00:04:25.900> to

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
you're done you never really have to

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.260 
you're done you never really have to
think<00:04:26.229> about<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:27.070> it's<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.490> it's<00:04:27.669> so<00:04:27.970> this<00:04:28.120> is

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
think about it so it's a it's so this is

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.850 
think about it so it's a it's so this is
literally<00:04:28.690> though<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.169> an<00:04:29.380> external<00:04:29.830> hard

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
literally though is an external hard

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.730 
literally though is an external hard
this<00:04:30.130> is<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.640> exact<00:04:31.360> replica<00:04:32.229> the<00:04:32.380> piece<00:04:32.560> of

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
this is the exact replica the piece of

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.310 
this is the exact replica the piece of
rice<00:04:33.340> crashes<00:04:34.120> yeah<00:04:34.240> that<00:04:34.690> is<00:04:34.840> going<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.169> break

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
rice crashes yeah that is going to break

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.500 
rice crashes yeah that is going to break
down<00:04:35.560> now<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:36.039> probability<00:04:36.820> of<00:04:36.849> both<00:04:37.120> of<00:04:37.150> them

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
down now the probability of both of them

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.600 
down now the probability of both of them
going<00:04:38.020> down<00:04:38.289> at<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.590> same<00:04:38.710> time<00:04:38.950> very<00:04:39.280> low

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
going down at the same time very low

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.940 
going down at the same time very low
yeah<00:04:39.940> do<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.210> statistics<00:04:40.659> very<00:04:40.840> low<00:04:40.990> but<00:04:41.800> if

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
yeah do the statistics very low but if

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.500 
yeah do the statistics very low but if
that<00:04:42.130> does<00:04:42.370> happen<00:04:42.400> if<00:04:42.880> one<00:04:43.060> or<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.479> other

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
that does happen if one or the other

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.060 
that does happen if one or the other
does<00:04:44.140> go<00:04:44.349> down<00:04:44.380> you're<00:04:44.680> going<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:44.860> want<00:04:45.010> to

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
does go down you're going to want to

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.980 
does go down you're going to want to
turn<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.460> other<00:04:45.610> off<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.240> get<00:04:46.570> help<00:04:46.780> with

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
turn the other off and get help with

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.080 
turn the other off and get help with
whichever<00:04:47.349> broke<00:04:47.650> and<00:04:47.860> good<00:04:48.070> advice<00:04:48.460> me<00:04:48.700> okay

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
whichever broke and good advice me okay

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.940 
whichever broke and good advice me okay
so<00:04:49.150> now<00:04:49.330> we're<00:04:49.690> going<00:04:50.020> on<00:04:50.229> over<00:04:50.440> here<00:04:50.470> over

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
so now we're going on over here over

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.680 
so now we're going on over here over
