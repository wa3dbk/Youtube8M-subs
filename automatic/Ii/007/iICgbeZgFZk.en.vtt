 alligator went to serve 

00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:04.000
 on the fleet in the Barents Sea passed exercises with 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.460
 helicopter 52 over two 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.660
 weeks fighting vehicle practiced landing 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.700
 to the deck of the ship if the current teachings 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.040
 alligators will be recognized as successful 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.519
 will be the main striking force 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.299
 Mistral helicopter carriers 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.710
 in three years will go on

 report of Dmitry Vysotsky 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.529
 this event is sure to go into 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.529
 naval aviation history 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.449
 you see unique shots for the first time 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.099
 helicopter ka 52 is landing on 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.160
 large antisubmarine deck 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.540
 ship 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.090
 helicopter landing pad only 12 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.240
 meters 2 less than the length of the 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.220
 the helicopter however pilot 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.670
 rolling conditions strong side 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.580
 wind succeeds on the first try 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.740
 put the car on deck 152 its still 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.640
 called alligator for external similarity with 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.300
 reptile 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.739
 created by the design office 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.460
 behalf of Kamov for the needs of army aviation and 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.230
 first his samples have already arrived on 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.990
 land forces 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.020
 even foreign experts recognize 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.210
 today it is the best helicopter mi 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.630
 years created a system for the arrangement of screws 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.370
 allows him to perform combat 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.399
 tasks in almost any conditions 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.590
 but landing on the deck is one of the most difficult 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.260
 piloting elements 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.750
 and even a thirty year old pilot 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.300
 experience 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.150
 Vitaly Lebedev before the first flight 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.160
 Navigator do not hide excitement 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.230
 he is not afraid 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.800
 Direction of the wind 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.080
 in principle until certain 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.860
 value 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.390
 m all the same 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.390
 tail wind side meeting 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.340
 self-controllability this 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.410
 helicopter 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.390
 simpler than tails helicopters 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.290
 screw 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.150
 before flying to the helicopter installed 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.080
 dozens of sensor developers 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.909
 interested in the load on the chassis 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.780
 boarding the ship is usually tougher 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.630
 devices fixed 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.319
 elevated brothers lobes but even in 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.979
 strong storm helicopter 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.679
 sit down and take off from the deck without problems from 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.479
 the results of these tests in many ways 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.090
 depends the fate of another one more 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.369
 significant project 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.630
 ship version ka 52 will be the main 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.939
 helicopter guns 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.899
 mistral which 2014 must do 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.399
 on arms of the Russian military 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.140
 navy specifically for this 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.769
 ship type ministry of defense 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.730
 intends to order three dozen super 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.899
 modern rotorcraft 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.989
 sea-based helicopters will equip 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.399
 additional navigation 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:18.279
 equipment 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:19.469
 for pilots install system 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.189
 conditioning rescuers 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.209
 overalls and the machine itself will change 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.979
 Army khaki on blue on the ship 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.439
 always appreciated that dimensions yes 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.040
 this is the most important volume accommodation in 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.370
 hangar and so on the helicopter will 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:36.639
 it is provided we put on Syria 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.719
 folding wings that knowledge 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:41.039
 significantly reduce the size and 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.899
 increase the number of flying 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:45.419
 flight deck hangar 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.129
 in the basic version ka 52 is capable of 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.689
 accidents shoot blades and both seats 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.430
 pilots are equipped with a catapult 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.550
 Moscow modification supplement system 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.530
 security that will help the pilots 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.950
 Alien developers are driving for now 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.879
 keeps secret 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.779
 but the term of the first experienced 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:04.470
 sample ship ka 52 is already known 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.760
 2012 in five years the designer promises 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.640
 KAM Alligators will take the place not 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.800
 only on mistral but also on other ships 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.689
 navy 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.139
