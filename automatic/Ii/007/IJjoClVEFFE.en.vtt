4.5 tutorial and today we're going to

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.959 
4.5 tutorial and today we're going to
talk<00:00:08.849> about<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.179> live<00:00:09.389> pencil<00:00:10.080> tilt<00:00:10.910> now<00:00:11.910> you

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
talk about the live pencil tilt now you

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.150 
talk about the live pencil tilt now you
can<00:00:12.269> tilt<00:00:12.599> your<00:00:12.750> stylus<00:00:13.440> when<00:00:13.830> using<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
can tilt your stylus when using the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.820 
can tilt your stylus when using the
pencil<00:00:14.400> tool<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.929> will<00:00:16.170> show<00:00:16.199> up<00:00:16.680> in

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
pencil tool and that will show up in

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.910 
pencil tool and that will show up in
your<00:00:17.070> line<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:18.180> canvas<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.800> should

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
your line on the canvas and it should

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.140 
your line on the canvas and it should
help<00:00:20.010> make<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> little<00:00:20.400> bit<00:00:20.580> more<00:00:20.760> realistic<00:00:21.410> so

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
help make a little bit more realistic so

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.599 
help make a little bit more realistic so
resetting<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.449> pencil<00:00:24.810> tool<00:00:24.960> here<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.609> also

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
resetting the pencil tool here and also

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.960 
resetting the pencil tool here and also
tilt<00:00:27.240> angle<00:00:27.539> must<00:00:27.660> be<00:00:27.779> visible<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.970> precise

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
tilt angle must be visible and precise

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.749 
tilt angle must be visible and precise
must<00:00:30.300> be<00:00:30.420> turned<00:00:30.720> off<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:32.399> still<00:00:32.610> have

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
must be turned off so you still have

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.030 
must be turned off so you still have
your<00:00:32.880> pressure<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.770> softness<00:00:34.770> tool

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
your pressure and softness tool

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.660 
your pressure and softness tool
available

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
available

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.260 
available
so<00:00:36.059> another<00:00:36.329> thinner<00:00:36.660> line<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:38.030> straight<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
so another thinner line is straight and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.819 
so another thinner line is straight and
the<00:00:40.140> thicker<00:00:40.379> line<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:41.010> when<00:00:41.309> I'm<00:00:41.430> tilting

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.930 

okay<00:00:46.829> let<00:00:47.039> me<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.250> draw<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> straight<00:00:47.520> line

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
okay let me just draw a straight line

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.510 
okay let me just draw a straight line
here<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.559> still<00:00:49.829> get<00:00:50.010> even

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
here so you can see you still get even

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.660 
here so you can see you still get even
amount<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.910> pressure<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.559> that<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.489> one

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
amount of pressure and that and that one

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.020 
amount of pressure and that and that one
I<00:00:53.699> was<00:00:53.910> trying<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.469> I'm<00:00:55.469> trying<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> like

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
I was trying to I'm trying to do it like

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.420 
I was trying to I'm trying to do it like
I'm<00:00:57.660> shading<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:59.309> my<00:00:59.460> pencil<00:00:59.969> almost

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
I'm shading with my pencil almost

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.840 
I'm shading with my pencil almost
parallel<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.780> full<00:01:04.110> tilt<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.730 

basically<00:01:08.850> I'm<00:01:09.119> gonna<00:01:09.390> choose<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> hard<00:01:10.380> shader

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
basically I'm gonna choose a hard shader

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.289 
basically I'm gonna choose a hard shader
see<00:01:11.640> how<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.939> works<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.930> 100%

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
see how that works so is that 100%

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.630 
see how that works so is that 100%
so<00:01:15.299> I'm<00:01:15.659> tilting<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.530> tilting<00:01:17.189> tilting<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
so I'm tilting here tilting tilting the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120 
so I'm tilting here tilting tilting the
whole<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:19.650> I'm<00:01:19.710> gonna<00:01:19.830> bring<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
whole way so now I'm gonna bring that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.109 
whole way so now I'm gonna bring that
down<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.890> then<00:01:22.890> didn't<00:01:23.369> lies<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:23.850> when<00:01:24.030> I'm

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
down and then didn't lies or when I'm

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:32.050 
down and then didn't lies or when I'm
not<00:01:25.070> Nikolai's<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.400> am<00:01:26.640> tilted<00:01:30.950> then

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
not Nikolai's it when I am tilted then

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.289 
not Nikolai's it when I am tilted then
thick<00:01:34.009> then<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:36.119> thick<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
thick then and thick so you can see it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.450 
thick then and thick so you can see it
is<00:01:39.450> improved<00:01:40.049> over<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.560> previous<00:01:40.770> versions

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
is improved over the previous versions

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.590 
is improved over the previous versions
of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> pencil<00:01:42.360> tool<00:01:43.939> now<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.329> saying

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
of the pencil tool now as I was saying

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.859 
of the pencil tool now as I was saying
when<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.229> saw<00:01:46.409> me<00:01:46.700> scraping<00:01:47.700> across<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
when you saw me scraping across with the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:49.460 
when you saw me scraping across with the
cursor

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
cursor

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.440 
cursor
nothing<00:01:50.220> was<00:01:50.340> showing<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.030> was<00:01:51.149> trying

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
nothing was showing because I was trying

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.560 
nothing was showing because I was trying
to<00:01:52.159> shade<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.399> had<00:01:53.579> decided<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.210> pencil

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
to shade like I had decided the pencil

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.959 
to shade like I had decided the pencil
but<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.810> doesn't<00:01:55.079> work<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> stylus<00:01:55.969> so

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
but that doesn't work with the stylus so

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.109 
but that doesn't work with the stylus so
