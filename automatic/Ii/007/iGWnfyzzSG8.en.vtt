00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 I think hello to many people I think 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.109
 interesting and what will you find out 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.809
 and hotels new xbox and I think I know 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.730
 the answer is now playstation 4 console and 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.370
 xbox one are small 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.039
 computers and in principle the number of pixels in 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.080
 depends only on the power of the console itself 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.420
 and of course in our loved ones 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.850
 consoles can not change the iron and 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.830
 we'll watch they become obsolete grandfather and for five 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.230
 years and then comes a new generation 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.269
 consoles with more powerful stuffing and so 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.239
 further such principle is applied already 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.130
 last 10-15 years but personally 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.800
 it seems in the near future the situation 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.930
 sony will change a lot now 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.340
 very very actively developing his 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.030
 playstation now 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.129
 and I think this is a brilliant decision 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.710
 principle so you can run the same 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.809
 these zones or there were a hundred phases and in principle 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.239
 absolutely all that is the playstation 4 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.850
 on your own tv 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.770
 you need to buy the console itself all you need 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.809
 you need this internet and actually 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.270
 telly itself from samsung wheel 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.189
 let's not take kill zone 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.650
 run on sony servers somewhere 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.479
 very far from you and will be on the internet 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.610
 eager for you in the living room on the big 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.740
 telly you will only gamepad and you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.630
 You can just like on ps4 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.180
 run it with this as i already and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.490
 said the console itself you don't have the whole one 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.290
 gameplay you will only strive but 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.780
 its bluetooth you connect your one 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.280
 Fees can safely enjoy 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.240
 all the hits that are on the same console 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.240
 by sony 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.670
 i.e. it is faster and ps4 and most 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.560
 the main playstation all is already available but 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.250
 there it is now available in the usa and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.079
 Canada 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.390
 and of course people who live there already 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.310
 now I can test it 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.070
 surprised subscription price pretty 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.020
 reports 20 bucks a month and 50 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.780
 bucks for three months that is let's 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.600
 will explain again you pay 20 bucks for 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.909
 month and on your ki ki from sony or 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.579
 samsung body kit console you do not need 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.740
 you can run the same was that face 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.329
 and as I say absolutely everything that 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.100
 have on playstation 4 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.350
 but of course there is one important 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.850
 disadvantage to us of this technology 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.590
 will get in three years at best 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.440
 because to enjoy playstation all 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.390
 need to have a server everywhere else in 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.000
 the game will be a big ping and permanent 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.980
 Lags but in the USA and Canada a server from sony 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.720
 stand almost everywhere in principle people who 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.910
 live there they do not experience any 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.980
 strong lags and big ping there 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.050
 principle, too, is not present therefore to use 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.390
 this technology can now 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.670
 but of course not with us, I want 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.470
 lead to the fact that in the future it is unlikely 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.390
 home we will melt familiar to us 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.459
 consoles most likely people will 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.470
 use just like streaming 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.930
 but again for all this you need 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.850
 stable internet but unfortunately if 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.390
 look at the statistics then in ours 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.269
 regions 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.030
 not everyone has even 20 megabits so 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.620
 wait there still very very long and for 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.110
 this is not a similar decision 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.390
 the perfect console will no longer be 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.030
 it is not necessary at all to hold you about anything 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.250
 soared turned on the telly took the gamepad 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.980
 launched the same fifu and calmly chase 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.890
 no drives no extra consoles 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.600
 I believe that the future is precisely for this on 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.819
 that's all and of course don't forget 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.900
 like this video all good luck 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.900
 and bye
