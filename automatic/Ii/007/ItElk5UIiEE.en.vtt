00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
what's really nice about this canon 60d

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.929 
what's really nice about this canon 60d
is<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:15.180> had<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.479> level<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.430> line<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
is it had to level so when that line is

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.510 
is it had to level so when that line is
green<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.509> means<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.990> camera<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.680> level

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
green that means the camera is level

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.990 
green that means the camera is level
with<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.270> subject<00:01:21.810> matter<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
with the subject matter and to the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.350 
with the subject matter and to the
ground<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:26.340> helps<00:01:26.610> me<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.909> level<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
ground and so it helps me to level the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.910 
ground and so it helps me to level the
camera<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.259> pictures<00:01:28.619> are<00:01:28.740> all
