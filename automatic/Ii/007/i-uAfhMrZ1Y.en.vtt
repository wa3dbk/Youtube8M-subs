when you have a game that succeeds like

probably a aren't good at it or be you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.920 
probably a aren't good at it or be you
never

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
never

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.570 
never
waited<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.800> that's<00:01:55.980> the<00:01:56.190> only<00:01:56.220> two

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
waited and I think that's the only two

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.070 
waited and I think that's the only two
weeks<00:01:56.820> there<00:01:57.060> are<00:01:57.240> explanations<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.870> here's

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
weeks there are explanations and here's

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.080 
weeks there are explanations and here's
just<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.830> this<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.280> goes<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.670> show<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.910> how

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
just so this just goes to show you how

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.080 
just so this just goes to show you how
bad<00:02:00.390> these<00:02:00.600> kids<00:02:00.870> are<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.670> know<00:02:02.760> I<00:02:02.820> think<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
bad these kids are you know I think the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.760 
bad these kids are you know I think the
biggest<00:02:03.330> thing<00:02:03.690> that<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.410> is<00:02:04.620> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
biggest thing that really is the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.380 
biggest thing that really is the
difference<00:02:04.860> between<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.400> games<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:05.910> I<00:02:06.180> mean

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
difference between the games and I mean

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.359 
difference between the games and I mean
this<00:02:06.480> could<00:02:06.750> be<00:02:06.900> arguable<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.009> think<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
this could be arguable but I think the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.290 
this could be arguable but I think the
sniping<00:02:09.020> is<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.290> biggest<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.830> know

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
sniping is the biggest you know

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.340 
sniping is the biggest you know
contraction<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> guess<00:02:12.840> there's<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.080> way<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
contraction I guess there's a way and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.300 
contraction I guess there's a way and
look<00:02:13.470> at<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.710> guy<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:13.920> mean<00:02:14.100> right<00:02:14.250> there

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
look at this guy I mean right there

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.800 
look at this guy I mean right there
she'll<00:02:14.610> up<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.820> ego<00:02:15.030> at<00:02:15.150> home<00:02:15.300> don't<00:02:15.540> burn<00:02:15.750> up

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
she'll up the ego at home don't burn up

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.990 
she'll up the ego at home don't burn up
the<00:02:15.900> ladder<00:02:16.080> I'm<00:02:16.800> dead

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
the ladder I'm dead

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.250 
the ladder I'm dead
but<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.450> sniping<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:18.990> biggest

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
but the sniping is the biggest

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.930 
but the sniping is the biggest
difference<00:02:19.530> between<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.860> two<00:02:19.980> games<00:02:20.190> by<00:02:20.490> far

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
difference between the two games by far

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.730 
difference between the two games by far
I<00:02:20.970> think<00:02:21.240> everything<00:02:21.750> else<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.200> kind<00:02:22.560> of

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
I think everything else is kind of

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.500 
I think everything else is kind of
similar<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.310> mean<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.640> game<00:02:23.790> really<00:02:24.240> doesn't

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
similar I mean the game really doesn't

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.710 
similar I mean the game really doesn't
play<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:24.870> itself<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:26.670> know<00:02:26.790> when<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.510> have

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
play like itself you know when you have

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.020 
play like itself you know when you have
something<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.110> succeeds<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.520> want<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.910> go

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
something that succeeds you want to go

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.300 
something that succeeds you want to go
ahead<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.510> use<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:31.890> know<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.010> know<00:02:32.100> where

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
ahead and use that you know I know where

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.130 
ahead and use that you know I know where
at<00:02:32.370> my<00:02:32.490> school<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.970> can't<00:02:33.209> take<00:02:33.450> us<00:02:33.780> history

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
at my school you can't take us history

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.420 
at my school you can't take us history
until<00:02:34.290> sophomore<00:02:34.920> year

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
until sophomore year

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.100 
until sophomore year
now<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.700> also<00:02:36.000> took<00:02:36.150> us<00:02:36.480> history<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:36.959> eighth

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
now I also took us history in eighth

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.020 
now I also took us history in eighth
grade<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.920> there's<00:02:38.400> also<00:02:38.580> an<00:02:38.730> eighth<00:02:38.880> year

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
grade so there's also an eighth year

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.100 
grade so there's also an eighth year
that's<00:02:39.240> at<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.390> different<00:02:39.660> school<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:39.990> and

that's at the different school this and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.630 
that's at the different school this and
that<00:02:40.230> it's<00:02:40.380> kind<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.800> habit<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.400> relates

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
that it's kind of habit but it relates

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.080 
that it's kind of habit but it relates
to<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.450> know<00:02:42.600> say<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.840> get<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.410> 94%<00:02:44.090> US

like<00:03:47.519> I<00:03:47.580> said<00:03:47.670> this<00:03:47.850> game<00:03:48.030> doesn't<00:03:48.360> play

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
like I said this game doesn't play

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.840 
like I said this game doesn't play
exactly<00:03:49.170> like<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.500> should<00:03:49.530> exactly<00:03:50.459> like<00:03:50.700> I

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
exactly like it should exactly like I

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.660 
exactly like it should exactly like I
feel<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.239> should<00:03:51.950> because<00:03:52.950> there's<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.580> know

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
feel it should because there's you know

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.210 
feel it should because there's you know
different<00:03:54.120> perks<00:03:54.420> different<00:03:55.080> gone<00:03:55.650> styles<00:03:56.100> I

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
different perks different gone styles I

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.060 
different perks different gone styles I
think<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.489> black<00:03:56.580> ops<00:03:56.880> 2<00:03:56.970> you<00:03:57.209> die<00:03:57.420> really<00:03:57.720> fast

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
think in black ops 2 you die really fast

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.199 
think in black ops 2 you die really fast
you<00:03:59.070> know<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.220> submachine<00:03:59.610> guns<00:03:59.820> obviously

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
you know the submachine guns obviously

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.680 
you know the submachine guns obviously
black<00:04:00.360> ops<00:04:00.600> 2<00:04:00.810> just<00:04:01.019> just<00:04:01.500> dominate<00:04:02.070> or<00:04:02.280> means

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
black ops 2 just just dominate or means

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.170 
black ops 2 just just dominate or means
no<00:04:03.020> not<00:04:03.320> not<00:04:03.770> so<00:04:04.130> much<00:04:04.400> here<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:04.910> there<00:04:05.030> they

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
no not not so much here and there they

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.330 
no not not so much here and there they
do<00:04:05.240> a<00:04:05.360> little<00:04:05.630> bit<00:04:05.930> but<00:04:06.830> for<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.040> most<00:04:07.190> part

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
do a little bit but for the most part

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.100 
do a little bit but for the most part
this<00:04:07.580> is<00:04:07.640> a<00:04:07.760> balanced<00:04:08.180> game<00:04:08.420> I<00:04:08.480> mean<00:04:08.780> this<00:04:08.870> is<00:04:09.020> a

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
feel that this game it just plays way

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.050

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.180 
that that's about it but you know I
think<00:04:30.020> black<00:04:30.290> ops<00:04:30.500> 2<00:04:30.710> should<00:04:30.980> have<00:04:31.070> been<00:04:31.160> a

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
think black ops 2 should have been a

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.490 
think black ops 2 should have been a
direct<00:04:31.550> reflection<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:32.210> black<00:04:32.390> ops<00:04:32.630> 1<00:04:32.900> now

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
direct reflection the black ops 1 now

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.080 
direct reflection the black ops 1 now
there's<00:04:33.920> so<00:04:34.160> many<00:04:34.280> people<00:04:34.610> that<00:04:34.730> agree<00:04:34.850> with

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
there's so many people that agree with

this game this was a good game I'm and I

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.690 
this game this was a good game I'm and I
should<00:04:42.770> have<00:04:42.860> built<00:04:43.010> off<00:04:43.190> it<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:43.460> know<00:04:43.580> if

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
should have built off it you know if

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.400 
should have built off it you know if
they<00:04:43.820> did<00:04:44.240> really<00:04:44.390> good<00:04:44.570> in<00:04:44.720> history<00:04:45.110> why

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
they did really good in history why

they did really good in history why
don't<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:45.650> just<00:04:45.770> go<00:04:45.920> take<00:04:46.130> his<00:04:46.280> cell<00:04:46.520> in<00:04:46.670> the

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
don't you just go take his cell in the

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.400 
don't you just go take his cell in the
AP<00:04:47.060> history<00:04:47.450> you<00:04:47.540> know<00:04:47.630> as<00:04:47.750> simple<00:04:47.930> as<00:04:48.140> that

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
AP history you know as simple as that

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.530 
AP history you know as simple as that
and<00:04:48.590> they<00:04:49.160> didn't<00:04:49.550> instead<00:04:50.180> of<00:04:50.270> taking<00:04:50.510> that

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
and they didn't instead of taking that

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.440 
and they didn't instead of taking that
AP<00:04:51.080> or<00:04:51.550> accelerated<00:04:52.550> history<00:04:52.940> they<00:04:53.090> they<00:04:53.300> took

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
AP or accelerated history they they took

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.350 
AP or accelerated history they they took
the<00:04:53.630> same<00:04:53.840> class<00:04:54.910> you<00:04:55.910> know<00:04:56.000> it's<00:04:56.150> kind<00:04:56.330> of

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
the same class you know it's kind of

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
like it's kind of like the same class

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.440 
like it's kind of like the same class
with<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.070> worst<00:04:58.250> teacher<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:58.880> that's<00:04:59.150> the

with the worst teacher and that's the
way<00:04:59.540> black<00:04:59.780> ops<00:05:00.020> 2<00:05:00.140> feels<00:05:00.380> it's<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.680> same<00:05:01.270> kind

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
way black ops 2 feels it's the same kind

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.420 
way black ops 2 feels it's the same kind
of<00:05:02.420> the<00:05:02.570> same<00:05:02.780> outset<00:05:03.380> they<00:05:03.620> like<00:05:03.800> the<00:05:03.950> layout

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
of the same outset they like the layout

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.000 
of the same outset they like the layout
if<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:05.420> get<00:05:05.570> rid<00:05:05.720> of<00:05:05.780> submachine<00:05:06.260> guns<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:06.770> if

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
if you get rid of submachine guns you if

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.560 
if you get rid of submachine guns you if
you<00:05:07.130> look<00:05:07.280> past<00:05:07.490> that<00:05:07.580> in<00:05:07.730> the<00:05:07.790> sniping<00:05:08.180> it's<00:05:08.480> a

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
you look past that in the sniping it's a

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.470 
you look past that in the sniping it's a
very<00:05:08.810> similar<00:05:09.169> you<00:05:09.770> know<00:05:09.800> reflection<00:05:10.490> but<00:05:11.180> you

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
very similar you know reflection but you

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.970 
very similar you know reflection but you
know<00:05:11.540> they<00:05:11.660> took<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.900> same<00:05:12.080> class<00:05:12.290> over<00:05:12.710> again

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
know they took the same class over again

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.790 
know they took the same class over again
copied<00:05:13.460> that<00:05:13.640> game<00:05:13.910> kind<00:05:14.720> of<00:05:14.900> and<00:05:15.200> then<00:05:15.770> you

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
copied that game kind of and then you

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.830 
copied that game kind of and then you
get<00:05:16.040> that<00:05:16.220> bad<00:05:16.430> teacher<00:05:16.760> that's<00:05:17.150> you<00:05:17.540> know<00:05:17.630> the

get that bad teacher that's you know the

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.470 
get that bad teacher that's you know the
sniping<00:05:18.350> and<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:19.220> submachine<00:05:19.880> guns<00:05:20.060> now<00:05:20.240> I

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
sniping and the submachine guns now I

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.670 
sniping and the submachine guns now I
don't<00:05:20.900> think<00:05:21.050> this<00:05:21.110> are<00:05:21.290> machine<00:05:21.500> then<00:05:21.650> the

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
don't think this are machine then the

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.380 
don't think this are machine then the
black<00:05:21.919> ops<00:05:22.100> 2<00:05:22.190> are<00:05:22.370> all<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.640> powers<00:05:23.120> but

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
black ops 2 are all the powers but

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.240 
black ops 2 are all the powers but
rather<00:05:23.570> overuse<00:05:24.260> they<00:05:24.680> do<00:05:24.740> get<00:05:25.010> annoying

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250
