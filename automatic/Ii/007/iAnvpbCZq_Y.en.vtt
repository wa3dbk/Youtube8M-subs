three<00:01:47.520> different<00:01:47.840> levels<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.990> carb<00:01:49.350> cycles<00:01:49.770> to

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
three different levels of carb cycles to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.170 
three different levels of carb cycles to
choose<00:01:50.100> from<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.430> beginner<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.060> your

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
everything from A to Z to carb cycle

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.090 
everything from A to Z to carb cycle
alright

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
alright

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.609 
alright
so<00:02:02.479> cycle<00:02:03.479> your<00:02:03.600> carbs<00:02:03.899> even<00:02:04.140> even<00:02:04.409> right<00:02:04.590> now

insert a cheat meal once a week and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.639 
insert a cheat meal once a week and
you're<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.729> experience<00:02:09.349> again<00:02:10.349> some

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
you're going to experience again some

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.380 
you're going to experience again some
major<00:02:10.979> major<00:02:11.400> fat<00:02:11.730> loss

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
major major fat loss

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.470 
major major fat loss
all<00:02:12.810> right<00:02:12.960> so<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.650> second<00:02:14.040> thing<00:02:14.300> here<00:02:15.300> is

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
all right so the second thing here is

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.550 
all right so the second thing here is
increase<00:02:17.420> increase<00:02:18.420> protein<00:02:19.910> all<00:02:20.910> right<00:02:21.560> why

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
increase increase protein all right why

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.320 
increase increase protein all right why
would<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.340> want<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.550> increase<00:02:23.819> protein<00:02:24.150> well

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
would you want to increase protein well

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.410 
would you want to increase protein well
the<00:02:24.420> first<00:02:24.600> thing<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.170> protein<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.069> very

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
the first thing is is protein is very

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.820 
the first thing is is protein is very
satiating<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> most<00:02:27.840> satiating

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
satiating it's the most satiating

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.330 
satiating it's the most satiating
macronutrient<00:02:29.790> there<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:31.040> oftentimes<00:02:32.040> if

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
macronutrient there is so oftentimes if

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.010 
macronutrient there is so oftentimes if
you<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:33.030> you've<00:02:33.150> ever<00:02:33.300> tried<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.870> know

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
you if you've ever tried this you know

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.150 
you if you've ever tried this you know
if<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.260> sit<00:02:34.470> down<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.650> you've<00:02:34.920> got<00:02:35.040> your

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
if you sit down and you've got your

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.220 
if you sit down and you've got your
protein<00:02:35.340> your<00:02:35.610> fats<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.030> your<00:02:36.570> carbohydrates

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
protein your fats and your carbohydrates

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.380 
protein your fats and your carbohydrates
and<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.470> eat<00:02:38.190> your<00:02:38.370> protein<00:02:38.520> first<00:02:39.060> really

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
and you eat your protein first really

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.910 
and you eat your protein first really
slowly<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.840> eat<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.200> piece<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.590> steak<00:02:40.770> or

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
slowly you eat that piece of steak or

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.559 
slowly you eat that piece of steak or
that<00:02:41.040> piece<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.340> chicken<00:02:41.520> or<00:02:41.760> something<00:02:41.970> some

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
that piece of chicken or something some

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.860 
that piece of chicken or something some
that<00:02:43.140> slowly<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:44.790> are<00:02:44.820> going<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.180> feel<00:02:45.390> so

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
that slowly you are going to feel so

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.229 
that slowly you are going to feel so
much<00:02:46.350> more<00:02:46.709> full<00:02:47.040> by<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.310> time<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.790> get<00:02:47.940> to

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
much more full by the time you get to

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.540 
much more full by the time you get to
your<00:02:48.390> fats<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.350> carbohydrates<00:02:50.040> you're<00:02:50.430> going

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
your fats and carbohydrates you're going

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.440 
your fats and carbohydrates you're going
to<00:02:50.610> be<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:50.760> oh<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:50.910> you're<00:02:51.120> going<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.269> eat

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
to be like oh and you're going to eat

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
to be like oh and you're going to eat
less<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:52.110> them

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
less of them

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.630 
less of them
all<00:02:52.620> right<00:02:52.769> that's<00:02:53.010> rule<00:02:53.220> number<00:02:53.280> one<00:02:53.489> the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
all right that's rule number one the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.780 
all right that's rule number one the
second<00:02:54.090> thing<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.330> it's<00:02:54.900> it's<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.590> most<00:02:55.830> it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
second thing is it's it's the most it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.180 
second thing is it's it's the most it
has<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:57.239> has<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.390> thermic<00:02:57.810> effect<00:02:58.190> so

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
has it has a thermic effect so

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.280 
has it has a thermic effect so
essentially<00:03:00.090> what<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.209> means<00:03:00.480> is<00:03:00.630> your<00:03:00.959> body

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
essentially what that means is your body

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.430 
essentially what that means is your body
uses<00:03:02.100> expends<00:03:02.610> more<00:03:02.670> calories<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.810> break<00:03:04.110> down

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
uses expends more calories to break down

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.220 
uses expends more calories to break down
protein<00:03:05.130> than<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.459> does<00:03:05.640> any<00:03:05.970> other

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
protein than it does any other

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.960 
protein than it does any other
macronutrient<00:03:07.230> okay<00:03:07.680> that's<00:03:08.070> number<00:03:08.220> two<00:03:08.489> the

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
macronutrient okay that's number two the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.360 
macronutrient okay that's number two the
the<00:03:09.209> third<00:03:09.600> thing<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.140> often<00:03:10.890> times<00:03:11.070> when

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
the third thing is it often times when

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.670 
the third thing is it often times when
you<00:03:11.459> increase<00:03:11.760> your<00:03:12.000> protein<00:03:12.290> all<00:03:13.290> right<00:03:13.470> it

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
you increase your protein all right it

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.509 
you increase your protein all right it
you<00:03:14.370> displace<00:03:15.269> another<00:03:16.340> macronutrient<00:03:17.340> and

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
you displace another macronutrient and

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.390 
you displace another macronutrient and
usually<00:03:18.150> that's<00:03:18.329> carbs<00:03:18.840> all<00:03:19.530> right<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:19.860> all<00:03:20.040> of

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
usually that's carbs all right so all of

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.770 
usually that's carbs all right so all of
these<00:03:20.519> things<00:03:20.820> happen<00:03:21.269> when<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.510> increase

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
these things happen when you increase

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.009 
these things happen when you increase
your<00:03:21.989> protein<00:03:22.230> all<00:03:23.299> which<00:03:24.299> are<00:03:24.420> all<00:03:24.630> going<00:03:24.930> to

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
your protein all which are all going to

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.340 
your protein all which are all going to
promote<00:03:25.350> fat<00:03:26.160> loss<00:03:26.370> all<00:03:27.360> right<00:03:27.540> very<00:03:28.049> very

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
promote fat loss all right very very

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.120 
promote fat loss all right very very
important<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.709> then<00:03:28.799> you've<00:03:28.920> got<00:03:29.010> the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
important and then you've got the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.729 
important and then you've got the
benefits<00:03:29.549> of<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.110> repairing<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
benefits of the of the repairing of the

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.410 
benefits of the of the repairing of the
cell<00:03:31.920> tissue<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.430> muscles<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.239> and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
cell tissue and the muscles and the and
