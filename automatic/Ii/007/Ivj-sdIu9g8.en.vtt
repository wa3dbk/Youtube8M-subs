00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
pulling wats apart yeah when I first

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.170 
pulling wats apart yeah when I first

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
pull them apart because it would really

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.560 
pull them apart because it would really
shrink<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.340> small<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:49.490> if<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:50.880> kind<00:01:51.509> of

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
shrink really small and if we kind of

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.359 
shrink really small and if we kind of
hard<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> differentiate<00:01:52.369> differentiate

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
hard to differentiate differentiate

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.499 
hard to differentiate differentiate
between<00:01:53.579> relax<00:01:54.149> using<00:01:54.630> um<00:01:56.030> let's<00:01:57.030> finish<00:01:57.240> that

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
