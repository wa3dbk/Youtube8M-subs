00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.520
 Hello friends 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.779
 I wanted to show you this active frequency divider 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.730
 built whom 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.019
 at home 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.329
 this active filter also known as incoex ridley filter 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.759
 or fat tip 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.619
 the village 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.070
 the researchers 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.550
 what 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.810
 to get the mathematics to return the operation of this circuit 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.370
 at the beginning of 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.690
 the last century 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.730
 It is powered with the split source of plus minus 12 volts 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.070
 with integrated regulators 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.250
 here the transformer a small transformer these circuits not 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.860
 they consume a lot 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.860
 and consumption will be in the order of the few customers 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.280
 then you do not need to put a 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.700
 a fountain 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.700
 too robust 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.780
 in the entrances we have percent and integrated tlc the 71 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.990
 Tokyo on the right 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.520
 and after filtering we also have 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.290
 he said that in that sense some for each channel to reinforce it 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 Miss has a job 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.460
 We have the tickets when chips reside 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.460
 here we are going to connect the audio console 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.070
 here 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.110
 we are going to 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.860
 with card 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.740
 the entrance of the amplifier that is going to occupy of kandji faces frequency this 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.250
 filter state 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.530
 cut in 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.530
 if the twenty-first century in sherry 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.600
 although it can be modified 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.740
 the capacitors and the resistances for 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.740
 make it work across the audio range 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.339
 between 20 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.339
 and 20 kilos sherry 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.719
 two level controls with two small colt always 50 kilos 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.849
 the indication 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.849
 of signal presence here 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.059
 with green oaks 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.209
 the left channel 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.589
 with webber triggered by the right channel 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:49.569
 i the level controls of the potentiometers that showed him enclosure 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.529
 the task of meaning 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.960
 here 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.960
 a pilot with another read 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:05.330
 always impossible 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.729
 for any adverse circumstance 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.999
 what happens in the circuit 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.089
 as a rule 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:14.700
 general I always put 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.849
 a fuse 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.439
 I think it is the most recommended 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.139
 this transformer 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.579
 although eta since I entered I put it for a matter of comfort 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.869
 but 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:27.029
 in when 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:31.049
 one is going to build this kind of circuits it's not convenient that inside 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.259
 this transformer 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:37.589
 because it also brings the 60 cycle that come from the line of 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:39.009
 limitation 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:40.959
 which it's 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.339
 can still have influence 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.579
 in it filter circuit 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.809
 here taking some precautions current the magnetic field of 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.399
 transformer that in sense 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.479
 by blind placed in another direction 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:59.309
 and away from the hoop filter unit that this platelet kinase 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:01.589
 so that there is none 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:04.039
 influence 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.039
 that affects us filter operation 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:12.259
 these filters have 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:14.789
 an attenuation 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.509
 belly 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:19.549
 30 and 40 decibels in some cases 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.549
 There may be others too of fat labor do of the circuit 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.550
 and that's what makes it far superior 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.090
 with respect to other types of filters we have here 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:32.099
 a filter 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.309
 passive 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:38.619
 this is a mid-frequency circuit and the cut is at 1800 and clos 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.159
 china ninth shock 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.439
 a capacitor 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:46.460
 and good 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.460
 in this case a resistance pair to attenuate a little nothing 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.230
 the power of April to Mariano 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.789
 burn the drive units 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.979
 I do the media speakers 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.360
 o'grady see how they are known 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.360
 popularly 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.409
 he is also editor 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.620
 which can be appreciated st 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.150
 constructed 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.629
 totally here at home 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.629
 and he used it for some neighborhoods 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.569
 but in general this type of filter is preferred for this filtering function 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.569
 dividers 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.889
 I hope this video is useful 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:33.599
 and thank you always 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.340
 for sharing it from that moment of a 9 years
