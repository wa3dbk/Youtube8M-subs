there's two indents for to come out of
on<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.239> sides<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.980> is<00:03:48.250> about<00:03:48.400> seated<00:03:48.760> properly

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
on the sides it is about seated properly

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.949 
on the sides it is about seated properly
like<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:54.150> okay<00:03:55.150> so<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:55.390> have<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.510> other<00:03:55.690> two

these<00:04:03.549> two<00:04:03.730> holes

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.430 

I<00:04:10.830> find<00:04:11.490> their<00:04:11.640> easiest<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.120> install<00:04:12.440> using

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
I find their easiest to install using

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.330 
I find their easiest to install using
firm<00:04:13.860> pressure<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:15.290> twisting<00:04:16.290> them<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:20.280> you

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
firm pressure and twisting them so you

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.660 
firm pressure and twisting them so you
can<00:04:20.460> see<00:04:20.610> when<00:04:20.910> they're<00:04:21.030> seated<00:04:21.240> properly

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
can see when they're seated properly

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.800 
can see when they're seated properly
maybe<00:04:23.670> all<00:04:23.790> the<00:04:23.880> way<00:04:23.970> through<00:04:24.240> they<00:04:24.510> can<00:04:24.630> spin

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
maybe all the way through they can spin

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.540 
maybe all the way through they can spin
freely<00:04:25.140> but<00:04:25.710> they're<00:04:25.860> definitely<00:04:26.010> not<00:04:26.250> coming

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
freely but they're definitely not coming

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.340 
freely but they're definitely not coming
out<00:04:26.790> all<00:04:27.660> right<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:27.780> now<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:27.990> need<00:04:28.230> to

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
out all right so now you need to

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.440 
out all right so now you need to
obviously<00:04:28.680> remove<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.160> rear<00:04:29.370> seat<00:04:32.450> just

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
obviously remove the rear seat just

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
going to put the key right on there in

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.770 
going to put the key right on there in
the<00:04:34.830> key<00:04:35.010> slot<00:04:35.660> turn<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.810> key<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:39.270> creates

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
the key slot turn the key and it creates

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.290 
the key slot turn the key and it creates
a<00:04:39.840> mechanism<00:04:40.320> right<00:04:40.470> here<00:04:40.790> it<00:04:41.790> releases<00:04:42.060> the

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300
