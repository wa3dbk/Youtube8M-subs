00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.139
 hello youtube people in this video I'm going 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:20.640
 to be teaching them how to download and 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.110
 play gta bay city yes sir the same 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.780
 GTA Vice City 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.410
 we play every day and we play in 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:34.930
 the childhood that we play always effective 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.930
 everyone knows it is a classic 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.710
 gonzÃ¡lez is a classic is on the cover 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.060
 everything according to the we played when it was more 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.520
 boy when the cybercafe 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.320
 everything we played we all liked and what 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.820
 I know I will relive those moments 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.510
 Epics are simply priceless 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.950
 good people let's get down to business 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.330
 the first thing they should do is go to 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.440
 the link that I will leave the 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.930
 description that will bring a 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.390
 mega server 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.480
 and so you can download the file that is 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.880
 they call 0 0 3 times does it mean 0 3 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.830
 white city I put a code name for 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.900
 that the Serbian number erase you are going 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.940
 to give to download the file is a 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.120
 slightly heavy 1,26 and bytes 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.920
 once they have it they have downloaded 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.610
 It depends on the folder where they have the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.940
 downloads 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.250
 download because as always already what 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.200
 I have in my case what I have in the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.990
 desktop the file is called 0 0 3 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.860
 sometimes it's a compressed file honoring what 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.860
 what are you going to do 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:50.350
 is to unzip it 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:53.040
 here anywhere to connect to the game 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.040
 this leads an undefeated 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.630
 good once and ends after us 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.600
 three hours do not lie once we are 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.570
 ends of unzipping we can discard 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.010
 this file on 0 0 3 times because it 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.260
 is going to create a folder that is called 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.300
 7 Sometimes that's the gta vice city 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.110
 Ladies and Gentlemen 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.110
 I'm going to enter the folder 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.180
 and once I entered the folder here I'm going to 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.489
 have all the files as you see 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.900
 the small size but I can have a 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.819
 Large size also young is being 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.400
 is near 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.930
 you win the setup this one that has the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.010
 state 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.010
 world corporation 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.360
 will ask you if you want to open programs 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.360
 we say yes 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.250
 including we can in Spanish so we 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.730
 if we wait for the process to end 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.340
 installation we can next accept 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.260
 the terms of windows conditions 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.310
 you put an education I do not know 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.630
 of whistle 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.190
 how I love you 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:15.500
 they will be urged into the folder that for a 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.180
 program files by 86 or program file 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.080
 as you have me for these 64 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.950
 thousand 086 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.950
 and 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.870
 to see we give next we can 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.870
 install and start installing 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.840
 gta vice city 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.350
 we wait for the installation to finish 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.690
 well once we are finished with 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.670
 install we lose to install wizard has 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.890
 completed the installation we give to 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.430
 Finalize 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:53.660
 and there in theory I would finish installing 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.780
 the game but nevertheless or they are in 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.480
 but nevertheless nevertheless we must 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.550
 put the crack in the folder 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.530
 installation for it let's go to disk 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.590
 local in my case I have it installed in 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.740
 program files by 86 the company 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.740
 is 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.760
 big 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.420
 a star game 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.209
 we enter the rockstar games and go to 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.810
 look like big country city and you have to 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.360
 appear all important files 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.800
 they see it very clearly if we had the game 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.690
 original we can see it yes but as 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.010
 I'm not pirates, we're all looking for 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.010
 easy things 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.930
 we have to be a little bit better in 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.850
 the gta folder despite the fact 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.260
 decompressed previously in addition to 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.780
 the installation files as setup 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.210
 a folder called crack you 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.680
 they enter that folder and it's going to 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.720
 personar file that is called gta that 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.480
 still despite that file they give copy and 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.919
 they stick it in the directory do not have 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.390
 installed in this case rockstargames 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:01.220
 big auto vice city they put us 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.890
 ask if we want to replace the 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.300
 file we can replace the 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.980
 destination file to me it seems like this 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.419
 because I have windows 8 to you 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.280
 it will only appear otherwise 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.540
 but in the end they have to replace 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.760
 the file they replace in the 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.800
 destination file 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.800
 if we want to continue we can continue 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:27.790
 and there we already had in 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:31.500
 definitively the installed game 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.500
 and ready to play 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.830
 to a thing like the video to tell them 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.259
 as tele as I was saying we already have the 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.270
 game ready to play but I do not know by 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.849
 what to me for what reason I do not believe the 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.800
 direct access but you do not have to 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.680
 worry if in that case I do not believe them 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.259
 the direct access as is to me as is 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.330
 happening to me same you surely 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:57.889

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.139
 If you do not have it, copy this 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.900
 gta file or the one we had 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.870
 replaced they remember the one that the 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.689
 bta gta bc replaced here we give 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.580
 this copy and we paste it in the 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:13.039
 desk and then change the 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.710
 name do what you reveal 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.980
 the balls decant 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.290
 they will have double click open and the game will 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.160
 will execute I'm not going to execute it because the 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.140
 asia field did not touch me I do not know why 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.690
