great<00:02:02.790> suggestions<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.049> minefields

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
great suggestions that the minefields

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.889 
great suggestions that the minefields
even<00:02:05.460> though<00:02:05.520> they're<00:02:05.670> fantastic<00:02:06.270> idea<00:02:06.630> their

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
even though they're fantastic idea their

even though they're fantastic idea their
other<00:02:07.140> cool<00:02:07.469> they're<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> little<00:02:08.429> impractical

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
other cool they're a little impractical

because my team and Jenny depending on
with<00:02:11.039> full<00:02:11.520> team<00:02:11.700> he's<00:02:11.879> on

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
with full team he's on

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.850 
with full team he's on
caught<00:02:13.330> up<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.310> mines<00:02:15.610> are<00:02:16.710> gonna<00:02:17.710> have

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
caught up in so the mines are gonna have

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.470 
caught up in so the mines are gonna have
a<00:02:17.890> purpose<00:02:18.340> but<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.700> don't<00:02:18.790> know<00:02:19.150> if<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.360> going

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
a purpose but I don't know if it's going

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.040 
a purpose but I don't know if it's going
to<00:02:19.540> be<00:02:19.930> just<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:21.190> flagrant<00:02:22.180> mine<00:02:22.390> fields<00:02:22.840> all

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
to be just like flagrant mine fields all

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.590 
to be just like flagrant mine fields all
over<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.350> place<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:25.120> one<00:02:25.240> thing<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.450> do<00:02:25.510> want

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
over the place the one thing I do want

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.490 
over the place the one thing I do want
to<00:02:25.780> test<00:02:26.050> though<00:02:27.870> which<00:02:28.870> would<00:02:28.990> be<00:02:29.080> very<00:02:29.200> cool

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
to test though which would be very cool

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.780 
to test though which would be very cool
to<00:02:29.650> know<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.520> if<00:02:31.390> registering<00:02:31.870> trigger<00:02:32.790> that

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
to know is if registering trigger that

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.300 
to know is if registering trigger that
is<00:02:33.970> far<00:02:34.420> too<00:02:34.450> many<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.810> let's<00:02:38.110> make<00:02:38.320> some

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
is far too many so let's make some

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.670 
is far too many so let's make some
torches<00:02:40.980> let's<00:02:41.980> make<00:02:42.220> some<00:02:42.850> ah<00:02:43.690> why'd<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.530> do

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
torches let's make some ah why'd I do

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.300 
torches let's make some ah why'd I do
that<00:02:44.830> I<00:02:45.010> just<00:02:45.100> needed<00:02:45.550> some<00:02:45.700> more<00:02:45.820> red<00:02:46.000> cent<00:02:46.270> oh

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
that I just needed some more red cent oh

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.050 
that I just needed some more red cent oh
okay<00:02:49.560> all<00:02:50.560> right<00:02:50.740> let's<00:02:51.460> go<00:02:51.610> check<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.790> out<00:02:51.940> and

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
okay all right let's go check it out and

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.730 
okay all right let's go check it out and
see<00:02:52.120> if<00:02:52.210> the<00:02:52.330> mines<00:02:52.540> get<00:02:52.750> triggered<00:02:53.230> from<00:02:53.590> a

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
see if the mines get triggered from a

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.610 
see if the mines get triggered from a
redstone<00:02:54.220> signal<00:02:54.990> they<00:02:55.990> get<00:02:56.140> triggered<00:02:56.470> when

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
redstone signal they get triggered when

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.120 
redstone signal they get triggered when
you<00:02:56.710> step<00:02:57.010> on<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:58.200> don't<00:02:59.200> think<00:02:59.290> its<00:02:59.740> proximity

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
you step on I don't think its proximity

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.800 
you step on I don't think its proximity
I<00:03:00.340> think<00:03:00.580> yeah<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.970> have<00:03:01.240> to<00:03:01.330> actually<00:03:01.420> hit

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
I think yeah you have to actually hit

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.690 
I think yeah you have to actually hit
the<00:03:01.990> block<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.460> mind<00:03:03.640> is<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.790> part<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:05.700> so

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
the block that the mind is a part of so

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.640 
the block that the mind is a part of so
let's<00:03:06.850> go<00:03:06.970> back<00:03:07.150> over<00:03:07.180> here<00:03:07.720> into<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.110> testing

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
let's go back over here into the testing

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.560 
let's go back over here into the testing
area<00:03:08.860> we<00:03:09.280> tested<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.910> couple<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.270> these<00:03:10.360> guys

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
area we tested a couple of these guys

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.970 
area we tested a couple of these guys
last<00:03:10.810> time<00:03:10.990> they<00:03:11.200> do<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.350> crapload<00:03:12.070> of<00:03:12.310> damage

be they must be stepped on but they can
also<00:04:45.240> not<00:04:45.750> be<00:04:45.900> broken<00:04:46.139> which<00:04:46.440> is<00:04:46.590> really

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
also not be broken which is really

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.520 
also not be broken which is really
really<00:04:47.370> good<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.729> know<00:04:47.880> so<00:04:48.690> those<00:04:49.050> have<00:04:49.080> one's

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
really good to know so those have one's

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.500 
really good to know so those have one's
very<00:04:49.740> specific<00:04:50.310> purpose<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:50.970> is<00:04:51.000> defense

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
very specific purpose that is defense

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.850 
very specific purpose that is defense
you<00:04:51.690> gotta<00:04:51.900> know<00:04:52.580> where<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:53.699> want<00:04:53.909> them<00:04:54.860> when

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
you gotta know where you want them when

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.290 
you gotta know where you want them when
you<00:04:55.949> put<00:04:56.070> them<00:04:56.190> down<00:04:56.370> cuz<00:04:56.909> you<00:04:57.000> ain't<00:04:57.180> gonna

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
you put them down cuz you ain't gonna

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.200 
you put them down cuz you ain't gonna
get<00:04:57.479> it<00:04:57.539> back<00:04:57.630> up<00:04:57.930> maybe<00:04:58.770> I<00:04:59.159> think<00:05:00.030> they're

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
get it back up maybe I think they're

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.360
