00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.309 
and as you guys can see bigger is not
always<00:02:24.540> better

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
always better

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.630 
always better
I<00:02:25.349> really<00:02:25.650> think<00:02:25.799> black<00:02:26.010> gray<00:02:26.159> took<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.459> step

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
I really think black gray took a step

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.220 
I really think black gray took a step
forward<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.090> trying<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:27.780> compete<00:02:28.140> with

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
forward and trying this to compete with

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.990 
forward and trying this to compete with
other<00:02:28.440> smartphones<00:02:29.010> but<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.459> still<00:02:29.700> think<00:02:29.879> it

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
other smartphones but I still think it

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.580 
other smartphones but I still think it
needs<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.209> do<00:02:30.329> a<00:02:30.360> lot<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.659> catching<00:02:30.989> up<00:02:31.110> since

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
needs to do a lot of catching up since

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.289 
needs to do a lot of catching up since
the<00:02:31.680> other<00:02:31.860> phone<00:02:32.099> companies<00:02:32.310> are<00:02:32.849> years
