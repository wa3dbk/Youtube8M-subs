00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.390
 cell phone 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.820
 If this is true the good will use these 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.560
 such images may be that it is even going to 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.340
 call the bike g3 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.380
 but guys looks like the same guy from the front 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.170
 so his screen clear that the screen the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.660
 where the front camera is located is the 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.330
 same thing I've seen the bike already know how 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.880
 It's just the same thing, man. 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.830
 me to have a little bit different but 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.930
 copied another cell phone that I did not 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.370
 I remember the name but there is a cell phone that has 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.530
 one thingie so in the middle printed one 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.980
 ball, I do not know, people, how is it? 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.800
 someone who knows and comments that you copied 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.060
 on the back of it but anyway I do not know 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.220
 How do you forget to buy the same? 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.869

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.480

 rumor the images will get off the bike gp 3 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.800
 that would be a bike again, right? 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.170
 and then you would buy if you have a motor 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.599
 g comments this is good not worth it 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.430

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.989
