00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.250
 hello welcome again to the channel 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.570
 guitar lessons the dotcom dotcom 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.700
 today we are going to learn a very trick 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.290
 interesting to be able to use our 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.200
 record in the instrument to be able 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.849
 extend those fingerings basically 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.010
 what we are going to do is link scales 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.169
 so I'm going to show you how it's done 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.110
 for this you are going to require a 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.090
 very important concept which location 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.640
 of the notes if you still do not know 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.220
 locate the notes go through this video and 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.350
 I always say I spend a lot of time 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.359
 that they do not imagine everything they are going to 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.070
 win in their interpretation if they know 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.219
 where are the notes on the instrument 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.530
 if they know their guitar well of what 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.640
 try this in the expensive areas it turns out 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.530
 that when you're starting to 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.090
 studying guitar scales 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.980
 soon you found a fingering for 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.960
 internet or in some video or something and you 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.269
 You found this room for example 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.269
 to take the sun as a reference 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.259
 this you learned in this room for 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.200
 the biggest sun scale and also you 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.909
 they said that if you make a single inside 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.500
 of the major sun scale using that 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:27.860
 fingering everything you do is going to sound 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:29.240
 well and it is true everything you do 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.390
 there it will sound good and it will work 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.890
 but eventually you're going to get tired you 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.880
 you're going to tire of wants to be stuck in 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.340
 four frets and everything is my own success 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.470
 seen x guitarist that when he does 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.299
 one only uses the whole guitar and is 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.340
 over here and then you see it here and pains 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.189
 over here then you do not ask how 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.890
 they do that because there is a very simple trick 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.360
 first of all the guitarists that already 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.829
 they have experience that is already very 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.049
 advanced in the instrument that we know 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.610
 well the instrument is already handled by 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.840
 next way and that should be you 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.640
 goal 1 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.289
 if you have the location of the notes 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.630
 clear and know where they are each 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.459
 the guitar notes 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.069
 and you know what notes have each 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.140
 scale you will be able to use the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.569
 instrument freely you're going to have to 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.769
 think no time in fingerings 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.720
 believe me when doing solos is a 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.910
 liberating that is what we have to 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.700
 arrive 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.540
 but that is something that takes time 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.010
 practice you have to spend a lot of time 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.040
 to the location a long time the 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.630
 improvisation and sometimes we say that 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.060
 I want to look for a shortcut then what 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.310
 we take for policy it works like 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.440
 shortcut 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.660
 it turns out that you learned your interest 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.099
 extra strong not only I propose you 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.230
 because we did not look at how this 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.989
 same fingering but if we started 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.420
 from the fifth from the fourth from the 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.530
 third or from the second string 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.970
 let's look at how the sun's scale would look 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.640
 greater if I will start from the fifth 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.500
 then what will I do? 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.349
 come to the sun note of the fifth string 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.280
 that is here and now edits in the camera 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:03.959
 it's five o'clock re re my f sharp are 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.959
 5 pm 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.200
 now let's go to the fourth string we look 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.730
 how would we touch the sun of the fourth 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.730
 rope we do 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.510
 sharp only born 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.340
 and now we go to the third string 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.920
 let's now finally to the second 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.920
 rope we go to the sun 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.530
 this already opens up many possibilities and 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:53.100
 you can then start improvising here 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.100
 pass back 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.599
 i 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.360
 and with that you realized 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.739
 take advantage of my instrument but the 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.299
 today's lesson is called learn to 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.580
 link the scales learning to launch 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.800
 scales then 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.600
 I do not want to link the scales with 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.460
 the following if you have the location 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.530
 of the relatively clear notes so 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.269
 that we made criticism to look for the note in 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.400
 each rope and start the scales of 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.440
 there and you have those fingerings and 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.850
 small parenthesis that is in the pdf 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.500
 that accompanies this lesson I told them the 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.390
 fingerings for larger scale and scale 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.910
 minor one of the many fingerings that 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.290
 no view from the sixth fifth fourth 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.650
 third second string so that the 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.780
 can make good use if you already have that 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.790
 clear the fingerings had what 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.270
 does one he ripped it here on the scale 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.290
 of the sun on sixth string 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.590
 eventually at some point I'm going to 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.440
 come back to the sun note are the and 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.710
 do re my f sharp 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.370
 Sun 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:05:00.310
 because he did not resume the stairs he tore 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.310
 with sharp 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.160
 so what does it say I hit the sixth 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.040
 every record I covered came out of 4 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.270
 frets 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.930
 I already have a much wider space 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:31.570
 to touch true 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:33.910
 now I can take him out to hit the jump if 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.350
 I was in this situation here for 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.350
 hit the jump to the fifth string 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.430
 sustained 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.890
 I have all the guitar at my disposal 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.480
 with that little trick linking the 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.370
 scales of respect I tell you how it is 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:00.130
 that are linked you start sixth 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.130
 rope stick with the fourth 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.760
 and it's going to end 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.680
 I had already started here 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.630
 when all the scales of the way in 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.920
 the one I'm showing you and this applies 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.990
 for any scale that I show you 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.250
 when you what is linking the scales 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.510
 in this way then simply expand 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.190
 your record in an incredible way 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.700
 you have the whole instrument to your 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:39.460
 willingness to improvise 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:41.770
 you already get out of the four frets 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.479
 I personally am a little friend of the 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.550
 fingerings I think you have to 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.900
 Search reach the point where you 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.240
 You know very well where the notes are 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.130
 on the guitar and know what notes they have 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.780
 the scale so that you can address it 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.150
 anywhere without thinking about 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.919
 fingerings but that's easy to do 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.080
 when you are working in greater sun 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.210
 in D major in the greatest in my greatest 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.610
 knowledge they tell you fa sharp senior 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.610
 or flat sun greater than are scales that 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.590
 they have six alterations 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.240
 fingerings so I want them here in 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.920
 where invitations can arrive 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.660
 help us a lot 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.270
 very well I hope this trick has them 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.680
 it became clear as I say in the pdf them 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.240
 I'm leaving the fingerings in the 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.210
 different roots to study them 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:25.340
 and start making these types of links 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.340
 they will realize how we can get out 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.630
 of what is the basic record that 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.250
 we had four notes and address everything 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.690
 the instrument as I said this 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:34.410
 applies for any scale if I take 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.410
 the blues scale 

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:49.210
 one 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.210
 and 

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.610
 I have all the instrument to me 

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.400
 disposition okay I hope you liked it 

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.840
 this election was commissioned a like 

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.280
 share so you know it's useful 

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.650
 socially seven by two guitarists 

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.150
 share subscribe to the channel if you do not 

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.710
 have done and see you next week 

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.700
 in a new election is worth happy week 

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.700
 everyone is doing very well
