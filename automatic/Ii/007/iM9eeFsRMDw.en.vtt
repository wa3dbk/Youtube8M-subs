and it happens to make a great body grip
support<00:00:47.960> now<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.230> system<00:00:49.680> will<00:00:49.829> work<00:00:49.860> with

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
support now this system will work with

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.760 
support now this system will work with
one<00:00:50.489> tends<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.940> 20s<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> 80s<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.620> even

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
one tends to 20s to 80s and you can even

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.350 
one tends to 20s to 80s and you can even
work<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> 330<00:00:53.789> although<00:00:54.180> that's

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
work with the 330 although that's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.260 
work with the 330 although that's
pushing<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:55.160> but<00:00:56.160> all<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.550> basically<00:00:56.820> is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
pushing it but all you do basically is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.840 
pushing it but all you do basically is
you're<00:00:57.780> gonna<00:00:57.870> hang<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> trap<00:00:58.850> vertically

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
you're gonna hang the trap vertically

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.389 
you're gonna hang the trap vertically
instead<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.449> horizontally<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:02.129> simply

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
instead of horizontally and you simply

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.880 
instead of horizontally and you simply
stick<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> piece<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.780> lath<00:01:03.930> into<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.650> ground

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
stick the piece of lath into the ground

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.760 
stick the piece of lath into the ground
where<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.909> want<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.210> Tramp<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.560> bend

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
where you want the Tramp and you bend

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.250 
where you want the Tramp and you bend
the<00:01:07.860> springs<00:01:08.189> down<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.720> put<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.960> bottom

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the springs down and you put the bottom

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.410 
the springs down and you put the bottom
spring<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.950> then<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> top<00:01:11.670> spring<00:01:12.090> through

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
spring and then the top spring through

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.830 
spring and then the top spring through
it<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:13.619> stabilize<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.490> trap<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.360> simply

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it and to stabilize the trap you simply

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.039 
it and to stabilize the trap you simply
push<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.380> springs<00:01:16.970> outward<00:01:17.970> until<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.869> gets

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
push the springs outward until it gets

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.340 
push the springs outward until it gets
firm<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.700> put<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.000> Tramp<00:01:21.350> anywhere

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
firm and you can put that Tramp anywhere

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.340 
firm and you can put that Tramp anywhere
you<00:01:22.530> want<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.460> gonna<00:01:23.610> stay<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.200> is

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
you want and it's gonna stay and this is

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.170 
you want and it's gonna stay and this is
a<00:01:25.380> great<00:01:25.740> system<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.450> it's<00:01:27.450> lightweight

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
a great system here it's lightweight

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.170 
a great system here it's lightweight
these<00:01:30.180> pieces<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.869> laughs<00:01:31.049> or<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.950> lot<00:01:32.310> lighter

smaller animal such as a mink even

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.710 
smaller animal such as a mink even
a bigger<00:02:13.980> trap<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.760> otherwise<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.540> might

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
a bigger trap that otherwise you might

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.720 
a bigger trap that otherwise you might
lose<00:02:15.780> him<00:02:16.260> because<00:02:16.950> he<00:02:17.220> could<00:02:17.370> go<00:02:17.490> right

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
lose him because he could go right

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.460

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
when you get a 220 on Beaver it's

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.770 
when you get a 220 on Beaver it's
usually<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.340> very<00:03:50.670> very<00:03:51.000> fast<00:03:51.270> dispatch

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
usually a very very fast dispatch

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.970 
usually a very very fast dispatch
because<00:03:51.960> they<00:03:52.110> get<00:03:52.230> some<00:03:52.350> right<00:03:52.620> behind<00:03:52.830> the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
because they get some right behind the

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.640 
because they get some right behind the
ears<00:03:53.190> especially<00:03:53.820> if<00:03:53.910> they're<00:03:54.060> big
