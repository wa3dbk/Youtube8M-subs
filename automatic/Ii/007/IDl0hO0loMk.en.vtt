00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.400
 I want to thank our sponsors of

 channel is to close computer and the king and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.570
 let's seal the links are the inscription 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.790
 is needed and shop topshop a shop 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.160
 computer science and here is a cheese shop 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.690
 for games then come on let's get started 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.340
 Talk about it. 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.290
 good who loses x10 to those who do not know 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.129
 how is x10 x10 the way ten 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.120
 for each side 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.460
 the map is composed esmal and also you 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.020
 have vehicles at the start or are those 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.610
 have a lot of tactics for everything to destroy 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.489
 vehicle and to use those made in the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.320
 certain beauty knowing that as 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.079
 this part of those 10 works almost there 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.520
 everything released for you to use just do not 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.469
 were released only a few who could 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.870
 being with the flu in the cattle state and this 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.909
 ends up helping or sometimes hindering 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.920
 and the adolescent analysis arms 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.330
 could you feel it might be that you have 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.280
 someone who has not played has not 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.140
 bought the animals found together 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.450
 have not won a must be that person 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.470
 until then a power is unjust in what is the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.020
 biggest newspaper 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.680
 so their image was seized 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.570
 This is just beauty. 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.040
 come on, how did this part of the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.740
 championship keys for work was 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.829
 divided for the team to play and I'm going to talk 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.470
 for you here ours as that was 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.930
 candidate who has played against and such 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.810
 well, let's go, our first match, man. 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.890
 was already tense our first match was 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.890
 in Brazil akeo mw against the army that 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.290
 she is the xts who is one of the strongest 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.259
 who have to see the son indicates the faces 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.970
 they play many guys are guys are 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.430
 very organized that she has on the board 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.540
 but are the cases of the United States and 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.399
 people ended up playing against them in 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.899
 first match then it was already necessary 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.899
 I imagine it must have been a little 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.520
 stressful this business you have 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.110
 start with all the teams that the team 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.300
 practically team stronger than in the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.770
 championship then it was very interesting 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.440
 That's because we have to train. 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.420
 very 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.100
 the guys and a map was the silent voice 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.290
 It is also not a very easy map 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.270
 win and face 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.280
 was very suffered I played with 300 of 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.660
 the morning of this departure is to kill the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.220
 Brave face one or two seconds 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.140
 to appear I had killed is fine 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.570
 complicated game but it ended up winning 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.640
 their rounds and went round the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.440
 first round in 80 with 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.940
 second tinga already over one hundred 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.790
 few that ended up flipping with the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.750
 flags them for a long time in 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.230
 second round 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.590
 our second part of that was against 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.510
 the group seek that in the second 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.430
 part of my school went against bk 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.560
 network that is but is a second line that 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.020
 had the problem is k 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.660
 and this match was a bankrupt idea 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.330
 which is a map you can do that 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.700
 roll call of the dam is not the food 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.920
 zone for who will be remembered was given 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.390
 with the company but that is a map too 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.950
 It's difficult to play because you have a little sister. 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.200
 which stands one of the flags 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.180
 So it 's that zica tries to keep the 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.710
 control it or you have to keep the 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.200
 control of the two flags that are 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.420
 inside the buildings she can pick up 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.280
 in buildings is not very complicated involves 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.830
 too much while the vehicle 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.080
 Helicopter for is a complicated map of 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.360
 is playing at home and I did not play the 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.130
 from there the plan staff left 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.230
 play leave up because I probably 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.630
 would have taken on a more personal side already 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.040
 that the clan that we have played against him and 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.100
 there were people who would not accept me 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.010
 did not want to let me in the btk clan 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.750
 so I personally and left out of this 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.459
 I even start and thank you, because otherwise I think 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.090
 that really this taint of staff 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.340
 Could something go wrong now? 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.050
 on the next match we had uranium 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.600
 the game every one that was really starting 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.310
 more difficult that it was the only match 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.730
 access that we have lost at least one 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.860
 round here is this match how many uranos 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.070
 Dude then it rocks 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.750
 It was a match that was difficult even 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.459
 first round and the second we finish 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.500
 losing we end up losing is 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.390
 policy then we won by 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.780
 his tickets so I'm the one who 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.070
 matter and guy the passionate has come to 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.780
 lose all the flags of the old 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.739
 litigation of the old capital flag all 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.049
 the manners were then very 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.660
 balanced the match they are a team 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.960
 very strong and has a good tank face that 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.460
 it was good infantry 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.050
 it's really a club that has enough 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.120
 the staff has a lot of commitment 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.860
 competitive there so people also 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.970
 you got better was 3 with several 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.680
 titles and such 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.720
 and it really was a very 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.789
 difficult the staff is very well trained and 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.960
 plays well as hell and is the only 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.639
 starting as said we just 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.669
 losing at least one round in the match 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.560
 and give a kiss on her to vote you too that 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.090
 I have I think I have a match 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.120
 or two does not apply when the 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.740
 I have against them there to ours 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.319
 third match that was the last 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.050
 Match was against the Dome Arena game 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.639
 at home here is a Chilean club or damage 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.750
 the one is also Brazilian and the market 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.520
 Brazilian 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.280
 only the army does not want an American anymore 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.169
 the war and in the house all the chile that also 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.990
 already had some titles and also a 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.060
 arena game was also part of the next 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.820
 it was also the next haiti chile was not 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.139
 son of 3 was a very difficult match 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.270
 against them 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.770
 It was a match where it was kind of hard. 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.240
 How can I go to you, is it? 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.599
 difficult to train for the match until the 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.130
 match itself it was not so complicated 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.110
 so because there was still a lot of shooting 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.289
 indirectly in mind that he was a shovel and 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.000
 lucky that was in the case yesterday the match 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.520
 difficult to train because much of the 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.320
 of those who had already left the x5 of the five 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.970
 of the x10 mini cooper was gone 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.259
 they were already playing it was not much of 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.990
 close the training to play this 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.370
 but luckily he got some 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.530
 practice the match was a tactic 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.719
 Good to win the first round 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.349
 was over 200 chic with 50 in the second 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:52.610
 for quite that too and each was very 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:55.880
 good match and it was the match that 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.250
 consecrated us there as champion of the x10 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.110
 Ever since that time, all the teams that 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.110
 are playing in team sports that everyone 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.210
 The teams are times that guy has not to 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.400
 They are not very competitive and 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.800
 I really do not have to say that 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:15.620
 our key felt that it had the most fans 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:17.780
 strong even because xts flex uranium 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.210
 the games to forget our 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.789
 part of our down key are clear 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.199
 which had a very strong fall then it was 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.820
 very cool to have played we did not catch 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.740
 no weak team had a share of that 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.449
 breakthrough not to train in a hurry 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.979
 everything was very difficult and he had to 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.699
 train enough to be able to win the 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.130
 departures 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.900
 so it was very well - this victory I 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.230
 I have to thank the staff there that I 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.580
 He gave 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.960
 chance while no one else wanted a 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.210
 chance to play in the very competitive 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.710
 thank the staff mw and come to 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.900
 will have another competitive match going 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.310
 To have 50 more Chinese has a lot to 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.660
 people play 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.160
 then am I guys hope you 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.260

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.490
