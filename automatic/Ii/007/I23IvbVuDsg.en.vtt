00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
for me because I was really looking

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.699

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.880 
forward to face function but we don't
have<00:02:46.030> this<00:02:47.030> function<00:02:47.720> in<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.110> japanese

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890

version of the iphone 4s and in this you

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.000 
version of the iphone 4s and in this you
can<00:02:54.049> see<00:02:54.349> if<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:55.750> personal<00:02:56.750> Wi-Fi<00:02:57.109> has<00:02:57.739> been

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
can see if the personal Wi-Fi has been

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.009 
can see if the personal Wi-Fi has been
disabled<00:02:58.700> for<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:59.480> soft<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.290> iphone<00:03:01.870> it<00:03:02.870> is

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
disabled for the soft and iphone it is

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.940 
disabled for the soft and iphone it is
available<00:03:04.510> on<00:03:05.510> softbank<00:03:06.109> so<00:03:06.290> if<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:06.560> want<00:03:06.829> to

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
available on softbank so if you want to

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.740 
available on softbank so if you want to
have<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.250> pocket<00:03:07.609> what<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.299> need<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.629> buy<00:03:08.720> a

have a pocket what you need to buy a

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.309 
have a pocket what you need to buy a
pocket<00:03:09.140> Wi-Fi<00:03:09.290> if<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.769> want<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.160> have<00:03:10.370> a<00:03:11.319> Wi-Fi

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
pocket Wi-Fi if you want to have a Wi-Fi

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.190 
pocket Wi-Fi if you want to have a Wi-Fi
hotspot<00:03:12.349> so<00:03:13.220> that's<00:03:13.730> quite<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.200> disadvantage

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
hotspot so that's quite a disadvantage

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.500 
hotspot so that's quite a disadvantage
for<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.680> iphone<00:03:16.040> 4s<00:03:16.430> in<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.760> japanese

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
for the iphone 4s in the japanese

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.759 
for the iphone 4s in the japanese
version<00:03:18.790> so<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:20.269> rest<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.900> iphone<00:03:21.290> 4s<00:03:21.590> is

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
version so the rest the iphone 4s is

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.640 
version so the rest the iphone 4s is
quite<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.010> same<00:03:22.370> as<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:23.060> iphone<00:03:23.419> 4<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:23.959> i

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
quite the same as the iphone 4 and i

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.640 
quite the same as the iphone 4 and i
would<00:03:24.799> like<00:03:24.889> to<00:03:25.010> take<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.910> camera<00:03:26.510> also<00:03:26.810> has

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
would like to take the camera also has

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.750
