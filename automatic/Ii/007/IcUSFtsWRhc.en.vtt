00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
i 9100 XX k p 1 let's see here was that

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.769 
i 9100 XX k p 1 let's see here was that
the<00:00:16.949> full<00:00:17.190> name<00:00:18.980> yeah<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.310> negative<00:00:21.210> 100<00:00:21.630> as

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the full name yeah I negative 100 as

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.620 
the full name yeah I negative 100 as
obviously<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.760> galaxy<00:00:23.760> s<00:00:23.850> whose<00:00:24.119> model

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
obviously the galaxy s whose model

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.040 
obviously the galaxy s whose model
number<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.109> then<00:00:25.699> XX<00:00:26.699> k<00:00:27.590> p1<00:00:28.820> it<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.420> was<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
number and then XX k p1 it it was a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.130 
number and then XX k p1 it it was a
build<00:00:32.009> or<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:33.180> know<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.510> they<00:00:33.660> build<00:00:33.930> this

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
build or you know that they build this

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.220 
build or you know that they build this
on<00:00:34.980> some<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> seventh<00:00:35.969> book<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:37.110> don't

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
on some of the seventh book and we don't

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.229 
on some of the seventh book and we don't
know<00:00:37.469> if<00:00:37.649> they're<00:00:37.829> going<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.070> do<00:00:38.160> more<00:00:38.489> changes

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
know if they're going to do more changes

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.850 
know if they're going to do more changes
to<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.629> probably<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.469> one<00:00:40.680> is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
to it but probably because this one is

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.630 
to it but probably because this one is
all<00:00:41.129> fast<00:00:41.670> hell<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.149> buggy<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.750> well<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.640> yeah

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
all fast hell it's buggy as well so yeah

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.040 
all fast hell it's buggy as well so yeah
therefore<00:00:44.940> going<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.329> lot<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.510> changes

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
therefore going to do a lot of changes

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.779 
therefore going to do a lot of changes
and<00:00:46.440> hopefully<00:00:46.829> we'll<00:00:47.010> get<00:00:47.100> more<00:00:47.160> leaks<00:00:47.610> in

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
and hopefully we'll get more leaks in

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.450 
and hopefully we'll get more leaks in
the<00:00:47.910> future<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.739> time<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.370> go

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the future but this time I'm going to go

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.770 
the future but this time I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.700> show<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:50.940> how<00:00:51.180> we<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.420> give<00:00:51.539> ahead

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
ahead and show you how we can give ahead

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.200 
ahead and show you how we can give ahead
and<00:00:51.930> install<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.590> your<00:00:52.649> samsung<00:00:53.640> galaxy<00:00:53.670> s2

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
and install it on your samsung galaxy s2

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.450 
and install it on your samsung galaxy s2
now<00:00:54.570> let<00:00:55.079> me<00:00:55.110> start<00:00:55.410> off<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:55.739> saying<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
now let me start off with saying that I

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.580 
now let me start off with saying that I
have<00:00:56.670> no<00:00:56.879> idea<00:00:57.059> about<00:00:57.360> different<00:00:57.870> variants<00:00:58.500> on

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
have no idea about different variants on

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.049 
have no idea about different variants on
the<00:00:58.649> samsung<00:00:58.949> galaxy<00:00:58.980> s2<00:00:59.430> if<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.850> going<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the samsung galaxy s2 if it's going to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.360 
the samsung galaxy s2 if it's going to
work<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.690> or<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.829> know<00:01:02.039> things<00:01:02.219> like

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
work for you or you know things like

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.130 
work for you or you know things like
that<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.000> suppose<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.449> should<00:01:03.690> work<00:01:03.719> for

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
that but I suppose this should work for

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.690 
that but I suppose this should work for
all<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.650> samsung<00:01:04.949> galaxy<00:01:04.979> s2<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> out

there that is on and that is on the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.760 
there that is on and that is on the
