00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
all right guys get all of the pieces cut

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.349 
all right guys get all of the pieces cut
so<00:00:20.430> I've<00:00:20.699> got<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.210> frame<00:00:21.480> pieces<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:23.150> big<00:00:24.150> bar

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
so I've got the frame pieces the big bar

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.849 
so I've got the frame pieces the big bar
up<00:00:24.420> here<00:00:24.449> nothing's<00:00:24.930> welded<00:00:25.320> together<00:00:25.439> yet

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
up here nothing's welded together yet

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.740 
up here nothing's welded together yet
it's<00:00:26.430> just<00:00:26.490> held<00:00:26.820> together<00:00:26.880> with<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.269> magnets

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
it's just held together with the magnets

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.880 
it's just held together with the magnets
and<00:00:28.080> then<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:28.650> are<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.949> three<00:00:29.279> pieces<00:00:29.849> that

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
and then here are the three pieces that

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.680 
and then here are the three pieces that
will<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.399> lifting<00:00:32.820> mechanism

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
will be the lifting mechanism

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.830 
will be the lifting mechanism
I<00:00:34.760> had<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> sharpie<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:37.250> labeled<00:00:38.450> each<00:00:39.450> piece

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
I had a sharpie and I labeled each piece

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.970 
I had a sharpie and I labeled each piece
as<00:00:40.309> to<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.430> get<00:00:41.700> confused<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> pieces<00:00:42.980> so

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
as to not get confused on the pieces so

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.410 
as to not get confused on the pieces so
basically<00:00:45.110> my<00:00:46.110> next<00:00:46.469> step<00:00:46.680> will<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.420> drilling

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
basically my next step will be drilling

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.930 
basically my next step will be drilling
out<00:00:48.809> all<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.469> holes<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.039> figure<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.789> should

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
out all the holes I figure I should

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.970 
out all the holes I figure I should
probably<00:00:51.210> drill<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> holes<00:00:52.199> before<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.680> weld

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
probably drill the holes before I weld

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.099 
probably drill the holes before I weld
it<00:00:53.160> all<00:00:53.280> together<00:00:53.489> because<00:00:54.420> once<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.920> once<00:00:55.920> I

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
it all together because once I once I

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.500 
it all together because once I once I
especially<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:59.309> piece<00:00:59.640> here<00:01:00.059> it

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
especially on this this piece here it

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.510 
especially on this this piece here it
may<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:01.050> difficult<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.649> drill<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> holes<00:01:02.309> in

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
may be difficult to drill the holes in

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.219 
may be difficult to drill the holes in
this<00:01:02.640> once<00:01:03.000> i<00:01:03.180> weld<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.629> because<00:01:03.930> it'll<00:01:04.080> be

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
this once i weld it because it'll be

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:12.060 
this once i weld it because it'll be
bulky<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:04.979> frame<00:01:05.309> so

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.820 

all<00:01:13.070> right<00:01:13.280> people<00:01:13.870> well<00:01:14.870> tilt<00:01:15.500> it<00:01:15.620> down<00:01:15.650> a

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
all right people well tilt it down a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.930 
all right people well tilt it down a
little<00:01:15.950> more<00:01:16.100> there<00:01:16.910> we<00:01:17.060> go

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
little more there we go

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
all right there's my 2 bar mechanism

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.480 
all right there's my 2 bar mechanism
everything's<00:01:23.240> welded<00:01:23.660> together<00:01:24.370> bolted<00:01:25.370> it

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
everything's welded together bolted it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.620 
everything's welded together bolted it
together<00:01:25.760> I<00:01:25.850> didn't<00:01:26.060> tighten<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.360> down<00:01:26.390> all

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
together I didn't tighten it down all

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.480

couple<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:32.930> pretty<00:03:33.109> good<00:03:33.319> welds<00:03:33.709> on<00:03:33.859> here<00:03:34.569> I'm

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
couple of pretty good welds on here I'm

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.240 
couple of pretty good welds on here I'm
pretty<00:03:35.840> proud<00:03:36.049> of<00:03:36.109> this<00:03:36.319> one<00:03:36.530> if<00:03:36.829> you<00:03:36.980> can<00:03:37.010> see

pretty proud of this one if you can see
this<00:03:37.400> one<00:03:41.109> that's<00:03:42.109> not<00:03:42.349> too<00:03:42.379> bad<00:03:43.599> there's<00:03:44.599> like

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
this one that's not too bad there's like

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.649 
this one that's not too bad there's like
hardly<00:03:45.079> any<00:03:45.439> burchett<00:03:46.250> at<00:03:46.760> all<00:03:47.000> on<00:03:47.269> that<00:03:47.450> will

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
hardly any burchett at all on that will

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.259 
hardly any burchett at all on that will
I<00:03:47.870> just<00:03:48.500> want<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.739> make<00:03:48.889> sure<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:49.579> this

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
I just want to make sure that this this

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.309 
I just want to make sure that this this
crossbar<00:03:50.989> here<00:03:52.299> where<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.420> joins<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.930> frame

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
crossbar here where it joins the frame

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.030 
crossbar here where it joins the frame
this<00:03:55.220> has<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.670> be<00:03:55.790> really<00:03:56.120> strong<00:03:56.750> so<00:03:57.739> I<00:03:57.769> need

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
this has to be really strong so I need

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.490 
this has to be really strong so I need
to<00:03:58.129> make<00:03:58.310> sure<00:03:58.659> this<00:03:59.659> this<00:03:59.989> is<00:04:00.170> where<00:04:00.349> there's

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
to make sure this this is where there's

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.280 
to make sure this this is where there's
a<00:04:00.560> lot<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:01.040> stress<00:04:01.310> on<00:04:01.489> this<00:04:01.670> thing<00:04:01.849> right<00:04:02.030> here

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
a lot of stress on this thing right here

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.069 
a lot of stress on this thing right here
I<00:04:03.349> may<00:04:04.159> even<00:04:05.349> what<00:04:06.349> I'll<00:04:06.470> probably<00:04:06.680> do<00:04:08.079> since

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
I may even what I'll probably do since

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.780 
I may even what I'll probably do since
my<00:04:09.290> welding<00:04:09.680> isn't<00:04:10.040> all<00:04:10.129> that<00:04:10.160> great<00:04:10.519> right

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
my welding isn't all that great right

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.259 
my welding isn't all that great right
now

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
now

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.530 
now
since<00:04:12.109> I'm<00:04:12.260> gonna<00:04:12.349> mount<00:04:12.709> my<00:04:13.579> cylinder<00:04:14.329> up

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
since I'm gonna mount my cylinder up

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.740 
since I'm gonna mount my cylinder up
high<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:15.459> could<00:04:16.459> go<00:04:16.579> ahead<00:04:16.699> and<00:04:16.940> put<00:04:17.120> some<00:04:17.150> angle

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
high I could go ahead and put some angle

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.210 
high I could go ahead and put some angle
iron<00:04:17.870> here<00:04:18.349> and<00:04:20.139> put<00:04:21.139> some<00:04:21.289> bolts<00:04:21.440> in<00:04:21.680> it<00:04:21.799> bolt

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
iron here and put some bolts in it bolt

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.210 
iron here and put some bolts in it bolt
this<00:04:22.400> down<00:04:23.080> bolt<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.229> down<00:04:24.260> there<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.949> really

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
this down bolt it down there to really

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.909 
this down bolt it down there to really
reinforce<00:04:25.520> this<00:04:26.320> that's<00:04:27.320> probably<00:04:27.470> a<00:04:27.740> good

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
reinforce this that's probably a good

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.010 
reinforce this that's probably a good
idea

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
idea

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.260 
idea
just<00:04:30.020> just<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.500> be<00:04:30.530> on<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.830> safe<00:04:31.070> side<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:32.120> I'll

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
just just to be on the safe side so I'll

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.659 
just just to be on the safe side so I'll
probably<00:04:32.449> go<00:04:32.720> ahead<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:32.990> do<00:04:33.080> that<00:04:33.550> which<00:04:34.550> I

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
probably go ahead and do that which I

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.070 
probably go ahead and do that which I
think<00:04:34.849> will<00:04:34.970> help<00:04:35.000> out<00:04:35.330> with<00:04:35.449> the<00:04:35.570> strength<00:04:35.870> of

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
think will help out with the strength of

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.810 
think will help out with the strength of
the<00:04:36.830> mechanism<00:04:37.400> so<00:04:38.860> okay<00:04:39.860> people<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.490> don't

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
the mechanism so okay people I don't

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.070 
the mechanism so okay people I don't
know<00:04:40.970> if<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.120> can<00:04:41.210> see<00:04:41.419> this<00:04:41.570> freaking<00:04:42.050> thing

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
know if you can see this freaking thing

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.050 
know if you can see this freaking thing
or<00:04:42.349> not<00:04:42.470> but<00:04:44.979> this<00:04:45.979> is<00:04:46.159> my<00:04:46.310> jumping<00:04:46.699> barrel

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
or not but this is my jumping barrel

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.980 
or not but this is my jumping barrel
setup<00:04:48.550> using<00:04:49.550> an<00:04:51.039> animation<00:04:52.039> maestro<00:04:52.990> it's

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
setup using an animation maestro it's

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.420 
setup using an animation maestro it's
already<00:04:54.199> ready<00:04:54.380> to<00:04:54.530> hook<00:04:54.650> up<00:04:54.860> so<00:04:55.039> all<00:04:55.159> I<00:04:55.190> did

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
already ready to hook up so all I did

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:12.129 
already ready to hook up so all I did
was<00:04:55.610> just<00:04:55.789> plug<00:04:56.120> it<00:04:56.240> in<00:04:56.360> so<00:04:58.630> here<00:04:59.630> we<00:04:59.930> go

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139

very so it works I will be putting this

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.100 
very so it works I will be putting this
spider<00:05:20.340> on<00:05:20.639> there<00:05:20.849> I<00:05:21.030> don't<00:05:21.509> have<00:05:21.870> a<00:05:21.900> way<00:05:22.050> to
