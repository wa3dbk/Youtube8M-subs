00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
by clearing out an entire poker table

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.200 
by clearing out an entire poker table
and<00:00:34.260> much<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.250> other<00:00:35.460> mini<00:00:35.730> games<00:00:36.000> and

and much like the other mini games and

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.330 
and much like the other mini games and
watchdogs<00:00:36.570> poker<00:00:37.350> has<00:00:37.710> many<00:00:38.070> different

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
watchdogs poker has many different

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.690 
watchdogs poker has many different
levels<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:39.180> different<00:00:39.210> binds<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.710> 10,000

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
levels with different binds like 10,000

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.549 
levels with different binds like 10,000
I<00:00:42.000> think<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> highest<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:42.989> saw<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
I think the highest one I saw was like a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.850 
I think the highest one I saw was like a
hundred<00:00:44.040> thousand<00:00:44.640> there's<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> thousand

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
hundred thousand there's a thousand

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.930 
hundred thousand there's a thousand
obviously<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> easiest<00:00:47.700> poker

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
obviously we want the easiest poker

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.850 
obviously we want the easiest poker
table<00:00:48.270> possible<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.260> go<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> table

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
table possible so we go to the table

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.380 
table possible so we go to the table
that's<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> madam<00:00:50.579> aisle<00:00:50.730> district<00:00:51.270> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
that's in the madam aisle district and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.850 
that's in the madam aisle district and
that<00:00:51.570> has<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> buying<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.230> only<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.500> hundred

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
that has a buying of only a hundred

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.220 
that has a buying of only a hundred
dollars<00:00:53.210> but<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.390> wouldn't<00:00:54.660> say<00:00:54.870> there's<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
dollars but I wouldn't say there's a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
dollars but I wouldn't say there's a
real<00:00:55.410> strategy<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.160> clearing<00:00:56.430> out<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
real strategy to clearing out one of the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.430 
real strategy to clearing out one of the
poker<00:00:57.390> tables<00:00:57.719> other<00:00:57.870> than<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.410> know

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
poker tables other than just you know

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.459 
poker tables other than just you know
being<00:00:58.770> good<00:00:58.980> at<00:00:59.070> poker<00:00:59.280> against<00:00:59.670> an<00:00:59.760> easy<00:01:00.030> AI

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
being good at poker against an easy AI

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.080 
being good at poker against an easy AI
sometimes<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.739> get<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> AI<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.340> call<00:01:02.820> if

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
sometimes you can get the AI to call if

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.670 
sometimes you can get the AI to call if
you<00:01:03.210> go<00:01:03.359> all-in<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.470> first

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you go all-in in just one of the first

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.679 
you go all-in in just one of the first
two<00:01:04.890> rounds<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.030> speed<00:01:06.270> things<00:01:06.420> up

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
two rounds and that can speed things up

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.510 
two rounds and that can speed things up
cuz<00:01:06.869> you'll<00:01:07.080> easily<00:01:07.350> knock<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.189> think

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
cuz you'll easily knock one out I think

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.710 
cuz you'll easily knock one out I think
I<00:01:08.549> was<00:01:08.670> playing<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:08.939> my<00:01:09.030> friend<00:01:09.360> Nate<00:01:09.540> who

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
I was playing with my friend Nate who

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.820 
I was playing with my friend Nate who
you<00:01:09.780> guys<00:01:09.869> remember<00:01:10.170> from<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.380> previous<00:01:10.409> video

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you guys remember from a previous video

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.679 
you guys remember from a previous video
he<00:01:11.520> was<00:01:11.610> doing<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:11.970> challenge<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.510> he

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
he was doing this challenge and he

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.600 
he was doing this challenge and he
knocked<00:01:12.930> out<00:01:13.049> two<00:01:13.110> people<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.100> first<00:01:14.310> hand

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
knocked out two people in the first hand

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.490 
knocked out two people in the first hand
so<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.450> mean<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.990> finish<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.320> pretty

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
so I mean you can finish this pretty

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.899 
so I mean you can finish this pretty
quickly<00:01:16.740> you're<00:01:17.250> probably<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.759> get

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
quickly you're probably going to get

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.219 
quickly you're probably going to get
into<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> period<00:01:18.570> though<00:01:18.720> where<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
into a period though where you have to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.960 
into a period though where you have to
like<00:01:19.320> grind<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.860> hands<00:01:20.189> because<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> AI<00:01:20.759> is

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
like grind out hands because the AI is

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.940 
like grind out hands because the AI is
just<00:01:21.270> folding<00:01:21.720> after<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.200> get<00:01:22.409> their<00:01:22.590> cards

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
just folding after they get their cards

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.990 
just folding after they get their cards
and<00:01:23.040> they're<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.220> happy<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.549> their<00:01:23.759> hand

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and they're not happy with their hand

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
and they're not happy with their hand
but<00:01:24.540> they<00:01:24.689> do<00:01:24.750> add<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> cool<00:01:25.530> feature<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.979> lets

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
but they do add a cool feature that lets

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.070 
but they do add a cool feature that lets
you<00:01:26.400> see<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.820> nervous<00:01:27.270> level<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> other

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you see the nervous level of the other

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.359 
you see the nervous level of the other
player<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.890> tell<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.220> they're

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
player so you can tell if they're

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.649 
player so you can tell if they're
bluffing<00:01:29.759> or<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:29.909> or<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.180> they're<00:01:30.360> worried

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
bluffing or not or if they're worried

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.359 
bluffing or not or if they're worried
that<00:01:30.689> they<00:01:30.960> don't<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.680> cards<00:01:31.950> they<00:01:32.100> need

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that they don't have the cards they need

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.130 
that they don't have the cards they need
and<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:33.030> didn't<00:01:33.360> use<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.570> when<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:34.020> doing

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
and I didn't use this when I was doing

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.960 
and I didn't use this when I was doing
this<00:01:34.320> challenge<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.890> went<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.640> brute

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
this challenge I went for the brute

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.789 
this challenge I went for the brute
force<00:01:36.000> method<00:01:36.360> which<00:01:36.900> worked<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.590> pretty

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
force method which worked out pretty

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.260 
force method which worked out pretty
well<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.159> smaller<00:01:38.430> table<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.210> doubt

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
well in the smaller table but I doubt

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.850 
well in the smaller table but I doubt
that<00:01:39.689> would<00:01:39.750> work<00:01:40.020> out<00:01:40.170> well<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> harder

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
that would work out well in the harder

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.590 
that would work out well in the harder
tables<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.759> feature<00:01:41.939> could<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.390> come

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
tables so this feature could really come

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.840 
tables so this feature could really come
in<00:01:42.720> handy<00:01:42.829> but<00:01:43.829> after<00:01:44.220> clearing<00:01:44.549> out<00:01:44.729> an

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
in handy but after clearing out an

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.370 
in handy but after clearing out an
entire<00:01:45.090> table<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.600> should<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
entire table you should see a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.260 
entire table you should see a
progression<00:01:46.799> wheel<00:01:47.070> notification<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.939> if

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
progression wheel notification and if

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.880 
progression wheel notification and if
you<00:01:48.360> check<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.659> car<00:01:48.930> on-demand<00:01:49.290> app<00:01:49.680> you'll
