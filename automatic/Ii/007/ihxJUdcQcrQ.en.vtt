00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510
 Yes 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.510
 no wonder 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.620

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.620
 like you 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.800
 Hello today it is a lunch idea 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.560
 video of me and that gives it up 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.630
 youtube 80 videos for breakfast ideas 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.950
 and also jacky but healthy ones 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.420
 There are hardly any lunch ideas here 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.130
 That's why I thought I'll show you today 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.869
 Just have a nice lunch 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.090
 Ideas I personally feel it too 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.500
 is relatively healthy are clear once 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.690
 you should potatoes potatoes now 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.250
 not in amounts as daddy as long as it times 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.320
 a lunch in the week is that 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.030
 completely okay just the same now 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.290
 just not longer but I wish 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.970
 Have fun with it now 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.580
 lunch ideas are the first recipe 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.260
 These pizza pockets are here and there 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.090
 Just swap those pizza 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.370
 made of spelled flour and relative 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.990
 we are healthy vegetarian too 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.510
 First, make the dough for it 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.930
 we have a bowl of oatmeal water 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.370
 then we still have salt and pepper and 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.170
 Finally, we need it again 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.830
 several are the exact quantities 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.390
 to every recipe in the infobox 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.009
 Now we start with all the ingredients in 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.840
 to give the bowl we start with 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:18.190
 he will come next 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.870
 oatmeal fine then the water and 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.820
 then we lose the whole thing when we do 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.560
 realize that it is still a bit dry 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.030
 then we give a little more water 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.230
 this comes on top of each 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.120
 oatmeal 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.280
 then we're done coming 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.170
 then salt and pepper in and if 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.640
 which is then finished off then 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.450
 The whole thing will be together again 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.700
 Mulled now, we are different 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.400
 According to a red onion need one 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.640
 paprika a tomato and then we should 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.950
 Passed tomatoes for sauce all the way 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.350
 want to cut small and then start 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.720
 We use the dough on the baking sheet 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.940
 of course, give over a baking paper whole 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.860
 important and we just start something 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.619
 to participate in a nice round 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.360
 just form on the baking tray 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.310
 smear, so to speak, then come the 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.380
 tomato sauce on it is important too 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.909
 not to take too much and that too 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.979
 really only 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.379
 inside, therefore, the outside remains 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.970
 still holiday over then stays 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.260
 the vegetable comes over it that is the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.730
 onions are onions and peppers 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.610
 when we are done we start 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.410
 to give the next layer above and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.290
 although we are still distributing something over 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.299
 the last circle so we outside the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.349
 dough once again can firmly press that 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.349
 we do not stop there 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.620
 The last step is an optional one 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.410
 give it a bit more mozzarella cheese 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.450
 about However, all vegetarian and 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.770
 vegetarians who do not eat cheese this 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.770
 course, omit step 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.340
 for me he now shares personally 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.709
 for doubtful you can but 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.239
 Of course, four little ones do that too 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.290
 Of course, depending on how many people 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.239
 who want to eat 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.129
 and then the pizza pockets come too 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.739
 already in the oven they look like that 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.620
 She in the preheated oven comes there 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.030
 then come for about 15 to 20 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:23.549
 about one minute 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:25.139
 at about 200 degrees these are the 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.659
 finished pizza chips I'll tell you 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.430
 Tasty super delicious and me 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.560
 would say happens after the next 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.439
 recipe and I show you each one 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.299
 we start with the tomato 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.829
 concept and that's where we start with that 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.230
 cooking noodles I think that can 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.760
 each one of us and as soon as they are 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.120
 noodles are cooked, we go 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.709
 then put some oil in the pan and give 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.819
 then fry the noodles in the pan 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.819
 this something 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.750
 next we will give the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.310
 passed tomatoes 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.169
 I have about half of that now 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.120
 pack but you can do it yourself 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.620
 decide how much you want so much 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.159
 Of course that depends on how 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.530
 many noodles you have in the next one already 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.690
 we spread the whole and then comes 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.489
 even the coconut milk is there for it 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.470
 Coconut milk at Rossmann in any case 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.879
 I think there are also some dm there 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.159
 But I'm not sure now 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.840
 and we just give it something 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:21.120
 but not quite so 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.039
 Much like tomatoes passed by him then 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.530
 we naturally salt the whole thing 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.750
 also pasta salt and pepper to that 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.310
 whole is then frozen in the noodle 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.520
 and then we're done 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.520
 in order to 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.590
 this is what the finished result looks like 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.570
 really super delicious and very easy 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.010
 is within 15 minutes if you 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.410
 you guys soon maybe even 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.000
 faster and the last recipe are on 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.340
 are is this bratkartoffeln here 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.130
 just potatoes from the oven but 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.530
 super nice crispy almost as if 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.760
 they are fried and we take each other 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.560
 for the first time the desired amount 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.630
 potatoes and cut these into such 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.520
 You can see how I see you 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.930
 Just cut the narrow one 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.700
 pieces so they break through quickly 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.710
 can cut the whole 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.200
 We will then bring potatoes 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.970
 the baking tray and then oil comes to me 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.440
 take almost oil but of course you can 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.380
 also exercise differently how to use 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.210
 For example olive oil that we distribute well 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.400
 is that it took place at all potatoes 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.350
 and then the paprika is spiced up 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.330
 that is really the best law for 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.550
 I can tell you fried potatoes then 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.960
 they really taste really close to real 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.020
 I'll tell you some chips 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.850
 Then pepper is added to salt then 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.650
 the potatoes are ready too 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.420
 and you can see them in the yard like that 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.970
 before you come in the oven 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.730
 We give it for about 20 to 30 minutes 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.110
 in the preheated oven and I know 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.300
 not exactly how long that takes you 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.840
 can you look when they are pretty crispy 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.730
 become 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.740
 so they look super delicious 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:56.660
 is very fast and that was the 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.590
 three lunch ideas always writes in 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.360
 the comments 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.430
 which lunch idea you most 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.630
 has addressed and whether he is now of me 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.980
 I feel very safe 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.330
 that she will or will have now 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.590
 I just liked it 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.750
 here on my right is still right now 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.130
 once my last huttary I link 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.810
 Hope you click on it all at once 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.520
 there are even more ideas of food 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.910
 me and we'll see each other next 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.910
 again
