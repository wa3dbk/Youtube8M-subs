00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:04.100 
alright and now I want to show you some

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.160 
alright and now I want to show you some
basic<00:00:05.100> drawing<00:00:05.549> technique<00:00:06.089> that<00:00:06.690> I've

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
basic drawing technique that I've

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.730 
basic drawing technique that I've
learned<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:08.420> I<00:00:09.420> hope<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.200> will<00:00:10.230> find<00:00:10.559> it

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
learned and I hope you will find it

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.450 
learned and I hope you will find it
useful<00:00:12.259> basically<00:00:13.259> what<00:00:13.440> i<00:00:13.469> did<00:00:13.740> i<00:00:14.009> drew<00:00:14.429> a

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
useful basically what i did i drew a

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.340 
useful basically what i did i drew a
rectangle<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.389> as<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:16.619> see<00:00:16.650> when<00:00:17.190> i<00:00:18.350> when

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
rectangle and as you can see when i when

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.210 
rectangle and as you can see when i when
i<00:00:19.430> put<00:00:20.430> my<00:00:20.609> mouse<00:00:20.820> pointer<00:00:21.800> closer<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
i put my mouse pointer closer to the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.460 
i put my mouse pointer closer to the
edge<00:00:23.539> it<00:00:24.539> changes<00:00:25.080> telling<00:00:25.920> me<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.340> i<00:00:26.519> can

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
edge it changes telling me that i can

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.540 
edge it changes telling me that i can
reshape<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.849> like<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.949> when<00:00:31.949> i<00:00:31.980> reach<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
reshape it like so and when i reach a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.030 
reshape it like so and when i reach a
node<00:00:32.880> i<00:00:34.610> can<00:00:35.610> drag<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.880> like<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.230> what<00:00:37.890> i'm

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
node i can drag it like so so what i'm

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.790 
node i can drag it like so so what i'm
going<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.399> do<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.850> I'm<00:00:39.270> just<00:00:39.300> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.930> hold

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
going to do is I'm just going to hold

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.910 
going to do is I'm just going to hold
down<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.190> control<00:00:41.579> key<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:44.329> bring<00:00:45.920> another

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
down the control key and bring another

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.150 
down the control key and bring another
node<00:00:47.899> from<00:00:49.879> from<00:00:50.879> my<00:00:51.030> shape<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.860> as<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.980> can

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
node from from my shape and as you can

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.840 
node from from my shape and as you can
see<00:00:53.190> i<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.969> draw<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.739> as<00:00:55.739> many<00:00:56.100> nodes<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.670> I

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
see i can draw as as many nodes as I

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.039 
see i can draw as as many nodes as I
want<00:00:57.859> sorry<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.960> just<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.199> bring<00:01:01.620> my<00:01:01.920> mouse

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
want sorry I just have to bring my mouse

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:10.399 
want sorry I just have to bring my mouse
to<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.080> edge<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.010> shape<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:09.170> whenever<00:01:10.170> I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
to the edge of the shape and whenever I

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:18.110 
to the edge of the shape and whenever I
press<00:01:10.740> ctrl<00:01:11.340> key<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:14.119> just<00:01:15.119> take<00:01:16.110> another<00:01:16.409> node

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
press ctrl key I just take another node

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.350 
press ctrl key I just take another node
and<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:20.200> like<00:01:21.100> I<00:01:21.400> like<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.850> flash<00:01:22.060> drawing

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
and I like I like the flash drawing

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.950 
and I like I like the flash drawing
because<00:01:22.570> as<00:01:23.409> you<00:01:23.650> can<00:01:23.830> see<00:01:24.100> in<00:01:24.430> it<00:01:25.240> enables<00:01:25.810> me

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
because as you can see in it enables me

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:35.100 
because as you can see in it enables me
to<00:01:26.490> draw<00:01:27.490> these<00:01:28.060> smooth<00:01:29.050> shapes<00:01:29.650> and<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:34.110> it's

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
to draw these smooth shapes and and it's

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.350 
to draw these smooth shapes and and it's
kind<00:01:35.320> of<00:01:35.380> pretty<00:01:35.619> I<00:01:35.800> like<00:01:36.070> it<00:01:38.970> anyway<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.030> have

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
kind of pretty I like it anyway I have

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.649 
kind of pretty I like it anyway I have
no<00:01:40.570> idea<00:01:40.720> what<00:01:41.619> I'm<00:01:41.800> drawing<00:01:42.159> but<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:46.420> looks

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
no idea what I'm drawing but it looks

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.980 
no idea what I'm drawing but it looks
like<00:01:46.869> a<00:01:46.920> bad<00:01:47.920> man<00:01:48.190> or<00:01:48.310> something

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.200 

yep

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:07.620 

anyway<00:01:59.110> I<00:01:59.350> hope<00:01:59.860> you<00:01:59.920> find<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.430> useful<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:06.630> by

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
anyway I hope you find it useful and by

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.990 
anyway I hope you find it useful and by
the<00:02:07.690> way<00:02:07.930> if<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:08.289> wanna<00:02:08.560> if<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.580> want<00:02:09.850> to

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
the way if you wanna if you want to

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.059 
the way if you wanna if you want to
smooth<00:02:10.420> them<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:10.810> area<00:02:11.260> as<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.650> can<00:02:11.830> see

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
smooth them this area as you can see

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.160 
smooth them this area as you can see
there's<00:02:12.370> an<00:02:12.550> old<00:02:12.700> in<00:02:12.880> here<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.600> have<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.959> take

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
there's an old in here you have to take

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.690 
there's an old in here you have to take
that<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:17.020> white<00:02:17.230> arrow<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:18.100> path<00:02:18.310> selection

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
that the white arrow the path selection

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.690 
that the white arrow the path selection
tool<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.239> just<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.900> know<00:02:20.250> select<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:21.400> like

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
tool and just you know select this like

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.820 
tool and just you know select this like
so<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:23.709> can<00:02:23.920> just<00:02:24.040> delete<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:25.830> then

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
so and you can just delete it and then

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.020 
so and you can just delete it and then
i'm<00:02:27.730> taking<00:02:27.790> my<00:02:28.600> black<00:02:28.870> hair<00:02:29.050> again<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:30.030> no

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
i'm taking my black hair again and no

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.960 
i'm taking my black hair again and no
not<00:02:31.269> in<00:02:31.480> here<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:32.560> that's<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.489> deal<00:02:33.610> and

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
not in here so that's the deal and

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.840 
not in here so that's the deal and
that's<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.690> technique<00:02:35.530> i<00:02:35.769> hope<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.370> you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
that's the technique i hope that you

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.450 
that's the technique i hope that you
find<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.300> useful
