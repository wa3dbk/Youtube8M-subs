important has a wide-angle lens this is

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.969 
important has a wide-angle lens this is
quite<00:01:13.260> an<00:01:13.680> advantage<00:01:14.280> especially<00:01:15.979> after

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
quite an advantage especially after

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.429 
quite an advantage especially after
using<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.939> Canon<00:01:18.439> 895<00:01:19.439> camera<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.259> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
using a Canon 895 camera it this one is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.899 
using a Canon 895 camera it this one is
28<00:01:22.830> millimeters<00:01:24.020> mine<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.350> about<00:01:25.909> 37

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
28 millimeters mine was about 37

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.960 
28 millimeters mine was about 37
millimeters<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:30.950> get<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.369> friend

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
millimeters I think so get more friend

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.060 
millimeters I think so get more friend
more<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.450> your<00:01:33.600> friends<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> same<00:01:34.560> picture

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
more of your friends in the same picture

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.200 
more of your friends in the same picture
frame<00:01:37.820> definitely<00:01:38.820> an<00:01:38.880> advantage<00:01:40.759> other<00:01:41.759> than

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
frame definitely an advantage other than

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.880 
frame definitely an advantage other than
that<00:01:42.740> it's<00:01:43.740> quick<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.520> deploy<00:01:45.470> I'll<00:01:46.470> show<00:01:46.799> an

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that it's quick to deploy I'll show an

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.310 
that it's quick to deploy I'll show an
example<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.670> present<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.810> pop<00:01:49.590> button<00:01:50.040> here

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
example I present a pop button here

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.539 
example I present a pop button here
pressing

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.450 

sure<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:55.869> took<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.170> picture<00:01:56.469> II<00:01:56.500> took<00:01:57.399> the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
sure and it took the picture II took the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.249 
sure and it took the picture II took the
second<00:01:57.969> picture<00:01:58.149> now<00:01:58.619> so<00:02:00.000> yeah<00:02:01.109> it's<00:02:02.109> fast

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
second picture now so yeah it's fast

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.529 
second picture now so yeah it's fast
actually<00:02:05.259> is<00:02:05.530> taking<00:02:05.829> a<00:02:05.920> video<00:02:06.070> right<00:02:06.369> now

because it remembers that's the video
mode<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.879> had<00:02:10.119> that's<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.080> mode<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.319> wasn't

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
mode I had that's the mode that wasn't

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.940 
mode I had that's the mode that wasn't
before<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.900> can't<00:02:13.900> talk<00:02:14.140> about<00:02:14.349> that<00:02:14.680> later<00:02:16.950> and

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950

the camera above my head before the
before<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.280> screen<00:05:12.580> just<00:05:12.760> disappears<00:05:13.360> I'm

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
before the screen just disappears I'm

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:21.450 
before the screen just disappears I'm
used<00:05:14.680> to<00:05:14.830> a<00:05:18.330> -<00:05:19.330> to<00:05:20.080> us<00:05:20.229> displayed<00:05:20.800> I<00:05:20.979> can<00:05:21.220> rotate

with the a 95

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.159

so<00:05:23.940> viewing<00:05:24.940> angle<00:05:25.210> is<00:05:25.300> never<00:05:25.479> an<00:05:25.630> issue<00:05:25.810> by

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
so viewing angle is never an issue by

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.439 
so viewing angle is never an issue by
doing<00:05:26.680> all<00:05:26.800> that<00:05:26.949> other<00:05:27.130> cameras<00:05:27.729> do<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.180> better

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
doing all that other cameras do a better

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.110 
doing all that other cameras do a better
job<00:05:28.479> at<00:05:29.080> this<00:05:29.349> if<00:05:29.650> they<00:05:29.889> if<00:05:30.130> you<00:05:30.520> want<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:30.970> take

job at this if they if you want to take

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.029 
job at this if they if you want to take

things like that

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.810 
things like that
another<00:05:39.490> small<00:05:39.940> gripe<00:05:40.300> is<00:05:40.599> that<00:05:41.849> one<00:05:42.849> in

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
another small gripe is that one in

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
picture it is kind of like laggy but

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.320 
picture it is kind of like laggy but
still<00:05:54.350> usable<00:05:54.950> I<00:05:56.200> just<00:05:57.200> wish<00:05:57.410> it<00:05:57.500> was<00:05:57.710> faster

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
still usable I just wish it was faster

has digital image stabilization which is

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:39.790 
has digital image stabilization which is
not<00:06:33.740> effective<00:06:34.280> at<00:06:34.370> all<00:06:35.740> I'd<00:06:36.740> rather<00:06:37.070> just<00:06:38.800> not

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
not effective at all I'd rather just not

not effective at all I'd rather just not
use<00:06:40.220> the<00:06:41.050> shake<00:06:42.050> reduction<00:06:42.260> feature<00:06:42.830> as<00:06:43.310> it's

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
use the shake reduction feature as it's

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.750 
use the shake reduction feature as it's
called<00:06:46.930> when<00:06:47.930> taking<00:06:48.290> pictures<00:06:48.740> even<00:06:49.370> higher

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760 
called when taking pictures even higher

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.380 
called when taking pictures even higher
sensitivities<00:06:50.750> higher<00:06:51.230> ISOs<00:06:51.770> it<00:06:52.700> will<00:06:53.030> still

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
sensitivities higher ISOs it will still

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.650 
sensitivities higher ISOs it will still
be<00:06:53.660> able<00:06:54.380> to<00:06:54.910> have<00:06:55.910> a<00:06:56.000> picture<00:06:56.210> one<00:06:56.510> beat

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
be able to have a picture one beat

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.810 
be able to have a picture one beat
didn't<00:06:57.080> all<00:06:57.290> that<00:06:57.530> grainy<00:06:57.890> I<00:06:58.130> was<00:06:58.370> very

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 
didn't all that grainy I was very

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.480 
didn't all that grainy I was very
surprised<00:06:59.300> to<00:06:59.510> see<00:06:59.810> all<00:07:00.020> my<00:07:00.200> reviews<00:07:00.770> of<00:07:01.250> the

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
surprised to see all my reviews of the

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:11.250 
surprised to see all my reviews of the
canon<00:07:01.880> and<00:07:02.380> it's<00:07:04.540> very<00:07:05.540> good<00:07:06.520> noise<00:07:07.520> levels<00:07:08.710> so

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:11.260 
canon and it's very good noise levels so

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.610 
canon and it's very good noise levels so
yeah

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 
yeah

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.460 
yeah
you<00:07:14.310> might<00:07:14.490> as<00:07:14.580> well<00:07:14.660> take<00:07:15.660> pictures<00:07:16.199> with

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:16.470 
you might as well take pictures with

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:22.730 
you might as well take pictures with
your<00:07:18.080> with<00:07:19.080> your<00:07:19.110> cell<00:07:20.040> phone<00:07:20.630> with<00:07:21.630> the<00:07:22.169> high

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
your with your cell phone with the high

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.520 
your with your cell phone with the high
levels<00:07:23.220> of<00:07:23.430> noise<00:07:23.880> that<00:07:24.060> this<00:07:24.360> camera<00:07:24.840> puts

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.530 
levels of noise that this camera puts

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:31.390 
levels of noise that this camera puts
out<00:07:25.770> in<00:07:26.870> automatic<00:07:27.870> modes<00:07:29.120> so<00:07:30.120> it's<00:07:30.750> kind<00:07:31.080> of

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
out in automatic modes so it's kind of

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.370 
out in automatic modes so it's kind of
pointless<00:07:33.350> our<00:07:34.350> live<00:07:35.100> and<00:07:35.220> learn
