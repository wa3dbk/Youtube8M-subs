those<00:00:49.020> replace<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.680> belt<00:00:50.420> it's<00:00:51.420> okay<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:51.780> you

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
those replace the belt it's okay if you

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.520 
those replace the belt it's okay if you
have<00:00:51.899> surface<00:00:52.530> surface<00:00:53.190> cracks<00:00:54.289> but<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.410> an

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
have surface surface cracks but it's an

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.380 
have surface surface cracks but it's an
indication<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.190> worse<00:00:56.370> things<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> come<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.300> if

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
indication of worse things to come so if

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.020 
indication of worse things to come so if
you<00:00:57.480> find<00:00:57.690> those<00:00:58.370> keep<00:00:59.370> an<00:00:59.520> eye<00:00:59.609> out<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you find those keep an eye out on the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.689 
you find those keep an eye out on the
belt<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.710> then<00:01:01.710> after<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.100> check<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> belt

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
belt and then after you check the belt

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.410 
belt and then after you check the belt
you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.710> check<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> belt<00:01:05.040> deflection<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you can check the belt deflection and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.789 
you can check the belt deflection and
the<00:01:06.450> way<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.689> do<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.380> need<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.560> find

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the way you do that is you need to find

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.330 
the way you do that is you need to find
the<00:01:07.979> midpoint<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.610> belt<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:10.189> come<00:01:11.189> under

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the midpoint of the belt and come under

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.630 
the midpoint of the belt and come under
here<00:01:11.670> follow<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.510> belt<00:01:12.720> up<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.580> of

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
here follow the belt up you can kind of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.280 
here follow the belt up you can kind of
feel<00:01:14.790> where<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> belt<00:01:15.299> starts<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.780> go<00:01:15.930> up<00:01:15.960> on

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
feel where the belt starts to go up on

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.899 
feel where the belt starts to go up on
the<00:01:16.380> sprocket<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.520> kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> gauge

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the sprocket and you can kind of gauge

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.580 
the sprocket and you can kind of gauge
where<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.630> middle<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.049> sprocket

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
where that the middle of that sprocket

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.649 
where that the middle of that sprocket
is<00:01:19.740> major<00:01:20.580> from<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.030> point<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.630> about

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
is major from that point which is about

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.899 
is major from that point which is about
right<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:23.060> back<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.090> your<00:01:25.250> rear<00:01:26.250> axle<00:01:26.729> and

right here back to your rear axle and

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.760 
right here back to your rear axle and
then<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> midpoint<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> where<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.560> should

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
then the midpoint is where you should

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.980 
then the midpoint is where you should
measure<00:01:28.950> measure<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.759> belt<00:01:30.000> deflection<00:01:30.600> from

and 7/16 of an inch
which<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:31.409> I've<00:02:32.219> already<00:02:32.430> adjusted<00:02:32.909> it

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
which it is I've already adjusted it

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.830 
which it is I've already adjusted it
after<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.010> measure<00:02:35.219> it<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.549> one<00:02:35.760> spot<00:02:36.090> spin

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
after you measure it in one spot spin

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.709 
after you measure it in one spot spin
the<00:02:36.959> wheel<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.579> measure<00:02:38.579> it<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:38.969> three<00:02:39.629> or

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
the wheel and measure it in three or

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.190 
the wheel and measure it in three or
more<00:02:39.900> spots<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.769> should<00:02:40.980> be<00:02:41.129> you<00:02:41.760> should<00:02:41.790> get

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
more spots you should be you should get

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.250 
more spots you should be you should get
pretty<00:02:43.200> consistent<00:02:43.859> reading<00:02:44.870> I've<00:02:45.870> noticed

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
pretty consistent reading I've noticed

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.899 
pretty consistent reading I've noticed
that<00:02:46.409> some<00:02:46.650> spots<00:02:46.980> are<00:02:47.220> tighter<00:02:47.430> than<00:02:47.639> others

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
that some spots are tighter than others

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.479 
that some spots are tighter than others
but<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.239> should<00:02:48.419> all<00:02:48.629> I've<00:02:49.590> got<00:02:49.889> it<00:02:50.040> all<00:02:50.189> in

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
but it should all I've got it all in

00:02:50.489 --> 00:03:00.129 
but it should all I've got it all in
between<00:02:50.639> 3/8<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.419> 7/16<00:02:52.139> so<00:02:54.049> it's<00:02:55.049> all<00:02:55.230> good

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.110 

it's<00:03:01.139> a<00:03:01.230> little<00:03:01.260> bit<00:03:01.620> more<00:03:02.370> deflection<00:03:02.909> there

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
it's a little bit more deflection there

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.050 
it's a little bit more deflection there
but<00:03:03.299> it's<00:03:03.450> still<00:03:03.659> within<00:03:03.840> specs<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:05.060> then

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
but it's still within specs and then

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.409 
but it's still within specs and then
once<00:03:06.569> you<00:03:06.659> get<00:03:06.780> your<00:03:07.189> if<00:03:08.189> you<00:03:08.700> have<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:09.060> what

once you get your if you have to what

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:10.670 
once you get your if you have to what
you<00:03:09.540> measure<00:03:09.689> your<00:03:09.930> belt<00:03:10.139> if<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.349> have<00:03:10.500> to

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
change the deflection you want to come

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.409

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
the if you lower if you rotate this this

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:09.589 
the if you lower if you rotate this this
axle<00:04:06.419> counterclockwise<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:08.370> will<00:04:08.699> increase

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
axle counterclockwise it will increase

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.020 
axle counterclockwise it will increase
the<00:04:09.930> belt<00:04:10.259> deflection<00:04:10.829> and<00:04:11.009> if<00:04:11.729> you<00:04:11.849> rotate

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
the belt deflection and if you rotate

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.869 
the belt deflection and if you rotate
this<00:04:12.449> nut<00:04:12.750> clockwise<00:04:13.349> it<00:04:13.949> will<00:04:14.129> decrease<00:04:14.489> belt

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
this nut clockwise it will decrease belt

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.199 
this nut clockwise it will decrease belt
deflection<00:04:15.949> you<00:04:16.949> can<00:04:17.130> see<00:04:17.400> that's<00:04:17.880> it's

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
deflection you can see that's it's

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.649 
deflection you can see that's it's
eccentric<00:04:18.810> here<00:04:19.489> so<00:04:20.489> if<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.760> turn<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.389> to<00:04:21.510> the

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
eccentric here so if you turn it to the

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:22.730 
eccentric here so if you turn it to the
right

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
right

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.650 
right
going<00:04:22.919> to<00:04:22.979> push<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.340> axle<00:04:23.550> back<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:26.660> decrease

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
going to push the axle back and decrease

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.589 
going to push the axle back and decrease
deflection<00:04:28.289> and<00:04:28.740> then<00:04:29.550> that's<00:04:29.819> how<00:04:29.970> you<00:04:30.030> you

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
deflection and then that's how you you

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.570 
deflection and then that's how you you
make<00:04:31.229> your<00:04:31.410> adjustment<00:04:31.919> in<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.069> belt<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.460> go

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
make your adjustment in the belt and go

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.969 
make your adjustment in the belt and go
back<00:04:32.789> and<00:04:33.000> check<00:04:33.150> your<00:04:33.300> belt<00:04:33.569> belt<00:04:34.410> deflection

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
back and check your belt belt deflection

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.260 
back and check your belt belt deflection
once<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.250> got<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.490> within<00:04:35.639> specs<00:04:38.120> tighten<00:04:39.120> up

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
once you got it within specs tighten up

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.809 
once you got it within specs tighten up
tighten<00:04:39.539> up<00:04:39.960> this<00:04:40.139> axle<00:04:40.710> nut<00:04:40.889> it<00:04:41.430> should<00:04:41.669> be

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
tighten up this axle nut it should be

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.409 
tighten up this axle nut it should be
tightened<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.330> between<00:04:43.080> 95<00:04:43.560> and<00:04:43.800> 105
