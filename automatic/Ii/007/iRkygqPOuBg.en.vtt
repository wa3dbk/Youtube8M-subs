00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.419 

hey<00:00:00.870> it's<00:00:01.020> Jim<00:00:01.199> again<00:00:01.469> Delma<00:00:01.890> Mountain<00:00:02.129> custom

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
hey it's Jim again Delma Mountain custom

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.019 
hey it's Jim again Delma Mountain custom
models<00:00:02.790> so<00:00:03.510> I<00:00:04.130> previously<00:00:05.130> shot<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.549> video<00:00:05.759> of

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
models so I previously shot a video of

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.320 
models so I previously shot a video of
this<00:00:06.150> via<00:00:06.450> train<00:00:07.109> line<00:00:07.319> 6<00:00:07.649> 404<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:09.150> was

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
this via train line 6 404 and it was

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.290 
this via train line 6 404 and it was
kind<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.630> pulsing<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:10.920> took<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.370> apart<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:12.059> I

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
kind of pulsing so I took it apart and I

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.369 
kind of pulsing so I took it apart and I
repowered<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.200> with<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> Kaito<00:00:14.070> motor<00:00:14.750> it<00:00:15.750> still

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
repowered it with a Kaito motor it still

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.740 
repowered it with a Kaito motor it still
kind<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.430> pulses<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> little<00:00:18.210> bit<00:00:18.390> at<00:00:18.600> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
kind of pulses a little bit at the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.769 
kind of pulses a little bit at the
lowest<00:00:19.109> speeds<00:00:19.580> so<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:20.820> not<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.180> motor<00:00:21.420> and

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
lowest speeds so it's not the motor and

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.120 
lowest speeds so it's not the motor and
it's<00:00:22.619> not<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.869> DCC<00:00:24.869> because<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.500> still<00:00:25.800> kind

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
it's not the DCC because it still kind

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.509 
it's not the DCC because it still kind
of<00:00:26.220> pulse<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.609> little<00:00:26.849> bit<00:00:27.260> in<00:00:28.260> DC<00:00:28.920> mode<00:00:29.189> when<00:00:29.490> I

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
of pulse a little bit in DC mode when I

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.009 
of pulse a little bit in DC mode when I
just<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> motor<00:00:30.240> connected<00:00:30.779> directly

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
just have the motor connected directly

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.920 
just have the motor connected directly
to<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> track<00:00:32.040> wires<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> think<00:00:33.690> it's

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
to the track wires so I think it's

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.720 
to the track wires so I think it's
something<00:00:34.350> with<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.530> gearing<00:00:34.920> inside<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
something with the gearing inside of the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.319 
something with the gearing inside of the
trucks<00:00:35.969> which<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.300> can't<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:36.780> fix<00:00:37.280> but<00:00:38.329> why

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
trucks which I can't really fix but why

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.580 
trucks which I can't really fix but why
don't<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.540> take<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> look<00:00:40.140> at<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.379> really

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
don't we just take a look at this really

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.979 
don't we just take a look at this really
quick<00:00:46.430> and<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.850> set<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.360> flash<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
quick and this is set up to flash on the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:01:01.170 
quick and this is set up to flash on the
horn<00:00:49.550> okay<00:00:50.550> show<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.000> already

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.550 

but<00:01:02.180> it<00:01:02.270> does<00:01:02.450> run<00:01:02.660> smooth<00:01:03.080> with<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.350> Cato

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
but it does run smooth with the Cato

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.810 
but it does run smooth with the Cato
motor<00:01:03.830> in<00:01:04.010> it<00:01:04.600> but<00:01:05.600> hold<00:01:06.350> on<00:01:07.630> let<00:01:08.630> me<00:01:08.750> set<00:01:08.990> up<00:01:09.020> my

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
motor in it but hold on let me set up my

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.610 
motor in it but hold on let me set up my
step<00:01:10.820> speed<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:12.680> go<00:01:12.830> slower<00:01:13.250> here<00:01:14.470> put<00:01:15.470> it<00:01:15.560> in

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
step speed to go slower here put it in

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.090 
step speed to go slower here put it in
reverse

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.880 

there<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:22.880> could<00:01:23.030> see<00:01:23.240> it<00:01:23.560> at<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.680> lowest

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
there you could see it at the lowest

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.359 
there you could see it at the lowest
speeds<00:01:26.049> pulsing<00:01:27.049> a<00:01:27.140> little<00:01:27.380> bit<00:01:27.590> but<00:01:28.009> once<00:01:28.189> you

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
speeds pulsing a little bit but once you

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.810 
speeds pulsing a little bit but once you
get<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.640> up<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:28.820> about<00:01:29.509> right<00:01:30.430> track<00:01:31.430> speed

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
get it up to about right track speed

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.330 
get it up to about right track speed
it's<00:01:32.180> fine<00:01:33.430> so<00:01:34.430> I<00:01:35.409> was<00:01:36.409> reading<00:01:36.740> online<00:01:36.890> some

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
it's fine so I was reading online some

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.529 
it's fine so I was reading online some
people<00:01:37.369> were<00:01:37.700> saying<00:01:37.970> oh<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.920> can<00:01:40.190> motor

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
people were saying oh the the can motor

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.630 
people were saying oh the the can motor
needed<00:01:41.539> to<00:01:41.630> be<00:01:41.750> opened<00:01:42.170> up<00:01:42.320> but<00:01:42.860> that

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
needed to be opened up but that

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.690 
needed to be opened up but that
apparently<00:01:44.299> isn't<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.869> problem

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
apparently isn't the problem

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.730 
apparently isn't the problem
apparently<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.820> problem<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.630> gearing<00:01:48.500> or

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
apparently the problem is the gearing or

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.609 
apparently the problem is the gearing or
something<00:01:49.159> that<00:01:50.149> there's<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:50.479> resistance<00:01:51.470> in

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
something that there's a resistance in

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.219 
something that there's a resistance in
the<00:01:51.710> gearing<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.509> that's<00:01:53.509> what's<00:01:53.750> causing<00:01:53.960> it

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
the gearing and that's what's causing it

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:03.370 
the gearing and that's what's causing it
to<00:01:54.380> pulse<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:54.770> at<00:01:55.130> real<00:01:55.399> loss<00:01:55.640> speed<00:01:56.140> so

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.580 

and<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:04.100> is<00:02:04.250> at<00:02:04.430> 128<00:02:05.270> once<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.869> get<00:02:06.080> it<00:02:06.200> up<00:02:06.350> to

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
and this is at 128 once I get it up to

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:43.040 
and this is at 128 once I get it up to
about<00:02:07.580> 8<00:02:08.149> on<00:02:08.479> 128<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.709> runs<00:02:10.069> fine

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.430 

all<00:02:43.620> right<00:02:43.770> that's<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.280> thanks<00:02:44.790> for<00:02:45.440> watching

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
all right that's it thanks for watching

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.390 
all right that's it thanks for watching
and<00:02:47.240> I<00:02:48.240> have<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> batch<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.320> units<00:02:49.800> coming<00:02:50.070> up<00:02:50.220> I

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
and I have a batch of units coming up I

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.360 
and I have a batch of units coming up I
have<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.820> rock<00:02:51.030> island<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.600> 30c<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:53.160> going

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
have a rock island you 30c that is going

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.770 
have a rock island you 30c that is going
to<00:02:53.460> turn<00:02:53.610> out<00:02:53.760> really<00:02:53.910> nice<00:02:54.180> once<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.510> get<00:02:54.660> it

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
to turn out really nice once I get it

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.540 
to turn out really nice once I get it
all<00:02:54.900> weather<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.350> gonna<00:02:55.470> have<00:02:55.680> tsunami<00:02:56.310> sound

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
all weather is gonna have tsunami sound

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.190 
all weather is gonna have tsunami sound
it<00:02:56.700> as<00:02:56.820> well<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.660> should<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:57.840> up<00:02:57.990> in<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.170> next
