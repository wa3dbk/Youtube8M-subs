hey thanks for stopping by and taking a
look<00:00:05.040> at<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.490> Eco<00:00:05.850> harvester<00:00:06.480> eco<00:00:06.960> harvester

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
look at the Eco harvester eco harvester

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.970 
look at the Eco harvester eco harvester
is<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.280> combination<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.240> lake<00:00:10.080> weed<00:00:10.349> harvester

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
is a combination of lake weed harvester

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.780 
is a combination of lake weed harvester
as<00:00:11.190> well<00:00:12.059> as<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> skimmer<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.670> capable<00:00:14.670> of

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
as well as a skimmer and capable of

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.830 
as well as a skimmer and capable of
actually<00:00:15.000> pulling<00:00:15.540> plants<00:00:16.199> from<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.160> bottom

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
actually pulling plants from the bottom

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.570 
actually pulling plants from the bottom
as<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.900> can<00:00:19.080> see<00:00:19.500> there's<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.510> round<00:00:22.250> drum<00:00:23.250> that

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
as you can see there's a round drum that

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.540 
as you can see there's a round drum that
turns<00:00:24.050> as<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.320> turns<00:00:25.560> out<00:00:25.769> picture<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.220> kind<00:00:26.460> of

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
turns as it turns out picture it kind of

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.330 
turns as it turns out picture it kind of
like<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.699> ringer<00:00:27.630> washer<00:00:27.869> where<00:00:28.380> you've<00:00:28.529> got<00:00:28.800> it

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
like a ringer washer where you've got it

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.099 
like a ringer washer where you've got it
turning<00:00:29.939> against<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.330> opposite<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
turning against the opposite of the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.830 
turning against the opposite of the
compare<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.489> actually<00:00:32.640> grabs<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
compare and so it actually grabs the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.910 
compare and so it actually grabs the
weeds<00:00:34.640> debris<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.420> pulls<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.590> drops

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
weeds debris and pulls it up and drops

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.869 
weeds debris and pulls it up and drops
it<00:00:38.129> into<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> payload<00:00:38.879> area<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.670> see

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
it into the payload area and you can see

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.150 
it into the payload area and you can see
one<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.149> its<00:00:42.270> greatest<00:00:42.780> features<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.800> only

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
one of its greatest features the only

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.860 
one of its greatest features the only
place<00:00:44.399> you're<00:00:44.550> gonna<00:00:44.640> find<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.480> an<00:00:45.660> eco

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
place you're gonna find it is not an eco

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.319 
place you're gonna find it is not an eco
harvester<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:47.280> gonna<00:00:47.460> change<00:00:47.940> right<00:00:48.270> now

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
harvester it's gonna change right now

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.790 
harvester it's gonna change right now
from<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.820> harvester<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.110> ability<00:00:52.559> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
from a harvester to the ability to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.020 
from a harvester to the ability to
upload<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> moving<00:00:56.039> into<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.489> position

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
upload it so moving into that position

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.080 
upload it so moving into that position
just<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.890> turn<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.250> box<00:00:59.489> from<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
just like that turn on the box from the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.810 
just like that turn on the box from the
to<00:01:00.780> back<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.350> from<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> other<00:01:02.039> where<00:01:02.670> it's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
to back it up from the other where it's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.700 
to back it up from the other where it's
gonna<00:01:02.940> move<00:01:03.510> things<00:01:04.049> out<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:05.659> payload

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
gonna move things out of the payload

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.950 
gonna move things out of the payload
onto<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> conveyor<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.880> up<00:01:09.119> onto<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> waiting

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
onto the conveyor and up onto a waiting

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.350 
onto the conveyor and up onto a waiting
truck<00:01:12.560> with<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.159> couple<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.670> flips<00:01:14.970> know

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
truck with just a couple of flips know

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.749 
truck with just a couple of flips know
the<00:01:15.540> hydraulic<00:01:16.130> switches<00:01:17.130> you're<00:01:17.369> able<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
the hydraulic switches you're able to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.780 
the hydraulic switches you're able to
spin<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> around<00:01:19.100> put<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.130> back<00:01:20.400> into<00:01:20.610> position

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
spin it around put it back into position

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.740 
spin it around put it back into position
like<00:01:21.119> that

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
like that

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
like that
that<00:01:21.930> would<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.229> your<00:01:22.439> transport<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.250> you're

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
that would be your transport if you're

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.830 
that would be your transport if you're
going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.820> across<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.390> lake<00:01:24.540> long

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
going to be going across the lake long

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.480 
going to be going across the lake long
distance<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.409> would<00:01:25.619> keep<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
distance you would keep that up in the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.480 
distance you would keep that up in the
air<00:01:26.549> put<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.930> down<00:01:28.140> into<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> water<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.070> you

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
air put it down into the water and you

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.870 
air put it down into the water and you
this<00:01:31.030> is<00:01:31.180> actually<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:32.040> real-time<00:01:33.040> video<00:01:33.369> in

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
this is actually a real-time video in

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.350 
this is actually a real-time video in
other<00:01:34.000> words<00:01:34.330> that's<00:01:34.930> all<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:35.409> took<00:01:35.619> to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
other words that's all it took to

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.230 
other words that's all it took to
literally<00:01:37.360> spin<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:37.960> around<00:01:38.049> from<00:01:39.000> its<00:01:40.000> work

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
literally spin it around from its work

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.990 
literally spin it around from its work
mode<00:01:40.510> harvesting<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:42.010> its<00:01:42.130> offloading<00:01:42.820> and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
mode harvesting to its offloading and

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.100 
mode harvesting to its offloading and
back<00:01:43.450> times<00:01:44.940> obviously<00:01:45.940> in<00:01:46.060> this<00:01:46.240> video<00:01:46.630> we

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
back times obviously in this video we

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.930 
back times obviously in this video we
this<00:01:47.619> was<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:47.800> brand<00:01:48.070> new<00:01:48.190> unit<00:01:48.369> when<00:01:48.610> you<00:01:48.700> want

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
this was a brand new unit when you want

this was a brand new unit when you want
to<00:01:49.000> get<00:01:49.119> it<00:01:49.240> dirty<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.869> so<00:01:50.440> we're<00:01:50.649> not<00:01:50.770> using

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
to get it dirty and so we're not using

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.330 
to get it dirty and so we're not using
any<00:01:51.520> weeds<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.960> this<00:01:53.229> particular<00:01:53.740> video<00:01:53.979> but
