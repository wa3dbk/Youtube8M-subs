00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
probably know how this works every patch

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.130 
probably know how this works every patch
I<00:00:16.560> do<00:00:16.619> an<00:00:17.100> update<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.910> some<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.779> things<00:00:18.960> I

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
I do an update on some of the things I

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.349 
I do an update on some of the things I
think<00:00:19.170> are<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> most<00:00:19.650> important<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
think are the most important for the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.480 
think are the most important for the
hunter<00:00:21.689> class<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.500> if<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:22.859> not<00:00:23.100> hunter

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
hunter class so if you are not hunter

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.310 
hunter class so if you are not hunter
then<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.180> may<00:00:24.390> not<00:00:24.539> come<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.960> quite<00:00:25.289> handy

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
then this may not come in quite handy

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.290 
then this may not come in quite handy
for<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.250> I'll<00:00:26.369> mention<00:00:26.640> some<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
for you but I'll mention some of the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.990 
for you but I'll mention some of the
things<00:00:27.599> other<00:00:28.050> than<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.830> hunter<00:00:29.130> changes<00:00:29.550> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
things other than the hunter changes to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.200 
things other than the hunter changes to
benefit<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.929> puppet<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:32.160> first<00:00:32.430> up<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:33.180> have

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
benefit that puppet so first up we have

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.260 
benefit that puppet so first up we have
a<00:00:33.719> bit<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.620> nerf<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.850> hunter

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
a bit of a nerf going on with the hunter

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.619 
a bit of a nerf going on with the hunter
CC<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.070> not<00:00:38.370> surprising<00:00:38.610> because<00:00:39.210> they

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
CC this is not surprising because they

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.830 
CC this is not surprising because they
actually<00:00:39.780> wanted<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.410> nerf<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.540> scatter<00:00:42.540> trap

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
actually wanted to nerf the scatter trap

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.020 
actually wanted to nerf the scatter trap
dr<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.649> they<00:00:43.800> reverted<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.489> quite<00:00:44.760> rightly

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
dr but they reverted that quite rightly

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.430 
dr but they reverted that quite rightly
because<00:00:45.539> i<00:00:45.570> think<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.930> would<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.170> quite

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
because i think that would be quite

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.100 
because i think that would be quite
ridiculous<00:00:47.030> so<00:00:48.030> they've<00:00:48.210> gone<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.690> nerfing

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
ridiculous so they've gone for nerfing

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.260 
ridiculous so they've gone for nerfing
the<00:00:49.260> CC<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> pet<00:00:50.070> which<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.489> okay<00:00:51.090> because

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the CC of the pet which is okay because

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.479 
the CC of the pet which is okay because
they<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.050> know<00:00:52.079> their<00:00:52.320> ambitions<00:00:52.829> was<00:00:53.039> enough

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
they you know their ambitions was enough

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.260 
they you know their ambitions was enough
Hunter<00:00:54.300> CC<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.980> yeah<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.730> was<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:57.000> bit<00:00:57.239> of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
Hunter CC and yeah so that was a bit of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.779 
Hunter CC and yeah so that was a bit of
enough<00:00:57.480> another<00:00:57.809> change<00:00:58.140> coming<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.680> 5.3<00:00:59.579> is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
enough another change coming to 5.3 is

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.209 
enough another change coming to 5.3 is
that<00:01:00.090> hunters<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:00.570> get<00:01:00.870> 50<00:01:01.379> stable<00:01:01.949> slots

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
that hunters now get 50 stable slots

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.789 
that hunters now get 50 stable slots
instead<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.180> 20<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
instead of 20 as you can see on the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.130 
instead of 20 as you can see on the
screen<00:01:04.920> I've<00:01:05.220> got<00:01:05.369> two<00:01:05.700> pages<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.930> they<00:01:07.080> are

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
screen I've got two pages and they are

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.429 
screen I've got two pages and they are
just<00:01:07.439> full<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:07.979> completely<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.869> having<00:01:09.869> an

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
just full up completely so having an

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.660 
just full up completely so having an
extra<00:01:10.830> 30<00:01:11.100> slots<00:01:11.549> will<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.880> pretty<00:01:12.570> amazing

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
extra 30 slots will be pretty amazing

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.890 
extra 30 slots will be pretty amazing
primarily<00:01:14.670> because<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.270> don't<00:01:15.720> know<00:01:15.810> if

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
change that really caught my eye was

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.760 
change that really caught my eye was
that<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.340> 5.3<00:02:12.270> everybody<00:02:13.110> will<00:02:13.319> have<00:02:13.410> sick

eighty-five<00:02:14.070> percent<00:02:14.250> resilience<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:16.050> a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
eighty-five percent resilience this is a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.520 
eighty-five percent resilience this is a
good<00:02:16.860> change<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.730> my<00:02:18.060> opinion<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.780> good<00:02:19.290> side

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
good change in my opinion the good side

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.190 
good change in my opinion the good side
is<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:20.460> going<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.940> allow<00:02:21.060> PV<00:02:21.630> ears<00:02:21.930> to

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
is that it's going to allow PV ears to

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.750 
is that it's going to allow PV ears to
easily<00:02:22.740> get<00:02:22.980> back<00:02:23.280> into<00:02:23.490> pvp<00:02:24.110> as<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.920> now<00:02:26.280> you

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
easily get back into pvp as in now you

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.000 
easily get back into pvp as in now you
know<00:02:26.880> PV<00:02:27.300> ears<00:02:27.570> if<00:02:27.720> they<00:02:27.870> even<00:02:27.930> attempted<00:02:28.590> PvP

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
know PV ears if they even attempted PvP

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.890 
know PV ears if they even attempted PvP
and<00:02:29.040> went<00:02:29.340> into<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> battleground<00:02:29.910> they<00:02:30.720> would

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
and went into a battleground they would

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.850 
and went into a battleground they would
enter<00:02:31.320> combat<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.890> get<00:02:32.010> smashed<00:02:32.690> in<00:02:33.690> 5.3<00:02:34.260> they

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
enter combat and get smashed in 5.3 they

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.860 
enter combat and get smashed in 5.3 they
will<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.730> little<00:02:36.000> bit<00:02:36.210> more<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.600> chance

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
will have a little bit more of a chance

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.260 
will have a little bit more of a chance
and<00:02:37.170> therefore<00:02:37.710> have<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.340> chance<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.940> get

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
and therefore have that chance to get

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.900 
and therefore have that chance to get
gear<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:39.900> get<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.860> bit<00:02:41.100> more<00:02:41.280> comfortable<00:02:41.670> in

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
gear and get a bit more comfortable in

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.480 
gear and get a bit more comfortable in
PvP<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.570> if<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.260> happens<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.830> if<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.100> PvP

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
PvP and if that happens and if the PvP

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.300 
PvP and if that happens and if the PvP
community<00:02:45.000> gets<00:02:45.690> bigger<00:02:45.990> than<00:02:46.440> Blizzard<00:02:47.130> will

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
community gets bigger than Blizzard will

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.330 
community gets bigger than Blizzard will
give<00:02:47.820> PvP<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.420> bit<00:02:48.690> more<00:02:48.870> priority<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.770> ways<00:02:50.070> of
