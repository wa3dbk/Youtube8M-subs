00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
smells terrible it smells even worse

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.870

than<00:02:42.940> bleach<00:02:44.099> seriously<00:02:45.099> it<00:02:45.280> just<00:02:45.549> smells

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
than bleach seriously it just smells

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.110 
than bleach seriously it just smells
like<00:02:46.410> cat<00:02:47.410> pee<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:49.420> yeah<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.959> was<00:02:50.079> only<00:02:50.440> like

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
like cat pee but yeah it was only like

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.020 
like cat pee but yeah it was only like
less<00:02:52.120> than<00:02:52.420> 2<00:02:52.660> euros<00:02:53.139> for<00:02:53.680> one<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:54.100> those<00:02:54.310> boxes

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
less than 2 euros for one of those boxes

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.830 
less than 2 euros for one of those boxes
so<00:02:56.639> 2<00:02:57.639> boxes<00:02:58.450> was<00:02:59.400> not<00:03:00.400> even<00:03:00.670> 4<00:03:00.940> euros<00:03:01.359> can<00:03:01.780> you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
so 2 boxes was not even 4 euros can you

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.629 
so 2 boxes was not even 4 euros can you
believe<00:03:02.109> that<00:03:02.139> um<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:04.180> yeah<00:03:04.620> we<00:03:05.620> cannot<00:03:05.950> expect

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
believe that um so yeah we cannot expect

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.039 
believe that um so yeah we cannot expect
the<00:03:06.819> best<00:03:07.209> smell<00:03:07.569> I<00:03:07.930> guess<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.599> just<00:03:10.870> want

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
the best smell I guess and I just want

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.680 
the best smell I guess and I just want
to<00:03:11.139> see<00:03:11.560> what<00:03:12.160> this<00:03:12.340> would<00:03:12.880> turn<00:03:13.239> out<00:03:13.480> like

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
to see what this would turn out like

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.430 
to see what this would turn out like
it's<00:03:14.590> maybe<00:03:14.829> not<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.280> smartest<00:03:15.459> idea<00:03:15.970> but<00:03:16.660> you

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
it's maybe not the smartest idea but you

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.569 
it's maybe not the smartest idea but you
never<00:03:17.650> know<00:03:18.419> it's<00:03:19.419> not<00:03:19.660> as<00:03:19.930> liquidy<00:03:20.680> as<00:03:20.980> I

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
never know it's not as liquidy as I

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.360 
never know it's not as liquidy as I
thought<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.940> would<00:03:22.060> be<00:03:22.290> because<00:03:23.290> before<00:03:24.069> it

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
thought it would be because before it

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.050 
thought it would be because before it
just<00:03:24.870> got<00:03:25.870> everywhere<00:03:26.590> when<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.519> poured

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
just got everywhere when I poured

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.690 
just got everywhere when I poured
everything<00:03:28.389> together<00:03:28.750> because<00:03:29.349> it<00:03:29.739> was<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.220> lot

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
everything together because it was a lot

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.809 
everything together because it was a lot
more<00:03:30.730> liquid<00:03:32.250> than<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.280> thought<00:03:35.010> um<00:03:36.010> so<00:03:36.669> that

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
more liquid than I thought um so that

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.370 
more liquid than I thought um so that
was<00:03:36.970> kind<00:03:37.150> of<00:03:37.209> embarrassing<00:03:40.079> so<00:03:41.079> I'm

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
was kind of embarrassing so I'm

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.339 
was kind of embarrassing so I'm
basically<00:03:41.590> just<00:03:42.010> going<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.609> continue<00:03:43.349> with

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
basically just going to continue with

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.409 
basically just going to continue with
putting<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.859> die<00:03:45.040> on<00:03:45.250> my<00:03:45.400> head<00:03:45.669> and<00:03:45.910> rubbing<00:03:46.180> it

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
putting to die on my head and rubbing it

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.809 
putting to die on my head and rubbing it
in<00:03:46.569> and<00:03:46.840> stuff<00:03:47.049> like<00:03:47.260> that<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.769> then<00:03:48.549> when

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
in and stuff like that and then when

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.509
