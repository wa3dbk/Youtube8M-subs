00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
was too short but it doesn't matter

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.959 
was too short but it doesn't matter
because<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.630> only<00:01:54.780> really<00:01:55.140> need<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.740> right<00:01:56.700> so

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
because you only really need to right so

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.510 
because you only really need to right so
it<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> four<00:01:58.380> position<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.100> know<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.280> can

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
it is a four position you know you can

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.940 
it is a four position you know you can
put<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.930> any<00:02:00.930> position<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.439> want

the<00:03:51.870> tremor<00:03:52.230> or<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:53.670> hamon<00:03:54.000> cruiser<00:03:54.420> more

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
the tremor or the hamon cruiser more

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.590 
the tremor or the hamon cruiser more
because<00:03:55.320> it's<00:03:55.530> just<00:03:55.850> larger<00:03:56.850> size<00:03:57.060> handles

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
because it's just larger size handles

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.770 
because it's just larger size handles
now<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.500> tremor<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.370> assisted<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.390> lot<00:04:00.690> of

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
now the tremor is assisted a lot of

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.750 
now the tremor is assisted a lot of
people<00:04:01.019> don't<00:04:01.290> like<00:04:01.470> assisted<00:04:02.160> okay<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:02.549> if

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
people don't like assisted okay so if

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.420 
people don't like assisted okay so if
you're<00:04:02.940> not<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.209> fan<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.570> assisted<00:04:04.310> then<00:04:05.310> you

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
you're not a fan of assisted then you

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.030 
you're not a fan of assisted then you
might<00:04:05.610> want<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:05.940> go<00:04:06.090> with<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.140> CRKT

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
and also the speed safe assist does tend
