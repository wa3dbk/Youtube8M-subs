00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:16.390
 so many solutions solutions in residences 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:18.580
 modular delta containers presents 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.630
 an innovative idea for building 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.680
 civil 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.109
 the house that contains if the concept of 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.029
 contain widely accepted and 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.070
 approved in countries of Europe and 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.649
 North America arrives in Brazil 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.000
 bringing countless advantages to your 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.700
 consumers 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.090
 this type of construction is carried out in 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.640
 record time in three months is possible 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.050
 have a home that up to 200 meters 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.829
 squares 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.480
 besides the reduced cost up to 30% lower than 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.820
 a masonry house 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.120
 The container house project aims to 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.670
 sustainability and recycling their 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.699
 does not produce waste and the 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.250
 material waste is minimal 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.070
 practicality is also a strong point 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.619
 since the whole structure mounted on the 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.959
 ground in a single step 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.639
 minimizing labor problems 

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:17.619
 common in a conventional construction 

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:19.990
 the challenge of turning containers into 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.420
 a single family home was first 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.399
 break the paradigms of society that 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.389
 container house a cold house without 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.369
 identity 

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:29.289
 it is possible to have a home training 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.049
 functional and comfortable 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.869
 container in this house were used 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.630
 fiberglass drywall coatings 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.479
 in addition to hot material materials last 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.159
 market trend tissues project 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.789
 all those elements 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.590
 links have contributed to comfort 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.770
 extremely acoustic functionality 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.399
 comfortable 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.200
 the bold design of the building offers 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.409
 numerous possibilities of 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.320
 customization and finishing that allies 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.100
 the glazed bring 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.649
 families a comfort many times 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.929
 superior to that of a masonry house 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.150
 We opted for a container house. 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.209
 because it is much cleaner much more 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.980
 skilled workforce then 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.410
 everything ends much faster 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.120
 one of the coolest things that led me 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.090
 working with a container is the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.120
 two years ago I 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.360
 I was looking for an industrial language 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.310
 and I found it precisely with the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.470
 container construction researching 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.950
 solutions outside brazil 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.750
 another very important quest that I 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.730
 I found myself in the middle of this 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.860
 whole process is the question of 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.230
 sustainability that is inherent 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.010
 to use this 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.530
 structure 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.680
 you miss spending a lot of 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.120
 material that is unnecessary in this 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.790
 type of construction 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.540
 I do not use sand in brick use do not use 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.239
 cement or very little and how much 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.750
 to work this kind of structure and 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.579
 can position in different ways 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.700
 containers and the spaces that we 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:13.609
 can do with them 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.709
 in the delta the customer taken seriously and 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:19.519
 all projects follow standards 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.970
 safety and quality 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.829
 one day I decided to make a cottage and 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.700
 this cottage in a house 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:32.389
 conventional masonry and the result 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.060
 The end was that it cost me a lot to 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.940
 face because of rework that face 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.760
 because of the expensive material because the hand 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.560
 of work in the state available at the time 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.940
 I needed and it was not too 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.650
 qualified 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.379
 This was due to the growth in 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.689
 Brazil that everybody wanted 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:54.569
 I always thought there must be another 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:57.599
 way a better and cheaper way 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.750
 faster to do this. 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:04.109
 home and there we did this project in the house 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.959
 contain the innovative projects of the 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:09.739
 delta container has attracted every time 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.650
 the attention of the public and the media 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.810
 cheaper gets ready in less days than 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.220
 I 'm talking the different house made 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.199
 with containers 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.259
 engineers and architects say that the 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.330
 project is ecologically sustainable 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.400
 the metal boxes will now come 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.400
 offices and even houses of high standard 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.099
 in closed condominiums this house 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.770
 container for example has 220 meters 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:37.860
 square took 90 days to stay 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.710
 ready and cost 30 percent less than 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.750
 that a masonry house including a 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.690
 very nice suite that brings you a small 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.449
 library is the living room by the 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.410
 kitchen are conjugated the house is getting 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.810
 ready 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.349
 it would just be another good project. 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.770
 like it were not for one detail these 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:01.940
 walls here 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.940
