 the person who is concluding 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.130
 the whole bush process 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.400
 at the end of 96 hours and what has been with us he 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.970
 student could 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.060
 this get what's coming without the state certificate 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.880
 perfect week the foot the deficit in training 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.990
 in with that card the student could 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.760
 this 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.370
 work with a contractor who have the license c beltré need 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.300
 for how much more or less a person earns 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.040
 check that goes out into the field to work with this type of certification 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.090

 entering with a card 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.190
 if the card is not possible 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.850
 the reason is because the state requires that each 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.840
 this worker who has - who works in the hedge city needs to have these 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.220
 this certification 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.220
 hy this 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.509
 I suppose they are advised to 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:14.779
 O well 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:19.109
 work for a company ok so that they themselves start to be 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.259

 is yes to be able to have your own company I had four years in it 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.029
 in ee either in this field of electricity 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:34.829
 also to work for a company this is only they have who 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:35.879
 They had

 the afternoon 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:38.689
 d 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.209
 to learn what has been the basics of electricity 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.589
 and there it costs not to improve 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:45.449
 p 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.419
 now the mayor 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:49.359
 I suppose the 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.949
 Let's go to the 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.409
 the schedules or severe with your auction 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.319
 what schedules do you have available

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:26.309
 3 5 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:28.289
 east of the province 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.279

 The postal code is 9 0 2 0 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.609
 your escort by laboratory 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.800
 if we have in this area 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.060
 what has been a laboratory where they practice belonging 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.389
 in an interview on the electric tv 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.649
 install what is being master 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:54.929
 l electrical boxes and and the wire fence 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:56.489
 so 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.949
 what time do you dedicate to the practice or do you have theoretical and 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:05.779
 then the practice is young if what we want is this year 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.109
 the first hour 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.659
 it would be this one of practice 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.809
 martín ni and aranda 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:15.310
 in an hour and a half and the next third hour 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.169
 following the prat 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.169
 we do not have two or the practice and a puppet play 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:23.290
 how many people 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.469
 are by class or how you handle it 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:28.959
 percent people because we have those who are being or not 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.240
 n 12 people per class 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.120
 and this 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.360
 in shops of people we understand the laboratory where 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.430
 is also being practiced 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.759
 all right 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.330
 or how much it became known that we also have testimonies from students who 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.400
 they concluded their classes did not have their and itching and I speak because they already have with this 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.490
 low mocoa 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.059
 to defend the price 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:01.739
 is yes in all the files that we have to criticize this adn 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.069
 will have your testimony 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.729
 what is being n the website that we have that is this year 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.930
 the breast again 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.710
 in this point against pérez 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.490
 and the one that kissinger 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.550
 a stump 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.480
 and there you would find everything that has been the testimonies of 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:22.780
 address 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.870
 everyone who wants to know 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.090
 what for any question to which phone you plan to locate directly 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.529
 to you 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:30.879
 p 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:33.219
 today on stage 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:37.800
 maybe I would get a phone would be 3 2 3 at 2 2 8 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.770
 struck out one 2 8 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.960
 although for now they are in the angels 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.129
 promptly 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:44.439
 I think it's worth 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:48.389
 have other hawthorn endowments on most students 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.510
 in us we could wait in the future 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.270
 we have this in planes 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.360
 in no instant instant min 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.319
 nxp 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:03.860
 concretely soil already maintained the serve 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.960
 and that's what it takes to solve 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.919
 yes this happy panels this we have another laboratory 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.169
 one day we will have this year 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.949
 what is being 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.439
 in solar panels the motor control 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:21.189
 and this year 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:23.339
 and what has been 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:28.580
 percent change this ballasts dyn what they say or all kinds of light min 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.919
 government 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.919
 that kind of jobs are better paid 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.020
 ee 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.699
 what happens is that these need the student's needs to know all this 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.860
 the type of court need fields 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.919
 in the park not only will do with the pipeline 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:52.899
 all males had 

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:55.039
 and everything includes the same job ma 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.550
 maybe this is enough 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.410
 it was a commercial work for it estimated towers 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.520
 there will be lights then this one 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.640
 in vain are the staging is needed first 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:11.229
 After presenting a better preparation for Castilla y León the concept 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:12.210
 general 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.629
 banners that seeks to enhance would be more this 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:19.289
 high when you well know all these three eastern fields according to 

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:22.120
 in addition people cloth 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.389
 that bilingual 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:26.159
 that speaks english and they are in spanish 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:30.580
 now we have to walk we saw in Spanish that can extend by having 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.330
 me Spanish for 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.860
 they start at the mayor 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.060
 and in the future and even if they have what is not 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:43.580
 are this pattern 1800 hours in this line c 

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.479
 the professional glass 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:48.289
 who can get your certificate said crime 

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:53.889
 I saw this with that of g this license and apollinate before the bosom of 28 38 

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:55.569
 ucr 

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:58.580
 olé those fools we move in the boat 

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.320
 another person s 

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.130
 the sector 

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:01.590
 cake
