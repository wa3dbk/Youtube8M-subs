haven't tried this with just the
original<00:00:21.300> I'm<00:00:21.570> sure<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.810> would<00:00:21.930> work<00:00:22.050> also<00:00:22.260> and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949

kind<00:04:30.479> of<00:04:30.510> random<00:04:30.660> something<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.620> do<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.889> game

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
kind of random something to do the game

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.659 
kind of random something to do the game
programming<00:04:32.610> see<00:04:33.449> it's<00:04:33.600> still<00:04:33.810> guy<00:04:33.990> here<00:04:34.669> one

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
programming see it's still guy here one

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.640 
programming see it's still guy here one
time<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:35.910> was<00:04:36.120> holding<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.540> guy<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:36.960> he

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
time I was holding the guy and he

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.700 
time I was holding the guy and he
actually<00:04:38.250> turned<00:04:38.610> into<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:39.000> mechanic<00:04:39.590> it<00:04:40.590> was

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
actually turned into a mechanic it was

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.170 
actually turned into a mechanic it was
interesting<00:04:41.220> I<00:04:41.340> wish<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.610> could<00:04:41.760> replicate

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
interesting I wish I could replicate

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.029 
interesting I wish I could replicate
that<00:04:42.660> but<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:42.840> don't<00:04:43.110> know<00:04:43.260> exactly<00:04:43.380> how<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.770> did

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
that but I don't know exactly how I did

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.640 
that but I don't know exactly how I did
it<00:04:45.860> anyways<00:04:46.860> uh<00:04:46.889> like<00:04:47.669> I<00:04:47.789> said<00:04:47.850> you<00:04:48.060> can<00:04:48.650> use

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
it anyways uh like I said you can use

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.040 
it anyways uh like I said you can use
this<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:50.010> move<00:04:50.160> around<00:04:50.310> the<00:04:50.580> parks<00:04:51.050> whatever

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
this to move around the parks whatever

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.080 
this to move around the parks whatever
I'm<00:04:52.979> sure<00:04:53.160> there's<00:04:53.370> other<00:04:53.520> things<00:04:53.610> you<00:04:53.910> can

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
I'm sure there's other things you can

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.000 
I'm sure there's other things you can
exploit<00:04:54.539> but<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.139> haven't<00:04:55.560> figured<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:55.889> out

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
exploit but I haven't figured that out

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.770 
exploit but I haven't figured that out
yet<00:04:57.320> if<00:04:58.320> you<00:04:58.440> go<00:04:58.530> like<00:04:58.650> this<00:04:58.889> it's<00:04:59.160> gonna<00:04:59.720> go<00:05:00.720> to

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
yet if you go like this it's gonna go to

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.180 
yet if you go like this it's gonna go to
the<00:05:00.870> edge<00:05:00.990> of<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.199> park<00:05:01.410> cuz<00:05:01.590> there's<00:05:01.919> no<00:05:01.979> one

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
the edge of the park cuz there's no one

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.740 
the edge of the park cuz there's no one
there<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.729> I'll<00:05:02.940> show<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.330> error<00:05:03.510> if<00:05:03.690> you

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
there and I'll show you the error if you

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.060 
there and I'll show you the error if you
try<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.050> click<00:05:04.229> on<00:05:04.380> some<00:05:04.560> of<00:05:04.620> this<00:05:04.710> not<00:05:04.860> there

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
try to click on some of this not there

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.580 
try to click on some of this not there
it<00:05:05.250> gives<00:05:05.370> us<00:05:05.550> an<00:05:05.669> exception<00:05:06.150> raised<00:05:06.389> and<00:05:06.930> the

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
it gives us an exception raised and the

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.100 
it gives us an exception raised and the
game<00:05:07.800> crashes<00:05:08.449> anyways<00:05:09.449> that's<00:05:09.690> it<00:05:09.810> I<00:05:10.020> just

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
game crashes anyways that's it I just

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.810 
game crashes anyways that's it I just
thought<00:05:10.410> that<00:05:10.470> was<00:05:10.650> kind<00:05:10.710> of<00:05:10.860> cool<00:05:11.039> and<00:05:11.460> maybe

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
thought that was kind of cool and maybe

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.460 
thought that was kind of cool and maybe
someone<00:05:12.330> else<00:05:12.389> will<00:05:12.570> not<00:05:12.720> try<00:05:12.960> it<00:05:12.990> anyway<00:05:13.410> so

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
someone else will not try it anyway so

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.000 
someone else will not try it anyway so
let<00:05:13.710> me<00:05:13.770> know<00:05:13.889> what<00:05:13.979> you<00:05:14.039> think<00:05:14.190> thanks
