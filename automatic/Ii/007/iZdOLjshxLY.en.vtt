from<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.439> holiday<00:02:07.740> party<00:02:08.209> but<00:02:09.209> kind<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.780> I

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
from the holiday party but kind of I I

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.510 
from the holiday party but kind of I I

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
see it as the kind of replacing it but

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.040 
see it as the kind of replacing it but
maybe<00:02:11.879> that's<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.180> good<00:02:12.209> thing<00:02:12.510> because<00:02:12.690> maybe
