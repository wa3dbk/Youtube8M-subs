00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.589
 I said there I'm sixth and today I'll talk 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.429
 all about ram 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.429
 as well 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:26.430
 more than one animal frog would be higher revenue 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.830
 is a fish that stores several chips 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.070
 want more and not large amounts of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.570
 memory because the short time 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.670
 for example when we open a 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.570
 internet browser such as chrome or 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 firefox 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.739
 you click a copy of the hair is archived 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.840
 in ramp memory than the processor 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.840
 process and open the application and you 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.170
 You get to vote on a good analogy of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.940
 It's better if you imagine that a table 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.969
 have the pencils to pen notebook to desk 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.510
 would be dead than the basis of everything she 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.729
 You'll command everything you go on base. 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.420
 the computer because it brings together 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.290
 all and sex with 116 tried me 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.150
 understanding that it is a thing now when 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.880
 there is a lack of ram 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.880
 programs can not open and can then 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.759
 very chic you have to think what the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.340
 What am I going to do with my computer? 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.829
 I'll watch videos on youtube open half 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.290
 many years, then you need to 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.590
 memory now if you go 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.619
 to judge and do health video editing 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.939
 to a heavier thing edit focus 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.720
 You will need large quantities. 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.689
 the home household and handle means 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.399
 of a video of heaven I recommend 12 days 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.770
 at most now 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.939
 in the 2010 edition and can therefore even 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.939
 eight that is enough 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.829
 ahem in the motherboard manual because you 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.280
 always want to see what kind of memory 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.280
 ram 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.280
 What is the technology used only board 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.900
 for example there is one of r 2 thousand of 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.720
 r keys apple what is real difference of r 2 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.270
 thousand of r 15 then the real difference is 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.880
 who currently will only hire r 3 more 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.250
 back today the difference is that he has 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.209
 a technology with faster speed 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.250
 faster than r 2 and a 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.370
 oxygen and putin before I believe 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.560
 I've never seen r 2 doing it but it takes 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.510
 this speed while everything is equal 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.150
 change speed increase quantity 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.670
 weight for 40 days and nights faster 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.950
 than paint and pain not what happens 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.959
 here it does not matter how much you were the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.360
 computer will not be faster than 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.090
 may be is that your computer more 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.360
 faster than the speed of the sister in a 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.500
 city ​​that is access to information 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.050
 play the processor 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.420
 so let's assume you have one of 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.680
 800 megahertz and another one of 1,333 6 straight 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.350
 admitted that in addition to amusing and maya 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.950
 harrison is faster here than 800 in 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:24.480
 network is not so remarkable so a 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:26.970
 thing more vaccinated more subtle but it has 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.480
 a difference in which was why 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.269
 Do you have a house in the neighborhood of 2005? 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.310
 Did you get this speed business? 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.920
 but what has been the xenon popcorn 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.830
 chelsea spoke a little obscure business is 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.739
 very 5 from tihany to set here two 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.810
 memory breasts work as if they were 2 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.670
 but twice as fast because they 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.370
 the states simultaneously as per 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.120
 Quick example and do nonsense from here 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.940
 two plate 2 gigas at 1,556 naia raps 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.769
 When you put it out of the hotel, it will turn 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:05.209
 two fish only they did not stop 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.209
 simultaneously piran 2333 megahair 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.680
 understood then you have a speed 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.030
 and on the intel motherboards of the socket 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.720
 rg 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.760
 you had to pull lyon 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.640
 it would be this type channel is something that 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.739
 douch three times faster and who says 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.960
 It's cool to say it's faster than 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.960
 It says coolest you agree with me. 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.590
 This is the shooting drama having a lighting 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.470
 Professional you can adjust the 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.280
 lighting top gun kids like 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.280
 professional lighting 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:05:04.150
 ué ué in clear memory manual does not 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:10.270
 complicates 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:14.530
 I recommend do not blame it because it is 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:17.290
 cheap very cheap not worth it you 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:21.430
 I really want you to finish 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:24.220
 using both it will end up getting 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.720
 most absolute that I recommend to you 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.020
 There is Joseph, he does not see any need. 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.090
 initial day goes on today if people 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.120
 realize that there are just eight more 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.520
 gigas with four plus 12 does not matter 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.430
 It has been understood, thank you very much, that 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.460
 watched so far so if you are 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.050
 watching for the first time and liked 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.050
 even liked 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.320
 if you already wrote on the channel and liked the 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.640
 content or will be enrolled does not 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.200
 also included the content of the 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:04.270
 for an abortion leave here jewelry and the coupon 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.680
 leave the favorite too so if 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.390
 Do you help me with the evaluation and 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.120
 Video disclosure share it with your 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.330
 facebook friends and twitter and old 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.250
 of the unique video I made for 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.360
 very cool ebook hotels 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.280
 so this is coming with me 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.280
 and what is the
