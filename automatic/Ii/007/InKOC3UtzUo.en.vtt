00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello in today's chapter we're going to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.509
 explain how holes open up how 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.849
 makes a gap between two planes or 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.320
 beginning of a sequence or in place 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.190
 that we want within the line of 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.559
 apte time first of all 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.949
 let's tell you what is the simplest 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.080
 how to open a hole at the beginning of the 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.869
 sequence imagine that I want to put 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.849
 a black hole before it starts all 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.370
 my sequence is as easy as 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.460
 press right button on the timeline 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:37.060
 and choose the rent option to start 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.760
 add fill at the beginning we press 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.470
 and you see that he has dragged me all 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.810
 clips and has left a gap 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.370
 beginning of the sequence this gap does not 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.070
 it has to be always the same 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.870
 duration we can change it 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.170
 pressing right button let's do 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.629
 first control z 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.199
 and press the right button timeline 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.199
 settings 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.370
 and here in the option to be and the vegetable 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.280
 Zion 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.390
 we can say for example that instead 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.860
 of 30 seconds be five seconds 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.260
 press ok 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.970
 we say it again with the right button 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.970
 pin start 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.270
 and you see that now the duration is 5 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.880
 seconds if we wanted for example 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.150
 open a gap of two seconds between 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.210
 these two planes 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.000
 we would have to do something different 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.240
 we come to the player and click on this 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.240
 eyelash 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.520
 and press float filler load fill 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:49.079
 by pressing loud filler 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:54.000
 what we do is load a clip that 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:57.430
 has the video in black and the audio null 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.080
 then we get the amount 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.870
 with control we bet 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.260
 and here we tell you to see if we want a 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.899
 exact duration of two seconds per 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.190
 we will have to give entry point and 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:18.070
 press more on a numeric keypad 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.540
 press + 200 click on the keyboard 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.629
 numeric 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.390
 and we would place two more seconds 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.879
 go ahead if we see here we open this 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.219
 tab and we see the duration we see that 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:34.870
 he has put us 201 because this is because 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:38.360
 has added to the frame in which 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.840
 we were two seconds with which 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.210
 we had to remove one we go to go 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.580
 to bout with which we would go to the point 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.610
 of departure 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.420
 we go back one frame or with the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.450
 cursors or with this button and 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.240
 we press again one of the exit by the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.000
 key 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.000
 now we would have exactly two seconds 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.390
 and now we press the key we would go down 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.890
 this gap to the timeline 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.400
 6 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.980
 now we have an exact hole here 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.980
 to see him here opening in out 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.110
 and will cover key from the 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.240
 beginning at the end of the hole we press the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.290
 t key 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.460
 you see that we have a gap of 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.920
 seconds 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.690
 other forms of open space for 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.300
 it is simply linking to the cursor 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.520
 but it is not as accurate as with the 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.470
 load filler option 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.920
 If you want, we open another hole 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.210
 here this time we can do it 3 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.000
 seconds 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.540
 you know what it is 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.030
 opening this easy tab with the key 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.710
 that we can go to the point of entry 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.690
 more press on the keypad will 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.580
 we say 300 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.860
 we back one frame 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.310
 and press exit 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.710
 three seconds and we can already 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.200
 lower the hole 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.250
 in the next chapter we will start with 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.250
 the audio tools
