 the rage team increase subscribers small to 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.760
 small so do not hesitate to think about it 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.800
 it's really super important 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.700
 today which will pack news 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.920
 of call of duty 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.129
 so be aware that during the conference of 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.890
 the e3 in los angeles microsoft so the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.340
 xbox developer has announced everything 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.160
 simply that old xbox games 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.470
 360 to bring them out on xbox one for 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.720
 all the people who had had the 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.520
 game for example on xbox 360 and who 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.610
 had sold their xbox 360 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.649
 when they bought the xbox one what 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.630
 is quite logical so there they have 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.119
 they will simply stand out 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.979
 old xbox 360 games on xbox oise 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.350
 which is a very good thing microsoft 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.810
 but here activists have advanced other 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.469
 thing because normally what says 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.210
 the xbox 360 games on xbox one says 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.639
 that the old call of duty to the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.350
 come out on xbox one but I do not think 

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:27.389
 not remasterise way ie 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.420
 that he would come out on xbox one 

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:31.619
 but with their qualities of old 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.990
 consoles ie the game was going 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.780
 to be like you could know him on 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.119
 xbox 360 or on playstation 3 and le 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.649
 come out with the same quality on xbox 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.939
 zone which was not necessarily the 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.429
 best idea that is their activism 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.709
 thought a lot for just 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.479
 remastered their game so that is to say 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:51.240
 for example that kd mona finally black 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.189
 ops modern warfare 3 and black ops the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.600
 remaster them ie they 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.719
 are going to rework them at the level of the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.639
 quality can be improved the engine 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.189
 graph etc so that the game can 

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:04.679
 to be up to date and that he can 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.539
 just keep in mind that he 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.130
 had at the time but with 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.740
 new graphics it's really going with 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.959
 the goal of activision then it's going to be 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.180
 on the verge of being confirmed on 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.680
 playstation 4 and on xbox donkeys 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.110
 so I'll admit that when milestones 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.849
 when I heard that this xbox europe 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.230
 on us the old games were going 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.670
 come out on xbox one I was 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.140
 totally disgusted I say to myself but 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.810
 playstation 4 the guys are coming out and the 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.790
 new colleagues 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.440
 ti on playstation 4 finally the old ones 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.520
 as in the Caribbean on iphone 4 and 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.410
 then there was no new step 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.450
 expected passengers I searched for and 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.069
 actually activists have so no 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.900
 announced that they laughed hundreds of 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.880
 just think a new 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.050
 years out and a call of duty this 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.489
 are the new consoles 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.500
 do you think it can be 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.190
 a good idea do not hesitate to put me 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.260
 that in the comments 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.650
 and especially tell me which game among 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.650
 modern code 4 finally black ops or in 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.440
 date wa modern warfare 3 and black ops 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.480
 what games do you want on new 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.310
 console we really want to have a small 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.280
 poll and so on and we can 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.049
 possibly transmit activition 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.160
 France so here is not hesitate to put 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.989

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.430
