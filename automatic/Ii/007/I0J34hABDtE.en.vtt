00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.010
 as you can see in the title of this 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.690
 video is about how to make one of the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.269
 reactor and good first thing 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.720
 we need is 15 collection is where 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.510
 four gold blocks six ingots 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.769
 iron and three diamonds good if they want 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.300
 know how to get this these four 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.279
 Gold blocks can go to me 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.739
 list of videos and there it will appear as 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.760
 multiply your things in minecraft 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.340
 pocket edition and now good what 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.239
 we need is kraft already the network cne 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.340
 that we put in a casting table and here 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.860
 down the stairs will be the cne 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.890
 from the good rector what we did as 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.649
 you can see you need three diamonds 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.640
 six of 'iron and good we're planning and 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.090
 we already have our 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.910
 the rest 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.170
 well what we need is also 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.420
 have our inventory a bit empty 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.799
 because many of you will know that the 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.799
 cne of the reactor loose things but this 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.830
 is 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.050
 Now I do want 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.940
 now we go to a place where you can not 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.150
 see because as you can see here I am 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.360
 building in good house a few away from 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.360
 here 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.980
 in fact already 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:40.080
 I've already done in the reactor and well let's go 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.920
 draft 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.229
 i 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.780
 is that if you do it very close to your house 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.840
 You can also destroy it because it covers 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.020
 a good space 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.390
 and well here what you can see is a 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.870
 detractor and as I told you covers a good 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.380
 space 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:04.620
 Well, I think we're going to do it here 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.620
 here and good now of acm une at night 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.940
 then let's put some black 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.849
 let's leave here and well the first thing is 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:19.020
 put the four blocks of good gold 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:24.210
 we are going to put them this way 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:28.410
 in obvious square then here we go to 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:32.490
 put 1 arrive pass a block 1 after 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.350
 they let another block 1 pass and they let pass 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.380
 another block 1 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.960
 in this way it has to stay like this 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.420
 a cross 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.000
 with cross and good in the middle we're going to 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.000
 put the collection yes 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.580
 or vice versa they can also first 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:56.360
 put it as a ribbon 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.950
 which is here and then put the 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.020
 gold blocks and good the next thing that 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.100
 let's do is put the middle reactor 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.410
 here 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.590
 sorry the piquetero is already when 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.940
 well then let's put col are 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.840
 up here from the gold blocks 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.690
 I am the 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.560
 now the following we are going to put a 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.720
 block above the reactor cne 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.530
 then in front of the block we are going to 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.760
 put another one here 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.760
 and another one here 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.730
 and other 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:40.689
 in this way it has to be like 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:45.250
 I said the four gold blocks under the 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:48.519
 cross lay on top of the blocks above 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.719
 of the gold blocks put the collision 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.280
 and above they form a cross but first 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:55.740
 they have to put the block in the middle 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.390
 flow 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.280
 now a guy if they want to recover their 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.670
 gold blocks it 's good to be stung 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.420
 with a peak of a and it is good to be stung 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:13.200
 to the button to that yellow that is there with 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:18.570
 one with a peak and then later 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:23.290
 remove them good now removed him I remove it 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:28.690
 Remove it or if you want it 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:32.440
 it's a century of reach and good 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.040
 now I start to drop things I do not know 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.340
 why 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:41.670
 although already and so we started collecting them 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:46.300
 I put them on facebook for what 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:50.180
 so they put us the zombies pigments 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.280
 good is for times until they run out 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.350
 as you can see it's obsidian and you 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.770
 turns into rock and good they have 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:02.110
 those three as three times for what 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.919
 to leave 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:12.650
 and I put and have until it goes out 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:16.400
 to collect all the things like that 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.350
 and if they do not collect them in time 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.770
 good is not going to serve 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:26.280
