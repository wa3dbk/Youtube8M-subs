00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
there is another type of addressing

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.140 
there is another type of addressing
system<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.740> use<00:01:16.890> called<00:01:17.220> dynamic<00:01:17.729> DNS

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
system you can use called dynamic DNS

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.210 
system you can use called dynamic DNS
but<00:01:18.860> this<00:01:19.860> process<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:21.020> there's<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.220> there's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
but this process is there's just there's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.859 
but this process is there's just there's
too<00:01:23.340> many<00:01:23.460> variables<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.420> process

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
too many variables in this process

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.350 
too many variables in this process
already<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.310> show<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.850> how<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> do

already and if we show you how to do

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.350 
already and if we show you how to do
dynamic<00:01:27.570> DNS<00:01:28.460> it's<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.030> introduce

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
dynamic DNS it's just want to introduce

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.569 
dynamic DNS it's just want to introduce
so<00:01:30.540> many<00:01:30.720> more<00:01:30.930> variables<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.710> also<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.400> top

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
so many more variables and also on top

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.640 
so many more variables and also on top
of<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.820> not<00:01:33.420> all<00:01:33.630> rulers<00:01:34.020> will<00:01:34.229> support

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
of that not all rulers will support

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.069 
of that not all rulers will support
certain<00:01:35.520> types<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:36.900> gets

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
certain types of it and it just gets

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.539 
certain types of it and it just gets
very<00:01:37.140> complicated<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:37.890> we're<00:01:38.009> only<00:01:38.250> showing

would mean that it would the last three

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.060 
would mean that it would the last three
digits<00:02:26.540> would<00:02:26.870> actually<00:02:27.170> be<00:02:27.290> zero<00:02:27.620> one<00:02:27.860> two

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
connection picture quality would be

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.050 
connection picture quality would be
better<00:04:36.409> there<00:04:36.680> won't<00:04:36.830> be<00:04:36.889> frame<00:04:37.159> drops<00:04:37.520> things

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
better there won't be frame drops things

basically<00:04:48.139> just<00:04:48.710> trying<00:04:49.129> to<00:04:49.219> see<00:04:49.370> how<00:04:49.400> well

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
basically just trying to see how well

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.249 
basically just trying to see how well
the<00:04:49.819> tree<00:04:50.000> G<00:04:50.210> worked<00:04:50.449> there<00:04:50.900> were<00:04:50.990> some

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
the tree G worked there were some

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:52.570 
the tree G worked there were some
locations<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:51.830> actually<00:04:52.310> worked<00:04:52.490> really

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
locations that actually worked really

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.189 
locations that actually worked really
well<00:04:52.819> but<00:04:53.150> then<00:04:53.300> there<00:04:53.449> was<00:04:53.509> other<00:04:53.689> locations

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
well but then there was other locations

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.719 
well but then there was other locations
we<00:04:54.319> just<00:04:54.530> couldn't<00:04:54.710> even<00:04:54.979> connect<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.610> know

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
we just couldn't even connect you know

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.129 
we just couldn't even connect you know
we<00:04:55.909> were<00:04:55.969> only<00:04:56.060> getting<00:04:56.419> one<00:04:56.569> or<00:04:56.750> two<00:04:56.870> bars

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
we were only getting one or two bars

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.129 
we were only getting one or two bars
basically<00:04:57.889> are<00:04:58.550> them<00:04:58.789> tray<00:04:59.180> G<00:04:59.360> signal<00:04:59.810> and<00:05:00.020> it

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
basically are them tray G signal and it

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.240 
basically are them tray G signal and it
just<00:05:00.319> wouldn't<00:05:00.469> work<00:05:00.620> so<00:05:00.830> you're<00:05:01.099> always

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
just wouldn't work so you're always

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.869 
just wouldn't work so you're always
better<00:05:01.550> to<00:05:01.639> use<00:05:01.789> a<00:05:02.919> Wi-Fi<00:05:03.919> if<00:05:04.189> we're<00:05:04.610> available

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:04.879 
better to use a Wi-Fi if we're available

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.790 
better to use a Wi-Fi if we're available
but<00:05:05.419> you<00:05:05.569> know<00:05:05.689> the<00:05:05.930> fact<00:05:06.139> that<00:05:06.199> tree<00:05:06.469> G<00:05:06.650> is

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
but you know the fact that tree G is

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.529 
but you know the fact that tree G is
available<00:05:07.340> it<00:05:07.460> can<00:05:07.669> be<00:05:07.849> handy<00:05:08.120> in<00:05:08.210> certain

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
available it can be handy in certain

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.529 
available it can be handy in certain
situations<00:05:09.469> so<00:05:10.099> that's<00:05:10.310> basically<00:05:10.789> and<00:05:11.240> how

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
situations so that's basically and how

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.230 
situations so that's basically and how
you<00:05:11.599> configure<00:05:12.169> at<00:05:12.439> the<00:05:12.740> KMI<00:05:13.279> app<00:05:13.490> on<00:05:13.729> your

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
you configure at the KMI app on your

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.689 
you configure at the KMI app on your
iPhone<00:05:14.659> and<00:05:14.960> to<00:05:15.620> access<00:05:16.039> your<00:05:16.699> DVR<00:05:17.150> remotely
