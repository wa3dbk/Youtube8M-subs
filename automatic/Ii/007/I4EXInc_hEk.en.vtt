I made cordon bleu with fried potatoes

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.160 
I made cordon bleu with fried potatoes
and<00:01:11.010> peas<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.450> again<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.810> another

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and peas and this again is another

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.230 
and peas and this again is another
family<00:01:13.409> favorite<00:01:13.770> that's<00:01:14.250> simple<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.820> it's

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
family favorite that's simple to do it's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.910 
family favorite that's simple to do it's
not<00:01:15.420> fried<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> actually<00:01:16.290> make<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> oven

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
not fried I actually make it in the oven

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
not fried I actually make it in the oven
so<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.280> makes<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.790> healthier<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.810> kind

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
so it makes it a healthier of the kind

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990 
so it makes it a healthier of the kind
of<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.080> layer<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.470> options<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.640> makes<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
of a layer of options so it makes it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.999 
of a layer of options so it makes it
better<00:01:21.119> than<00:01:21.390> frying<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.380> you're<00:01:22.650> here

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
better than frying it but if you're here

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.649 
better than frying it but if you're here
it<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.220> open<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.000> basically<00:01:24.330> Swiss

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
