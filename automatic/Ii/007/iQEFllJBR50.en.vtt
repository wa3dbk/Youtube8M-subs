that<00:00:52.110> Chromebooks<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.980> chrome<00:00:53.309> bases<00:00:53.670> don't

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
that Chromebooks and chrome bases don't

that Chromebooks and chrome bases don't
have<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.899> lot<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> internal<00:00:56.160> storage<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.610> you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
have a lot of internal storage so you

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.430 
have a lot of internal storage so you
can<00:00:56.850> store<00:00:57.059> things<00:00:57.210> locally<00:00:57.570> yes<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.109> and

can store things locally yes you can and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.819 
can store things locally yes you can and
this<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.160> enables<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.000> store<00:01:00.420> 16<00:01:01.140> gigs<00:01:01.590> of

this one enables you to store 16 gigs of
internal<00:01:02.010> storage<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:03.210> pretty<00:01:03.539> big<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
internal storage it's pretty big to a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.940 
internal storage it's pretty big to a
21.5<00:01:04.890> inch<00:01:05.460> 1080p<00:01:05.820> full<00:01:06.360> HD<00:01:06.750> display<00:01:06.950> the

21.5 inch 1080p full HD display the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
21.5 inch 1080p full HD display the
display<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.610> we'll<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:08.970> into<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> quality<00:01:09.630> of

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
display as we'll get into the quality of

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.960 
display as we'll get into the quality of
the<00:01:09.780> display<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.260> minute<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.189> HD<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the display in a minute but it is HD and

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.020 
the display in a minute but it is HD and
it's<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> reasonably<00:01:13.650> bright

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
it's a it's a reasonably bright

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.850 
it's a it's a reasonably bright
reasonably<00:01:15.030> good<00:01:15.180> screen<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> has<00:01:15.810> 178<00:01:16.530> degree

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
reasonably good screen it has 178 degree

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.770 
reasonably good screen it has 178 degree
viewing<00:01:17.159> angles<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.240> that's<00:01:18.360> pretty<00:01:18.630> good

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
viewing angles and so that's pretty good

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.810 
viewing angles and so that's pretty good
especially<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.530> we'll<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:19.799> into<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.549> thing

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
especially as we'll get into this thing

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
especially as we'll get into this thing
tilts<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.630> really<00:01:22.049> are<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
tilts and so you really are going to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.820 
tilts and so you really are going to
need<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.369> wide<00:01:23.670> viewing<00:01:24.000> angle<00:01:24.830> regarding

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
need that wide viewing angle regarding

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.499 
need that wide viewing angle regarding
the<00:01:25.860> touch<00:01:26.070> displays<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> 10-point<00:01:27.150> touch<00:01:27.299> so

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
the touch displays a 10-point touch so

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.480 
the touch displays a 10-point touch so
it'll<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.900> register<00:01:28.110> 10<00:01:28.650> fingers<00:01:28.950> at<00:01:29.250> once

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
it'll can register 10 fingers at once

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.940 
it'll can register 10 fingers at once
which<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.780> probably<00:01:30.990> will<00:01:31.229> never<00:01:31.380> need<00:01:31.710> you

the way up so that it's vertical for
watching<00:02:50.909> TV<00:02:51.599> or<00:02:51.810> something<00:02:51.989> like<00:02:52.169> that<00:02:52.230> it's

watching TV or something like that it's

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.520 
watching TV or something like that it's
very<00:02:53.310> fast<00:02:53.939> and<00:02:54.239> flexible<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.199> everything

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
very fast and flexible and everything

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.550 
very fast and flexible and everything
about<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:55.889> is<00:02:56.099> fast<00:02:56.489> except<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:56.939> actual

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
about this is fast except the actual

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.199 
about this is fast except the actual
compute<00:02:58.560> performance<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.459> when<00:02:59.609> I<00:02:59.639> say<00:02:59.849> fast<00:03:00.090> I

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
compute performance so when I say fast I

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.030 
compute performance so when I say fast I
mean<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:00.480> boots<00:03:00.689> up<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.049> less<00:03:01.230> than<00:03:01.379> 10<00:03:01.590> seconds

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
mean it boots up in less than 10 seconds

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.629 
mean it boots up in less than 10 seconds
it<00:03:02.519> shuts<00:03:02.849> down<00:03:03.060> right<00:03:03.750> away<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.980> can<00:03:05.159> adjust

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
it shuts down right away you can adjust

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.459 
it shuts down right away you can adjust
it<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.209> tilt<00:03:06.449> it<00:03:06.599> right<00:03:06.780> out<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.049> box<00:03:07.230> in

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:07.469 
it and tilt it right out of the box in

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:08.899 
it and tilt it right out of the box in
fact<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.829> get<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.040> brand<00:03:08.340> new<00:03:08.519> one<00:03:08.699> of<00:03:08.819> these

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
nice feature in principle I love the

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.259 
nice feature in principle I love the
idea<00:03:28.409> of<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.769> very<00:03:29.159> large<00:03:29.400> it's<00:03:29.849> like<00:03:29.939> the<00:03:30.090> size

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
idea of a very large it's like the size

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.599 
idea of a very large it's like the size
of<00:03:30.509> for<00:03:30.930> iPads<00:03:31.530> for<00:03:31.709> example<00:03:32.159> that's<00:03:32.310> that's

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
of for iPads for example that's that's

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.990 
of for iPads for example that's that's
how<00:03:32.729> big<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.150> display<00:03:33.599> feels<00:03:34.409> and<00:03:34.819> that's<00:03:35.819> a

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
how big this display feels and that's a

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.719 
how big this display feels and that's a
great<00:03:36.329> idea<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.900> problem<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.439> Chrome<00:03:37.979> OS<00:03:38.220> does

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
great idea the problem is Chrome OS does

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.649 
great idea the problem is Chrome OS does
not<00:03:39.349> it's<00:03:40.349> not<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.590> great<00:03:40.769> interface<00:03:41.209> for<00:03:42.209> touch

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
not it's not a great interface for touch

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.439 
not it's not a great interface for touch
it's<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.229> it's<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.650> interface<00:03:44.310> for<00:03:44.609> a<00:03:44.819> mouse<00:03:45.120> and

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
it's a it's a interface for a mouse and

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.089 
it's a it's a interface for a mouse and
a<00:03:45.540> keyboard<00:03:45.569> and<00:03:46.139> it<00:03:46.680> would<00:03:46.769> be<00:03:46.829> great<00:03:47.069> if

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
a keyboard and it would be great if

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.039 
a keyboard and it would be great if
Google<00:03:47.549> would<00:03:47.639> come<00:03:47.849> out<00:03:47.970> with<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.150> really

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
Google would come out with a really

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.869 
Google would come out with a really
touch<00:03:49.259> friendly<00:03:49.470> interface<00:03:49.859> for<00:03:50.519> this<00:03:50.669> that

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
touch friendly interface for this that

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.369 
touch friendly interface for this that
would<00:03:50.970> make<00:03:51.150> all<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.810> difference<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.349> the

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
would make all the difference in the

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.189 
would make all the difference in the
world<00:03:52.560> with<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.280> device<00:03:53.579> like<00:03:53.609> this<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.419> it's

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
world with a device like this and it's

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.110 
world with a device like this and it's
also<00:03:55.439> nice<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.799> know<00:03:56.009> that<00:03:56.189> it<00:03:56.489> supports<00:03:56.939> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
also nice to know that it supports the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.209 
also nice to know that it supports the
VESA<00:03:57.509> mounting<00:03:58.019> interface<00:03:58.469> standard<00:03:58.919> so<00:03:59.099> if

00:03:59.209 --> 00:03:59.219 
VESA mounting interface standard so if

and<00:05:12.090> one<00:05:12.659> of<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:12.810> things<00:05:12.990> you<00:05:13.110> discover<00:05:13.560> if

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
and one of the things you discover if

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.529 
and one of the things you discover if
you've<00:05:13.919> been<00:05:14.039> using<00:05:14.219> a<00:05:14.400> conventional<00:05:14.699> laptop

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
you've been using a conventional laptop

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.450 
you've been using a conventional laptop
is<00:05:15.719> that<00:05:15.750> almost<00:05:16.560> everything<00:05:17.039> is<00:05:17.280> in<00:05:17.370> the

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
is that almost everything is in the

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.219 
is that almost everything is in the
cloud<00:05:17.669> anyway<00:05:18.090> so<00:05:18.599> you<00:05:18.659> might<00:05:18.690> as<00:05:18.870> well<00:05:19.080> go<00:05:19.199> all

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
cloud anyway so you might as well go all

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.110 
cloud anyway so you might as well go all
cloud<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:19.949> gain<00:05:20.069> the<00:05:20.190> security<00:05:20.550> benefits<00:05:20.940> of

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
cloud and gain the security benefits of

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.629 
cloud and gain the security benefits of
doing<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.710> second<00:05:23.099> thing<00:05:23.190> that<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.400> like

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
doing that the second thing that I like

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.570 
doing that the second thing that I like
about<00:05:23.669> this<00:05:23.940> whole<00:05:24.690> idea<00:05:25.139> is<00:05:25.469> the<00:05:26.250> fact<00:05:26.490> that

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
about this whole idea is the fact that

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.969 
about this whole idea is the fact that
it's<00:05:26.789> a<00:05:26.909> large<00:05:27.180> screen<00:05:27.599> touch<00:05:28.169> device<00:05:28.590> these

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
it's a large screen touch device these

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.189 
it's a large screen touch device these
are<00:05:29.310> rare<00:05:29.729> in<00:05:29.759> low-cost<00:05:30.449> devices<00:05:30.900> like<00:05:30.990> this

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
are rare in low-cost devices like this

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.920 
are rare in low-cost devices like this
again<00:05:31.469> this<00:05:31.979> is<00:05:32.159> very<00:05:32.210> inexpensive<00:05:33.210> it's<00:05:33.690> just

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
again this is very inexpensive it's just

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.050 
again this is very inexpensive it's just
44<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:34.919> twenty-nine<00:05:35.250> ninety-nine<00:05:35.279> if<00:05:35.969> you

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
44 and twenty-nine ninety-nine if you

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.779 
44 and twenty-nine ninety-nine if you
want<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.569> non-touch<00:05:37.080> version<00:05:37.440> it's<00:05:37.590> 320<00:05:38.159> 999

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
want the non-touch version it's 320 999

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.120 
want the non-touch version it's 320 999
but<00:05:38.819> this<00:05:39.150> touch<00:05:39.779> version<00:05:39.990> i<00:05:40.259> think<00:05:40.469> is<00:05:40.560> really

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
but this touch version i think is really

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.969 
but this touch version i think is really
great<00:05:41.340> you<00:05:41.400> know<00:05:41.550> of<00:05:41.729> course<00:05:41.909> on<00:05:42.210> in<00:05:43.199> the<00:05:43.380> world

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
great you know of course on in the world

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.969 
great you know of course on in the world
of<00:05:44.279> Windows<00:05:45.120> you<00:05:45.690> can<00:05:45.719> get<00:05:45.990> a<00:05:46.199> large<00:05:46.680> screen

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
of Windows you can get a large screen

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.589 
of Windows you can get a large screen
touch<00:05:47.279> device<00:05:47.639> but<00:05:48.029> you're<00:05:48.180> not<00:05:48.270> going<00:05:48.419> to<00:05:48.509> get

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
touch device but you're not going to get

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.959 
touch device but you're not going to get
it<00:05:48.719> anywhere<00:05:49.259> near<00:05:49.529> this<00:05:50.159> price<00:05:50.490> point<00:05:50.550> so

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
it anywhere near this price point so

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:52.790 
it anywhere near this price point so
that's<00:05:51.210> a<00:05:51.419> very<00:05:51.810> very<00:05:52.169> compelling

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
that's a very very compelling

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.339 
that's a very very compelling
combination<00:05:53.009> and<00:05:53.550> for<00:05:53.789> a<00:05:54.000> second<00:05:54.840> device<00:05:55.080> a

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
combination and for a second device a

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.920 
combination and for a second device a
secure<00:05:55.830> device<00:05:56.210> and<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.449> fact<00:05:57.659> that<00:05:57.750> it's

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
secure device and the fact that it's

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.930 
secure device and the fact that it's
cloud<00:05:58.139> you<00:05:58.349> can<00:05:58.379> just<00:05:58.590> plug<00:05:59.250> it<00:05:59.370> in<00:05:59.460> leave<00:05:59.819> it
