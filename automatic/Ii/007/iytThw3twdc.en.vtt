00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.810
 hello my name is antoine fouche 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.599
 teacher drawing in a workshop 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.490
 Parisian 14th arrondissement and I 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.610
 will show you how to draw 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.400
 agree to 6 then the body so poses 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.140
 different types of difficulties between 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.820
 tournus and thighs that are in a 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.490
 position in the race he asks for a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.920
 particular montage two sketches then 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.460
 we will start with the proportion 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.939
 overall body to draw some 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.219
 undecided 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.649
 we will start with the head which is the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:40.020
 most visible part of the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.980
 body we're going to have the bust the bust in 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.329
 sitting position undergoes no deformation 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:54.860
 so there will be no problem 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:57.690
 particular on the on the bust and then goes 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.160
 to arrive a more complex part to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.129
 inside their presentation that's going 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.899
 operate at the thighs why 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.519
 because they come to you and 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.140
 so at that moment the proportions 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.880
 undergo deformation 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.549
 first we will have to find the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:18.259
 relative knee position by 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.479
 compared to what was drawn above 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.619
 of the body so look at the alignment of the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.619
 knee to the shoulders 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:34.380
 ok maybe we can negotiate in 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.420
 hockey so the difficulty will come to the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.460
 level of knee positioning 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.490
 why because they come to you 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.560
 and so it's more complicated then to 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.049
 so position the best system 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.759
 it is to find a point at the level of 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.240
 shoulders and find his alignment 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:56.369
 so there right now I'm playing there is going to be 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.710
 in the alignment here and we're going to ask this 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.340
 first game we pretty much 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.509
 brutal calf he's not going to suffer from 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.700
 deformation because he too is 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.110
 vertical and does not come to us and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.209
 so he'll be like the torso 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.209
 relatively simple to treat 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:20.010
 stone we can go back to finish the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.010
 skiers watch the position 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.490
 chest position 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.320
 the position of the second of the second 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.600
 game we also important 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.170
 we will compare it to the position all this 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.550
 which has already been drawn so there in 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.040
 the occurrence the knee be located at 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.350
 the outside of the body so to the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:03:00.340
 position we will deduce the position 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:00.340
 thigh reposition 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.770
 another important element is the 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.350
 mediant position of the plane the circus 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.600
 breast the sternum the navel and the 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.990
 pubis will tell us the orientation 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.990
 of the body we are attentive to the season ena 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.390
 to position them in space 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.570
 so here we saw in the drawing of a 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.940
 character sitting the importance of 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.920
 positioning the knees because of 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.230
 elements that come to you so from 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.460
 elements called shortcuts so 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.840
 we must be particularly attentive 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.230
 to those areas there that she will push the type 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.230
 drawing
