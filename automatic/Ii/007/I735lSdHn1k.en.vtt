00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
along and you're gonna follow

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.210

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
right foot with it and then what you're

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.670 
right foot with it and then what you're
going<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.400> do<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:22.200> you're<00:02:23.200> going<00:02:23.319> to<00:02:23.380> try<00:02:23.530> and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
going to do is you're going to try and

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.110 
going to do is you're going to try and
get<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.890> break<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:25.630> your<00:02:25.690> right<00:02:26.140> foot<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.970> try

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
get the break of your right foot to try

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.230 
get the break of your right foot to try
and<00:02:28.300> chase<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:29.350> heel<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:30.040> your<00:02:30.280> left<00:02:30.610> foot<00:02:30.910> so

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
and chase the heel of your left foot so

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.949 
and chase the heel of your left foot so
I<00:02:31.450> look<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.660> bit<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.900> this

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.509 

so<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.049> you<00:02:37.140> do<00:02:37.590> all<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:37.890> then<00:02:38.400> you'll

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
so if you do all of that then you'll

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.080 
so if you do all of that then you'll
probably<00:02:38.639> end<00:02:38.999> up<00:02:39.689> being<00:02:40.109> able<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.469> do<00:02:41.090> 360

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
probably end up being able to do 360

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.930 
probably end up being able to do 360
since<00:02:42.510> it's<00:02:42.749> been
