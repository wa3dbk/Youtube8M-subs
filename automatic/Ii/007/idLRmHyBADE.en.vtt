really great shape it's really smooth it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.069 
really great shape it's really smooth it
doesn't<00:01:50.280> catch<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.729> anything<00:01:50.880> either<00:01:51.390> which

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
doesn't catch on anything either which

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.749 
doesn't catch on anything either which
is<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> best<00:01:52.619> thing<00:01:52.890> because<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:53.490> things

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
is the best thing because these things

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.630 
is the best thing because these things
can<00:01:54.060> sometimes<00:01:54.240> snag<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.320> very<00:01:56.100> delicate

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
can sometimes snag on very delicate

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.819 
can sometimes snag on very delicate
clothes<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.659> if<00:01:57.840> you're<00:01:57.960> wearing<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.319> sari<00:01:58.619> or

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
clothes like if you're wearing a sari or

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.950 
clothes like if you're wearing a sari or
something<00:01:59.399> you<00:02:00.240> know<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.479> could<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.659> worried

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
something you know you could be worried

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.539 
something you know you could be worried
but<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.649> really<00:02:01.799> smooth<00:02:02.250> doesn't

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
but it's really really smooth doesn't

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.959 
but it's really really smooth doesn't
catch<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.880> anything<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:04.189> yeah<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.219> like<00:02:05.579> really

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
catch on anything and yeah I like really

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.499 
catch on anything and yeah I like really
using<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.689> very<00:02:07.110> very<00:02:08.119> elaborate<00:02:09.119> event

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
using it for very very elaborate event

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.020 
using it for very very elaborate event
but<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> also<00:02:10.500> think<00:02:10.769> it<00:02:10.920> would<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.340> fun

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
have handheld like this but I even if I

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.460

it as a clutch I still leave the chain

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.670 
it as a clutch I still leave the chain
down<00:03:32.480> because<00:03:32.900> i<00:03:32.930> think<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:33.320> just<00:03:33.350> looks

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680

really like to wear it going out at
night<00:03:56.420> and<00:03:56.780> another<00:03:57.530> thing<00:03:57.770> is<00:03:58.010> that<00:03:58.040> don't

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
night and another thing is that don't

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.340 
night and another thing is that don't
think<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.330> just<00:03:59.540> because<00:03:59.660> this<00:03:59.900> is<00:04:00.050> brown

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
think that just because this is brown

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.080 
think that just because this is brown
that<00:04:00.950> whatever<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.400> wear<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.640> won't<00:04:01.940> go

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
that whatever you wear a won't go

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.790 
that whatever you wear a won't go
because<00:04:02.420> this<00:04:02.570> is<00:04:02.720> a<00:04:02.750> statement<00:04:03.110> piece<00:04:03.320> on<00:04:03.650> its

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
because this is a statement piece on its

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.550 
because this is a statement piece on its
own<00:04:04.070> this<00:04:04.640> is<00:04:04.820> on<00:04:05.060> an<00:04:05.420> entirely<00:04:05.990> different

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
own this is on an entirely different

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.370 
own this is on an entirely different
level<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:08.150> will<00:04:08.300> look<00:04:08.480> great<00:04:08.660> with<00:04:09.050> no

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
level so it will look great with no

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.600 
level so it will look great with no
matter<00:04:09.620> what<00:04:09.860> you're<00:04:09.980> wearing<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.340> can<00:04:10.460> wear

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
difficult color as such to really work

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.180 
difficult color as such to really work
with<00:05:54.880> because<00:05:55.480> it's<00:05:55.750> a<00:05:56.020> dusky<00:05:56.380> purple<00:05:56.920> it's<00:05:57.070> a

with because it's a dusky purple it's a

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.750 
with because it's a dusky purple it's a
color<00:05:57.900> so<00:05:58.900> not<00:05:59.470> necessarily<00:05:59.650> will<00:06:00.220> always<00:06:00.580> go

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
color so not necessarily will always go

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.760 
color so not necessarily will always go
with<00:06:00.880> everything<00:06:01.200> but<00:06:02.200> for<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.470> most<00:06:02.650> part

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
with everything but for the most part

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.590 
with everything but for the most part
for<00:06:03.280> what<00:06:03.460> i<00:06:03.670> wear<00:06:03.940> and<00:06:04.120> the<00:06:04.180> colors<00:06:04.420> that<00:06:04.540> I

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
where are quite neutral palette so this

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.450 
where are quite neutral palette so this
will<00:06:07.120> just<00:06:07.270> add<00:06:07.510> a<00:06:07.540> really<00:06:07.930> nice<00:06:08.170> soft<00:06:08.830> accent
