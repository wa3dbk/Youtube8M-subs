then<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.420> start<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.810> earlier<00:01:10.729> this<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
then we start of this earlier this is

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.600 
then we start of this earlier this is
the<00:01:11.880> box<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:13.040> that's<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> piece<00:01:14.400> right<00:01:14.580> there

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the box and that's the piece right there

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.880 
the box and that's the piece right there
that's<00:01:15.240> basically<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.590> let's<00:01:16.710> move<00:01:16.799> this

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that's basically it so let's move this

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.160 
that's basically it so let's move this
by<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.189> way<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> show<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.670> how<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.659> works<00:01:18.720> so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
by the way to show you how this works so

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.160 
by the way to show you how this works so
basically<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.490> focuses<00:01:21.170> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
basically this is like a it focuses the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.289 
basically this is like a it focuses the
sound<00:01:22.470> from<00:01:22.860> off<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.189> your<00:01:23.280> iphone<00:01:23.670> towards

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
sound from off of your iphone towards

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.810 
sound from off of your iphone towards
you<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.590> increases<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.400> sum<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
you and it increases the sum of the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.399 
you and it increases the sum of the
speaker<00:01:27.150> makes<00:01:27.479> what<00:01:27.659> makes<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.960> louder<00:01:28.140> so

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
speaker makes what makes it louder so

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.929 
speaker makes what makes it louder so
