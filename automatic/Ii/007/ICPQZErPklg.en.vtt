00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.440 
fighters but not world class fighters so
so<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.519> think<00:03:13.579> that<00:03:13.730> could<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.180> could<00:03:14.239> make<00:03:14.390> a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
so I think that could that could make a

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.670 
so I think that could that could make a
big<00:03:14.569> difference<00:03:14.629> you<00:03:15.019> know<00:03:15.049> ruby<00:03:15.409> has<00:03:15.530> the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
big difference you know ruby has the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.460 
big difference you know ruby has the
experience<00:03:15.859> Rubio<00:03:16.670> has<00:03:16.849> that<00:03:17.480> 65<00:03:18.139> you<00:03:18.349> know

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
experience Rubio has that 65 you know

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.500 
experience Rubio has that 65 you know
and<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.430> act<00:03:19.669> that's<00:03:20.000> going<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.329> make<00:03:20.450> a

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
and and that act that's going to make a

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.629 
and and that act that's going to make a
big<00:03:20.630> difference<00:03:20.780> also<00:03:21.230> plus<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:22.069> spine<00:03:22.459> that

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
big difference also plus the spine that

any better sparring I think it couldn't

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.619 
any better sparring I think it couldn't
be<00:03:37.489> in<00:03:37.549> better<00:03:37.579> shape<00:03:37.790> than<00:03:38.060> what<00:03:38.269> he<00:03:38.359> is<00:03:38.480> right

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629

now and from what it looks it I get the

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.490 
now and from what it looks it I get the
sense<00:03:41.359> that<00:03:41.480> he's<00:03:41.660> not<00:03:41.780> scared<00:03:41.989> of<00:03:42.230> him<00:03:42.349> he's
