00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
the seeds and then you're going to take

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.220 
the seeds and then you're going to take
the<00:02:25.549> part<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:25.970> strained<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.750> you're

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
the part that you strained and you're

the part that you strained and you're
going<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.609> make<00:02:28.609> it<00:02:28.790> into<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.239> homogenous

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
going to make it into a homogenous

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.280 
going to make it into a homogenous
consistency<00:02:30.609> by<00:02:31.609> blending<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.299> as<00:02:32.480> well<00:02:32.720> so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
consistency by blending it as well so

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.569 
consistency by blending it as well so
I'm<00:02:33.380> just<00:02:33.530> going<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.709> go<00:02:33.859> ahead<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.250> pour<00:02:34.459> this

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
I'm just going to go ahead and pour this

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.530 
I'm just going to go ahead and pour this
into<00:02:34.940> our<00:02:35.660> blender

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.570 

once<00:02:40.170> again<00:02:40.319> we're<00:02:40.620> going<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.860> blend<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.370> up

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
once again we're going to blend this up

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.250 
once again we're going to blend this up
and<00:02:41.909> you<00:02:42.150> want<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.599> make<00:02:42.750> sure<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:43.140> you're

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
and you want to make sure that you're

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.619 
and you want to make sure that you're
blending<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.860> very<00:02:44.129> well<00:02:44.489> because<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.450> way

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
blending it very well because the way

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.960 
blending it very well because the way
that<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.930> gets<00:02:46.110> thick<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.739> through<00:02:47.189> heating<00:02:47.700> up

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
that it gets thick is through heating up

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.210 
that it gets thick is through heating up
of<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.480> cashews<00:02:49.049> because<00:02:49.500> then<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:49.799> begins<00:02:50.040> to

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
of the cashews because then it begins to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.940 
of the cashews because then it begins to
expand<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:51.120> it's<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.480> consistency<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
expand and it's the consistency of a

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.250 
expand and it's the consistency of a
regular<00:02:53.430> mousse<00:02:53.700> but<00:02:54.480> if<00:02:54.629> your<00:02:54.780> blender<00:02:55.110> is

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
regular mousse but if your blender is

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.949 
regular mousse but if your blender is
not<00:02:55.409> able<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.069> heat<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.459> up<00:02:56.640> itself<00:02:57.180> then<00:02:57.810> all

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
not able to heat it up itself then all

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.170 
not able to heat it up itself then all
you<00:02:58.049> have<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.290> do<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.680> put<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.040> into<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.430> pan<00:02:59.909> and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
you have to do is put it into a pan and

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.750 
you have to do is put it into a pan and
put<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.840> on<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.230> stove<00:03:01.560> until<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:02.129> starts<00:03:02.579> to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
put it on the stove until it starts to

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.210 
put it on the stove until it starts to
just<00:03:03.060> boil<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.810> then<00:03:04.379> you<00:03:04.620> want<00:03:04.799> to<00:03:04.860> serve<00:03:05.099> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
just boil and then you want to serve the

just boil and then you want to serve the
whole<00:03:05.370> time<00:03:05.609> and<00:03:06.000> take<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.269> off<00:03:06.359> of<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.629> stove

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:15.320 
whole time and take it off of the stove
and<00:03:07.200> then<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:07.680> cool<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.310> fridge
