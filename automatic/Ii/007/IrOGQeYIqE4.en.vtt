things<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.430> been<00:02:11.879> turning<00:02:12.239> out<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.629> I

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
things have been turning out and I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.809 
things have been turning out and I
imagine<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.010> know<00:02:14.099> every<00:02:14.310> single<00:02:14.459> time<00:02:14.640> that

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
imagine you know every single time that

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.089 
imagine you know every single time that
I<00:02:15.030> go<00:02:15.269> to<00:02:15.330> bed<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:16.080> know<00:02:16.170> take<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.410> nap<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.920> wake

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
I go to bed you know take a nap and wake

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.830 
I go to bed you know take a nap and wake
up<00:02:17.340> later<00:02:17.580> things<00:02:17.940> seem<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.300> be<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> little<00:02:18.720> bit

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
up later things seem to be a little bit

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.020 
up later things seem to be a little bit
clearer<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.190> think<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.700> know<00:02:20.819> by<00:02:20.970> tomorrow

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
clearer so I think you know by tomorrow

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.110 
clearer so I think you know by tomorrow
on<00:02:21.780> d5<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.290> should<00:02:22.860> have<00:02:23.010> even<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.459> better<00:02:23.849> update

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120
