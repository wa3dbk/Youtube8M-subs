00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the mariposa grove for not only

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.430 
the mariposa grove for not only
historical<00:00:39.210> reasons<00:00:39.629> but<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.930> also<00:00:40.079> really

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
historical reasons but it also really

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.930 
historical reasons but it also really
demonstrates<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> special<00:00:41.489> qualities<00:00:41.910> that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
demonstrates the special qualities that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.360 
demonstrates the special qualities that
giant<00:00:42.390> sequoias<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:43.129> when<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> first

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
giant sequoias have when the first

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.750 
giant sequoias have when the first
European<00:00:44.760> settlers<00:00:44.820> got<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.949> 1850s

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
European settlers got here in the 1850s

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.389 
European settlers got here in the 1850s
or<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.360> interest<00:00:49.079> parties<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:50.040> saw<00:00:50.220> this

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
or so interest parties they saw this

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.509 
or so interest parties they saw this
tree<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.589> they<00:00:52.589> decided<00:00:53.010> they<00:00:53.040> needed<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
tree and they decided they needed to

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.780 
tree and they decided they needed to
ride<00:00:54.120> their<00:00:54.300> horses<00:00:54.540> on<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.460> they<00:00:56.610> did

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
ride their horses on it and so they did

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.119 
ride their horses on it and so they did
and<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.299> pictures<00:00:57.659> of<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.320> Americans<00:00:59.040> of

another really cool thing about this

another really cool thing about this
trees<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.539> don't<00:01:27.630> know<00:01:27.780> how<00:01:27.899> long<00:01:27.960> it's

trees that we don't know how long it's

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.710 
trees that we don't know how long it's
been<00:01:28.319> on<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.530> ground<00:01:28.800> I<00:01:29.729> mean<00:01:30.090> obviously<00:01:30.390> it's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
been on the ground I mean obviously it's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.130 
been on the ground I mean obviously it's
fallen<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.350> not<00:01:31.500> dating<00:01:31.830> anymore<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
fallen it's not dating anymore and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.359 
fallen it's not dating anymore and
because<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.259> don't<00:01:34.440> know<00:01:34.500> how<00:01:34.679> long<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.280> been

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
because we don't know how long it's been

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.399 
because we don't know how long it's been
on<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.580> ground<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.360> tells<00:01:36.750> us<00:01:36.899> two<00:01:37.080> really

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
on the ground it tells us two really

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.889 
on the ground it tells us two really
important<00:01:37.890> things<00:01:37.920> about<00:01:38.159> science<00:01:38.579> quiz<00:01:38.899> the

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
important things about science quiz the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.740 
important things about science quiz the
first<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.850> lacking<00:01:42.270> at

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
first is we can see that it's lacking at

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.200 
first is we can see that it's lacking at
the<00:01:42.960> iconic<00:01:43.829> red<00:01:44.100> color<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.790> guys<00:01:44.939> can<00:01:45.090> step

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
the iconic red color you guys can step

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.859 
the iconic red color you guys can step
off<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> trail<00:01:45.659> if<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.110> um<00:01:47.689> it<00:01:48.689> doesn't

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
off the trail if you like um it doesn't

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.649 
off the trail if you like um it doesn't
have<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.229> red<00:01:49.409> color<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.009> mostly

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
have that red color that we mostly

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.999 
have that red color that we mostly
associate<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.079> Giant<00:01:52.380> Sequoias<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
associate with the Giant Sequoias the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.209 
associate with the Giant Sequoias the
mature<00:01:53.310> ones<00:01:53.520> anyways<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.890> they<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.039> that

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
mature ones anyways and they get that

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.920 
mature ones anyways and they get that
red<00:01:56.399> color<00:01:56.610> from<00:01:56.969> something<00:01:57.329> called<00:01:57.450> tannic

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
red color from something called tannic

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.340 
red color from something called tannic
acid<00:01:58.380> which<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.670> also<00:02:00.360> used<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.960> making<00:02:01.110> of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
acid which is also used in the making of

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:23.220 
acid which is also used in the making of
red<00:02:01.560> wine

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.770 

place<00:02:23.950> like<00:02:24.220> kind<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.459> like<00:02:24.519> a<00:02:24.640> pile<00:02:24.909> on<00:02:25.269> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
place like kind of like a pile on the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.190 
place like kind of like a pile on the
upside<00:02:26.200> uphill<00:02:27.190> side<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.000> tree<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:28.810> when<00:02:29.170> a

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
upside uphill side of the tree so when a

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.660 
upside uphill side of the tree so when a
fire<00:02:29.409> comes<00:02:29.709> through<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.220> now<00:02:30.340> have<00:02:30.519> that

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
fire comes through you now have that

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.210 
fire comes through you now have that
accumulated<00:02:31.269> burn<00:02:31.569> center<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.290> that's<00:02:33.010> why

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
accumulated burn center and that's why

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.820 
accumulated burn center and that's why
you<00:02:33.280> see<00:02:33.640> fire<00:02:33.909> scars<00:02:34.239> on<00:02:34.629> the<00:02:35.379> uphill<00:02:35.590> side

wanna hotel built that whole complex

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.270 
wanna hotel built that whole complex
it's<00:06:15.990> actually<00:06:16.139> one<00:06:16.440> of<00:06:16.470> the<00:06:16.560> oldest<00:06:16.949> hotels

it's actually one of the oldest hotels
in<00:06:17.610> California<00:06:18.210> I<00:06:18.240> think<00:06:18.389> it's<00:06:18.479> like<00:06:18.569> the

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
in California I think it's like the

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.290 
in California I think it's like the
second<00:06:19.020> oldest<00:06:19.319> or<00:06:19.470> something<00:06:19.789> they<00:06:20.789> tunneled

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
second oldest or something they tunneled

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.969 
second oldest or something they tunneled
this<00:06:21.419> one<00:06:21.599> out<00:06:21.720> because<00:06:22.110> what<00:06:22.530> a<00:06:22.560> talent<00:06:22.889> REE

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
this one out because what a talent REE

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.040 
this one out because what a talent REE
was<00:06:23.129> often<00:06:23.490> inaccessible<00:06:23.729> because<00:06:24.659> of<00:06:24.900> snow

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
was often inaccessible because of snow

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.350 
was often inaccessible because of snow
so<00:06:25.560> when<00:06:26.129> the<00:06:26.220> tourists<00:06:26.580> came<00:06:26.729> earlier<00:06:27.060> I<00:06:27.180> want

so when the tourists came earlier I want

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
to ride my care to the tree they would

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.339 
to ride my care to the tree they would
say<00:06:29.069> oh<00:06:29.099> well<00:06:29.340> this<00:06:29.370> is<00:06:29.550> it<00:06:30.169> even<00:06:31.169> though<00:06:31.259> they

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349 
say oh well this is it even though they

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.469

money so that's kind of why they tumbled
out<00:06:34.889> this<00:06:35.099> tree<00:06:35.370> and<00:06:35.690> as<00:06:36.690> you<00:06:36.870> can<00:06:37.050> see<00:06:37.080> a<00:06:37.289> car
