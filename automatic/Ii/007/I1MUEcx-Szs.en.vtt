00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.480 

has<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.140> pretty<00:00:04.440> cool<00:00:04.500> waterfall<00:00:05.130> up<00:00:05.310> here

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
has a pretty cool waterfall up here

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.130 
has a pretty cool waterfall up here
little<00:00:05.759> ways<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:06.210> kind<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.629> climbed<00:00:06.839> up<00:00:07.020> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
little ways I kind of climbed up the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.610 
little ways I kind of climbed up the
river<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.470> bit<00:00:07.760> but<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:09.330> think<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.260> second

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
river a bit but I think the second

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.589 
river a bit but I think the second
tunnel<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.920> actually<00:00:11.190> down<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.580> river<00:00:14.599> still

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
tunnel is actually down the river still

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.740 
tunnel is actually down the river still
looking<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> second<00:00:16.529> tunnel

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.450 

in<00:00:24.080> a<00:00:24.109> long<00:00:24.349> time<00:00:24.590> but<00:00:24.800> I<00:00:24.830> finally<00:00:25.009> found<00:00:25.310> the

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
in a long time but I finally found the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.480 
in a long time but I finally found the
entrance<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.060> second<00:00:26.509> cave<00:00:26.919> no<00:00:30.310> light<00:00:31.310> but

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
entrance to the second cave no light but

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.030 
entrance to the second cave no light but
looks<00:00:31.820> like<00:00:32.320> through<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.440> cave<00:00:33.620> in<00:00:33.800> here<00:00:33.980> a

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
looks like through the cave in here a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.639 
looks like through the cave in here a
while<00:00:34.160> ago<00:00:34.190> but<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.760> pack<00:00:35.020> still<00:00:36.020> goes<00:00:36.199> on<00:00:36.350> I

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
while ago but the pack still goes on I

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.790 
while ago but the pack still goes on I
can<00:00:36.800> see<00:00:36.829> light<00:00:37.510> way<00:00:38.510> down<00:00:38.870> that<00:00:39.079> very<00:00:39.290> end<00:00:39.590> so

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
can see light way down that very end so

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.860 
can see light way down that very end so
we're<00:00:40.190> moving<00:00:41.680> well<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.739> camera<00:00:43.100> appeared<00:00:43.430> to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
we're moving well the camera appeared to

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.750 
we're moving well the camera appeared to
freeze<00:00:45.010> midway<00:00:46.010> through<00:00:46.190> that<00:00:46.220> tunnel<00:00:46.519> so<00:00:46.730> I

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
freeze midway through that tunnel so I

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.069 
freeze midway through that tunnel so I
wasn't<00:00:46.909> able<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.150> get<00:00:47.269> in<00:00:47.420> some<00:00:47.720> of<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.870> shots

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
wasn't able to get in some of the shots

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.319 
wasn't able to get in some of the shots
about<00:00:48.320> thigh-deep<00:00:48.920> I'll<00:00:49.850> try<00:00:49.970> to<00:00:50.030> get<00:00:50.180> him<00:00:50.239> on

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
about thigh-deep I'll try to get him on

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.840 
about thigh-deep I'll try to get him on
the<00:00:50.480> way<00:00:50.570> back<00:00:50.920> here's<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.129> light<00:00:52.339> that<00:00:52.579> I<00:00:52.670> saw

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
the way back here's the light that I saw

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.350 
the way back here's the light that I saw
it<00:00:52.940> into<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.269> tunnel<00:00:53.600> but<00:00:54.290> as<00:00:54.800> you<00:00:54.920> can<00:00:55.010> see<00:00:55.360> or

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
it into the tunnel but as you can see or

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.439 
it into the tunnel but as you can see or
to<00:00:56.510> go<00:00:56.689> back<00:00:57.280> there's<00:00:58.280> an<00:00:58.549> exit<00:00:58.790> to<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.059> tunnel

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
to go back there's an exit to the tunnel

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.079 
to go back there's an exit to the tunnel
and<00:01:00.049> this<00:01:00.320> is<00:01:00.619> the<00:01:00.799> shangri-la<00:01:01.339> that<00:01:02.000> they

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
and this is the shangri-la that they

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:13.450 
and this is the shangri-la that they
talked<00:01:02.299> about

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:22.169 

is<00:01:13.670> straight<00:01:14.120> overhead

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.470 

there's<00:01:22.539> a<00:01:22.630> waterfall<00:01:22.929> back<00:01:23.320> in<00:01:23.530> there

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
there's a waterfall back in there

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.710 
there's a waterfall back in there
take<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> closer<00:01:25.080> look

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
take a closer look

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.770 
take a closer look
step<00:01:26.870> down<00:01:26.900> waterfalls<00:01:27.590> here

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.210 

and<00:01:33.870> not<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> lot<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.380> people<00:01:34.590> see

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.600 

people<00:01:37.910> do

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
people do

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.370 
people do
the<00:01:39.030> water<00:01:39.210> falling<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.660> hiked<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.230> little

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the water falling and hiked up a little

00:01:40.380 --> 00:02:08.570 
the water falling and hiked up a little
bit<00:01:40.530> further

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.339 

I<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:09.150> to<00:02:09.270> get<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> summit<00:02:09.750> shot

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.380 

cross<00:02:14.980> away<00:02:15.340> there

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.809 

I'd<00:02:18.990> be<00:02:19.200> able<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.380> get<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.340> infant's

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
I'd be able to get that is the infant's

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.090 
I'd be able to get that is the infant's
to<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.030> third<00:02:21.420> shuttle<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:22.170> hear<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:22.980> it's

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
to the third shuttle I hear it so it's

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.850 
to the third shuttle I hear it so it's
too<00:02:23.250> rickety<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.760> travel<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.650> still<00:02:25.650> take<00:02:25.830> a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
too rickety to travel I still take a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.059 
too rickety to travel I still take a
closer<00:02:26.160> look<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.700> have<00:02:26.910> no<00:02:27.120> time<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.420> do

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
closer look I have no time to do

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.319 
closer look I have no time to do
we'll<00:02:28.489> take<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.670> peek<00:02:28.909> inside<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.370> did<00:02:32.000> decide

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
we'll take a peek inside so I did decide

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.000 
we'll take a peek inside so I did decide
to<00:02:32.390> travel<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:33.079> third<00:02:33.290> time<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.530> little<00:02:33.769> bit

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
to travel the third time a little bit

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.259 
to travel the third time a little bit
but<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.519> don't<00:02:35.090> think<00:02:35.390> get<00:02:35.659> that<00:02:35.870> or<00:02:36.049> not<00:02:37.209> try<00:02:38.209> to

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
but I don't think get that or not try to

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.209 
but I don't think get that or not try to
get<00:02:38.359> my<00:02:38.450> light<00:02:38.659> on<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.650> water<00:02:39.859> actually

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:40.219 
get my light on it the water actually

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.990 
get my light on it the water actually
comes<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.239> roof<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:42.489> that's<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.700> end<00:02:43.819> for

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
comes to the roof so that's the end for

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.849 
comes to the roof so that's the end for
me<00:02:44.150> there's<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.810> couple<00:02:44.959> peekaboo<00:02:45.409> lookouts

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
me there's a couple peekaboo lookouts

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.920 
me there's a couple peekaboo lookouts
I'm<00:02:46.819> going<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.060> take<00:02:47.180> some<00:02:47.359> shots<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.780> those

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
I'm going to take some shots of those

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.679 
I'm going to take some shots of those
but<00:02:48.349> this<00:02:48.500> tunnel<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.890> really<00:02:49.129> short<00:02:49.370> yeah<00:02:50.269> and

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
but this tunnel is really short yeah and

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.270 
but this tunnel is really short yeah and
now<00:02:50.840> it's<00:02:50.870> this<00:02:51.620> spot<00:02:51.859> right<00:02:52.010> here<00:02:52.069> is

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
now it's this spot right here is

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.410 
now it's this spot right here is
actually<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.640> cave-in<00:02:53.139> and<00:02:54.139> well<00:02:54.879> yeah<00:02:55.879> maybe

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
actually a cave-in and well yeah maybe

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.899 
actually a cave-in and well yeah maybe
Dave<00:02:56.689> would<00:02:56.870> do<00:02:56.989> that<00:02:57.109> but<00:02:57.319> I<00:02:57.439> wouldn't<00:02:57.909> know

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
Dave would do that but I wouldn't know

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:04.270 
Dave would do that but I wouldn't know
maybe<00:02:59.269> I<00:02:59.329> give<00:02:59.480> up<00:02:59.569> close<00:02:59.780> one<00:03:02.920> roof<00:03:03.920> coming

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
maybe I give up close one roof coming

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.309 
maybe I give up close one roof coming
down<00:03:06.790> all<00:03:07.790> right<00:03:07.939> here's<00:03:08.840> one<00:03:08.989> of<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.139> peak

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
down all right here's one of the peak
