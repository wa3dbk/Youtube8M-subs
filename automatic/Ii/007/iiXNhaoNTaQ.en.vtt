someone who's read the book I was

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.150 
someone who's read the book I was
ultimately<00:01:57.500> frustrated<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> few

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
ultimately frustrated with a few

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.820 
ultimately frustrated with a few
different<00:01:59.700> scenes<00:02:00.330> there<00:02:01.110> were<00:02:01.259> some<00:02:01.560> big

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
different scenes there were some big

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.740 
different scenes there were some big
points<00:02:02.160> where<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.610> plot<00:02:02.910> was<00:02:02.970> supposed<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
points where the plot was supposed to

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.740 
points where the plot was supposed to
move<00:02:03.899> forward<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.800> it<00:02:05.459> it<00:02:05.819> didn't<00:02:06.300> get<00:02:06.509> there

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
move forward and it it didn't get there

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.600 
move forward and it it didn't get there
for<00:02:07.050> me<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.350> really<00:02:07.979> think<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.459> best

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
for me I really think that the best

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.100 
for me I really think that the best
thing<00:02:08.789> about<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.119> movie<00:02:09.630> were<00:02:09.990> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
thing about this movie were the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.660 
thing about this movie were the
relationships<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.950> characters<00:02:11.430> which

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
relationships and the characters which

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.800 
relationships and the characters which
is<00:02:11.850> odd<00:02:12.300> because<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.840> expected<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.530> lot<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.830> emo

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
is odd because I expected a lot of emo

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.120 
is odd because I expected a lot of emo
industrial<00:02:15.810> music<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.380> Evanescence<00:02:17.010> and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
industrial music and Evanescence and

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.580 
industrial music and Evanescence and
montages<00:02:17.819> of<00:02:17.970> cool<00:02:18.390> vampires<00:02:18.990> flying<00:02:19.410> around

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
montages of cool vampires flying around

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.170 
montages of cool vampires flying around
and<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:19.950> really<00:02:20.280> not<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.880> they

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
and it's really not like that they

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.210 
and it's really not like that they
really<00:02:21.480> stick<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.020> love<00:02:22.260> story<00:02:22.560> well<00:02:22.890> and

between the vampire family is something

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.150 
between the vampire family is something
that's<00:02:30.390> really<00:02:30.959> great<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.470> actually<00:02:31.620> brings

know if Catherine Hardwicke was up to

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.680 
know if Catherine Hardwicke was up to
the<00:02:53.659> task<00:02:53.980> but<00:02:54.980> for<00:02:55.220> me<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.700> was<00:02:55.879> surprised<00:02:56.450> at

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
the task but for me I was surprised at

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.050 
the task but for me I was surprised at
how<00:02:56.900> well<00:02:57.170> most<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:57.860> worked<00:02:58.129> and<00:02:58.819> I<00:02:58.910> was

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
how well most of it worked and I was

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.190 
how well most of it worked and I was
able<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.299> forgive<00:02:59.599> a<00:02:59.660> lot<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.989> things

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
able to forgive a lot of things

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.850 
able to forgive a lot of things
especially<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:02.450> know<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:03.290> fact<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.620> all

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
especially you know the fact that all

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.400 
especially you know the fact that all
the<00:03:04.040> vampires<00:03:04.640> look<00:03:05.450> like<00:03:05.690> vampires<00:03:06.140> and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
the vampires look like vampires and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.960 
the vampires look like vampires and
nobody<00:03:06.680> seems<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:07.099> notice<00:03:07.250> there's<00:03:07.579> just<00:03:07.790> some

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
nobody seems to notice there's just some

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.390 
nobody seems to notice there's just some

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
things you have to kind of look past you

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.350 
things you have to kind of look past you
know<00:03:10.430> if<00:03:10.610> you're<00:03:10.700> going<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.849> accept<00:03:11.239> the

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.059 
premise and and I think once you do
you'll<00:03:13.760> be<00:03:13.790> surprised<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.950> know

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
the love story actually works not only

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.690 
the love story actually works not only
does<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.530> love<00:03:18.769> story<00:03:19.099> actually<00:03:19.340> work

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
does the love story actually work

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.789 
does the love story actually work
between<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.209> two<00:03:20.359> characters<00:03:20.629> but<00:03:21.560> they

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
between the two characters but they

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.670 
between the two characters but they
leave<00:03:22.129> I<00:03:22.720> think<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.900> fans<00:03:24.170> of<00:03:24.349> the<00:03:24.500> book

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
leave I think the fans of the book

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.660 
leave I think the fans of the book
satisfied<00:03:25.519> toward<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.060> end<00:03:26.239> with<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.670> the

surprisingly<00:04:04.519> well<00:04:04.790> formed<00:04:05.299> you<00:04:06.169> know<00:04:06.319> I<00:04:06.349> mean

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
surprisingly well formed you know I mean

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.289 
surprisingly well formed you know I mean
it<00:04:06.799> definitely<00:04:06.950> misses<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.609> mark<00:04:07.790> a<00:04:07.970> couple

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
it definitely misses the mark a couple

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.050 
it definitely misses the mark a couple
times<00:04:08.540> but<00:04:09.530> this<00:04:09.769> is<00:04:09.980> better<00:04:10.579> than<00:04:10.700> I<00:04:10.849> thought

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
times but this is better than I thought

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.599 
times but this is better than I thought
it<00:04:11.209> was<00:04:11.359> and<00:04:11.799> I'm<00:04:12.799> actually<00:04:13.010> looking<00:04:13.280> forward

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
it was and I'm actually looking forward

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.640 
it was and I'm actually looking forward
to<00:04:13.730> seeing<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.000> sequel<00:04:14.329> me<00:04:14.989> too

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650
