00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
mature when addressing these themes I

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.059 
mature when addressing these themes I
know<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.509> could<00:01:52.929> personally<00:01:53.140> relate<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.830> feel

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.380 
know I could personally relate and feel
for<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.310> characters<00:01:54.759> when<00:01:54.940> they<00:01:55.060> were<00:01:55.119> having

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
for the characters when they were having

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.120

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
to make important life choices that

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.499 
to make important life choices that
could<00:01:57.250> determine<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.880> rest<00:01:58.030> of<00:01:58.179> their<00:01:58.330> life

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
could determine the rest of their life

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.820 
could determine the rest of their life
when<00:01:58.929> you<00:01:59.050> could<00:01:59.170> kind<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.410> tell<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.740> they

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
when you could kind of tell that they

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.320 
when you could kind of tell that they
didn't<00:02:00.100> really<00:02:00.280> feel<00:02:00.459> ready<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.910> make<00:02:01.149> these

but the fit ingredients and blending of
colors<00:03:33.580> did<00:03:33.970> mix<00:03:34.209> a<00:03:34.420> crass<00:03:34.690> will<00:03:34.870> stand<00:03:35.110> out

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319

from most romantic shows it was one of

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.030 
from most romantic shows it was one of
the<00:03:37.690> better<00:03:37.840> attributes<00:03:38.379> to<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.620> show<00:03:38.800> but

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040
