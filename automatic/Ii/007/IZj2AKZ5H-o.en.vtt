00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
here he cut that off right below the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.850 
here he cut that off right below the
license<00:03:30.970> plate<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:32.020> throws<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.560> little<00:03:32.680> bit

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
license plate so throws a little bit

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.650 
license plate so throws a little bit
more<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.190> rooster<00:03:33.340> telling<00:03:33.850> in<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.450> water

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
more of a rooster telling in the water

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.710 
more of a rooster telling in the water

and a little bit more dust but you know
so<00:03:38.170> far<00:03:38.410> so<00:03:38.650> good

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
so far so good

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.580 
so far so good

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
he drilled out the exhaust pipe where he

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.440 
he drilled out the exhaust pipe where he
drilled<00:03:44.080> two<00:03:44.260> six<00:03:44.530> holes<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.910> inner<00:03:46.150> can

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
drilled two six holes in the inner can

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.910 
drilled two six holes in the inner can
here<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:46.840> make<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.200> little<00:03:47.320> bit<00:03:47.470> deeper<00:03:47.709> a

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
here to make it a little bit deeper a

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.770 
here to make it a little bit deeper a
little<00:03:47.980> bit<00:03:48.250> throaty<00:03:48.550> or<00:03:48.730> sound

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
little bit throaty or sound

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.340 
little bit throaty or sound
it's<00:03:51.200> got<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.470> spindles<00:03:51.890> here<00:03:51.950> for<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:53.350> the

lift for the bike to digest a chain of

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.620 
lift for the bike to digest a chain of
stuff<00:03:59.630> around<00:04:00.620> my<00:04:01.060> grams<00:04:02.060> here<00:04:02.300> you<00:04:02.390> can<00:04:02.480> see

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
stuff around my grams here you can see

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.210 
stuff around my grams here you can see
if<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:02.840> can<00:04:02.930> see<00:04:03.080> on<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.320> dust<00:04:03.560> is<00:04:03.830> a

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
if you can see on the dust is a

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.220 
if you can see on the dust is a
reflective<00:04:05.000> stripe<00:04:05.330> that's<00:04:05.720> really<00:04:06.050> nice

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
reflective stripe that's really nice

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.490 
reflective stripe that's really nice
when<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.880> lights<00:04:08.570> hit<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.900> from<00:04:09.050> a<00:04:09.080> car<00:04:09.350> or

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
when the lights hit it from a car or

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.770 
when the lights hit it from a car or
something<00:04:09.740> it<00:04:10.010> really<00:04:10.220> stands<00:04:11.030> out<00:04:11.270> and<00:04:11.510> kind

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
something it really stands out and kind

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.620 
something it really stands out and kind
of<00:04:12.100> makes<00:04:13.100> it<00:04:13.220> nice<00:04:13.430> I've<00:04:13.670> also<00:04:13.900> put<00:04:14.900> an<00:04:15.050> LED

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
of makes it nice I've also put an LED

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.130 
of makes it nice I've also put an LED
light<00:04:17.630> on<00:04:17.840> put<00:04:18.140> an<00:04:18.260> LED<00:04:18.560> strip<00:04:18.620> in<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:19.100> top<00:04:19.310> box

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
light on put an LED strip in the top box

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.190 
light on put an LED strip in the top box
so<00:04:21.140> that<00:04:21.170> it<00:04:21.440> it's<00:04:22.220> an<00:04:22.310> additional<00:04:22.990> tail<00:04:23.990> light

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
so that it it's an additional tail light

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.430 
so that it it's an additional tail light
and<00:04:24.470> then<00:04:24.620> it's<00:04:24.800> also<00:04:25.130> hooked<00:04:25.370> into<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.760> brake

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
and then it's also hooked into the brake

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.870 
and then it's also hooked into the brake
second<00:04:27.440> LED<00:04:27.740> strip<00:04:28.070> so<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.520> gives<00:04:28.670> a<00:04:28.760> little

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
second LED strip so it gives a little

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.120 
second LED strip so it gives a little
bit<00:04:28.970> more<00:04:29.180> visibility<00:04:29.600> from<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.080> back<00:04:33.130> let's

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
bit more visibility from the back let's

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.960 
bit more visibility from the back let's
see<00:04:35.920> when<00:04:36.920> I<00:04:36.950> got<00:04:37.280> this<00:04:37.430> bike<00:04:37.670> from<00:04:37.910> the

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
see when I got this bike from the

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.630 
see when I got this bike from the
previous<00:04:38.450> owner<00:04:38.690> he<00:04:39.020> had<00:04:39.110> lowered<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.770> so

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
previous owner he had lowered it and so

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.330 
previous owner he had lowered it and so
I<00:04:41.090> raised<00:04:42.020> it<00:04:42.230> back<00:04:42.380> up<00:04:42.620> because<00:04:42.950> I<00:04:43.040> wanted<00:04:43.250> the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
I raised it back up because I wanted the

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.300 
I raised it back up because I wanted the
off-road<00:04:43.730> clearance<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.390> so<00:04:45.170> when<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:45.650> he

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
off-road clearance and so when I he

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.100 
off-road clearance and so when I he
lowered<00:04:46.700> it<00:04:46.760> he<00:04:46.880> put<00:04:47.060> a<00:04:47.090> smaller<00:04:47.480> kickstand<00:04:47.960> on

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
lowered it he put a smaller kickstand on

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.350 
lowered it he put a smaller kickstand on
so<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.980> raise<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:49.280> back<00:04:49.430> up<00:04:49.490> I<00:04:49.880> just<00:04:50.150> put<00:04:50.330> a

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
so to raise it back up I just put a

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.870 
so to raise it back up I just put a
hockey<00:04:51.170> puck<00:04:51.470> on<00:04:51.680> there<00:04:51.890> and<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.490> couple<00:04:52.730> of

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
hockey puck on there and a couple of

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.170 
hockey puck on there and a couple of
screws<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:54.380> put<00:04:54.710> about<00:04:54.920> eight<00:04:55.700> thousand

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
screws and I put about eight thousand

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.880 
screws and I put about eight thousand
miles<00:04:56.330> on<00:04:56.510> this<00:04:56.630> bike<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.140> that's<00:04:57.440> still<00:04:57.710> on

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
miles on this bike and that's still on

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.440 
miles on this bike and that's still on
there<00:04:58.040> just<00:04:58.250> as<00:04:58.400> strong<00:04:58.670> as<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:58.910> day<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.060> put<00:04:59.360> it

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
there just as strong as the day I put it

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.260 
there just as strong as the day I put it
on<00:04:59.570> there<00:04:59.780> it's<00:05:00.260> also<00:05:00.440> a<00:05:00.590> wider<00:05:00.860> footprint<00:05:01.460> for

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
on there it's also a wider footprint for

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.750 
on there it's also a wider footprint for
softer<00:05:02.750> sand<00:05:03.050> or<00:05:03.350> you<00:05:03.380> know<00:05:03.590> hot<00:05:03.890> concrete<00:05:04.490> or

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
softer sand or you know hot concrete or

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.659 
softer sand or you know hot concrete or
I<00:05:04.790> mean<00:05:05.030> uh<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:06.080> know<00:05:06.169> pavement<00:05:06.740> where<00:05:07.460> that

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
I mean uh you know pavement where that

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.610 
I mean uh you know pavement where that
could<00:05:07.820> sink<00:05:08.120> in<00:05:08.300> so<00:05:08.510> it's<00:05:09.020> kind<00:05:09.169> of<00:05:09.230> nice<00:05:09.350> as

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
could sink in so it's kind of nice as

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.970 
could sink in so it's kind of nice as
you<00:05:09.710> see<00:05:09.860> it's<00:05:10.010> very<00:05:10.040> sturdy<00:05:10.490> just<00:05:11.360> fold<00:05:11.600> up

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
you see it's very sturdy just fold up

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.930 
you see it's very sturdy just fold up
out<00:05:12.980> of<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.220> way<00:05:13.310> it<00:05:13.430> doesn't<00:05:13.580> get<00:05:13.760> in<00:05:13.850> the<00:05:13.880> way

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
out of the way it doesn't get in the way

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.880 
out of the way it doesn't get in the way
of<00:05:14.060> anything<00:05:14.890> so<00:05:15.890> that's<00:05:16.880> how<00:05:16.970> I<00:05:17.030> fixed<00:05:17.419> that

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
of anything so that's how I fixed that

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.310 
of anything so that's how I fixed that
got<00:05:18.890> an<00:05:18.950> air<00:05:19.100> horn<00:05:19.310> on<00:05:19.550> here<00:05:19.930> we<00:05:20.930> put<00:05:21.140> in<00:05:21.290> place

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
got an air horn on here we put in place

dirt roads and you stop to take a look

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.900 
dirt roads and you stop to take a look
at<00:06:28.740> something<00:06:29.009> or<00:06:29.099> take<00:06:29.250> a<00:06:29.280> break<00:06:29.550> you<00:06:29.699> turn

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910

at something or take a break you turn
those<00:06:30.060> on<00:06:30.300> and<00:06:30.630> it<00:06:30.720> just<00:06:30.860> you<00:06:31.860> know<00:06:31.919> you'll
