just<00:03:12.310> like<00:03:12.520> that's<00:03:14.489> personally<00:03:15.489> I'm<00:03:15.580> not<00:03:15.730> a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
just like that's personally I'm not a

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.370 
just like that's personally I'm not a
big<00:03:15.940> fan<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.239> that<00:03:16.420> kind<00:03:16.810> of<00:03:16.870> thing<00:03:17.080> because<00:03:17.200> I

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
big fan of that kind of thing because I

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.220 
big fan of that kind of thing because I
think<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.739> wears<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:18.100> paint<00:03:18.370> on<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.780> hilt<00:03:20.050> to

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
think it wears the paint on the hilt to

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:28.160 
think it wears the paint on the hilt to
some<00:03:20.440> degree<00:03:21.480> but<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:25.180> works
