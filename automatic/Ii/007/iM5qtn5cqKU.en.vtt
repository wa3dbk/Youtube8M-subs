they<00:00:32.680> have<00:00:32.860> more<00:00:33.040> talk<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.870> helicopter

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469 
they have more talk so the helicopter

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.160 
they have more talk so the helicopter
ceased<00:00:35.649> to<00:00:35.829> fly<00:00:36.070> nicely<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.440> of<00:00:38.650> course<00:00:38.680> they

ceased to fly nicely and of course they

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.420 
ceased to fly nicely and of course they
have<00:00:41.170> metal<00:00:41.500> gears<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.910> in<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:44.430> unfortunate

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430

but likely event in a crash and they

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.510 
but likely event in a crash and they
don't<00:00:49.210> seem<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:49.570> break<00:00:49.930> or<00:00:50.290> at<00:00:50.829> least<00:00:51.130> not<00:00:51.370> as

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
don't seem to break or at least not as

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.580 
don't seem to break or at least not as

easily as these that seem to break every
other<00:00:53.680> crash<00:00:54.540> stripper<00:00:55.540> gear<00:00:57.120> now<00:00:58.120> they're

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
other crash stripper gear now they're

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.500 
other crash stripper gear now they're
not<00:00:58.390> without<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.750> problems<00:00:59.460> basically<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
not without the problems basically the

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.289 
not without the problems basically the
problems<00:01:01.989> are<00:01:02.230> is<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:02.950> tabs<00:01:03.250> on<00:01:03.670> the

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
problems are is that the tabs on the

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.510 
problems are is that the tabs on the
servers<00:01:04.809> are<00:01:05.079> Hollow<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:07.920> when<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:09.070> mount<00:01:09.280> it

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
servers are Hollow so when you mount it

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.910 
servers are Hollow so when you mount it
to<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.760> frame<00:01:10.090> you<00:01:10.360> don't<00:01:10.570> really<00:01:10.780> get<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.140> good

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
to the frame you don't really get a good

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.700 
to the frame you don't really get a good
purchase<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:13.450> just<00:01:13.930> feels<00:01:14.140> a<00:01:14.260> little<00:01:14.290> weak

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
purchase and it just feels a little weak

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.660 
purchase and it just feels a little weak
and<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.040> second<00:01:15.430> part<00:01:15.550> of<00:01:15.790> it<00:01:15.909> is<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.670> tabs

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
and the second part of it is the tabs

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.390 
and the second part of it is the tabs
themselves<00:01:19.270> have<00:01:19.390> little<00:01:19.690> lugs<00:01:19.930> on<00:01:20.140> them<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
themselves have little lugs on them and

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.100 
themselves have little lugs on them and
what<00:01:21.610> this<00:01:21.760> means<00:01:22.090> it<00:01:22.360> well<00:01:22.570> I'll<00:01:22.690> just<00:01:22.720> do

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
what this means it well I'll just do

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.050 
what this means it well I'll just do
this<00:01:23.200> for<00:01:23.260> demonstration<00:01:24.100> pits<00:01:24.400> normally<00:01:24.970> it

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
this for demonstration pits normally it

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.719 
this for demonstration pits normally it
fit<00:01:25.299> under<00:01:25.930> a<00:01:25.960> few<00:01:26.229> of<00:01:26.380> these<00:01:26.500> hex<00:01:27.070> screws<00:01:27.430> and

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
fit under a few of these hex screws and

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.330 
fit under a few of these hex screws and
fit<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:28.090> server<00:01:28.479> inside<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.049> frame<00:01:29.320> but<00:01:29.590> the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
fit the server inside the frame but the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.890 
fit the server inside the frame but the
sake<00:01:30.580> of<00:01:30.610> demonstration<00:01:30.850> I'll<00:01:31.420> just<00:01:31.600> hold<00:01:31.780> it

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
sake of demonstration I'll just hold it

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.280 
sake of demonstration I'll just hold it
up<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.200> side<00:01:33.030> when<00:01:34.030> you<00:01:34.210> fit<00:01:34.420> them<00:01:34.630> into

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
up to the side when you fit them into

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.539 
up to the side when you fit them into
the<00:01:35.500> flame<00:01:36.690> like<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:40.380> little<00:01:41.380> tabs<00:01:41.680> mean

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
the flame like that the little tabs mean

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.440 
the flame like that the little tabs mean
that<00:01:42.760> you<00:01:42.880> don't<00:01:43.060> get<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:45.400> little<00:01:46.030> religious

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
that you don't get the little religious

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.969 
that you don't get the little religious
mean<00:01:46.630> that<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.869> don't<00:01:46.990> get<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.350> tabs<00:01:47.619> flush

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
mean that you don't get the tabs flush

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.700 
mean that you don't get the tabs flush
to<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.189> flame<00:01:48.549> and<00:01:48.760> a<00:01:48.850> nice<00:01:49.689> solid<00:01:50.049> mount<00:01:50.470> it

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
to the flame and a nice solid mount it

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.570 
to the flame and a nice solid mount it
can<00:01:50.920> waddle<00:01:51.610> about<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:52.090> little<00:01:52.390> bit<00:01:53.580> whereas

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
can waddle about a little bit whereas

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.990 
can waddle about a little bit whereas
the<00:01:54.670> gold<00:01:55.049> xtronic<00:01:56.049> servo<00:01:56.580> which<00:01:57.580> is<00:01:57.790> pretty

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
the gold xtronic servo which is pretty

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.640 
the gold xtronic servo which is pretty
much<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.299> standard<00:01:58.630> server<00:01:59.320> for<00:01:59.500> these

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
much the standard server for these

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.570 
much the standard server for these
builds<00:02:00.070> fits<00:02:00.820> perfectly<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.979> how<00:02:03.130> can<00:02:03.189> we<00:02:03.400> make

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
builds fits perfectly so how can we make

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.789 
builds fits perfectly so how can we make
this<00:02:06.299> well<00:02:07.299> a<00:02:07.540> little<00:02:07.810> more<00:02:08.110> like<00:02:08.319> that<00:02:08.530> so

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
this well a little more like that so

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.499 
this well a little more like that so
well<00:02:09.129> what<00:02:09.280> we're<00:02:09.399> going<00:02:09.519> to<00:02:09.670> do<00:02:09.849> is<00:02:10.090> in<00:02:10.330> a

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
well what we're going to do is in a

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.679 
well what we're going to do is in a
nutshell<00:02:11.040> we're<00:02:12.040> going<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.400> fill<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:13.389> hollow

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
nutshell we're going to fill the hollow

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.580 
nutshell we're going to fill the hollow
tabs<00:02:14.819> with<00:02:15.819> 30<00:02:16.120> minute<00:02:16.480> epoxy<00:02:16.779> let<00:02:17.379> you

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
tabs with 30 minute epoxy let you

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.080 
tabs with 30 minute epoxy let you
I<00:02:17.620> overnight<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.489> then<00:02:18.640> we're<00:02:18.790> going<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:18.970> take

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
I overnight and then we're going to take

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.690 
I overnight and then we're going to take
a<00:02:19.239> craft<00:02:19.599> knife<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:20.200> just<00:02:21.069> cut<00:02:21.310> off<00:02:21.459> these

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
a craft knife I just cut off these

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.250 
a craft knife I just cut off these
ridges<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.290> mounts<00:02:23.739> flush<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.550> friend

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
ridges so it mounts flush to the friend

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.869 
ridges so it mounts flush to the friend
and<00:02:26.260> what<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.650> will<00:02:26.860> mean<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:27.340> when<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:27.670> come

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
and what that will mean is when you come

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.530 
and what that will mean is when you come
to<00:02:28.060> set<00:02:28.269> up<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:29.430> cyclic<00:02:30.430> servo<00:02:30.970> put<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.330> arm

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
to set up the cyclic servo put the arm

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.780 
to set up the cyclic servo put the arm
on<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.260> control<00:02:32.709> of<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.129> control<00:02:33.550> rod

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
on and the control of the control rod

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.509 
on and the control of the control rod
will<00:02:33.910> be<00:02:34.030> closer<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.140> vertical<00:02:35.370> then<00:02:36.370> if

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
will be closer to the vertical then if

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.360 
will be closer to the vertical then if
you'd<00:02:36.640> let<00:02:36.879> these<00:02:37.650> annoying<00:02:38.650> little<00:02:38.890> ridges

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
you'd let these annoying little ridges

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.449 
you'd let these annoying little ridges
in<00:02:39.519> place<00:02:39.819> so<00:02:40.379> let's<00:02:41.379> have<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.620> look<00:02:41.709> what<00:02:42.280> all

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
in place so let's have a look what all

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.770 
in place so let's have a look what all
you<00:02:42.580> need<00:02:43.230> well<00:02:44.230> some<00:02:44.860> epoxy<00:02:45.519> heeds<00:02:46.000> adhesive

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
you need well some epoxy heeds adhesive

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.490 
you need well some epoxy heeds adhesive

then let's mix up the epoxy that's

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.750 
then let's mix up the epoxy that's
squirt<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.650> little<00:03:11.890> out<00:03:12.900> he<00:03:13.900> says<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.410> stop

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
there we go let's mix up the epoxy keep

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.340 
there we go let's mix up the epoxy keep
going<00:03:33.890> into<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.310> ones<00:03:34.520> mixed<00:03:35.240> nicely<00:03:35.690> into

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350

nicely<00:03:52.550> mixed<00:03:52.970> in<00:03:53.240> i<00:03:53.360> think<00:03:53.980> no<00:03:54.980> it's<00:03:55.160> uniform

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
nicely mixed in i think no it's uniform

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.610 
nicely mixed in i think no it's uniform
color<00:03:57.700> okay<00:03:58.700> so<00:03:59.600> let's<00:03:59.870> take<00:04:00.140> our<00:04:00.440> servo<00:04:02.620> and

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
color okay so let's take our servo and

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:13.380 
color okay so let's take our servo and
then<00:04:03.830> very<00:04:04.070> carefully<00:04:05.980> go<00:04:06.980> to<00:04:07.240> drop<00:04:08.240> a<00:04:09.130> bead

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:26.080 

give<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.510> poxy<00:04:15.020> into<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.740> hollow<00:04:18.100> cubs

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.369 

slightly<00:04:27.090> too<00:04:27.240> butch<00:04:27.449> is<00:04:27.599> okay<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:28.050> can

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:28.379 
slightly too butch is okay you can

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:29.869 
slightly too butch is okay you can
always<00:04:28.680> turn<00:04:28.919> it<00:04:29.129> up<00:04:29.310> with<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.460> craft<00:04:29.759> knife

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879 
always turn it up with a craft knife

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:33.469 
always turn it up with a craft knife
afterwards<00:04:31.580> but<00:04:32.580> obviously<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.210> not<00:04:33.270> the

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
afterwards but obviously it's not the

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.209 
afterwards but obviously it's not the
kind<00:04:33.689> of<00:04:33.840> stuff<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.080> want<00:04:34.319> to<00:04:34.409> get<00:04:34.560> absolutely

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:35.219 
kind of stuff you want to get absolutely

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:43.940 
kind of stuff you want to get absolutely
everywhere

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.830 

ok

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.350 

that's<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.980> first<00:04:51.250> part<00:04:51.520> of<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:51.880> job<00:04:52.090> done

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
that's the first part of the job done

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.610 
that's the first part of the job done
now<00:04:52.740> 30<00:04:53.740> minutes<00:04:54.250> is<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:55.570> time<00:04:55.840> it<00:04:56.080> takes<00:04:56.110> for

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
now 30 minutes is the time it takes for

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.490 
now 30 minutes is the time it takes for
it<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.740> harden<00:04:57.690> but<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.810> truth<00:04:59.050> of<00:04:59.229> the<00:04:59.290> matter

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
it to harden but the truth of the matter

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.659 
it to harden but the truth of the matter
is<00:04:59.830> you<00:04:59.860> better<00:05:00.190> off<00:05:00.460> leaving<00:05:00.669> it<00:05:01.620> overnight

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
is you better off leaving it overnight

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.030 
is you better off leaving it overnight
it's<00:05:03.669> a<00:05:03.790> completely<00:05:04.270> hard<00:05:04.540> sell<00:05:04.960> we'll<00:05:05.830> leave

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
it's a completely hard sell we'll leave

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.370 
it's a completely hard sell we'll leave
this<00:05:06.190> overnight<00:05:06.660> returns<00:05:07.660> of<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:07.930> project

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
this overnight returns of the project

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.090 
this overnight returns of the project
tomorrow<00:05:11.580> okay<00:05:12.580> so<00:05:13.210> now<00:05:13.449> the<00:05:13.560> epoxy<00:05:14.560> adhesive

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
tomorrow okay so now the epoxy adhesive

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.350 
tomorrow okay so now the epoxy adhesive
has<00:05:15.360> sat<00:05:16.360> hard<00:05:16.840> overnight<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:18.090> tabs<00:05:19.090> are

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
has sat hard overnight and the tabs are

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.850 
has sat hard overnight and the tabs are
not<00:05:20.350> a<00:05:20.380> look<00:05:20.770> stronger<00:05:21.220> now<00:05:22.380> what<00:05:23.380> we<00:05:23.530> can<00:05:23.710> do

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
not a look stronger now what we can do

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.600 
not a look stronger now what we can do
now<00:05:24.100> is<00:05:24.130> take<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:24.820> hobby<00:05:25.240> knife<00:05:25.510> and

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
now is take the hobby knife and

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:33.570 
now is take the hobby knife and
carefully<00:05:27.610> cut<00:05:28.270> away<00:05:30.570> like<00:05:31.570> that<00:05:31.600> the<00:05:32.590> little

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
carefully cut away like that the little

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.080 
carefully cut away like that the little
ridges<00:05:33.970> that<00:05:34.210> are<00:05:35.110> on<00:05:35.320> top<00:05:35.590> of<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.830> tabs<00:05:36.100> and

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
ridges that are on top of the tabs and

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.990 
ridges that are on top of the tabs and
then<00:05:37.210> when<00:05:37.419> you've<00:05:37.570> done<00:05:37.810> that<00:05:39.000> there's

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
then when you've done that there's

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.640 
then when you've done that there's
almost<00:05:40.360> an<00:05:40.660> already<00:05:40.990> dumped<00:05:42.479> spoil<00:05:43.479> away<00:05:43.810> any

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
almost an already dumped spoil away any

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.180 
almost an already dumped spoil away any
remaining<00:05:45.130> bits<00:05:46.080> so<00:05:47.080> it's<00:05:47.229> all<00:05:47.410> nice<00:05:47.620> and<00:05:47.949> flat

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
remaining bits so it's all nice and flat

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.210 
remaining bits so it's all nice and flat
and<00:05:48.250> tidy<00:05:48.729> and<00:05:48.970> then<00:05:49.150> the<00:05:49.330> servo<00:05:49.840> can<00:05:50.110> fit<00:05:50.949> nice

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
and tidy and then the servo can fit nice

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
and tidy and then the servo can fit nice
and<00:05:51.370> flush<00:05:52.139> to<00:05:53.139> the<00:05:53.400> inside<00:05:54.400> of<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.760> frame<00:05:55.000> and

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
and flush to the inside of the frame and

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.540 
and flush to the inside of the frame and
give<00:05:55.389> you<00:05:55.539> a<00:05:55.570> nice<00:05:55.840> geometry<00:05:56.470> for<00:05:56.680> your<00:05:56.860> cyclic

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
give you a nice geometry for your cyclic

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.520

these<00:06:10.870> four<00:06:11.260> screws<00:06:11.940> and<00:06:13.320> pull<00:06:14.320> the<00:06:14.620> servo

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
these four screws and pull the servo

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.339 
these four screws and pull the servo
apart<00:06:15.910> along<00:06:17.669> here<00:06:18.870> it<00:06:19.870> could<00:06:20.050> be<00:06:20.139> a<00:06:20.169> little

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
apart along here it could be a little

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:24.600 
apart along here it could be a little
bit<00:06:20.560> of<00:06:20.710> resistance<00:06:21.070> because<00:06:21.789> the<00:06:23.610> output

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
bit of resistance because the output

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.879 
bit of resistance because the output
shaft<00:06:24.639> is<00:06:25.120> inside<00:06:25.510> a<00:06:25.539> bearing<00:06:26.139> pull<00:06:26.620> it<00:06:26.740> apart

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 
shaft is inside a bearing pull it apart

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.890 
shaft is inside a bearing pull it apart
and<00:06:27.340> you<00:06:27.490> can<00:06:27.669> insert<00:06:28.000> it<00:06:28.210> through<00:06:28.240> the<00:06:28.660> frame

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
and you can insert it through the frame

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.960 
and you can insert it through the frame
and<00:06:29.169> that<00:06:29.380> sets<00:06:29.650> it<00:06:29.800> all<00:06:29.919> very<00:06:30.190> nicely<00:06:30.430> so<00:06:30.849> you

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
and that sets it all very nicely so you

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.850 
and that sets it all very nicely so you
may<00:06:31.120> just<00:06:31.330> need<00:06:31.389> to<00:06:31.690> trim<00:06:32.280> the<00:06:34.229> hard<00:06:35.229> epoxy<00:06:35.830> on

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
may just need to trim the hard epoxy on

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.390 
may just need to trim the hard epoxy on
the<00:06:36.099> inside<00:06:36.520> so<00:06:36.880> these<00:06:37.060> the<00:06:37.479> inside<00:06:37.930> of<00:06:37.960> the

holes<00:06:43.030> on<00:06:43.360> these<00:06:43.539> servants<00:06:44.139> are<00:06:44.410> a<00:06:44.440> little

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
holes on these servants are a little

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:56.430 
holes on these servants are a little
bigger<00:06:45.870> and<00:06:47.160> say<00:06:48.160> the<00:06:48.340> hex<00:06:48.550> tronic<00:06:50.280> hxt<00:06:51.660> 900<00:06:55.440> so

sometimes you have to be a little bit

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.880 
sometimes you have to be a little bit
creative<00:06:58.150> about<00:06:58.630> what<00:06:58.900> to<00:06:59.080> mount<00:06:59.260> north<00:06:59.650> on
