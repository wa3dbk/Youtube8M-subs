00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.990
 I'm going to shoot 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.290
 hello how about people how are we andrés 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.720
 of that radar and today I bring you in pole 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.210
 on they use the and pokemon favorite to say 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.029
 true and today I bring you the strategies 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.790
 of employment let's play a pokémon 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.520
 type downpour as many already know is 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.450
 only weak to ground fighter and 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.280
 electricity 380 and 4.5 kilos and the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.309
 torrent skills that increase us the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.160
 movements of water by 1.5 when having a 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.840
 third less than hp and they said that we 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.540
 increases the attack in two stages if we 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.890
 they drop some other statistic wants 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.930
 tell 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.600
 with decías we are going to mint the attack 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.610
 but it is only and is caused by 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.830
 the opponent 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.880
 the employment statistics are very 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:02.880
 average so to speak several 82 yen 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.390
 so they will look at level 50 and 100 as 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.110
 can see spend 300 statistics 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.080
 except attack and speed but I say that 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.650
 298 and those 240 maximized are not for 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.240
 not bad either those defenses 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.680
 let's continue to what are the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.320
 strategies after I have 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.659
 used on pole on quite a few years and 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.569
 now more connection white 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.060
 the first would be scale there is inflection 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:33.420
 jacquire focused especially on the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.520
 defense ad and special attack to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.909
 quiet to save them from the odd 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.939
 thing 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.249
 object to solbes to have defense 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.490
 special and so balance it with the bosses 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:48.369
 of defense and quiet so that it does not affect 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.409
 for nothing the light attack change would be 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.659
 yesterday for another would be ras not 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.299
 I have a strategy is basically what 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.630
 same except that the object would be the tree 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.980
 and the babies will be focused on hp and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.280
 special attack 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.280
 a small change would be europe brass no 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.560
 for those who want to sleep at their 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.319
 opponent although this is to take a chance 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.989
 the third strategy for singles that 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.599
 It's physical and used but I still do not 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.060
 ends convincing is a quiet steve 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.370
 wynn erc which is worth stands the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.069
 skill will be torrent equal object 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.650
 leftovers and beings focused on 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.780
 attack and hp adam and for that matter the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.450
 attack and the slight changes that 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.660
 could do would be to put war fault 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.150
 from a quiet for fun instead of 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.420
 click 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.290
 we can also change the object to 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.380
 iphone 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.110
 including the ability to defend 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.630
 in doubles I found one but it is very common 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.170
 so to speak which consists of surfing 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.140
 slingrider with the rock object we can 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.240
 increase is grade ends to quiet for ya 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.150
 They know how to save us some things 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.250
 have seen the streams will understand and the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.930
 babies will be in 252 hp and also in 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.630
 expression quiet attack so that we 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.260
 Amount in special attack but do not go down 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.690
 attack and a change or slight changes 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.050
 would be object to the safety googles for 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.330
 avoid the hailstorm use ready and 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.060
 take advantage of this hailstorm and flash 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.880
 channel it should be said that for the latter 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.470
 two rather one we would have to have a 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.720
 pokémon friend who has thunder protect 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.560
 yale or something else so that we 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.209
 do so much damage 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.890
 these are all the strategies that 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.569
 can count on employment not which I 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.330
 I use nothing else to finish I want to 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.130
 mentioning the good and the bad the good is 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.959
 that your states are very average wants 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.290
 saying time is a bit very very varied 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.200
 in this aspect even has good hp to 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.440
 any that saves you from anything 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.170
 that has already little life scouts that can 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.959
 burn and that's really surprising 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.110
 people are surprised when scout hits 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.690
 with burn and when he used quiet and that 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:18.010
 his combination of types personally 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.320
 It makes me perfect even though they are 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.639
 guys that are not my favorites like 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.129
 I already mentioned in a streaming 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.169
 the bad thing is that you can not catch the 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:29.419
 object and sometimes you depend a lot on it 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.580
 also the movements that I have 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.460
 fear with the standard volleyball and plus 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.629
 fought and that his hidden ability said 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.629
 it's not very good to say 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.689
 that's why he awarded him a 9.5 out of 10 am 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.489
 polio 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.860

 social networks are showing up there 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:53.069
 we have the group the facebook and the 

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:54.989
