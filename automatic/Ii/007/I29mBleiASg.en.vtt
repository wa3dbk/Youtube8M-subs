 a quarter of onion apart a tooth of 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.500
 marjoram and thyme garlic and an egg and this 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.560
 is what first thing we do 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.510
 we are going to cook it, not rice 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.680
 let's know very well nothing more a 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.570
 precocity and we are going to make a caldillo 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.500
 let's make a stew with the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.320
 tomato onion and garlic then 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.750
 let's start here I'm going to put 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.500
 liquefy what was the tomatoes with the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.890
 onion and garlic and here I already have pre 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.690
 baking on grids on sides ready 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.310
 after I wait for about 5 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.310
 minutes you have to dry it should not 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.500
 get very cooked nothing more than just 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.410
 It thickens says and you get to perceive 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.180
 and then what we are going to do is 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.730
 stir it with the meat to the flesh 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.910
 let's put salt and what is being 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.790
 the egg and let's prepare the 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.920
 meatballs and while in a saucepan 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.890
 let's put what is being 2 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.679
 tablespoons of oil and let's fry the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.310
 Onion, fry the onion until it 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.930
 an already transparent appearance we are going to 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.500
 hope it has a little bit transparent 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.330
 that's almost there and then I'm going to 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.540
 add what is the caldillo 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.830
 of tomato that here is the meat 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.630
 already stirred with rice and egg and 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.900
 apart from me I like to put a 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:37.070
 spoonful of cornstarch to absorb a 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.520
 little moisture and they do better 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.380
 meatballs 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.480
 then the day here what we are going to 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.260
 to do is to prepare them to grab it with 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.700
 the spoon to make the ball 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.560
 and enter them 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.370
 the caldito 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.050
 to the caldillo I add it as a medium 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.030
 liter of water more than you have 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.740
 put now I'm waiting for you 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.020
 boil 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.410
 and as in what I prepare the 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.490
 6 meatballs well so I'm going to put 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.270
 also the error herbs 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:14.870
 and finished making meatballs and me 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.020
 six of a quarter of meat came out 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.860
 So what we are doing is going 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.530
 introducing 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.530
 to the caldillo without writing down the energy 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.060
 then checking where we put it 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.510
 so we do not crush them 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.849
 and we hope to boil more or less you 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.520
 serve after boiling about 15-20 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.790
 minutes here are ready 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.849
 meatballs 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.099
 they were occupied more or less between 15 and 20 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.189
 minutes exactly as I was telling you already 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.890
 they're ready and now we're going to serve them 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:55.620
 here are the meatballs ready for 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.000
 taste them and taste the real ones that 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.769
