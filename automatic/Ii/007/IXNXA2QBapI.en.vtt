00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
off and this gun entirely sure where

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.240 
off and this gun entirely sure where
exactly<00:03:42.709> this<00:03:43.220> plugs<00:03:43.639> in<00:03:43.910> i<00:03:44.919> get<00:03:45.919> i'm<00:03:46.010> gonna

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
exactly this plugs in i get i'm gonna

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.099 
exactly this plugs in i get i'm gonna
guess<00:03:47.379> i'm<00:03:48.379> behind<00:03:48.919> them<00:03:49.419> this<00:03:50.419> is<00:03:50.569> so<00:03:50.660> this

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
guess i'm behind them this is so this

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.449 
guess i'm behind them this is so this
does<00:03:51.260> okay<00:03:51.530> i<00:03:51.560> think<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:51.799> back<00:03:51.919> this<00:03:52.069> one<00:03:52.220> pegs

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
does okay i think it back this one pegs

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.770 
does okay i think it back this one pegs
in<00:03:53.109> back<00:03:54.109> here<00:03:54.560> is<00:03:55.489> how<00:03:55.639> that<00:03:55.790> works<00:03:55.970> ok<00:03:56.540> cool

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
in back here is how that works ok cool

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.990 
in back here is how that works ok cool
so<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:57.769> doesn't<00:03:58.069> actually<00:03:58.160> use<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.609> hinge<00:03:58.819> it

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
so it doesn't actually use the hinge it

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.610 
so it doesn't actually use the hinge it
pegs<00:03:59.209> in<00:03:59.359> on<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.569> back<00:03:59.720> of<00:03:59.750> the<00:04:00.079> least<00:04:00.260> not<00:04:00.470> in

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
pegs in on the back of the least not in

would have that back there because

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.089 
would have that back there because
there's<00:04:05.260> nothing<00:04:06.260> to<00:04:06.440> peg<00:04:06.680> into<00:04:06.919> it<00:04:06.980> that's

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
there's nothing to peg into it that's

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.220 
there's nothing to peg into it that's
just<00:04:07.160> we're<00:04:07.430> just<00:04:07.870> but<00:04:08.870> they're<00:04:09.019> so<00:04:09.049> you

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
that's what it looks like with these

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.890 
that's what it looks like with these
guns<00:04:11.650> then<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:12.829> backpack<00:04:13.569> can<00:04:14.569> just<00:04:14.720> hide

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
guns then this backpack can just hide

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.250 
guns then this backpack can just hide
back<00:04:15.109> here

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
back here

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.840 
back here
and<00:04:17.130> PEG<00:04:17.370> on<00:04:19.280> like<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:22.610> maybe<00:04:23.610> like<00:04:23.790> this

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
and PEG on like this maybe like this

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.040 
and PEG on like this maybe like this
they<00:04:24.510> can<00:04:24.660> peg<00:04:24.870> on<00:04:25.050> back<00:04:25.290> here<00:04:26.870> there<00:04:27.870> we<00:04:27.960> go

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
they can peg on back here there we go

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.780 
they can peg on back here there we go
just<00:04:28.080> like<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.320> pic<00:04:28.980> onto<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.280> back<00:04:29.430> of<00:04:29.460> this

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
just like that pic onto the back of this

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.370 
just like that pic onto the back of this
the<00:04:30.510> tank<00:04:33.740> so<00:04:34.740> there's<00:04:34.920> that<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.340> then

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
the tank so there's that and then

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.580 
the tank so there's that and then
transform<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.500> robot<00:04:37.530> mode<00:04:39.710> peg<00:04:40.710> this<00:04:42.590> not

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
transform to robot mode peg this not

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.740 
transform to robot mode peg this not
sure<00:04:43.740> if<00:04:43.860> this<00:04:43.920> just<00:04:44.160> keeps<00:04:44.550> hanging<00:04:45.300> on<00:04:45.540> back

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
sure if this just keeps hanging on back

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.530 
sure if this just keeps hanging on back
here<00:04:46.020> or<00:04:46.140> not<00:04:46.260> but<00:04:47.190> give<00:04:47.910> them<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.120> robot<00:04:48.390> move

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
here or not but give them to robot move

00:04:48.540 --> 00:05:03.650 
here or not but give them to robot move
here<00:04:48.720> and<00:05:00.950> just<00:05:01.950> like<00:05:02.340> on<00:05:02.580> stronghold<00:05:03.240> go

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
here and just like on stronghold go

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.920 
here and just like on stronghold go
ahead<00:05:05.030> inside<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.180> backpack<00:05:06.390> is<00:05:08.480> a<00:05:09.480> little

ahead inside the backpack is a little

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.750 
ahead inside the backpack is a little
tight<00:05:10.050> this<00:05:10.350> also<00:05:10.530> works<00:05:10.860> with<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.340> onslaught

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
tight this also works with the onslaught

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.880 
tight this also works with the onslaught
mold<00:05:12.030> just<00:05:12.900> like<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.110> original<00:05:13.200> one<00:05:13.500> did<00:05:13.710> and

mold just like the original one did and

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.350 
mold just like the original one did and
base<00:05:14.010> call<00:05:14.190> you<00:05:14.310> do<00:05:14.430> is<00:05:14.550> unscrew<00:05:14.730> on<00:05:15.060> slots

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
base call you do is unscrew on slots

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.940 
base call you do is unscrew on slots
head<00:05:15.540> and<00:05:15.750> this<00:05:15.930> peg<00:05:16.140> is<00:05:16.260> right<00:05:16.410> on<00:05:16.560> over<00:05:16.740> it

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.190 
head and this peg is right on over it
just<00:05:17.460> pegged<00:05:17.670> right<00:05:17.880> on<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.120> round<00:05:18.270> peg<00:05:18.420> but

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
just pegged right on the round peg but

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.870 
just pegged right on the round peg but
there<00:05:19.320> is<00:05:19.350> also<00:05:19.650> a<00:05:19.800> little<00:05:19.980> peg<00:05:20.250> included<00:05:20.760> in

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
there is also a little peg included in

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
here that plugs into the head as you can

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.130 
here that plugs into the head as you can
see<00:05:23.610> that<00:05:23.790> more<00:05:24.060> than<00:05:24.300> what<00:05:24.570> kind<00:05:24.750> of<00:05:24.810> mimics

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
see that more than what kind of mimics

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.880 
see that more than what kind of mimics
the<00:05:25.460> original<00:05:26.460> clip<00:05:26.760> system<00:05:27.000> here<00:05:27.560> so<00:05:28.560> you<00:05:28.650> can

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
the original clip system here so you can

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.180 
the original clip system here so you can
plug<00:05:29.900> this<00:05:30.900> head<00:05:31.170> directly<00:05:31.320> into<00:05:31.620> there<00:05:32.010> and

knew it was loose I did not realize it

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.640 
knew it was loose I did not realize it
was<00:05:49.920> quite<00:05:49.980> that<00:05:50.190> loose<00:05:51.290> so<00:05:52.290> you<00:05:52.320> can<00:05:52.440> see<00:05:52.560> it

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
strength and intelligence meters I'm not

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.250 
strength and intelligence meters I'm not
sure<00:05:58.590> if<00:05:58.710> that's<00:05:58.800> exactly<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.340> same<00:05:59.580> is<00:06:00.080> his<00:06:01.080> i

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
sure if that's exactly the same is his i

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.310 
sure if that's exactly the same is his i
believe<00:06:01.500> it<00:06:01.590> is<00:06:01.680> yeah<00:06:01.980> cool<00:06:02.490> look<00:06:02.670> at<00:06:02.760> that

then gives him a little bit more

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.250 
then gives him a little bit more
intelligence<00:06:05.660> because<00:06:06.660> he's<00:06:06.810> a<00:06:06.840> whole<00:06:07.080> new

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260
