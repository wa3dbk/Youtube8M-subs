hi today on American English daily we

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.329 
hi today on American English daily we
are<00:00:03.419> going<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.780> be<00:00:03.870> looking<00:00:04.170> at<00:00:04.380> two<00:00:04.830> more

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
are going to be looking at two more

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.670 
are going to be looking at two more
conjunctions<00:00:06.210> that<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.049> can<00:00:07.259> use<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.649> your

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
conjunctions that you can use in your

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.400 
conjunctions that you can use in your
speaking<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.309> writing<00:00:08.750> the<00:00:09.750> conjunctions

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
speaking and writing the conjunctions

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.749 
speaking and writing the conjunctions
we're<00:00:10.620> going<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.950> look<00:00:11.099> at<00:00:11.280> today<00:00:11.639> are<00:00:11.960> so<00:00:12.960> and

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
we're going to look at today are so and

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.710 
we're going to look at today are so and
yet<00:00:15.440> let's<00:00:16.440> start<00:00:16.740> by<00:00:16.859> looking<00:00:17.010> at<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.720> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
yet let's start by looking at so the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.900 
yet let's start by looking at so the
conjunctions<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:19.970> shows<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.710> consequence<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:23.189> a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
conjunctions so shows a consequence or a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.960 
conjunctions so shows a consequence or a
logical<00:00:24.689> conclusion<00:00:25.490> where<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> first

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
logical conclusion where the first

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.970 
logical conclusion where the first
sentence<00:00:28.160> causes<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.820> second<00:00:30.269> sentence

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
sentence causes the second sentence

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.680 
sentence causes the second sentence
let's<00:00:31.980> look<00:00:32.189> at<00:00:32.279> two<00:00:32.460> sentences<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.360> we<00:00:33.480> can

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
let's look at two sentences that we can

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.680 
let's look at two sentences that we can
connect<00:00:34.140> using<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.899> was<00:00:36.899> cold<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:38.540> put<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
connect using so I was cold I put on a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.330 
connect using so I was cold I put on a
jacket<00:00:40.550> here<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.940> first<00:00:42.270> sentence<00:00:43.340> causes

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
jacket here the first sentence causes

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
jacket here the first sentence causes
the<00:00:44.940> action<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> second<00:00:46.170> sentence<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:48.809> we

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the action in the second sentence so we

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.500 
the action in the second sentence so we
connect<00:00:49.649> these<00:00:49.800> sentences<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.910> manner<00:00:51.180> I

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
connect these sentences in this manner I

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.299 
connect these sentences in this manner I
was<00:00:52.350> cold<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.399> put<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> jacket<00:00:55.129> let's<00:00:56.129> look

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
was cold so I put on a jacket let's look

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
was cold so I put on a jacket let's look
at<00:00:56.430> another<00:00:56.550> example<00:00:56.789> using<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:59.180> we<00:01:00.180> were

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
at another example using so we were

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.300 
at another example using so we were
hungry<00:01:02.180> we<00:01:03.530> made<00:01:04.530> some<00:01:04.799> food<00:01:05.900> we<00:01:06.900> were<00:01:07.020> hungry

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
hungry we made some food we were hungry

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.390 
hungry we made some food we were hungry
so<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:09.210> made<00:01:09.420> some<00:01:09.659> food<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.860> second<00:01:11.220> action

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
so we made some food the second action

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.320 
so we made some food the second action
is<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.330> consequence<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.850> whatever<00:01:14.850> happened

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
is the consequence of whatever happened

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.539 
is the consequence of whatever happened
in<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> first<00:01:15.900> sentence<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.159> way<00:01:17.369> we

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
in the first sentence and in this way we

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.899 
in the first sentence and in this way we
can<00:01:17.729> connect<00:01:18.090> them<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> conjunction<00:01:18.750> so

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
can connect them with the conjunction so

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.320 
can connect them with the conjunction so
okay<00:01:20.909> let's<00:01:21.659> look<00:01:21.840> at<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> conjunction<00:01:22.650> yet

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
okay let's look at the conjunction yet

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.499 
okay let's look at the conjunction yet
yet<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.600> used<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.350> show<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.860> contrast<00:01:26.460> or<00:01:27.240> an

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
yet is used to show a contrast or an

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.710 
yet is used to show a contrast or an
exception<00:01:28.369> where<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.759> second<00:01:30.240> sentence

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
exception where the second sentence

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.380 
exception where the second sentence
doesn't<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.799> fit<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> first

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
doesn't really fit with the first

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.109 
doesn't really fit with the first
sentence<00:01:33.869> they<00:01:34.650> are<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.159> contrast<00:01:35.850> or

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
sentence they are in contrast or

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.990 
sentence they are in contrast or
exceptions<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.049> each<00:01:37.200> other<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> let's<00:01:38.880> look

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
exceptions to each other so let's look

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.590 
exceptions to each other so let's look
at<00:01:39.180> these<00:01:39.299> two<00:01:39.509> sentences<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:41.060> took<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> camera

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
at these two sentences I took a camera

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.330 
at these two sentences I took a camera
on<00:01:43.049> my<00:01:43.320> trip<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.920> China<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:45.770> didn't<00:01:46.770> take<00:01:47.040> any

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
on my trip to China I didn't take any

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.719 
on my trip to China I didn't take any
pictures<00:01:48.259> now<00:01:49.259> those<00:01:49.680> two<00:01:49.920> sentences<00:01:50.280> don't

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
pictures now those two sentences don't

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.319 
pictures now those two sentences don't
really<00:01:51.060> make<00:01:51.210> sense<00:01:51.860> if<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.310> took<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> camera<00:01:53.909> on

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
really make sense if I took a camera on

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.830 
really make sense if I took a camera on
a<00:01:54.390> trip<00:01:54.869> or<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.380> vacation<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:56.600> should<00:01:57.600> take<00:01:57.780> some

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
a trip or a vacation I should take some

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.010 
a trip or a vacation I should take some
pictures<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.770> remember<00:01:59.219> my<00:01:59.340> trip<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:00.810> I

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
pictures to remember my trip but I

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.050 
pictures to remember my trip but I
didn't<00:02:01.350> take<00:02:01.500> any<00:02:01.649> pictures<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.030> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
didn't take any pictures so this is a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.780 
didn't take any pictures so this is a
contrast<00:02:03.750> or<00:02:04.020> an<00:02:04.110> exception<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:05.490> what<00:02:05.670> we

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
contrast or an exception to what we

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.839 
contrast or an exception to what we
think<00:02:06.240> would<00:02:07.110> happen<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:08.399> these<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.819> be

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
think would happen so these can be

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.109 
think would happen so these can be
connected<00:02:09.420> using

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
connected using

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.670 
connected using
I<00:02:10.800> took<00:02:11.800> a<00:02:12.069> camera<00:02:12.640> on<00:02:12.880> my<00:02:13.090> trip<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.450> China<00:02:13.680> yet

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
I took a camera on my trip to China yet

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.510 
I took a camera on my trip to China yet
I<00:02:15.010> didn't<00:02:15.700> take<00:02:15.880> any<00:02:16.030> pictures<00:02:17.250> let's<00:02:18.250> look<00:02:18.400> at

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
I didn't take any pictures let's look at

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.270 
I didn't take any pictures let's look at
another<00:02:18.610> example<00:02:19.020> using<00:02:20.020> yet<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.830> show<00:02:21.010> a

don't speak Spanish we can connect these
two<00:02:33.519> sentences<00:02:33.910> using<00:02:34.630> yet<00:02:35.550> everyone<00:02:36.550> in<00:02:36.670> my
