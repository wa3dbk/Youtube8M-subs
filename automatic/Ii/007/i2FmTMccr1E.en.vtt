hello you do this a dark pattern on that

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.100 
hello you do this a dark pattern on that
six<00:00:02.370> point<00:00:02.580> where<00:00:02.700> you<00:00:02.879> could<00:00:03.030> take<00:00:03.840> out<00:00:03.990> them

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
today I'm going to show you how to speed

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.150 
today I'm going to show you how to speed
a<00:00:05.250> graph<00:00:05.520> hard<00:00:05.700> without<00:00:05.850> any<00:00:06.540> major<00:00:07.440> mods<00:00:07.830> like

how like the ram mods where you can have
more<00:00:13.710> virtual<00:00:14.370> memory<00:00:14.719> stuff<00:00:15.719> they<00:00:15.870> can<00:00:15.929> screw

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
more virtual memory stuff they can screw

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.070 
more virtual memory stuff they can screw
up<00:00:16.440> your<00:00:16.619> iPod<00:00:16.920> such<00:00:17.520> as<00:00:17.699> taking<00:00:18.480> off<00:00:18.570> demons

you can see my unlock and stuff is

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.529 
you can see my unlock and stuff is
faster<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.840> i'm<00:00:24.960> using<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.910> tweet<00:00:26.910> called<00:00:27.210> fate

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
your animations like when the ex atta

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.580 
your animations like when the ex atta
apps<00:01:43.649> or<00:01:43.890> open<00:01:44.700> up<00:01:44.790> at<00:01:44.940> such<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.720> settings<00:01:46.380> as

you<00:01:46.680> can<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.009> makes<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> pastor<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.820> you

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you can see it makes the pastor and you

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.180 
you can see it makes the pastor and you

can come to your settings and you can

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.270 
can come to your settings and you can
change<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.729> speed<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.330> going<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> hear

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
change the speed of it going to hear

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.060 
change the speed of it going to hear
animation<00:01:53.280> speeds<00:01:53.580> and<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.149> go<00:01:54.299> up<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
animation speeds and you can go up to

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.790 
animation speeds and you can go up to
there<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:56.520> here<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:58.380> see<00:01:58.409> it

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
there and then here as you see it

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.889 
there and then here as you see it
increases<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.340> speed<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.360> animations

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
increases the speed of the animations

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.700 
increases the speed of the animations
dramatically<00:02:03.319> it's<00:02:04.319> pretty<00:02:04.500> much<00:02:04.649> just

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
dramatically it's pretty much just

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.100 
dramatically it's pretty much just
taking<00:02:05.190> them<00:02:05.280> away<00:02:05.369> or<00:02:06.149> making<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.960> little

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
taking them away or making a little

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.389 
taking them away or making a little
faster<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:07.710> depends<00:02:08.069> on<00:02:08.160> how<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.310> want

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
faster it just depends on how you want

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.059 
faster it just depends on how you want
to<00:02:08.580> put<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.940> but<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:10.080> will<00:02:10.289> see<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.649> extreme

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
to put it but you will see the extreme

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.720 
to put it but you will see the extreme
speed<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.610> up<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:12.420> your<00:02:12.630> ipod<00:02:13.019> or<00:02:13.319> iphone<00:02:13.769> or

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
speed it up in your ipod or iphone or

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.390 
speed it up in your ipod or iphone or
ipad<00:02:15.540> i<00:02:15.930> don't<00:02:16.500> i<00:02:16.590> don't<00:02:16.739> know<00:02:16.950> if<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.100> works<00:02:17.190> on
