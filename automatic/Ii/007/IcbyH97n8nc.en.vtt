00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
flip over the case and the game says it

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.260 
flip over the case and the game says it
supports<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.679> link<00:01:54.920> cable<00:01:55.250> what<00:01:55.940> that<00:01:56.090> really

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
gradual damage which is pretty

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.129 
gradual damage which is pretty
impressive<00:04:05.040> stuff<00:04:05.280> for<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.669> ps1<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.720> get<00:04:06.870> been

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
impressive stuff for the ps1 to get been

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.530 
impressive stuff for the ps1 to get been
up<00:04:07.319> they<00:04:07.709> start<00:04:07.949> to<00:04:08.069> smoke<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:09.000> actually<00:04:09.299> feels

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
up they start to smoke it actually feels

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.420 
up they start to smoke it actually feels
good<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:10.079> maybe<00:04:10.530> when<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.709> smash<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.069> car

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
good to like maybe when you smash a car

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.149 
good to like maybe when you smash a car
from<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.790> side<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.569> get<00:04:12.659> that<00:04:12.810> nice<00:04:13.159> violent

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
from the side you get that nice violent

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.849 
from the side you get that nice violent
sense<00:04:14.489> of<00:04:14.669> impact<00:04:15.030> car<00:04:15.659> spin<00:04:16.139> all<00:04:16.470> over<00:04:16.769> the

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
sense of impact car spin all over the

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.250 
sense of impact car spin all over the
place<00:04:17.070> they<00:04:17.310> fly<00:04:17.669> everywhere<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:18.780> for<00:04:18.959> what<00:04:19.109> it

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
place they fly everywhere so for what it

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.539 
place they fly everywhere so for what it
is

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
is

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.099 
is
