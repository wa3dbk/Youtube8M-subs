00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 well I think the reason for creating 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.330
 this work is a bit 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.189
 first because I really want to do 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.500
 something different that is not game 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.809
 psychology theory or the psychology of what 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.059
 that we are in some way what I have 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.430
 used to the public to the public magician 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.619
 I mean but doing this job 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.539
 so that in some way you think more 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.550
 beyond the game I thought I thought beyond 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.619
 of the technique you think beyond the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.239
 table not that we jump now towards 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.640
 the session and we can see the session from 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.340
 the bird's eye view 'I always 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.290
 I say that the more you know better you can 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.730
 do not you can not get to a place 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.170
 who knows absolutely no one to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.510
 see what comes out everything has to be low 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.100
 control because in some way your mission 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.750
 is to give a show to the people that the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.610
 people receive everything they are seeing 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.980
 as a show as soon as everything is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.900
 more under control easier it will be you 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.030
 move on what you already know not about 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.130
 your own experience I like 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.470
 always and this is in some way what 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.690
 this work gives title to work in 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.550
 house is to say that everything is already 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.950
 you know as if you work in the classroom 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.300
 your house every day the state of your house you 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.369
 you know where you have the little table where 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.990
 they have the objects how they have the table 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.210
 you feel comfortable in any situation 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.200
 and that's the idea of bringing your living room 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.850
 house everywhere 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.469
 the world so that in some way you 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.020
 you feel very comfortable so that everything 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:17.310
 do you get out of the muscle memory that 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.590
 you do not have to think what you have to 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.110
 to do and in some way to always give 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.640
 the same show does not reach a 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.100
 show quality and try to imitate 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.810
 that quality, every time they do it and 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.729
 that is done simply by knowing the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.049
 souls with whom he works if everything is 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.240
 same the same way and always 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.740
 works in the same way despite 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.969
 much of the public puts the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.799
 public is the one that puts the quality of 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.869
 show but all you can 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.310
 to put you always to be the same because 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.220
 the same environment will always be the same 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.860
 situation and therefore your room 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.319
 be and the idea is to take your room 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.060
 be bring your living room take your house to 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.399
 all the scenarios of the world in 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.819
 definitive would be to work as once 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.739
 more I believe that the more love passion 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.630
 emotion you put what you do then 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:03.479
 best result will have no I believe that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.340
 demand the how you need the space 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.500
 to make a show will make your show be 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.179
 much better and that is part of the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.530
 who do it or who hires that 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.660
 they hire you do not really know what 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.069
 hire the one you hire unless you 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.930
 you have seen somewhere contracts for 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.549
 the emotion he felt when he saw you 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.709
 but the one who really knows what he does 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.709
 is the magician himself and if the magician himself does not 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.290
 he puts passion to that he is not going to put 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.719
 nobody I know what I sell I know what 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.420
 I do I know what the public 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.219
 is going to see and I need to make you understand what 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.200
 is what I know not so that among the 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.700
 two we can make that the best I 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.319
 I think the demands but not 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.299
 only these soon an example 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.310
 the demands on each game in each 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.469
 technique in every demand towards you 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.200
 same the requirement are always good no 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.569
 demanding are you still did what 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.099
 better the best because that at last and 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.409
 what the viewer takes away 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.819
 the more time you dedicate to one thing 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.819
 for much better it will be
