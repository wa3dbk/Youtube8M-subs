00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
go one turn back forward I take a bead

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.220 
go one turn back forward I take a bead
chain<00:00:41.200> I<00:00:42.300> add<00:00:43.300> one<00:00:43.480> of<00:00:43.570> those<00:00:43.690> out<00:00:43.960> I<00:00:45.900> lay<00:00:46.900> it<00:00:47.050> in

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
chain I add one of those out I lay it in

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.630 
chain I add one of those out I lay it in
right<00:00:48.160> there

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
right there

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.330 
right there
tie<00:00:49.390> it<00:00:49.450> on<00:00:49.630> top<00:00:49.900> of<00:00:50.050> the<00:00:50.140> shank<00:00:50.410> clauser<00:00:50.920> style

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
tie it on top of the shank clauser style

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.050 
tie it on top of the shank clauser style
because<00:00:51.760> this<00:00:51.910> will<00:00:52.090> run<00:00:52.300> a<00:00:52.540> point<00:00:52.990> up<00:00:53.140> again

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
because this will run a point up again

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.520 
because this will run a point up again
four<00:00:55.060> or<00:00:55.120> five<00:00:55.270> turns<00:00:55.570> one<00:00:55.810> way<00:00:55.990> for<00:00:56.350> five

it<00:00:59.190> go<00:01:00.190> right<00:01:00.370> behind<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:03.850> I<00:01:03.970> whip

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
it go right behind it and then I whip

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.849 
it go right behind it and then I whip
finish<00:01:04.509> right<00:01:05.170> there<00:01:06.360> take<00:01:07.360> my<00:01:07.509> thread<00:01:07.780> off

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.460 
and then I'll go ahead and go back
forward<00:02:15.600> this<00:02:16.600> doesn't<00:02:17.020> have<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.319> be

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
forward this doesn't have to be

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.140 
forward this doesn't have to be
beautiful<00:02:17.709> or<00:02:18.100> perfect<00:02:18.580> because<00:02:18.850> we're<00:02:19.060> gonna

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
beautiful or perfect because we're gonna

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.090 
beautiful or perfect because we're gonna
wrap<00:02:19.450> all<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.720> stuff<00:02:20.110> back<00:02:20.290> up<00:02:20.530> over<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.920> top

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
wrap all that stuff back up over the top

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.830 
wrap all that stuff back up over the top
of<00:02:21.160> it<00:02:21.489> nobody<00:02:22.450> will<00:02:22.660> ever<00:02:22.840> see<00:02:22.930> it

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
of it nobody will ever see it

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.170 
of it nobody will ever see it
so<00:02:25.840> we'll<00:02:26.739> just<00:02:26.890> wrap<00:02:27.069> this<00:02:27.310> stuff<00:02:27.670> just

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
so we'll just wrap this stuff just

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.240 
so we'll just wrap this stuff just
building<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.569> body<00:02:28.840> here<00:02:29.319> that's<00:02:29.890> all<00:02:30.069> we're

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250

also I take a tiny little amount of each
pretty<00:03:14.950> sparse<00:03:15.690> I'll<00:03:16.690> put<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.079> two<00:03:17.260> together

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
pretty sparse I'll put the two together

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.880 
pretty sparse I'll put the two together
with<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:18.190> white<00:03:18.489> on<00:03:18.730> bottom<00:03:19.690> okay<00:03:20.350> it's<00:03:20.709> hard

together trim it off nice and try and

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.720 
together trim it off nice and try and
keep<00:03:34.359> it<00:03:34.510> pretty<00:03:34.750> straight<00:03:35.079> here<00:03:35.549> just<00:03:36.549> like

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
keep it pretty straight here just like

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.500 
keep it pretty straight here just like
that<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:38.109> I'll<00:03:38.230> lay<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.650> in<00:03:38.859> on<00:03:39.010> top<00:03:42.510> cinch

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
that and I'll lay that in on top cinch

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.410 
that and I'll lay that in on top cinch
it<00:03:43.630> down

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
it down

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.830 
it down
four<00:03:46.410> or<00:03:46.470> five<00:03:46.500> terms<00:03:47.420> come<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:48.540> with<00:03:48.690> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
four or five terms come in with the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.410 
four or five terms come in with the
scissors<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.460> just<00:03:50.460> clean<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.790> up<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.240> that<00:03:51.390> I

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
scissors and just clean it up so that I

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.800 
scissors and just clean it up so that I
don't<00:03:51.660> cover<00:03:51.870> up<00:03:51.990> that<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.320> good<00:03:53.420> with<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.630> when

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
don't cover up that I good with it when

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.300 
don't cover up that I good with it when
I<00:03:54.840> finish<00:03:55.500> this<00:03:55.710> head<00:03:55.980> I<00:03:56.600> go<00:03:57.600> just<00:03:58.560> beyond<00:03:59.040> the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
I finish this head I go just beyond the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.390 
I finish this head I go just beyond the
tip<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.850> the<00:03:59.940> hook<00:04:00.440> go<00:04:01.440> ahead<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.740> nip<00:04:02.160> that

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
tip of the hook go ahead and nip that

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.920 
tip of the hook go ahead and nip that
off<00:04:03.260> now<00:04:04.260> take<00:04:04.620> this<00:04:04.970> extra<00:04:05.970> crystal<00:04:06.450> flash<00:04:06.690> we

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
off now take this extra crystal flash we

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.500 
off now take this extra crystal flash we
had<00:04:07.140> here<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.700> split<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.820> with<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.120> eye<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.270> the

had here I split it with the eye of the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.860 
had here I split it with the eye of the
hook<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.900> pull<00:04:10.770> it<00:04:10.890> up<00:04:11.010> over<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.630> then<00:04:12.630> tie<00:04:12.840> it

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
hook and pull it up over and then tie it

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.870 
hook and pull it up over and then tie it
back<00:04:13.170> down<00:04:13.410> with<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.680> thread<00:04:14.070> try<00:04:14.490> and<00:04:14.640> get<00:04:14.760> it

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
back down with the thread try and get it

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.420 
back down with the thread try and get it
centered<00:04:15.330> there<00:04:15.570> on<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.500> head<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:16.890> then<00:04:17.310> I

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
centered there on the head and then I

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.490 
centered there on the head and then I
just<00:04:17.609> built<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:18.000> threat<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.329> threat<00:04:18.600> head<00:04:19.200> get

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
just built a threat a threat head get

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.860 
just built a threat a threat head get
this<00:04:19.650> nice<00:04:19.829> hot<00:04:20.160> colored<00:04:20.519> head<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:21.120> think<00:04:21.750> they

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
this nice hot colored head I think they

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.690 
this nice hot colored head I think they
shine<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.590> fish<00:04:22.830> gives<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.340> little<00:04:23.490> more

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
shine to the fish gives it a little more

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.490 
shine to the fish gives it a little more
