big deal it'll work okay so this is a
nice<00:02:54.010> heavy-duty<00:02:55.450> power<00:02:56.450> cord<00:02:56.930> here<00:02:57.379> let<00:02:57.769> me

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
nice heavy-duty power cord here let me

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.220 
nice heavy-duty power cord here let me
take<00:02:59.329> a<00:02:59.390> peek<00:02:59.840> that<00:03:00.349> will<00:03:01.069> see<00:03:01.299> what<00:03:02.299> gauge<00:03:02.810> it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
take a peek that will see what gauge it

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:13.420 
take a peek that will see what gauge it
is<00:03:04.930> all<00:03:05.930> right<00:03:06.319> we've<00:03:06.709> got<00:03:06.739> a<00:03:11.319> 16<00:03:12.319> it's<00:03:12.769> a<00:03:12.889> 16

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
is all right we've got a 16 it's a 16

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.599 
is all right we've got a 16 it's a 16
gauge<00:03:13.790> power<00:03:14.480> cord<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.950> that's<00:03:16.159> that's

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
gauge power cord so that's that's

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.479 
gauge power cord so that's that's
alright<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.420> then<00:03:17.540> we've<00:03:17.750> got<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.349> box<00:03:18.920> with

business end as I would call it so if

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.650 
business end as I would call it so if
you<00:04:25.930> melt<00:04:26.169> it<00:04:26.350> in<00:04:26.710> your<00:04:26.949> case<00:04:27.280> with<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.330> fan

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
you melt it in your case with the fan

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.129 
you melt it in your case with the fan
down<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:30.310> will<00:04:30.460> see<00:04:30.729> that<00:04:30.970> if<00:04:31.300> you<00:04:31.720> mount<00:04:31.990> it

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
down you will see that if you mount it

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.409 
down you will see that if you mount it
in<00:04:32.320> your<00:04:32.500> case<00:04:32.770> with<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.280> fan<00:04:33.639> up<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.300> you

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
in your case with the fan up and you

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.120 
in your case with the fan up and you
will<00:04:34.600> see<00:04:34.870> this<00:04:37.440> don't<00:04:38.440> really<00:04:38.740> like<00:04:38.919> either

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
will see this don't really like either

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.120 
will see this don't really like either
one<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.400> them<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:39.960> don't<00:04:40.960> like<00:04:41.139> that<00:04:41.350> side<00:04:41.740> but

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
one of them I don't like that side but

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.490 
one of them I don't like that side but
this<00:04:42.370> side<00:04:42.430> it's<00:04:43.389> got<00:04:43.570> a<00:04:43.600> couple<00:04:43.870> of<00:04:44.080> stickers

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
this side it's got a couple of stickers

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.920 
this side it's got a couple of stickers
in<00:04:44.680> that<00:04:44.889> not<00:04:45.460> horrible<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.300> suppose<00:04:46.690> they

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
in that not horrible I suppose they

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.620 
in that not horrible I suppose they
could<00:04:46.990> definitely<00:04:47.860> be<00:04:48.220> removed<00:04:48.669> I<00:04:49.030> mean<00:04:49.300> the

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
could definitely be removed I mean the

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.390 
could definitely be removed I mean the
warranty<00:04:50.080> will<00:04:50.259> be<00:04:50.289> void<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.919> only<00:04:51.190> bad<00:04:51.370> thing

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
warranty will be void the only bad thing

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.510 
warranty will be void the only bad thing
but<00:04:51.940> it<00:04:52.539> could<00:04:52.750> be<00:04:52.930> removed<00:04:53.320> this<00:04:53.979> one<00:04:54.250> here

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
but it could be removed this one here

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.520 
but it could be removed this one here
would<00:04:54.699> be<00:04:54.849> a<00:04:54.880> little<00:04:55.120> bit<00:04:55.240> more<00:04:55.419> difficult<00:04:55.990> to

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
would be a little bit more difficult to

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.200 
would be a little bit more difficult to
remove<00:04:56.970> but<00:04:57.990> definitely<00:04:59.550> it<00:05:00.550> still<00:05:00.880> feels

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
remove but definitely it still feels

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.870 
remove but definitely it still feels
like<00:05:01.300> it<00:05:01.419> would<00:05:01.660> be<00:05:01.690> possible<00:05:02.699> okay<00:05:03.699> let's

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
like it would be possible okay let's

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.200 
like it would be possible okay let's
check<00:05:04.060> out<00:05:04.210> some<00:05:04.270> sleeving<00:05:04.720> here<00:05:05.139> we've<00:05:05.349> got

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
check out some sleeving here we've got

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.730 
check out some sleeving here we've got
kind<00:05:07.210> of<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.949> loosely<00:05:09.479> black<00:05:10.479> netting<00:05:10.990> here<00:05:11.440> so

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
kind of a loosely black netting here so

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.469 
kind of a loosely black netting here so
you<00:05:11.800> can<00:05:12.009> still<00:05:12.280> see<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.729> colors<00:05:13.090> underneath

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
you can still see the colors underneath

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.499 
you can still see the colors underneath
which<00:05:13.930> is<00:05:14.039> unfortunate<00:05:15.039> but<00:05:15.910> it's<00:05:16.180> not

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
which is unfortunate but it's not

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:22.189 
which is unfortunate but it's not
horrible<00:05:17.050> and<00:05:17.650> then<00:05:17.860> they're<00:05:19.050> nicely<00:05:21.090> shrink

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
horrible and then they're nicely shrink

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.700 
horrible and then they're nicely shrink
tube<00:05:23.199> tear<00:05:23.860> a<00:05:24.990> little<00:05:25.990> bit<00:05:26.169> coming<00:05:26.530> out

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
tube tear a little bit coming out

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.029 
tube tear a little bit coming out
afterwards<00:05:27.780> I've<00:05:28.780> seen<00:05:29.050> better<00:05:29.289> but<00:05:29.409> this<00:05:29.830> is

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
afterwards I've seen better but this is

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.399 
afterwards I've seen better but this is
not<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:31.030> worst<00:05:31.270> I've<00:05:31.599> seen<00:05:31.630> either<00:05:32.110> at<00:05:32.380> least

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
not the worst I've seen either at least

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.670 
not the worst I've seen either at least
it<00:05:32.800> does<00:05:33.280> attempt<00:05:33.970> to<00:05:34.570> sleeve<00:05:34.900> this<00:05:35.199> won't

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
it does attempt to sleeve this won't

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.379 
it does attempt to sleeve this won't
hide<00:05:35.979> it<00:05:36.010> but<00:05:36.400> it<00:05:36.550> definitely<00:05:36.729> keeps<00:05:37.060> all<00:05:37.270> the

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
hide it but it definitely keeps all the

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.529 
hide it but it definitely keeps all the
wires<00:05:37.599> together<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:39.130> the<00:05:39.970> same<00:05:40.180> sleeving

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
wires together and the same sleeving

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:46.879 
wires together and the same sleeving
goes<00:05:41.080> for<00:05:42.120> these<00:05:43.680> additional<00:05:44.680> cables<00:05:45.099> as<00:05:45.280> well

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
goes for these additional cables as well

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:53.640 
goes for these additional cables as well
okay<00:05:47.919> so<00:05:49.020> again<00:05:51.060> this<00:05:52.060> is<00:05:52.389> the<00:05:52.840> thermal<00:05:53.229> take

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
okay so again this is the thermal take

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.860 
okay so again this is the thermal take
