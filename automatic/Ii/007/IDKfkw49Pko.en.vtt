you<00:00:19.170> guys<00:00:19.289> something<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:19.980> built<00:00:20.189> here<00:00:20.369> in

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
you guys something that I built here in

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.290 
you guys something that I built here in
my<00:00:20.550> creative<00:00:20.910> world<00:00:21.060> right<00:00:21.720> over<00:00:21.840> there<00:00:22.050> and

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
my creative world right over there and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.160 
my creative world right over there and
this<00:00:24.300> plays<00:00:24.840> around<00:00:24.990> with<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.439> idea<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:26.340> in

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
this plays around with the idea that in

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.769 
this plays around with the idea that in
1.3<00:00:28.170> zombie<00:00:29.130> pigmen<00:00:29.550> will<00:00:29.939> spawn<00:00:30.269> near<00:00:30.570> nether

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
1.3 zombie pigmen will spawn near nether

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.110 
1.3 zombie pigmen will spawn near nether
portals<00:00:31.230> above<00:00:31.560> ground<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.880> um<00:00:34.219> this<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
portals above ground so um this this is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.760 
portals above ground so um this this is
I<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.360> killed<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> zombie<00:00:37.170> pigmen<00:00:37.440> but

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
I just killed all the zombie pigmen but

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.830 
I just killed all the zombie pigmen but
what<00:00:38.520> would<00:00:38.610> happen<00:00:38.969> I'm<00:00:39.149> not<00:00:39.360> exactly<00:00:39.629> sure

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
what would happen I'm not exactly sure

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.350 
what would happen I'm not exactly sure
how<00:00:40.079> they<00:00:40.200> spawned<00:00:40.500> quite<00:00:40.800> yet<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.190> all<00:00:42.180> these

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
how they spawned quite yet and all these

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.990 
how they spawned quite yet and all these
nether<00:00:42.570> portals<00:00:42.930> actually<00:00:43.500> link<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.760> one

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
nether portals actually link up to one

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.330 
nether portals actually link up to one
main<00:00:45.570> portal<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.890> want<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.100> build<00:00:47.219> this

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
main portal so if you want to build this

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.970 
main portal so if you want to build this
in<00:00:47.489> your<00:00:47.579> world<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:49.350> will<00:00:49.440> always<00:00:49.739> come<00:00:49.890> out

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
in your world you will always come out

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.439 
in your world you will always come out
of<00:00:50.070> one<00:00:50.190> portal<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:50.700> there's<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.149> bunch<00:00:51.329> of

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
of one portal see there's a bunch of

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.639 
of one portal see there's a bunch of
portals<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> overworld<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:52.500> there's

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
portals in the overworld but there's

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.450 
portals in the overworld but there's
only<00:00:52.739> one<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:54.059> nether<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:55.160> zombie<00:00:56.160> pigmen

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
only one in the nether so zombie pigmen

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.049 
only one in the nether so zombie pigmen
spawn<00:00:56.850> near<00:00:57.629> nether<00:00:57.899> portals<00:00:59.059> semi-regularly

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
spawn near nether portals semi-regularly

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.119 
spawn near nether portals semi-regularly
so<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> did<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.379> built<00:01:01.620> these<00:01:01.800> little

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
so what I did is I built these little

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.149 
so what I did is I built these little
capsules<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.210> there<00:01:04.080> are<00:01:04.199> four<00:01:04.559> portals<00:01:05.010> here

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
capsules and there are four portals here

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.310 
capsules and there are four portals here
for<00:01:05.549> portals<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.090> nether<00:01:06.270> out<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.720> so

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
for portals to the nether out here so

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.350 
for portals to the nether out here so
I'm<00:01:07.380> collected<00:01:07.830> one<00:01:08.040> guy<00:01:08.220> um<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.150> not<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
I'm collected one guy um it's not the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.480 
I'm collected one guy um it's not the
fastest<00:01:09.720> farm<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.080> world<00:01:10.260> because<00:01:11.070> zombie

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
fastest farm in the world because zombie

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.010 
fastest farm in the world because zombie
pigmen<00:01:11.729> don't<00:01:11.909> spawn<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.270> regularly<00:01:12.600> but

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
pigmen don't spawn that regularly but

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.140 
pigmen don't spawn that regularly but
when<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.260> got<00:01:13.350> four<00:01:13.680> portals<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:14.820> i<00:01:14.850> got

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
when you got four portals and then i got

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.770 
when you got four portals and then i got
i<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.390> 16<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.320> these<00:01:17.040> things<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.759> then<00:01:18.420> these

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
i have 16 of these things and then these

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
i have 16 of these things and then these
double<00:01:19.200> stacked<00:01:19.439> ones<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.400> make<00:01:20.490> them

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
double stacked ones you can make them

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.280 
double stacked ones you can make them
double<00:01:20.909> stack<00:01:21.090> there's<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> more

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
double stack there's just the more

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.450 
double stack there's just the more
portals<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.770> more<00:01:22.920> likely<00:01:23.189> they<00:01:23.310> are<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
portals the more likely they are to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.270 
portals the more likely they are to
spawn<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.810> what<00:01:25.110> happens<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.040> don't

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
spawn and then what happens is I don't

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.950 
spawn and then what happens is I don't
know<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.610> they<00:01:26.729> need<00:01:26.880> solid<00:01:27.150> blocks<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.689> spawn

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
know if they need solid blocks to spawn

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.359 
know if they need solid blocks to spawn
I'm<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.409> sure<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.680> they'll<00:01:28.799> spawn<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.220> air

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
I'm not sure if they'll spawn in air

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.770 
I'm not sure if they'll spawn in air
also<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.180> isn't<00:01:30.299> working<00:01:30.630> right<00:01:30.659> now

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
also this isn't working right now

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.060 
also this isn't working right now
because<00:01:31.079> they're<00:01:31.200> angry<00:01:31.470> at<00:01:31.590> me<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
because they're angry at me because I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.219 
because they're angry at me because I
killed<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.400> few<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.610> them<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.600> built<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
killed a few of them but I built this

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.770 
killed a few of them but I built this
little<00:01:34.409> thing<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.250> what<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.820> they

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
little thing so what they do is they

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780 
little thing so what they do is they
will<00:01:36.900> spawn<00:01:37.200> either<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> solid<00:01:38.100> block<00:01:38.310> they

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
will spawn either on a solid block they

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.700 
will spawn either on a solid block they
might<00:01:39.030> spawn<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.840> water<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.500> air

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
might spawn on the water like in air

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.429 
might spawn on the water like in air
like<00:01:41.100> here<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.909> as<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.360> they<00:01:42.509> were<00:01:42.570> as<00:01:43.110> if

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
like here like as if they were as if

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.800 
like here like as if they were as if

is<00:02:26.010> more<00:02:26.489> it's<00:02:26.790> pretty<00:02:27.030> effective<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.599> mean<00:02:27.780> and

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
is more it's pretty effective I mean and

is more it's pretty effective I mean and
you<00:02:28.019> could<00:02:28.439> imagine<00:02:28.650> how<00:02:29.010> many<00:02:29.189> of<00:02:29.280> these<00:02:29.370> you

you could imagine how many of these you

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.920 
you could imagine how many of these you

could build if you had if I double stack
all<00:02:31.170> these<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:32.040> rates<00:02:32.340> will<00:02:32.489> be<00:02:32.579> much<00:02:32.849> better

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
all these the rates will be much better

all these the rates will be much better
i'm<00:02:33.299> sure<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.079> little<00:02:34.290> bit<00:02:34.379> annoying<00:02:34.590> to

i'm sure it's a little bit annoying to
build<00:02:34.920> these<00:02:35.040> things<00:02:35.310> but<00:02:35.549> uh<00:02:35.609> and<00:02:35.969> all<00:02:36.780> those

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959

this pig farm because I mean you know a
few<00:03:09.000> nuggets<00:03:09.180> here<00:03:09.449> and<00:03:09.599> there<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.870> also

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:10.199 
few nuggets here and there and also

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.729 
few nuggets here and there and also
occasionally<00:03:10.829> they'll<00:03:10.980> drop<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.189> golden<00:03:11.819> ingot

occasionally they'll drop a golden ingot
so<00:03:13.739> I'm<00:03:13.980> gonna<00:03:14.250> build<00:03:14.489> one<00:03:14.579> of<00:03:14.669> these

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
so I'm gonna build one of these

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.369 
so I'm gonna build one of these

here<00:03:31.650> at<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.889> farm<00:03:32.359> for<00:03:33.359> about<00:03:34.199> a<00:03:34.530> half<00:03:34.919> hour

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
here at the farm for about a half hour

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.909 
here at the farm for about a half hour
and<00:03:35.549> as<00:03:36.389> you<00:03:36.629> can<00:03:36.780> see<00:03:36.810> they're<00:03:37.349> still<00:03:37.620> rolling

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
in um these are the pigment did spawn I

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.270 
in um these are the pigment did spawn I
don't<00:03:43.019> know<00:03:43.109> if<00:03:43.199> it's<00:03:43.319> like<00:03:43.439> wave<00:03:43.650> spawning<00:03:44.040> oh

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
don't know if it's like wave spawning oh

like<00:03:46.439> wave<00:03:46.650> spawning<00:03:47.040> or<00:03:47.340> how<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.579> works<00:03:47.790> but

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
like wave spawning or how it works but

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.589 
like wave spawning or how it works but
uh<00:03:48.650> they<00:03:49.650> did<00:03:49.889> spawn<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.579> another<00:03:51.090> advantage

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
uh they did spawn and another advantage

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.179 
uh they did spawn and another advantage
to<00:03:51.629> a<00:03:51.780> spawner<00:03:52.079> like<00:03:52.319> this<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.680> it's<00:03:52.829> more<00:03:53.009> like

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
to a spawner like this is it's more like

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.729 
to a spawner like this is it's more like
a<00:03:53.220> grinder<00:03:53.849> in<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.599> sense<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.199> don't

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.129 
a grinder in the sense that you don't
need<00:03:55.889> to<00:03:56.040> sit<00:03:56.310> at<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:56.669> or<00:03:57.299> like<00:03:57.449> a<00:03:57.479> mob<00:03:57.750> system

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
look at what I got I got a golden helmet

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.420 
look at what I got I got a golden helmet
56<00:04:09.870> nuggets<00:04:10.259> a<00:04:10.530> bunch<00:04:10.859> of<00:04:10.979> rotten<00:04:11.159> flesh

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
56 nuggets a bunch of rotten flesh

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.339 
56 nuggets a bunch of rotten flesh
rotten<00:04:12.239> flesh<00:04:12.359> isn't<00:04:12.539> really<00:04:12.780> useful<00:04:13.079> but<00:04:13.229> you

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
rotten flesh isn't really useful but you

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.839 
rotten flesh isn't really useful but you
could<00:04:13.500> turn<00:04:13.620> those<00:04:13.829> nuggets<00:04:14.189> into<00:04:14.430> golden

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
could turn those nuggets into golden

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.120 
could turn those nuggets into golden
blocks<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.539> mean<00:04:16.169> golden<00:04:16.440> bars<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.039> then

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
blocks I mean golden bars and then

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.550 
blocks I mean golden bars and then
eventually<00:04:17.250> blocks<00:04:17.789> I<00:04:17.969> guess<00:04:18.150> but<00:04:18.989> if<00:04:19.380> you

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
eventually blocks I guess but if you

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.050 
eventually blocks I guess but if you
again<00:04:19.859> if<00:04:20.190> you'd<00:04:20.370> like<00:04:20.459> to<00:04:20.579> see<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:20.849> more
