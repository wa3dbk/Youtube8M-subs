00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
last summer was my first time we're

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
doing it and I really thought it was

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.160 
doing it and I really thought it was
kind<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> like<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> training<00:00:33.690> camp<00:00:33.780> before<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
kind of like a training camp before the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.200 
kind of like a training camp before the
training<00:00:34.410> camp<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.890> mean<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.309> work<00:00:35.940> pretty<00:00:36.090> hard

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
training camp I mean we work pretty hard

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.729 
training camp I mean we work pretty hard
off<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.690> ice<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.140> know<00:00:37.170> track<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
off the ice you know track and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.650 
off the ice you know track and
everything<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.550> well<00:00:39.149> as<00:00:39.239> weights<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.600> then

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
everything as well as weights and then

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.420 
everything as well as weights and then
we<00:00:39.870> go<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> ice<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.860> know<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.100> NHL

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
we go on the ice you know with NHL

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.420 
we go on the ice you know with NHL
players<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.059> going<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> make<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.050> better

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
players so it's going to make you better

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.760 
players so it's going to make you better
and<00:00:44.430> while<00:00:45.149> skating<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.690> important<00:00:46.260> today's

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and while skating is important today's

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.799 
and while skating is important today's
athletes<00:00:47.010> also<00:00:47.610> hit<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> field<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.510> order<00:00:48.719> to

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
athletes also hit the field in order to

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.439 
athletes also hit the field in order to
push<00:00:48.989> themselves<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.739> different<00:00:49.920> ways<00:00:50.420> well<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
push themselves in different ways well I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.790 
push themselves in different ways well I
think<00:00:51.719> there<00:00:51.930> probably<00:00:51.960> was<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> point<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.710> time

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
think there probably was a point in time

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.950 
think there probably was a point in time
where<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.370> was<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.579> new<00:00:54.120> concept<00:00:54.329> there<00:00:54.840> was

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
where it was a new concept there was

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.330 
where it was a new concept there was
something<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.800> know<00:00:55.829> starting<00:00:56.280> to

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
something that was you know starting to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.069 
something that was you know starting to
catch<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.300> pretty<00:00:57.420> much<00:00:57.539> now<00:00:57.870> I'd

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
catch on but I think pretty much now I'd

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.020 
catch on but I think pretty much now I'd
be<00:00:58.260> shocked<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.949> there's<00:00:59.100> any<00:00:59.250> you
