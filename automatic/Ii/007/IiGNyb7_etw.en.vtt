so now as you can see there is now a

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.020 
so now as you can see there is now a
solve<00:02:03.409> it's<00:02:04.039> not<00:02:04.219> having<00:02:04.460> your<00:02:04.549> desktop

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
solve it's not having your desktop

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.050 
solve it's not having your desktop
background<00:02:05.179> and<00:02:05.570> sort<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:06.079> and

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
background and sort of this and

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.790 
background and sort of this and
basically<00:02:08.060> what<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.600> do<00:02:08.720> is<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.350> can<00:02:09.500> click

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
basically what you do is you can click

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.500 
basically what you do is you can click
on<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.310> con<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:12.260> then<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.950> has<00:02:13.160> FA<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:14.300> what

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
on a I con and then it has FA and what

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.940 
on a I con and then it has FA and what
we<00:02:14.600> could<00:02:14.720> do<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:15.140> can<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.530> top

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
we could do is you can the top

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.240 
we could do is you can the top
is<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.310> icon<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.900> icon<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.530> want<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
bottom one is basically the it's

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.170 
bottom one is basically the it's
basically<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.970> file<00:02:23.800> or<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.860> app<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:26.060> what

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
basically the file or the app and what

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.350 
basically the file or the app and what
we<00:02:26.269> do<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.599> if<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.780> click<00:02:26.870> on<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.110> icon<00:02:28.360> you

we do is if you click on the icon you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.479 
we do is if you click on the icon you
can<00:02:29.540> then<00:02:29.750> go<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.140> wherever<00:02:30.769> you<00:02:30.950> want<00:02:30.980> when

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
can then go to wherever you want when

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.860 
can then go to wherever you want when
you<00:02:31.580> go<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.730> my<00:02:31.819> desktop<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.420> I'm<00:02:32.599> going<00:02:32.810> to

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
you go to my desktop and I'm going to

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
you go to my desktop and I'm going to
look<00:02:32.989> for<00:02:33.550> paint<00:02:34.550> on<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:34.790> if<00:02:35.269> I<00:02:35.420> click<00:02:35.569> open

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
look for paint on that if I click open

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.250 
look for paint on that if I click open
even<00:02:36.890> if<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.099> click<00:02:37.280> save<00:02:37.610> now<00:02:38.080> paint<00:02:39.080> on<00:02:39.230> that

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
Dixie is the program itself but you'll

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.740 
Dixie is the program itself but you'll
have<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.400> find<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.760> icon<00:03:26.090> yourself<00:03:26.510> by

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
have to find the icon yourself by

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.479 
have to find the icon yourself by
looking<00:03:27.079> on<00:03:27.139> the<00:03:27.200> internet<00:03:27.680> it's<00:03:28.220> going<00:03:28.430> to

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
looking on the internet it's going to

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.879 
looking on the internet it's going to
clear<00:03:29.000> that<00:03:29.590> because<00:03:30.590> if<00:03:30.799> you<00:03:30.980> put<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.660> invalid

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
clear that because if you put a invalid

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.740 
clear that because if you put a invalid
icon<00:03:33.889> they<00:03:34.519> gives<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.819> preview<00:03:35.060> there<00:03:35.420> and

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
icon they gives you a preview there and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.069 
icon they gives you a preview there and
if<00:03:35.810> I<00:03:35.900> save<00:03:36.139> it<00:03:36.350> as<00:03:36.470> make<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.709> little<00:03:36.920> X<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.660> it's

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
if I save it as make a little X so it's

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.789 
if I save it as make a little X so it's
sort<00:03:40.040> of<00:03:40.130> ruins<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.370> program<00:03:41.590> so<00:03:42.590> what<00:03:42.709> we

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
sort of ruins the program so what we

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.610 
sort of ruins the program so what we
could<00:03:42.920> use<00:03:43.069> about<00:03:43.400> all<00:03:43.700> these<00:03:44.090> gaps<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:45.470> what

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
could use about all these gaps to what

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.530 
could use about all these gaps to what
you<00:03:45.769> like<00:03:45.889> with<00:03:46.400> programs<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.209> it's<00:03:47.329> a<00:03:47.389> cool
