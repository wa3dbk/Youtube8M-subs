 she breeds the church tower or spare like this one there are dark ones 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.310
 Corners and corners in which the plumes night birds during the day 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.210
 The barn is one of the dealer's place to hide 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.949
 because life would have to be here 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.959
 Loot animals of the veil and, so to speak, in shared flat with their parents 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.679
 the male does not initially feed himself like this 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:34.800
 he has become his products 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.950
 Dario Cologna has an old saying that she is good at the customers 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.600
 already an 8 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.210
 and Karl Marx 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.990
 Aalen 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.060
 even now with each other 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.580
 in a whirlwind the mice do themselves 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.000
 and that's great for barn owls 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.680
 because then they can go hunting even then because bad outside 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.990
 Weather prevails 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.530
 and 4 we have the opportunity 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.530
 the pollen department stores of 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.520
 every corner of her school knows the role exactly 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.250
 important in hunting in the dark of the night 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.060
 even in complete darkness, the role may be 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.329
 alone after her 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.329
 according to the mirror on vintage 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.840
 now know 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.050
 that now comes the time for step what 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.050
 and they wait impatiently in the first places 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.539
 SPU defiance 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.420
 and become fed slayer and have more practice practicing self-employment 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.520
 everyone between loud ipv6 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.370
 so we can find it again and again the stray offspring 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.909
 the first year is dangerous for the young barn owls 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.500
 yet she is having states and finding a partner 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.420
 then maybe they will raise their own boys next summer 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.400
