00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.240
 hi there, this is Nikita and in this video I 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.650
 I will show you a fan attack 50 family 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.340
 Mages 50 mages and 12 sets in my 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.550
 camp and 7 more magicians in my clan Kasley 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.710
 and when in a week I will have 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.380
 top magic is sure to attack 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.420
 make the same attack top magicians to 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.460
 compare these two attacks and I already know 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.910
 they will attack me on this base like this 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.340
 fortanulo immediately 2 base which is suitable 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.040
 for attack there are a lot of resources and 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.550
 it's not feet from 9 but still small 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.250
 pumping there is a mortar from touch not only 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.629
 one mortar but so average weak 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.480
 quietly even you x8 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.640
 because we already know that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.289
 magicians are weak now I will destroy the town hall more precisely 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.840
 monde is very strong but they have very little 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.070
 of life and I will attack from the top right 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.219
 more precisely just first from the right edge 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.489
 first destroy the Town Hall and see I took 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.189
 with one raid1 jump and tree hill and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.930
 in case of not enough wall battles and 3 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.530
 hiva because u magicians like i already 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 spoke very little life and to this 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.180
 little xn at least somehow 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.610
 compensate for hin 1 hill 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.830
 while the magicians are in this helly they have nothing 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.009
 scary that is, they will not have time to finish not 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.110
 mortar no bow tower no gun and one 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.600
 times for the magicians so that they finish off faster 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.860
 Kwan Casale and at the same time throw your 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.250
 the only jam so they quickly 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.200
 broke through the middle and took away those 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.259
 few resources and resources that are still 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.740
 stayed and landed all mac in to the end and 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.899
 schoolgirl icon sat down and everything seems to be going 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.840
 okay 40 percent will soon think 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.229
 50 and two stars one star we already have 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.290
 there is 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.329
 because of there halo which stood outside two 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.030
 stars we will have it already one hundred percent 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.909
 but we are unlikely to have a 3 star 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.939
 here on the old star appeared because 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.689
 that we ran out of snares well, that's how 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.250
 see smashed such a weak tth 9 to 50 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.790
 percent even a little more 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.700
 but you also see that this is not the case. 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.860
 will pull in order to destroy the function 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.130
 x 9 meaning there is a big one 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.470
 the probability that you will finish here is 50 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.220
 percent taking one star but very 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.860
 it is unlikely that you will get or reach 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.390
 to the town hall 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.780
 so it is not necessary to file such an attack 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.940
 in a coffee shop or a farm in a cab 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.420
 attack because you take very 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.850
 few stars finish the fight and not on and not 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.780
 farms such and because she is very 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:50.010
 dear here I spent on everything at all 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.290
 Mages and all banks about 300 400 thousand 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.989
 it turned out 200,000 of course you can 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.209
 find a base that has more resources but 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.480
 it will be very long and costly 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.940
 gold and it's all about fan attack 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.489
 Mages all thank you so much for watching 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.489
 until next video and bye
