factory wiring harness and connect it to
the<00:01:28.290> wine-<00:01:28.650> from<00:01:28.950> our<00:01:29.040> HID<00:01:29.310> bulb<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.939> very

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the wine- from our HID bulb it's very

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.050 
the wine- from our HID bulb it's very
straight<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.810> plug<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.229> in

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
straight for you just plug it right in

straight for you just plug it right in
just<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:34.079> next<00:01:34.200> step<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.710> gonna<00:01:34.979> be

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
just like that the next step is gonna be

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.770 
just like that the next step is gonna be
putting<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> bulb<00:01:35.610> into<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> socket<00:01:36.450> it's

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
putting the bulb into the socket it's

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.700 
putting the bulb into the socket it's
gonna<00:01:36.869> be<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> little<00:01:37.110> bit<00:01:37.259> tricky<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.650> I'm

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
gonna be a little bit tricky so I'm
