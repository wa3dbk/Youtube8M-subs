00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:08.428
Hello my lords, ladies and gentlemen
and welcome to Nick Saraf's Foodlog!

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:10.950
We have spent two breakfasts in Europe..

00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:13.787
..and now it's time to take a short trip 
across the pond!

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:18.530
That's what we call the Atlantic ocean
to the United States of America.

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:21.490
Oh how the world loves
Americans!

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:23.696
Moving on...

00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:28.822
So, the Americans have a variety of options
for their breakfast.

00:00:28.823 --> 00:00:32.690
Like Lucky charms, Corn flakes, Special K, Froot loops.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:37.151
But since any idiot can add milk
to a bowl of cereal and call it breakfast,..

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:39.380
..we are going to make something from scratch.

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:41.675
We are going to make an American favorite!

00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:45.030
The fluffy 'Pancake' with 'Maple Syrup'

00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:47.490
'Blueberry Jam' and the side of 'Bacon'.

00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:51.013
Of course if you say it in American
it's going to sound like this!

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:57.552
"Oh my God... Pancakes with like Blueberry Jam
and Maple Syrup and the side of streaky Bacon."

00:00:58.397 --> 00:01:00.232
Okay, I am making myself sick now.

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:08.386
So to make fluffy Pancakes we need to 
separate our ingredients in two types.

00:01:08.687 --> 00:01:11.621
The wet ingredients and the dry ingredients. 

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:16.293
You may have heard me say things like,
'grams' and 'milliliters' for the past few recipes.

00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:20.711
But now that we are in America,
I am going to be using the term 'cups'..

00:01:21.612 --> 00:01:24.316
..and 'tablespoons' (tbsp) and
'teaspoons' (tsp).

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:27.388
Because you know...
Who likes the metric system!

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.680
Yes, certainly not to the Americans.

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:34.553
What we do first is
take about 2 tbsp of butter.

00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:38.050
You might notice that 
my tablespoon is very generous...

00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:39.550
So attributes to this!

00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:43.408
And we put it in a bain-marie to melt.

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:47.357
We take about 3 quarters of a cup of milk..

00:01:47.358 --> 00:01:49.280
..and break in 1 egg.

00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:54.437
Make sure you whisk the milk 
in the egg together incorporating it completely.

00:01:54.638 --> 00:01:59.775
When the butter has melted,
we pour it into the milk and whisk it in.

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:05.933
And then we add about 
one and a half tsp of vanilla essence..

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:07.775
..or extracts. Whatever you wish.

00:02:08.756 --> 00:02:11.825
Now that we are done with 
mixing the wet ingredients together..

00:02:11.826 --> 00:02:15.393
..it's time to keep it aside and
move on to the dry ingredients.

00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:16.805
One cup of flour.

00:02:17.314 --> 00:02:19.332
2 tbsp of caster sugar.

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:22.100
Half a tsp of baking soda.

00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:26.480
Half a tsp of salt and 1 tsp of baking powder.

00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:28.877
Make sure you mix all of it together
with your fingers.

00:02:29.178 --> 00:02:32.609
Now we add the dry ingredients
to the wet ingredients.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.708
And whisk away to glory!

00:02:37.674 --> 00:02:40.478
When all the lumps have gone from the bowl..

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.837
..and it's turned into a nice thick batter.

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:45.219
We take a flat pan.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.914
Put it on low to medium heat.

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:51.804
And put in about 2 cubes of butter.

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:53.731
Lightly rub the butter.

00:02:54.032 --> 00:02:59.413
When tiny bubbles starts appear
just pour in a thick mixture of the Pancake..

00:02:59.414 --> 00:03:02.862
Round it a bit, make sure it's round
and keep it thick.

00:03:02.863 --> 00:03:05.927
That's how the Pancakes become round and fluffy.

00:03:06.028 --> 00:03:08.053
Don't want it too thin.

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.024
So Pancakes haven't really originated 
in America.

00:03:12.268 --> 00:03:14.780
But then again...
Not much has, has it?

00:03:17.177 --> 00:03:21.115
When you get large bubbles on the top
that means the bottom is..

00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:24.025
..not completely but pretty well cooked.

00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:25.699
So we are going to flip it.

00:03:27.912 --> 00:03:29.299
And now we let the other side.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.989
And you are done.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.702
So with all that batter
we have a stack of about..

00:03:58.003 --> 00:03:59.858
..7 to 8 Pancakes

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.453
And if you wish to make another 
American favorite like the 'Waffles',..

00:04:03.654 --> 00:04:07.184
..you can use exactly the same batter
 but you will need a Waffle Iron.

00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:10.819
And since we don't have the budget for it
I don't have a Waffle Iron.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.130
Are you listening to me my Producer?

00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:16.307
We don't have a Waffle Iron.
Buy me a Waffle Iron.

00:04:16.708 --> 00:04:19.596
We are going to move on to
making the side of Bacon.

00:04:19.997 --> 00:04:23.427
Of course, we are using 
American streaky Bacon.

00:04:28.443 --> 00:04:29.886
How precious!

00:04:29.887 --> 00:04:32.466
So to cook Bacon, 
we are going to put a pan..

00:04:32.967 --> 00:04:34.305
..on medium flame.

00:04:34.806 --> 00:04:39.629
We are going to put the Bacon directly on the pan
 without using any oil or any butter.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.680
And that's because Bacon already has
so much fat.

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:45.803
The fat's going to melt and
help the Bacon cook itself.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.296
So when the Bacon has colored nicely
and has shrunk down to about 3 quarters of the size..

00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:01.464
..and it looks an angel has been
 sent down from heaven.

00:05:01.865 --> 00:05:03.856
We put it on some absorbent paper.

00:05:04.057 --> 00:05:06.642
Now that we have got this pan nice and clean..

00:05:06.643 --> 00:05:08.857
..which is very important for the next step.

00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:13.219
We put it again on a medium flame..

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.893
..and now we cook this already cooked
Bacon a little bit further in Maple Syrup.

00:05:19.894 --> 00:05:24.347
This gives it a flavor that is as good
 as eating heaven.

00:05:25.444 --> 00:05:28.376
We let some Maple Syrup reduce in a pan.

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.910
Now that Maple Syrup is bubbling slightly
and you get a slight caramelized smell in the air..

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:39.472
..just add all your pieces of Bacon to it.

00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:43.211
And then slightly saute it in your pan.

00:05:43.212 --> 00:05:48.245
This process is also called
 rendering the Bacon in Maple Syrup..

00:05:48.246 --> 00:05:50.293
..or glazing the Bacon in Maple Syrup.

00:05:50.494 --> 00:05:52.887
Make sure the flame is not too high..

00:05:53.088 --> 00:05:56.834
..or else the Maple Syrup will burn,
caramelize and then it will just taste bitter.

00:05:56.835 --> 00:05:58.983
And then, there is no regressing it.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.266
So when the Bacon is 
shiny and candid like this..

00:06:03.567 --> 00:06:08.965
..and Maple Syrup is dripping off 
it very slowly, it's quite done.

00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:13.318
And I am extremely sorry about it,
I cannot stop myself from eating one.

00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:22.376
You have to give me a minute.

00:06:23.306 --> 00:06:26.222
So what we are going to make next
is a Blueberry Jam.

00:06:26.323 --> 00:06:29.914
So here is about 
half a cup of fresh blueberries.

00:06:29.915 --> 00:06:31.225
So I am going to put them in a pan.

00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:33.332
Half the quantity of sugar.

00:06:33.633 --> 00:06:37.704
And water, that is, 1/3rd the amount
 of the sugar that we have put in.

00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:41.292
And now keep it on a slightly high flame.

00:06:41.593 --> 00:06:45.167
Mix all the blueberries, sugar and water together.

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:49.976
And when the sugar starts bubbling slightly
you put in the sugar thermometer..

00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:52.876
..and wait till it reaches a 105 degrees.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.785
So as we reach a 105 degrees 
on a thermometer, turn the gas off..

00:06:58.786 --> 00:07:03.762
..and then we dip a silicon spatula lightly
into the jam and then..

00:07:03.763 --> 00:07:09.084
..when it is appropriately cooled, 
take a bit of jam between your fingers..

00:07:10.342 --> 00:07:12.930
..and check to see if a thread is formed.

00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:15.714
This thread is not supposed to
stay on for a long time..

00:07:15.715 --> 00:07:18.972
..because a 105 is just a soft thread.

00:07:19.273 --> 00:07:23.126
Make sure you don't leave the jam
in the sauce pan for too long..

00:07:23.427 --> 00:07:27.135
..as the temperature may go on rising 
with the heat of the pan. 

00:07:27.336 --> 00:07:29.035
So now that we are done with the Pancakes..

00:07:29.036 --> 00:07:32.550
..the last thing to do is pour
a good amount of Maple Syrup on it.

00:07:32.551 --> 00:07:35.552
Otherwise, you know...
They are not Pancakes!

00:07:39.747 --> 00:07:40.927
So there you have it!

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:43.151
You got Pancakes, you got Bacon..

00:07:43.552 --> 00:07:48.003
You got Blueberry jam 
and a big dob of the butter with Maple Syrup.

00:07:48.204 --> 00:07:50.832
That is the complete American breakfast.

00:07:52.357 --> 00:07:55.977
Promise me, you will never ever
make me do that again!

00:07:56.078 --> 00:07:57.115
Have a good meal!

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:58.468
Bye.
