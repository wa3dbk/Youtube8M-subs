sometimes we smaller end up Chester
Chester<00:01:36.840> gonna<00:01:37.320> clench<00:01:37.560> would<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.920> start

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
Chester gonna clench would I start

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.770 
Chester gonna clench would I start
thinking<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.909> myself<00:01:39.000> man<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.659> keep

you're<00:02:38.400> pulling<00:02:38.670> your<00:02:38.879> body<00:02:39.090> weight<00:02:39.329> back<00:02:39.599> and

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
you're pulling your body weight back and

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.050 
you're pulling your body weight back and
and<00:02:40.799> here<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.040> pull<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.370> over<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.670> top<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.879> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
and here you pull it over the top of the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.119 
and here you pull it over the top of the
jab<00:02:42.269> but<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.019> will<00:02:43.079> pull<00:02:43.319> back<00:02:43.500> my<00:02:43.650> body<00:02:43.890> weight

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
jab but I will pull back my body weight

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.100 
jab but I will pull back my body weight
to<00:02:44.160> try<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.549> counter<00:02:44.790> over<00:02:45.000> his<00:02:45.120> Jeff<00:02:45.390> his<00:02:45.750> jab

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
to try to counter over his Jeff his jab

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.140 
to try to counter over his Jeff his jab
was<00:02:46.319> really<00:02:46.620> heavy<00:02:46.769> right<00:02:47.129> here<00:02:47.579> so<00:02:48.120> i

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
was really heavy right here so i

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.699 
was really heavy right here so i
couldn't<00:02:48.569> bring<00:02:48.840> back<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.200> momentum<00:02:49.620> because

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
couldn't bring back the momentum because

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.990 
couldn't bring back the momentum because
you<00:02:49.860> basically<00:02:50.099> change<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.519> momentum<00:02:50.579> twice

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
you basically change of momentum twice

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.729 
you basically change of momentum twice
you<00:02:51.150> going<00:02:51.420> back<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.959> forward<00:02:52.170> your<00:02:52.290> rocket

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
you going back and forward your rocket

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.949 
you going back and forward your rocket
so<00:02:53.250> i<00:02:53.280> would<00:02:53.519> try<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.730> rock<00:02:53.970> back<00:02:54.209> but<00:02:54.540> his<00:02:54.629> jab

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
so i would try to rock back but his jab

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.410 
so i would try to rock back but his jab
would<00:02:55.530> hit<00:02:55.680> me<00:02:55.829> right<00:02:55.980> here<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.400> play<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.269> i

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
would hit me right here and play and i

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.759 
would hit me right here and play and i
couldn't<00:02:57.750> i<00:02:57.840> couldn't<00:02:57.989> bring<00:02:58.200> my<00:02:58.440> learning

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
couldn't i couldn't bring my learning

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.259 
couldn't i couldn't bring my learning
back<00:02:58.950> forward<00:02:59.310> on<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.459> top<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.880> gym<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.209> it
