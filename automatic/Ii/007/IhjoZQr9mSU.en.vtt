00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 questions with andres okay this like 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.230
 that all night I will appeal 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.719
 once again to the honesty with which 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.690
 you have been telling me the facts 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.860
 perfect this a cocaine consumer 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.180
 not regularly 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.090
 I know her as 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.190
 from time to time product let's say of my 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.000
 friendship with Carlos and the gifts that 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.140
 he offers me 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.140
 but the with its cycle 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.730
 in the proportions that I can 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.570
 manage not to affect 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.640
 decisions that everything in that state that is 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.290
 do nothing under the influence of 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.440
 cocaine of what it is but to lie 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:52.300
 use or not mix it with alcohol 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.379
 use it as a mind fixer 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.129
 of the head and I do not want to excuse myself 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.600
 take it to a mystical side that 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:04.149
 clearly he does not have it 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.830
 just find a state that I 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.390
 allows you to do other things in front of a 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.189
 computer screen let's say another 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.740
 degree of social attention of beings 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.480
 then how much do they consume 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.310
 cocaine 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.800
 I would have to explain to you one thing 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.740
 period and I'll do it 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.310
 I would tell you later 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.310
 d 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.450
 the first year of university where 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.460
 obviously 7 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.520
 you are offered let's say a tremendous 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.580
 amount of opportunities I've made there 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.650
 another relationship with women 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.440
 it's more of freedom that you 're not with 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.190
 companions of courses the holidays 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.800
 they have another level 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.500
 let's say for the first time 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.080
 and eye is simply doing it for 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.630
 a brutal honesty I just do not want 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.140
 say because I do not know that there is a 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.890
 climbing in this but in those first 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.070
 years of college when 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.580
 we were very followers of some musician 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.450
 certain symphony that is to say that we come together 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.040
 the house with friends to smoke marijuana and 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.470
 let's say let's say on the floor 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.720
 until listening to the last line of 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.319
 instruments let's say that allowed us the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.319
 soundtrack of this or that thing 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.319
 later 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.910
 inside the same party obviously the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.440
 environment that offers let's say this chaotic 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:36.350
 let's say and so moved always television 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.250
 people appeared that obviously was 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.990
 inside your entertainment menu and you 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.740
 they offered and they obviously go sometime 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.570
 provides as well as how I was not part of 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.480
 the quota is invited in asia 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.600
 friendly or a little bit of no since I 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.730
 he did not have access let's say obviously 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.350
 because he did not participate monetarily to 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.420
 Take my portion but you 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.420
 they invited inside theirs 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.600
 and I realize that there is one thing 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.950
 to start you will feel a level of 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.530
 dependence not why 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.050
 I can stop it in time but I saw in 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.620
 others as they did things that did not 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:23.160
 corresponded I mean take off the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.780
 clothes to wear with a level of confidence 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.800
 towards the stirrups he lost his temper 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.349
 that yes, it never happened to you, but because 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.670
 something very simple, not because it has a gel 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.190
 special of a better liver than 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.590
 probably its done with such if 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.060
 it's not because I knew I stopped because I did not start 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.310
 being a consumer is obviously where 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.200
 I bought drugs but 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.720
 they simply told me about Tehran 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.030
 asked 6 small gave instead the 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.540
 others I saw what was happening and I saw that 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.099
 people let's say with everything let's say the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.400
 career professionalism intelligence 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.650
 to know they obviously got loose and felt 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.120
 with an excess degree of confidence 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.160
 being again effective with pure 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.980
 well-known people you never had fear of 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.530
 fall into dependence on cocaine at 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.910
 point of throwing everything away as you 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.760
 so many people have passed 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.430
 the product of the drugs end 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.400
 totally impoverished on your part 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.400
 not because what we do not have yo yo yo 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.039
 by then I was already in a 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.419
 personal development exercise 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.490
 at that time maybe it was not the 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.919
 person that I am now was well someone 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.419
 more than I thought the normal crack then 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.669
 I do not like that he will not let anything 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.940
 I'll win more, I think that helped 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.350
 Today the relationship would be another so 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.310
 recently mining knowing the by x 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:48.030
 reason and is that I would not allow it to happen 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.680
 to bring some concept of mine that is like 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.370
 a way I live that proclaimed it 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.100
 televisively game 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.340
 having the possibility to combine 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.410
 small doses seeing the result of 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.040
 the full doses that are other supe 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.510
 consciously ask me at some point 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.460
 I said this limit 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.040
 here it happened that that is the limit and that 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.810
 was 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.720
 is an entity or have serious problems for 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.610
 go to sleep 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.879
 and to have 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.520
 let's say you want to leave not to 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:23.009
 because there is a quantity of energy that 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.169
 invites you to spend it and that 's that to me 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.069
 I was a bit shocked by what I know 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.069
 because you were a homebody 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.250
 you can think 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:39.569
 that helped me a lot because the crest is 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.199
 an inhibitor of this but it's a 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:46.680
 almost sensitive inhibitor no more then 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:48.000
 allows you to go deeper into the 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.719
 point that you will not start noticing what 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.719
 is doing you the
