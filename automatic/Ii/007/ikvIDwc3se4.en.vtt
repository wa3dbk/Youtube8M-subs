00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.930
 hello that such friends I am alex acker min and 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:08.800
 in this video tutorial I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.770
 to play in our hello version 1.10 in 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.840
 third person what we are going to do is 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.340
 download this file obviously me 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.380
 I'll just leave in the description of the video 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.390
 what we are going to do is extract it 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.390
 we right click and extract here 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.619
 this folder will be what we 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.140
 we are going to do is open it and inside 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.099
 bring two files this file here 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.470
 is where you are going to save the 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.600
 configuration this here is the one 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.250
 we have to run very important 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.989
 we always have to open it as 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.120
 administrator because if we do not open it 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.460
 as an administrator we can not play in 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.140
 our hello in the third person so 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.140
 to open it as a minister we click on 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.180
 right and run as administrator 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.430
 Once opened, we will configure it 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.500
 here everyone configures it as 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.239
 you want obviously to 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.190
 configure it just read a click on the 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.899
 button that we want to configure and 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.780
 we press the key that we want it to be 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.970
 in my case, configure them with the keys 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.800
 of the numbers because those that are f1 and 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.570
 that I already have them configured 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.060
 as you see here is for 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.050
 turn it up or down and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.300
 successively 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.130
 this is to move the angles right now 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.900
 I'm going to teach them good once 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.380
 you have configured this part of 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.000
 here they already have it set, let's go 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.000
 to our genius we are going to open 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.560
 and here I have my daughter ready and then to 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.560
 enter a server 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.170
 and this here I am playing on the server 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.160
 how the first to the third is activated 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.900
 person 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.970
 good using the keys we set 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.640
 in my case to activate it 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.350
 is number one whether in your case if the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.070
 activated with some key either the g 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.770
 the etcetera in my case pressed the 1 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.080
 and now I'm ready in third person as 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.720
 you could see also configure 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.000
 the angles with 1 2 3 4 and successively 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.470
 even if you press those keys you can 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.750
 moving the angle as you can 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.399
 see there I'm bringing it closer then what 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.340
 I can move away 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.310
 I can not move up I can 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.959
 move down and so on and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.000
 there you configure it as you 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.000
 obviously want if they no longer want 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.680
 play in the third person simply 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.079
 turn off the application with the same key 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.060
 that turns on and you can play normal 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.569
 and if he does not want to play again like that 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.790
 obviously they do not open the program 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.930
 well I hope this tutorial is 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.639
 a lot of help 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.639
 remember that it is a place and the cost of 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.439
 investment edition 1.10 if you liked the 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.810
 video hand above do not forget 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.499
 share it and if you're not in the group you 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.499
 I invite you to see
