Tyson today at the warehouse we're doing
a<00:00:08.410> quick<00:00:08.590> review<00:00:08.920> of<00:00:08.980> the<00:00:09.340> warrior<00:00:09.639> hit<00:00:09.880> me<00:00:10.000> and

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
a quick review of the warrior hit me and

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.180 
a quick review of the warrior hit me and
shoulder<00:00:10.420> pad<00:00:10.630> the<00:00:11.380> shoulder<00:00:11.740> pad<00:00:11.920> is<00:00:12.010> pretty

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
shoulder pad the shoulder pad is pretty

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.410 
shoulder pad the shoulder pad is pretty
much<00:00:12.340> the<00:00:12.490> same<00:00:12.670> as<00:00:12.849> last<00:00:12.970> year

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
much the same as last year

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.299 
much the same as last year
it<00:00:13.540> does<00:00:13.840> have<00:00:14.019> some<00:00:14.050> cosmetic<00:00:14.830> differences

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
it does have some cosmetic differences

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:16.980 
it does have some cosmetic differences
but<00:00:15.790> to<00:00:15.910> give<00:00:16.059> you<00:00:16.150> a<00:00:16.180> quick<00:00:16.420> run<00:00:16.630> through<00:00:16.660> of

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
but to give you a quick run through of

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.990 
but to give you a quick run through of
it<00:00:17.320> starting<00:00:18.220> on<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.369> front<00:00:18.460> portion<00:00:18.790> you<00:00:18.970> see

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
it starting on the front portion you see

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.479 
it starting on the front portion you see
it<00:00:19.210> does<00:00:19.420> have<00:00:19.630> a<00:00:19.660> panel<00:00:20.110> design<00:00:20.560> so<00:00:21.340> that's

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:21.489 
it does have a panel design so that's

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.190 
it does have a panel design so that's
gonna<00:00:21.610> be<00:00:21.669> basically<00:00:22.329> this<00:00:22.540> portions<00:00:23.020> gonna

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
gonna be basically this portions gonna

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.749 
gonna be basically this portions gonna
be<00:00:23.290> separated<00:00:23.800> from<00:00:23.980> this<00:00:24.250> portion<00:00:24.489> of<00:00:24.700> the

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
be separated from this portion of the

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.089 
be separated from this portion of the
pad<00:00:24.970> they<00:00:25.599> do<00:00:25.660> a<00:00:25.750> nice<00:00:25.989> job<00:00:26.290> at<00:00:26.500> segmenting

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
pad they do a nice job at segmenting

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.769 
pad they do a nice job at segmenting
this<00:00:27.310> so<00:00:27.700> you<00:00:27.759> can<00:00:27.910> really<00:00:28.060> offer<00:00:28.329> some<00:00:28.689> great

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
this so you can really offer some great

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.839 
this so you can really offer some great
mobility<00:00:29.169> there<00:00:29.590> and<00:00:29.800> then<00:00:30.220> also<00:00:30.460> it's<00:00:30.730> not

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
mobility there and then also it's not

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.670 
mobility there and then also it's not
just<00:00:31.119> single<00:00:31.329> density<00:00:31.809> foams<00:00:32.079> used<00:00:32.439> in<00:00:32.590> these

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
just single density foams used in these

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.889 
just single density foams used in these
side<00:00:32.920> portions<00:00:33.430> it<00:00:33.640> has<00:00:34.059> actually<00:00:34.750> some

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:34.899 
side portions it has actually some

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.090 
side portions it has actually some
higher<00:00:35.079> density<00:00:35.500> foams<00:00:35.710> and<00:00:35.829> then<00:00:35.950> some

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
higher density foams and then some

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.340 
higher density foams and then some
softer<00:00:36.579> foams<00:00:36.789> on<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.030> back<00:00:37.210> of<00:00:37.420> it<00:00:37.539> as<00:00:37.660> well

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
softer foams on the back of it as well

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.840 
softer foams on the back of it as well
as<00:00:38.530> you<00:00:38.649> see<00:00:38.679> a<00:00:38.829> mesh<00:00:39.100> material<00:00:39.550> so<00:00:39.640> it's<00:00:39.730> gonna

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
as you see a mesh material so it's gonna

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.369 
as you see a mesh material so it's gonna
be<00:00:40.000> a<00:00:40.030> little<00:00:40.179> bit<00:00:40.359> of<00:00:40.449> a<00:00:40.539> cooler<00:00:40.750> feel<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:41.260> it

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
be a little bit of a cooler feel to it

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.799 
be a little bit of a cooler feel to it
going<00:00:42.280> on<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.609> center<00:00:42.879> portion<00:00:43.059> I'm<00:00:43.510> you

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
going on to the center portion I'm you

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.360 
going on to the center portion I'm you
have<00:00:43.899> these<00:00:44.050> raised<00:00:44.350> up<00:00:44.559> pads<00:00:44.829> in<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.070> center

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
have these raised up pads in the center

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.619 
have these raised up pads in the center
you<00:00:45.489> actually<00:00:45.730> don't<00:00:45.879> have<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.059> plastic

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
you actually don't have the plastic

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.240 
you actually don't have the plastic
inserts<00:00:46.960> going<00:00:47.199> down<00:00:47.320> the<00:00:47.410> center<00:00:47.589> sternum<00:00:48.129> of

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
inserts going down the center sternum of

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.709 
inserts going down the center sternum of
the<00:00:48.309> pad<00:00:48.460> but<00:00:49.089> you're<00:00:49.179> still<00:00:49.359> getting<00:00:49.449> some

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
the pad but you're still getting some

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.419 
the pad but you're still getting some
good<00:00:49.839> protection<00:00:50.379> there<00:00:50.530> you<00:00:51.160> do<00:00:51.309> have

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
good protection there you do have

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:52.979 
good protection there you do have
segments<00:00:51.879> on<00:00:51.969> the<00:00:52.059> side<00:00:52.269> too<00:00:52.510> so<00:00:52.690> it<00:00:52.780> helps

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
segments on the side too so it helps

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.329 
segments on the side too so it helps
that<00:00:53.079> kind<00:00:53.289> of<00:00:53.350> wrap<00:00:53.499> around<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.890> body<00:00:54.070> and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
that kind of wrap around the body and

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.430 
that kind of wrap around the body and
then<00:00:54.969> taking<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.300> quick<00:00:55.510> look<00:00:55.780> of<00:00:55.899> how<00:00:56.140> they've

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
then taking a quick look of how they've

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.040 
then taking a quick look of how they've
put<00:00:56.859> these<00:00:57.010> pads<00:00:57.730> together<00:00:57.969> is<00:00:58.329> you<00:00:58.749> have<00:00:58.929> the

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
put these pads together is you have the

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.259 
put these pads together is you have the
elastic<00:00:59.559> portion<00:00:59.920> here<00:01:00.219> and<00:01:00.370> keeping<00:01:01.059> it<00:01:01.179> in

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
elastic portion here and keeping it in

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.299 
elastic portion here and keeping it in
place<00:01:01.600> as<00:01:01.870> well<00:01:02.409> as<00:01:02.469> on<00:01:02.679> the<00:01:02.769> sides<00:01:03.039> you<00:01:03.219> see

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
place as well as on the sides you see

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.430 
place as well as on the sides you see
it's<00:01:03.579> a<00:01:03.670> nylon<00:01:04.059> webbing<00:01:04.239> so<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:04.930> really<00:01:05.170> allows

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
it's a nylon webbing so it really allows

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.890 
it's a nylon webbing so it really allows
that<00:01:05.470> to<00:01:05.950> move<00:01:06.220> freely<00:01:06.580> from<00:01:06.760> each<00:01:07.030> other<00:01:07.270> so

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
that to move freely from each other so

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.300 
that to move freely from each other so
that's<00:01:07.990> gonna<00:01:08.200> increase<00:01:08.590> that<00:01:08.799> mobility

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
that's gonna increase that mobility

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.010 
that's gonna increase that mobility
while<00:01:09.430> still<00:01:09.729> keeping<00:01:09.909> that<00:01:10.090> protection<00:01:10.540> up

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
while still keeping that protection up

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.569 
while still keeping that protection up
against<00:01:11.500> your<00:01:11.590> body<00:01:11.680> during<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.130> game<00:01:12.340> so

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
against your body during the game so

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:14.990 
against your body during the game so
going<00:01:13.360> on<00:01:13.509> from<00:01:13.659> there<00:01:13.810> take<00:01:14.049> a<00:01:14.079> look<00:01:14.409> at<00:01:14.590> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
going on from there take a look at the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.219 
going on from there take a look at the
bicep<00:01:16.000> guards<00:01:16.299> and<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.509> shoulder<00:01:16.810> caps<00:01:17.020> on

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
bicep guards and the shoulder caps on

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.410 
bicep guards and the shoulder caps on
this<00:01:17.380> I'm<00:01:17.740> starting<00:01:18.100> on<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.250> bicep<00:01:18.579> guards<00:01:18.880> to

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
this I'm starting on the bicep guards to

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.850 
this I'm starting on the bicep guards to
move<00:01:19.570> in<00:01:19.719> here<00:01:19.930> you<00:01:20.320> see<00:01:20.530> they<00:01:20.680> have<00:01:20.829> a

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
move in here you see they have a

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.830 
move in here you see they have a
two-piece<00:01:21.340> free-floating<00:01:21.850> design<00:01:22.270> similar

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
two-piece free-floating design similar

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.880 
two-piece free-floating design similar
to<00:01:22.960> what<00:01:23.049> I<00:01:23.110> showed<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.320> on<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.530> other<00:01:23.680> where

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
to what I showed you on the other where

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.530 
to what I showed you on the other where
you<00:01:23.920> have<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.189> nylon<00:01:24.610> webbing<00:01:24.759> and<00:01:25.180> it<00:01:25.390> really

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
you have the nylon webbing and it really

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.600 
you have the nylon webbing and it really
allows<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.200> slide<00:01:26.439> into<00:01:26.680> it<00:01:26.890> as<00:01:27.310> well<00:01:27.520> as

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
allows that to slide into it as well as

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.660 
allows that to slide into it as well as
back<00:01:27.759> down<00:01:28.060> these<00:01:28.509> are<00:01:28.570> also<00:01:28.930> plastic<00:01:29.710> inserts

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
back down these are also plastic inserts

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.889 
back down these are also plastic inserts
throughout<00:01:31.030> both<00:01:31.210> of<00:01:31.450> these<00:01:31.540> so<00:01:31.689> that's<00:01:31.810> gonna

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
throughout both of these so that's gonna

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.690 
throughout both of these so that's gonna
give<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.140> nice<00:01:32.469> little<00:01:32.680> protection<00:01:33.340> with

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
give that nice little protection with

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.880 
give that nice little protection with
foams<00:01:34.000> on<00:01:34.240> both<00:01:34.509> sides<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.200> it<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.619> can

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
foams on both sides of it and you can

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.139 
foams on both sides of it and you can
really<00:01:36.039> see<00:01:36.189> it<00:01:36.280> does<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.460> good<00:01:36.670> job<00:01:36.729> at<00:01:37.000> really

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
really see it does a good job at really

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.330 
really see it does a good job at really
wrapping<00:01:37.630> all<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.810> way<00:01:37.899> around<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.350> arm<00:01:38.500> I'm

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
wrapping all the way around the arm I'm

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.550 
wrapping all the way around the arm I'm
also<00:01:39.549> going<00:01:39.820> on<00:01:40.000> from<00:01:40.210> there<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:41.020> see<00:01:41.229> it<00:01:41.320> does

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
also going on from there you see it does

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.469 
also going on from there you see it does
have<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.950> adjustment<00:01:42.549> feature<00:01:42.789> right<00:01:43.210> here<00:01:43.240> I

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
have the adjustment feature right here I

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.630 
have the adjustment feature right here I
have<00:01:43.630> an<00:01:43.719> elastic<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.799> you're<00:01:44.920> really<00:01:45.100> able<00:01:45.310> to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
have an elastic so you're really able to

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.120 
have an elastic so you're really able to
determine<00:01:46.149> how<00:01:46.299> far<00:01:46.539> down<00:01:46.869> or<00:01:47.289> far<00:01:47.619> up<00:01:47.859> the

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
determine how far down or far up the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.529 
determine how far down or far up the
pads<00:01:48.340> gonna<00:01:48.579> fit<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.000> that's<00:01:49.149> a<00:01:49.210> nice<00:01:49.329> feature

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
pads gonna fit so that's a nice feature

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.899 
pads gonna fit so that's a nice feature
as<00:01:49.780> well<00:01:49.960> also<00:01:50.920> on<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.250> shoulder<00:01:51.520> cap<00:01:51.729> which

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
as well also on the shoulder cap which

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.010 
as well also on the shoulder cap which
is<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:52.060> little<00:01:52.270> bit<00:01:52.359> different<00:01:52.689> than<00:01:52.810> some<00:01:52.840> of

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
is a little bit different than some of

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.270 
is a little bit different than some of
the<00:01:53.079> other<00:01:53.170> manufacturers<00:01:53.560> is<00:01:53.829> they've

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
the other manufacturers is they've

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.859 
the other manufacturers is they've
attached<00:01:54.609> it<00:01:54.820> here<00:01:55.090> as<00:01:55.149> you<00:01:55.270> can<00:01:55.299> see<00:01:55.450> with

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
attached it here as you can see with

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.109 
attached it here as you can see with
this<00:01:56.020> an<00:01:56.369> elastic<00:01:57.369> webbing<00:01:57.670> material<00:01:57.700> so

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
this an elastic webbing material so

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.219 
this an elastic webbing material so
that's<00:01:58.270> actually<00:01:58.570> going<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.719> offer<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.109> little

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
that's actually going to offer a little

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.810 
that's actually going to offer a little
more<00:01:59.469> mobility<00:01:59.740> there<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.429> they<00:02:00.670> have<00:02:00.759> a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
more mobility there and they have a

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.730 
more mobility there and they have a
larger<00:02:01.210> piece<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.570> elastic<00:02:01.810> here<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.439> another

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
larger piece of elastic here and another

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.560 
larger piece of elastic here and another
one<00:02:02.920> on<00:02:02.950> top<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:03.729> it<00:02:03.820> really<00:02:04.000> allows<00:02:04.299> that<00:02:04.509> to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
one on top so it really allows that to

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.899 
one on top so it really allows that to
move<00:02:04.929> as<00:02:05.469> far<00:02:05.679> as<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.920> shoulder<00:02:06.219> cap<00:02:06.429> goes<00:02:06.700> you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
move as far as the shoulder cap goes you

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.790 
move as far as the shoulder cap goes you
have<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.030> nice<00:02:07.240> size<00:02:07.539> to<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.960> it<00:02:08.289> doesn't<00:02:08.500> rest

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
have a nice size to it it doesn't rest

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.469 
have a nice size to it it doesn't rest
too<00:02:08.979> high<00:02:09.190> but<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.520> does<00:02:09.670> wrap<00:02:09.910> across<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
too high but it does wrap across the

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.420 
too high but it does wrap across the
front<00:02:10.780> as<00:02:10.960> well<00:02:11.170> as<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.470> back<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:12.010> you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
front as well as in the back and you

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.160 
front as well as in the back and you
have<00:02:12.550> some<00:02:12.700> nice<00:02:12.850> foams<00:02:13.240> underneath<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:14.020> as

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
have some nice foams underneath it as

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.020 
have some nice foams underneath it as
well<00:02:14.380> as<00:02:14.470> your<00:02:14.590> plastic<00:02:15.160> core<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.670> then

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
well as your plastic core and then

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.730 
well as your plastic core and then
another<00:02:16.270> level<00:02:16.600> of<00:02:16.750> foams<00:02:17.020> on<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.290> top<00:02:17.500> so

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
another level of foams on the top so

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.220 
another level of foams on the top so
converse<00:02:18.100> some<00:02:18.250> good<00:02:18.460> protection<00:02:19.090> into<00:02:19.990> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
converse some good protection into the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.780 
converse some good protection into the
collar<00:02:20.470> bone<00:02:20.680> or<00:02:20.710> clavicle<00:02:21.250> area<00:02:21.490> you<00:02:21.670> have

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
collar bone or clavicle area you have

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.280 
collar bone or clavicle area you have
some<00:02:21.940> high-density<00:02:22.480> foam<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:22.990> can<00:02:23.110> see

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
some high-density foam so you can see

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.810 
some high-density foam so you can see
here<00:02:23.500> they<00:02:23.590> are<00:02:23.620> segmented<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.700> really

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
here they are segmented so it really

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.150 
here they are segmented so it really
wraps<00:02:25.120> over<00:02:25.360> nicely<00:02:25.900> making<00:02:26.680> sure<00:02:26.950> there's<00:02:27.100> no

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
wraps over nicely making sure there's no

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.280 
wraps over nicely making sure there's no
gaps<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.730> protection<00:02:28.180> right<00:02:28.300> there<00:02:28.510> I'm

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
gaps and protection right there I'm

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.590 
gaps and protection right there I'm
going<00:02:29.530> onto<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.830> back<00:02:29.980> portion<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:31.390> see<00:02:31.420> it

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
going onto the back portion you see it

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.180 
going onto the back portion you see it
has<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> very<00:02:31.930> similar<00:02:32.170> design<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.890> front

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
has a very similar design to the front

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.070 
has a very similar design to the front
I'm<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.760> have<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.000> same<00:02:34.240> panel<00:02:34.540> structure

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
I'm you have that same panel structure

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.290 
I'm you have that same panel structure
as<00:02:35.230> well<00:02:35.470> as<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.800> segmented<00:02:36.310> dual<00:02:37.060> density

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
as well as the segmented dual density

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.870 
as well as the segmented dual density
foams<00:02:37.720> on<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:37.990> outside<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:39.370> see<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.670> both

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
foams on the outside you see that both

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.370 
foams on the outside you see that both
sides<00:02:40.180> same<00:02:40.450> thing<00:02:40.480> with<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.900> mesh<00:02:41.110> material

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
sides same thing with the mesh material

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.560 
sides same thing with the mesh material
and<00:02:41.920> then<00:02:42.280> in<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.460> center<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.940> see<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.210> little

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
and then in the center you see a little

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.840 
and then in the center you see a little
bit<00:02:43.720> denser<00:02:44.380> materials<00:02:44.860> as<00:02:45.310> well<00:02:45.580> as<00:02:45.700> those

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
bit denser materials as well as those

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.490 
bit denser materials as well as those
thick<00:02:46.240> raised<00:02:46.540> up<00:02:46.750> pieces<00:02:47.020> give<00:02:47.350> me<00:02:47.410> that

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
thick raised up pieces give me that

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.620 
thick raised up pieces give me that
protection<00:02:47.890> same<00:02:48.790> kind<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.060> design<00:02:49.390> as<00:02:49.600> the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
protection same kind of design as the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.290 
protection same kind of design as the
front<00:02:49.990> as<00:02:50.260> far<00:02:50.830> as<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.040> goes<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.550> then<00:02:52.060> also

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
front as far as that goes and then also

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
you used the two-piece bicep guard so

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.490 
you used the two-piece bicep guard so
really<00:04:04.360> as<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:04.510> move<00:04:04.750> your<00:04:04.870> arm<00:04:05.020> allows<00:04:05.290> the

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
really as you move your arm allows the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.530 
really as you move your arm allows the
pieces<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:05.950> slide<00:04:06.190> into<00:04:06.460> each<00:04:06.730> other<00:04:07.000> not

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
pieces to slide into each other not

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.970 
pieces to slide into each other not
holding<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.020> back<00:04:08.200> but<00:04:08.500> then<00:04:08.620> when<00:04:08.740> your<00:04:08.860> arm

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
holding you back but then when your arm

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.350 
holding you back but then when your arm
comes<00:04:09.160> back<00:04:09.430> down<00:04:09.610> you<00:04:09.760> solve<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.030> good

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
comes back down you solve that good

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.480 
comes back down you solve that good
level<00:04:10.630> protection<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.980> this<00:04:12.100> has<00:04:12.220> just<00:04:12.250> been<00:04:12.460> a

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
level protection so this has just been a

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.130 
level protection so this has just been a
quick<00:04:12.760> look<00:04:13.030> at<00:04:13.210> the<00:04:13.330> warrior<00:04:13.570> hit<00:04:13.930> man's

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140
