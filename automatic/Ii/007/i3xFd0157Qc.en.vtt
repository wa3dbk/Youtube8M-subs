so here's the bike see 2012 Honda nc700x
I<00:00:29.840> think<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.929> looks<00:00:31.080> like<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.260> dolphin<00:00:32.300> jumping

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
I think it looks like a dolphin jumping

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.020 
I think it looks like a dolphin jumping
out<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> water<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.670> design

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
out of the water like the design

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.000 
out of the water like the design
features<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.140> front<00:00:37.410> kind<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.770> reminds

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
features of it the front kind of reminds

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.979 
features of it the front kind of reminds
me<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> beak<00:00:38.430> reminds<00:00:39.000> me<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:41.129> BMW's

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
me of the beak reminds me of the BMW's

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.500 
me of the beak reminds me of the BMW's
the<00:00:42.989> f800<00:00:43.620> GS<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.309> f700

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the f800 GS and the f700

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.450 
the f800 GS and the f700
GS<00:00:47.629> obviously<00:00:48.629> not<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.500> extreme<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.280> beak

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
GS obviously not as extreme on the beak

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.990 
GS obviously not as extreme on the beak
but<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:52.579> I<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
but I kind of like that and I like the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.119 
but I kind of like that and I like the
styling<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.809> overall<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.770> pretty

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
styling of it overall it's pretty

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.369 
styling of it overall it's pretty
aggressive<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.300> standard<00:00:57.750> motorcycle

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
aggressive it's a standard motorcycle

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.130 
aggressive it's a standard motorcycle
for<00:00:59.129> Honda<00:01:00.020> but<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.910> it<00:01:02.910> looks<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.840> looks<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
for Honda but it it it looks it looks a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.479 
for Honda but it it it looks it looks a
little<00:01:04.260> more<00:01:04.470> aggressive<00:01:05.129> than<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.369> actually

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
little more aggressive than it actually

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.580 
little more aggressive than it actually
is<00:01:07.040> this<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.220> my<00:01:08.369> first<00:01:08.670> bike<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:12.590> didn't

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
is this is my first bike and I didn't

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.980 
is this is my first bike and I didn't
have<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> lot<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:13.979> experience<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.939> course<00:01:15.150> when

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
have a lot of experience of course when

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.289 
have a lot of experience of course when
I<00:01:16.020> was<00:01:16.290> trying<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.890> pick<00:01:17.070> one<00:01:17.220> out<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
I was trying to pick one out the the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.880 
I was trying to pick one out the the
bike<00:01:18.450> itself<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:20.479> its<00:01:21.479> brand<00:01:21.689> new<00:01:21.930> concept<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.590 

it<00:01:25.890> has<00:01:26.070> an<00:01:26.460> engine<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.119> took<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.450> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it has an engine that they took out of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.969 
it has an engine that they took out of
something<00:01:27.780> else<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.409> cut<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.799> half

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
something else and I cut it in half

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.640 
something else and I cut it in half
somehow<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.729> made<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> engine<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.409> and

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
somehow and made the engine for it and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.069 
somehow and made the engine for it and
so<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.070> slanted<00:01:33.030> pretty<00:01:33.210> far<00:01:33.450> forward<00:01:33.900> but

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
so it's slanted pretty far forward but

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.890 
so it's slanted pretty far forward but
that<00:01:34.290> left<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.829> lot<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.009> storage<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.900> this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
that left a lot of storage up here this

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.020 
that left a lot of storage up here this
compartment<00:01:37.290> opens<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.820> put<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
compartment opens up and you can put a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.889 
compartment opens up and you can put a
full<00:01:39.570> face<00:01:39.810> helmet<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.009> need<00:01:41.159> to

out and won't do anything past that
really<00:03:37.880> until<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:38.910> got<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.120> shift<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.660> it's<00:03:39.810> a

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
really until you got a shift and it's a

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.770 
really until you got a shift and it's a
six-speed<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:42.750> it's<00:03:43.110> happy<00:03:43.950> it's<00:03:44.540> peppy<00:03:45.540> ish

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.600 
six-speed so it's happy it's peppy ish
but<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.530> just<00:03:46.770> doesn't<00:03:47.040> get<00:03:47.100> my<00:03:47.250> heart<00:03:47.430> rate

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.229 
but it just doesn't get my heart rate
going<00:03:47.870> you<00:03:48.870> know<00:03:48.989> that's<00:03:49.830> that's<00:03:50.760> kind<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
going you know that's that's kind of the

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.330 
going you know that's that's kind of the
point<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.690> want<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.140> feel<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.620> bike<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:53.040> want<00:03:53.220> to

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
point I want to feel the bike I want to

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.140 
point I want to feel the bike I want to
feel<00:03:53.910> like<00:03:54.090> there's<00:03:54.270> more<00:03:55.580> more<00:03:56.580> left<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.060> the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
feel like there's more more left in the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.449 
feel like there's more more left in the
throttle<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:58.170> little<00:03:58.380> extra<00:03:58.709> if<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.100> need<00:03:59.280> it

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
throttle and a little extra if I need it

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.340 
throttle and a little extra if I need it
or<00:03:59.700> or<00:04:00.660> what-have-you

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
or or what-have-you

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.220 
or or what-have-you
so<00:04:01.530> I'm<00:04:01.680> kind<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.010> learning<00:04:03.050> lack<00:04:04.050> of

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
so I'm kind of learning lack of

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.000 
so I'm kind of learning lack of
experience<00:04:04.770> on<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.160> part<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:09.830> again<00:04:10.830> I<00:04:10.860> think

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
experience on that part so again I think

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.199 
experience on that part so again I think
it's<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.400> great<00:04:11.700> starter<00:04:12.630> bike<00:04:13.290> in<00:04:13.760> town<00:04:14.760> it's

a<00:05:10.190> good<00:05:10.789> thing<00:05:10.940> about<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.270> NC<00:05:11.539> 7<00:05:11.720> hundred<00:05:12.020> acts

is<00:05:12.380> it<00:05:13.220> gets<00:05:13.400> phenomenal<00:05:14.000> gas<00:05:14.180> mileage<00:05:14.919> right

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
around 65 70 miles per gallon which
