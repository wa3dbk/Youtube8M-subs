this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> very<00:00:47.910> dangerous<00:00:48.239> point<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.320> end

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
this is a very dangerous point to end

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.850 
this is a very dangerous point to end
the<00:00:50.039> story<00:00:50.399> because<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.149> sends<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.719> message

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
the story because it sends the message

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.880 
the story because it sends the message
so<00:00:52.860> if<00:00:53.160> I'm<00:00:53.489> following<00:00:54.210> Jesus<00:00:54.510> nothing<00:00:55.379> bad

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
so if I'm following Jesus nothing bad

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.740 
so if I'm following Jesus nothing bad
will<00:00:56.129> ever<00:00:56.160> happen<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:57.000> me<00:00:57.120> God<00:00:57.360> will<00:00:57.570> deliver

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
will ever happen to me God will deliver

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.040 
will ever happen to me God will deliver
me<00:00:58.170> from<00:00:58.440> everything<00:00:59.120> we<00:01:00.120> can't<00:01:00.449> land<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.870> that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
me from everything we can't land it that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.750 
me from everything we can't land it that
way<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.440> leads<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.100> much<00:01:02.250> bad<00:01:02.520> theology

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
way that leads to so much bad theology

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.299 
way that leads to so much bad theology
in<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> church<00:01:03.930> today<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.949> frightening

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
in the church today is just frightening

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.330 
in the church today is just frightening
how<00:01:05.640> much<00:01:05.880> damage<00:01:06.270> stopping<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> story<00:01:07.680> there

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
how much damage stopping the story there

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.149 
how much damage stopping the story there
does<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.210> Ian<00:01:09.600> asks<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.229> obvious<00:01:10.650> question

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
does so Ian asks the obvious question

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.920 
does so Ian asks the obvious question
because<00:01:11.490> he<00:01:11.700> remembers<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.390> story<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
because he remembers the story of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.920 
because he remembers the story of
Stephen<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.860> we've<00:01:14.010> already<00:01:14.220> told<00:01:14.700> why<00:01:15.689> did

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
Stephen that we've already told why did

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.510 
Stephen that we've already told why did
God<00:01:16.140> save<00:01:16.530> Paul<00:01:17.000> but<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.270> Stephen<00:01:19.340> didn't<00:01:20.340> he

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
God save Paul but not Stephen didn't he

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.380 
God save Paul but not Stephen didn't he
loved<00:01:20.790> Stephen<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.570> much<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.700> such<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
loved Stephen as much and that is such a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.469 
loved Stephen as much and that is such a
profoundly<00:01:25.200> central<00:01:25.920> question<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:27.330> mature

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
