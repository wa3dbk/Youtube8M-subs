00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.580
 bike we mount in the pÃ©riode and we go out 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.509
 Once out there and toss and turn

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.579
 too close 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:25.109
 get off and enter the garage mounted in 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:28.380
 way and exit again as you see 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:32.429
 on the way out I have to fall 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.799

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.899
 being careful not to get in 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.030
 garage 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.729

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.130

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.679
 from the garage and once far away prix 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.899
 stop and call the mechanic e 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.479
 ask to bring the car more 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.639

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.490
 you will lose the car and its price will come 

00:01:53.639 --> 00:02:01.829
 transferred to your bike 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:05.630

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.959
 go there to sell 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.330
