00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:11.790
 this game that seeks to destroy in 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.190
 map drones if I do not leave the pot like 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.990
 You see we entered a few the game and 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.740
 half of the team 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:24.820
 throughout the game says bye bye me 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:28.540
 I'm not afraid and they leave us at 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:32.309
 look like a team of three against one 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:37.480
 team of six we will logically lose the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:40.769
 departure and the truth that as I said in the 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.989
 last video I have enough complaints of 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.150
 the teams half the people half of 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.760
 the games goes that if connection with 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.940
 the game lost that seven that counts 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.220
 defeats because one of the other team 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.769
 pull the cable you're hanging you 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.500
 count all defeat because another strip 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.879
 the cable and it sends you backwards and so on 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.979
 etcetera etcetera everything tells you 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.590
 you beat me well it's my turn but 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:09.460
 the games but good to lose it and 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.960
 in this case he was worried and super 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.330
 little team that I tell you half I know 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.250
 he left the game in the second round 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.250
 and they left us hanging more than 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.590
 I bring it because I had a good run 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.540
 with the with the army and I made myself a 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.340
 ruthless that I still do not know how is the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:39.149
 Truth because the three of us who remained 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.520
 you had a very very very very frightened 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.680
 because apart the other team was 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.810
 pretty good is not that it has a 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.280
 point for my people who are camping in 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.250
 its base 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.899
 they came as full ones and eye to 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.729
 then this time it is not to be 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.360
 prepared but I do not know where it falls 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.380
 the uncle who is in front of talk or 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.420
 it does not shoot me good or not expected 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.399
 I was there and I know what the fuck 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.519
 Does that man 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.819
 well we won the first round here as 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.819
 you see 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.610
 we have to replace them as they 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.610
 we are four if we do not see badly 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.370
 wait 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.750
 this is when I'm once pointing 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.320
 it kills me 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.050
 is loaded on the targets as you see 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.590
 we lost the round in fact a cut 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:47.010
 paste the video to not see 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.560
 what the poor did we are three 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.420
 against six 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.239
 i have a a ferrari is a s 40 in the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.550
 pocket to take out I'm going to touch I have the 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.780
 important pump handle the pump 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.240
 convert the leaves some of these 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.340
 we carry it fatally 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:12.290
 how I saw that things were pretty 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:17.560
 chunga god placed those who 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:23.530
 and we will and we will have had 63 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:27.459
 each one proceeded to get to kill 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.020
 I get to kill with 200 bullets 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.990
 above but good nothing happens 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.030
 it's more than assumed they turn it off 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.780
 because my team does not move from the 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.300
 base 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.840
 3 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:45.500
 and the campers and how there is feeling in 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.290
 the objective other other subjects 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.650
 we are again 6 but the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.760
 idea for time exhausted and good the 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.390
 little team nothing serious, it was my turn 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.250
 he touched the black 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.870
 with the chosen 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.870
 as we said carrying my 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:14.130
 of casualties with the weapon a ruthless I do not 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.380
 I know many people who have been removed 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.380
 a desperate seeks to destroy 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.420
 since quite complicated 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.720
 the losing streak and that makes it easy but 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:36.650
 kill you 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:40.330
 shooter to the ground with my super super 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.330
 team and as you see 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.960
 here for 23 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:08.260
 and so we are going to look and so we go well 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.310
 and so lose carlos graphics 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:15.700
 there are as I already have my 20 streaks and their 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.960
 streak the spy plane the important thing is the 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.030
 car and eye what time I'm going to like in 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.280
 the plane spies 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.760
 just when he threw the car I see that 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:32.170
 arms one down the road 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.950
 and just the guy knew perfectly that 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.210
 I was there 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.740
 1 - and every moment a lot of luck because 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.240
 I knew that the car had left and 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.240
 I knew that this one was here 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:51.180
 if they do not let me 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:55.260
 here as it has been 5 I am all 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.980
 the other dead and the purpose that is 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.110
 place in the pump 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.160
 how do you see the markers of laughter in my 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.160
 team a single shooter 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.690
 another creative brand 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.650
 and good when you stay alone and put the 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.229
 pump the only thing you can do is 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.590
 is trying to fuck him out of Arratzain because 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:25.669
 there are four guys left I do not know how many 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:27.960
 both are left as is the case but 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:30.930
 never 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.480
 We never go very very difficult in 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.150
 little less than a month 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.659
 when they know you have to pick up and 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.930
 all sin 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:40.930
 the bomb 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.340
 two and two of bulk 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.620
 defend the objectives 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.270
 the enemy help pack on the way 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:01.880
 here it is our turn as you see defend another 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.880
 time we will defend little because I want 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.000
 in 10 seconds the whole team 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.580
 the truth that go to fabric 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:26.640
 you are alone 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:30.600
 my team did not give of my team not 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:34.180
 it works confirmed as I've been killing 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.010
 to the adventure because I'm going alone 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.130
 five or four years in those left 

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.130
 yet 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.760
 in the car 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:48.710
 they are going to kill me sure that he stabbed 

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:48.710
 one 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:56.470
 he committed suicide the car I would just go to 

00:07:53.169 --> 00:08:05.710
 kill it could be that not but but 

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:09.120
 more than anything else we see what 

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.120
 that you liked goodbye
