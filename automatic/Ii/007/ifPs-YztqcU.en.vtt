 life for the sake of that is i share full 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.610
 disappointments 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.680
 imagine being committed 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.550
 the classic fireplace of it from time to time 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.619

 snotty imitators of the great genre 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.369
 once at a concert of such a raw pose 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.290
 an accident occurs one of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.239
 guitarists climbed onto the scenery which 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.640
 cannot withstand its weight and naturally 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.950
 falls go like a real hero in spirit 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.660
 the artist 's grief saves however 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.879
 gets seriously wounded spectacle 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.530
 unpleasant bloodshed flows our reach

 and rescued musicians in a panic 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.409
 a few drops of blood scatter 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 falls on the badge go with the expression 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.449

 village times of brutality 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.470
 and present in heavy metal audience 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.060
 project is closely limited to genre 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.100
 the focus of the game itself mutates 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.110
 every hour is naturally sound 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.360
 design also disgusts 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.490
 supporters of pop culture at the same time 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.259
 she's awesome stylized and just 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.299
 shines with sparkling humor and 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.430
 colorful characters meeting with 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.049
 which each time turns into a whole

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.600
 only in this wonderful world 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.549
 created the best man can see

 true unlike rex prototype 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.880
 turned out high and pumped if you 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.140
 know none of the above 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.939
 musicians, in principle, you can safely 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.630
 release the brutal legend from your field 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.060
 of view 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.009
 it is unlikely you will like the same 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.780
 can be recommended to those who do not listen 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.670
 rock does not like the work of jack black 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.439
 or not at all familiar with him and waiting for this 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.520
 games deep gameplay and high 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.859
 polygonal texture 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.050
 the game has a very narrow audience and this 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.470
 is it good and bad at the same time brutal 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.300
 legend 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.460
 Good for being really fat 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.530
 loves heavy guitar riffs and quality 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.540
 no heavy metal will be excited about work 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.220
 shakira he did for real 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.140
 fan-driven product 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.060
 able to highlight the target audience 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.890
 check you, you'll definitely smitten 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.959
 these incredibly beautiful decorations 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.360
 permanently associated with fireworms 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.709
 Scandinavia you will be happy 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.510
 racing under the mattress 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.370
 navigate the open world under 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.110
 motley crue and fight the enemy 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.000
 peep north and certainly not you 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.099
 disappoint constant references to significant 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.409
 the events of the world of rock and the total strength 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.540
 games for small endless tours 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.370
 furious lesson in the collective however those 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.080
 who is all of the above absolutely 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.420
 all the same in my entirety 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.700
 unhappy let's say game mechanics or 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.860
 a constant jump in games from one genre to 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.840
 another if first brutal does john take 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.879
 peppy start offering ruby funny 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.319
 over heavy music 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.870
 time the process of destruction itself 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.299
 opponents does not change with food from 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.790
 pretty quickly apparently the best man decided that 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.159
 the situation will save the endless change of heat 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.870
 being a first slasher game is pretty 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.909
 quickly puts the player by the hand cool 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.040
 car turning everything into action race 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.230
 and then do with the main character 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.849
 commanders require him constant 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.709
 control of like - minded plant 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.560
 technically everything is working properly 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.959
 purely aesthetically, too, no complaints 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.569
 allies are opponents of the arena and locations 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.819
 made incomparably original and tasteful 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.709
 but this is eternal flirting with us 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.420
 Looks like an attempt to find a game 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.799
 place among the other one systems 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.689
 it turned out that because of these 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.549
 uncertain jumps as it should not 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.829
 no project component works 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.750
 so it turns out that tim best man created 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.579
 superb ingenious and incredible 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.739
 exciting product for dedicated 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.209
 and not very interesting hack for everyone 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.189
 the rest therefore strongly 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.019
 We recommend testing this project to everyone. 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.180
 video game lovers and classic 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.220
 rock music the rest get ready for 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.220
 muscle game you can simply not hook
