00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.230
 design continue to see the physical for 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:16.909
 to do it we will need a base of 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.820
 enamel a pistachio green enamel 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:24.409
 a white paint acrylic paint 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.750
 black acrylic an encapsulated enamel 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:31.410
 or shine and a brush 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.200
 very well to begin, you know, we'll take 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.930
 our enamel 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.809
 which will be our protective base or 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.350
 our treatment and we will apply it 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.470
 on all our nails once 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.650
 applied on all our nails 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.650
 let it dry 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:56.600
 and now do prepare to perform the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.550
 design first let's take the enamel 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.270
 of green color I am using a 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.460
 green as green pistache is optional already 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.270
 you know can use the one that you 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.510
 have we apply thin layers so that 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.250
 dry much faster and then if it is 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.890
 necessary we apply the layers that are 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.340
 necessary for the color color to 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.740
 be uniform once you 're done with 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.040
 our green enamel let's take the 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.860
 black acrylic paint and let's go 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.540
 to make various lines about our 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.630
 Ã© unha of the thumb to start that 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.540
 go along our entire nail 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.930
 we are going to make these lines about 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.860
 the thumb the index finger the finger 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.070
 ring and the little finger the middle finger 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.560
 we will leave it alone without any 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.370
 limit on the middle finger we're going to 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.670
 perform a heart first 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:03.550
 black this heart wash it one size 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.170
 medium not too small or too big and 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.180
 later we will make another 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.870
 heart just black but now 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:15.110
 yes a little bit smaller than the first 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:18.080
 this little heart is going to go that way, it's not empty 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.110
 to have any design nothing else is the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.820
 pure black heart take your time 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.790
 remember so that they are pretty 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.590
 our figures now like this with the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.800
 acrylic paint we will do our 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.170
 third heart that is more or less 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.100
 of the measurement of the first heart for 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.510
 that we have something similar once 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.590
 already dried 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.570
 our three little hearts we are going to 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.210
 decorate those of the first in black what 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.240
 let's decorate with several dots 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.810
 small in the order that we 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:58.700
 we want to put them 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:01.460
 and then the white heart is going to 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.840
 decorate with several black lines 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:09.200
 all around these lines must 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.900
 be tiny so you can see the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.640
 figure correctly once 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.130
 we are finished we are going to use our 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.900
 encapsulated our protective shine and 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.860
 we will apply it on all our 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.830
 nail we let dry and we have ready now 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.680
