property of fredbears family diner so is
it<00:03:35.740> possible<00:03:35.920> put<00:03:36.670> this<00:03:36.820> animatronic<00:03:37.300> be

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
it possible put this animatronic be

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.230 
it possible put this animatronic be
fredbear<00:03:38.560> yeah<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.250> think<00:03:39.550> that's<00:03:39.670> really<00:03:39.910> good

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
fredbear yeah I think that's really good

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.200 
fredbear yeah I think that's really good
assumption<00:03:40.690> there<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.290> um<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.430> lot<00:03:42.820> of<00:03:42.940> people

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
assumption there and um a lot of people

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.090 
assumption there and um a lot of people
think<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.540> fredbear<00:03:44.020> is<00:03:44.230> golden<00:03:44.710> freddy

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
think that fredbear is golden freddy

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.920 
think that fredbear is golden freddy
because<00:03:45.580> in<00:03:45.820> five<00:03:46.270> nights<00:03:46.420> at<00:03:46.600> freddy's<00:03:46.900> 3

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
because in five nights at freddy's 3

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.220 
because in five nights at freddy's 3
there<00:03:47.740> are<00:03:47.770> some<00:03:48.160> hints<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:49.150> fredbear<00:03:50.020> is

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
there are some hints that fredbear is

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.950 
there are some hints that fredbear is
golden<00:03:50.590> freddy<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:51.730> i<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:51.970> personally

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
golden freddy and so i I personally

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.960 
golden freddy and so i I personally
think<00:03:53.200> I'm<00:03:54.040> trying<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.370> come<00:03:54.520> up<00:03:54.640> with<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.820> good

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
think I'm trying to come up with a good

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.430 
think I'm trying to come up with a good
theory<00:03:55.360> here<00:03:55.570> I<00:03:55.720> think<00:03:55.990> this<00:03:56.110> is<00:03:56.230> either

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
theory here I think this is either

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.310 
theory here I think this is either
golden<00:03:57.130> it's<00:03:57.730> obviously<00:03:58.150> fredbear<00:03:58.750> but<00:03:59.200> it's

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
golden it's obviously fredbear but it's

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.890 
golden it's obviously fredbear but it's
either<00:03:59.590> golden<00:04:00.220> freddy<00:04:00.580> or<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:01.480> purple

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
either golden freddy or the purple

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.750 
either golden freddy or the purple
Freddy<00:04:02.170> yeah<00:04:02.710> I<00:04:02.740> can<00:04:02.980> see<00:04:03.160> how<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.340> think<00:04:03.640> it's

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
Freddy yeah I can see how you think it's

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.490 
Freddy yeah I can see how you think it's
the<00:04:03.880> purple<00:04:04.180> Freddy<00:04:04.420> because<00:04:04.810> it's<00:04:05.080> got<00:04:05.320> the

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
the purple Freddy because it's got the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.340 
the purple Freddy because it's got the
the<00:04:06.220> purple<00:04:06.550> bowtie<00:04:06.700> obviously<00:04:07.600> but<00:04:08.050> it<00:04:08.170> also

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
the purple bowtie obviously but it also

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.830 
the purple bowtie obviously but it also
links<00:04:08.710> with<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.460> golden<00:04:09.940> Freddy<00:04:10.240> because<00:04:10.630> if

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
links with the golden Freddy because if

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.820 
links with the golden Freddy because if
this<00:04:11.170> game<00:04:11.920> takes<00:04:12.580> place<00:04:12.700> in<00:04:13.410> 1987<00:04:14.410> like<00:04:14.620> the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
this game takes place in 1987 like the

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.130 
this game takes place in 1987 like the
source<00:04:15.130> code<00:04:15.490> is<00:04:15.640> suggesting<00:04:16.390> then<00:04:16.960> it's

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
source code is suggesting then it's

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.930 
source code is suggesting then it's
possible<00:04:17.650> that<00:04:17.770> this<00:04:17.920> could<00:04:17.980> be<00:04:18.280> golden

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
possible that this could be golden

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.630 
possible that this could be golden
Freddy<00:04:19.359> purple<00:04:20.230> Freddy<00:04:20.470> or<00:04:20.830> maybe<00:04:21.190> it's<00:04:21.400> both

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
Freddy purple Freddy or maybe it's both

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.460 
Freddy purple Freddy or maybe it's both
yeah<00:04:22.300> that's<00:04:22.570> what<00:04:22.720> I<00:04:22.750> was<00:04:22.930> thinking<00:04:23.290> maybe

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
yeah that's what I was thinking maybe

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.430 
yeah that's what I was thinking maybe
golden<00:04:24.220> Freddy<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.669> purple<00:04:25.030> Freddy<00:04:25.300> are<00:04:25.600> one

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
golden Freddy and purple Freddy are one

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.660 
golden Freddy and purple Freddy are one
in<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.680> same<00:04:26.950> you<00:04:27.160> know<00:04:27.310> like

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
in the same you know like

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.550 
in the same you know like
maybe<00:04:27.820> there's<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.180> saying<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:29.020> same<00:04:29.230> being

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
maybe there's a saying the same being

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.410 
maybe there's a saying the same being
you<00:04:29.860> know<00:04:30.010> yeah<00:04:30.490> that's<00:04:30.670> what<00:04:30.790> I<00:04:30.880> was<00:04:31.060> thinking

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
you know yeah that's what I was thinking

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.070 
you know yeah that's what I was thinking
maybe<00:04:31.600> uh<00:04:31.810> maybe<00:04:32.680> golden<00:04:33.220> freddy<00:04:33.520> is<00:04:33.640> what

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
maybe uh maybe golden freddy is what

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.480 
maybe uh maybe golden freddy is what
purple<00:04:35.080> Freddy<00:04:35.350> became<00:04:35.860> like<00:04:36.100> maybe<00:04:36.340> he

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
purple Freddy became like maybe he

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.150 
purple Freddy became like maybe he
became<00:04:36.790> golden<00:04:37.390> after<00:04:37.870> he<00:04:38.050> got<00:04:38.650> old<00:04:38.950> and

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
became golden after he got old and

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.390 
became golden after he got old and
rusted<00:04:39.670> you<00:04:39.820> know<00:04:39.970> yeah<00:04:40.330> I<00:04:40.360> know<00:04:40.540> but<00:04:41.320> he<00:04:41.980> does

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
rusted you know yeah I know but he does

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.760 
rusted you know yeah I know but he does
appear<00:04:42.880> as<00:04:42.910> golden<00:04:43.660> in<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:43.930> MIDI<00:04:44.290> game<00:04:44.560> in

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
appear as golden in the MIDI game in

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.320 
appear as golden in the MIDI game in
five<00:04:44.950> nights<00:04:45.100> at<00:04:45.250> Freddy's<00:04:45.520> 3<00:04:45.550> in<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.090> stage

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
five nights at Freddy's 3 in the stage

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.110 
five nights at Freddy's 3 in the stage
oh<00:04:46.540> one<00:04:46.930> mini<00:04:47.200> game<00:04:47.470> he<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.190> spring-trap<00:04:48.850> are

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
oh one mini game he and spring-trap are

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.840 
oh one mini game he and spring-trap are
already<00:04:50.080> golden<00:04:50.350> you<00:04:50.710> know<00:04:50.830> so<00:04:51.130> that<00:04:51.610> I<00:04:51.640> could

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
already golden you know so that I could

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.210 
already golden you know so that I could
disprove<00:04:52.270> that<00:04:52.600> theory<00:04:52.990> but<00:04:53.560> I'm<00:04:53.860> gonna<00:04:54.010> go

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
disprove that theory but I'm gonna go

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.980 
disprove that theory but I'm gonna go
out<00:04:54.340> on<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.490> limb<00:04:54.730> here<00:04:55.030> and<00:04:55.060> say<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.480> they

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
out on a limb here and say that they

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.260 
out on a limb here and say that they
might<00:04:56.200> they<00:04:56.410> might<00:04:56.440> be<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.890> same<00:04:57.160> thing<00:04:57.270> yeah

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
might they might be the same thing yeah

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.150 
might they might be the same thing yeah
I<00:04:58.540> think<00:04:58.960> that's<00:04:59.260> a<00:04:59.320> pretty<00:04:59.470> solid<00:04:59.710> theory

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
I think that's a pretty solid theory

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.770 
I think that's a pretty solid theory
honestly<00:05:00.610> I<00:05:00.640> mean<00:05:00.880> yeah<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.210> only<00:05:01.360> thing<00:05:01.510> that

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
honestly I mean yeah the only thing that

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.630 
honestly I mean yeah the only thing that
really<00:05:01.870> disproves<00:05:02.500> that<00:05:02.650> is<00:05:03.010> like<00:05:03.190> what<00:05:03.520> you

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
really disproves that is like what you

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.090 
really disproves that is like what you
said<00:05:03.850> with<00:05:04.030> the<00:05:04.060> mini<00:05:04.330> game<00:05:04.570> how<00:05:05.100> golden

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
said with the mini game how golden

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.350 
said with the mini game how golden
Freddy<00:05:06.340> might<00:05:06.520> have<00:05:06.610> been<00:05:06.700> golden<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.210> whole

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
Freddy might have been golden the whole

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.840 
Freddy might have been golden the whole
time<00:05:07.660> but<00:05:08.230> that<00:05:08.350> also<00:05:08.740> could<00:05:09.280> have<00:05:09.400> been<00:05:09.580> just

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
time but that also could have been just

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.810 
time but that also could have been just
Scott<00:05:10.210> just<00:05:10.600> showing<00:05:11.140> that<00:05:11.610> fredbear<00:05:12.610> was

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
Scott just showing that fredbear was

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.280 
Scott just showing that fredbear was
golden<00:05:13.180> Freddy<00:05:13.480> he<00:05:13.660> might<00:05:13.840> not<00:05:14.020> have<00:05:14.200> been

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
golden Freddy he might not have been

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.230 
golden Freddy he might not have been
golden<00:05:14.680> at<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:14.980> time<00:05:15.220> but<00:05:15.730> it's<00:05:15.850> just<00:05:16.000> showing

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
golden at the time but it's just showing

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.300 
golden at the time but it's just showing
that<00:05:16.420> Fred<00:05:16.720> bear<00:05:16.930> was<00:05:17.200> golden<00:05:17.620> Freddy<00:05:17.920> yeah

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
that Fred bear was golden Freddy yeah

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
believe that that's this animatronic

golden<00:05:37.240> freddy<00:05:37.510> /<00:05:37.900> purple<00:05:38.230> Freddy<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:38.830> think

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
golden freddy / purple Freddy I think

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.280 
golden freddy / purple Freddy I think
it's<00:05:39.340> one<00:05:39.490> of<00:05:39.520> those<00:05:39.700> three<00:05:40.270> yeah<00:05:40.810> me<00:05:41.050> too<00:05:41.260> I

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
it's one of those three yeah me too I

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.770 
it's one of those three yeah me too I
think<00:05:41.500> it's<00:05:41.800> it<00:05:42.160> it's<00:05:42.730> definitely<00:05:43.300> if<00:05:43.450> Freddy

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
think it's it it's definitely if Freddy

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.560 
think it's it it's definitely if Freddy
because<00:05:44.140> it's<00:05:44.320> got<00:05:44.530> the<00:05:44.770> I<00:05:45.280> don't<00:05:46.210> know<00:05:46.330> did

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
because it's got the I don't know did

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.090 
because it's got the I don't know did
any<00:05:46.720> of<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.960> other<00:05:47.050> Freddy's<00:05:47.470> do<00:05:47.710> they<00:05:47.860> have

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
any of the other Freddy's do they have

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.070 
any of the other Freddy's do they have
the<00:05:48.730> buttons<00:05:49.120> on<00:05:49.240> their<00:05:49.390> chests<00:05:49.720> because<00:05:50.050> I

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
the buttons on their chests because I

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.950 
the buttons on their chests because I
know<00:05:50.260> that<00:05:50.470> you<00:05:50.620> had<00:05:50.830> that<00:05:50.860> uh<00:05:51.750> I'm<00:05:52.750> just

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
know that you had that uh I'm just

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.990 
know that you had that uh I'm just
trying<00:05:53.200> to<00:05:53.230> think<00:05:53.320> back<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:53.980> I<00:05:54.430> don't<00:05:54.700> remember

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
trying to think back I I don't remember

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.720 
trying to think back I I don't remember
like<00:05:55.450> maybe<00:05:56.170> they<00:05:56.440> did<00:05:56.650> we'd<00:05:57.190> have<00:05:57.280> to<00:05:57.400> do<00:05:57.520> some

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
like maybe they did we'd have to do some

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.280 
like maybe they did we'd have to do some
more<00:05:57.820> research<00:05:58.030> into<00:05:58.480> this<00:05:58.600> but<00:05:58.870> yeah<00:05:59.080> I<00:05:59.110> think

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290 
more research into this but yeah I think

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.930 
more research into this but yeah I think
I'm<00:05:59.620> gonna<00:05:59.800> say<00:06:00.040> for<00:06:00.280> now<00:06:00.430> that<00:06:00.460> this<00:06:00.760> is

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
I'm gonna say for now that this is

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.240 
I'm gonna say for now that this is
probably<00:06:01.630> I<00:06:02.020> mean<00:06:02.890> this<00:06:03.010> could<00:06:03.220> be

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
probably I mean this could be

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.770 
probably I mean this could be
spring-trap<00:06:03.940> why<00:06:04.180> do<00:06:04.240> you<00:06:04.360> think<00:06:04.450> this<00:06:04.570> could

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
spring-trap why do you think this could

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.190 
spring-trap why do you think this could
be<00:06:04.810> spring-trap<00:06:05.380> ah<00:06:06.420> no<00:06:07.420> I<00:06:07.450> think<00:06:07.930> it's<00:06:08.050> more

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
be spring-trap ah no I think it's more

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.010 
be spring-trap ah no I think it's more
likely<00:06:08.470> to<00:06:08.710> be<00:06:08.830> Freddy<00:06:09.220> just<00:06:10.000> because<00:06:10.360> it

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
likely to be Freddy just because it

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.290 
likely to be Freddy just because it
because<00:06:11.740> we've<00:06:11.890> seen<00:06:12.160> a<00:06:12.430> lot<00:06:12.610> of<00:06:12.640> spring-trap

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
because we've seen a lot of spring-trap

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.970 
because we've seen a lot of spring-trap
in<00:06:13.510> five<00:06:13.690> nights<00:06:13.840> at<00:06:14.020> Freddy's<00:06:14.320> 3<00:06:14.350> already<00:06:14.770> I

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
in five nights at Freddy's 3 already I

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.560 
in five nights at Freddy's 3 already I
don't<00:06:15.280> know<00:06:15.370> what<00:06:15.580> do<00:06:15.640> you<00:06:15.700> guys<00:06:15.790> think<00:06:16.000> let<00:06:16.450> us
