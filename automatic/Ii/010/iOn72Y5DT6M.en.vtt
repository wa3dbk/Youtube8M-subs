so flip it over and start removing all
the<00:00:10.440> screws<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.040> case<00:00:11.250> oh<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.880> here's<00:00:12.030> a

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
the screws to the case oh and here's a

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.310 
the screws to the case oh and here's a
little<00:00:12.150> tip<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:12.990> bunch<00:00:13.200> of

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
little tip you can have a bunch of

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.410 
little tip you can have a bunch of
screws<00:00:13.590> left<00:00:13.860> over<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.340> just<00:00:14.610> use<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> magnet

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
screws left over so I just use a magnet

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.820 
screws left over so I just use a magnet
to<00:00:15.450> scoop<00:00:15.839> them<00:00:15.929> all<00:00:16.080> up<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.470> hold<00:00:16.650> them<00:00:16.770> in

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
to scoop them all up and hold them in

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.380 
to scoop them all up and hold them in
place<00:00:16.859> now<00:00:17.490> once<00:00:17.670> you've<00:00:17.789> got<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.090> open

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
place now once you've got that open

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.519 
place now once you've got that open
you're<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> look<00:00:19.020> for<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> small

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
you're going to look for the small

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.650 
you're going to look for the small
circuit<00:00:19.949> board<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.369> remove<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.000> two<00:00:21.210> screws

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
circuit board and remove the two screws

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.599 
circuit board and remove the two screws
so<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.109> can<00:00:22.260> access<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.800> other<00:00:22.830> side<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
so we can access the other side of it

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.519 
so we can access the other side of it
we're<00:00:24.180> going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> be<00:00:24.449> using<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> LED<00:00:24.990> that

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
we're going to be using the LED that

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.769 
we're going to be using the LED that
goes<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> scroll<00:00:26.490> lock<00:00:26.789> key<00:00:26.849> because

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
goes to the scroll lock key because

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.929 
goes to the scroll lock key because
that's<00:00:28.170> pretty<00:00:28.380> much<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.740> useless<00:00:29.070> key<00:00:29.460> now<00:00:29.760> if

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
that's pretty much a useless key now if

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.339 
that's pretty much a useless key now if
you<00:00:30.060> don't<00:00:30.179> have<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.779> could<00:00:30.900> also<00:00:31.050> use

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
you don't have one you could also use

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.830 
you don't have one you could also use
your<00:00:31.740> number<00:00:32.040> we're<00:00:32.940> going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.120> desolder<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
your number we're going to desolder the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.840 
your number we're going to desolder the
LED<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.530> goes<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> scroll<00:00:35.309> lock<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
LED that goes to the scroll lock and

LED that goes to the scroll lock and
remove<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> LED<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.230> hang<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.129> put<00:00:38.340> it

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
remove the LED and hang on to it put it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.560 
remove the LED and hang on to it put it
in<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:38.640> parts<00:00:38.790> bin<00:00:39.030> because<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
in your parts bin because it's a

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.900 
in your parts bin because it's a
perfectly<00:00:40.079> good<00:00:40.260> LED<00:00:40.829> now<00:00:41.489> you're<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:41.850> to
