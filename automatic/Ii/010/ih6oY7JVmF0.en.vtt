00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.200
 hello to all friends of jimbo network e 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.910
 welcome to this informative video 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.889
 concerning the recent flight of 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.199
 information on the new home console 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.910
 sony the playstation 4 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.890
 the document that seems to have revealed the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.080
 technical features present in 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.660
 then goddess kids and consoles for the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.460
 developers is a 90-page pdf 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.680
 received at kotaku 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.539
 and although the specifications may change 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.219
 even a lot from month to year is 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.500
 definitely interesting to give one 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.200
 peek at what it could contain 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 new generation console 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.129
 let's start immediately with an amd processor 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.440
 of the bulldozer series with a total of 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.059
 eight cores are in this case yes 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.739
 therefore differs from its c more 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.960
 owner who was the cell 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.340
 probably in order to favor the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.610
 development simplicity in particular 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.820
 for multi-platform projects 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.010
 then we pass to the gpu an amd r10 xx 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.770
 born from the same gnc technology 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.379
 present on the cards of the 7.900 series 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.689
 in this case a 2 GB video memory 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.830
 2 should be enough to support change 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.659
 generational 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.549
 unless the developers point 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.610
 use inactive resolutions e 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.170
 texture above 1080p 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.270
 the memory the system will attest 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.930
 instead on the good quantity of 8 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.180
 gigabyte 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.159
 however some rumors suggest that 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.979
 the latter can be halved 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.810
 in the final versions of the sony console 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.310
 once again he will focus on his flower 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.049
 buttonhole or blu ray 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.329
 therefore it does not seem that digital 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.680
 delivery will be at least at the beginning 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.960
 the main method for the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.509
 distribution of games on the hard disk 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.460
 mounted on desk kits of only 160 gig 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.040
 however, it should not scare the fans 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.840
 with a good degree of certainty to hdd 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.000
 that you will find yourself in your hands yes 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.490
 in fact they are around 300 or more 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.720
 gigabytes of storage space 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.770
 the outputs complete the work 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.810
 hdmi and optics 4 usb 3.0 and two ports 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.219
 ethernet one of which will be 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.290
 probably absent in the console 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.730
 marketed as it is reserved in 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.100
 these dev kits in the local network 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.630
 news also on the controller side that 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.460
 according to what reported by kotaku 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.230
 will have the same type of touchpad 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.630
 dorsal present in playstation vita 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.000
 clickable in the same way as the keys l 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.390
 trade r3 and with multitouch support 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.280
 share 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.110
 we will only see later how much he can 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.640
 actually be useful and comfortable 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.950
 during long gaming sessions 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.960
 one of the most discussed features 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.580
 leaked from the document is that which a 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.980
 apparently it will allow it to be 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.140
 connected simultaneously with a ph 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.030
 on the same console rumors 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.040
 suggest that connected a controller 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.510
 will be given the opportunity to log in with 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.480
 your account so that any 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.010
 progress trophies and anything else can 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.020
 be distributed to all users in 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.510
 I definitely play an interesting idea 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.580
 which, however, if not fully developed 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.170
 will risk falling into oblivion while remaining 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.690
 in used by most of the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.550
 player said this comes to wonder 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.320
 when it will be possible to see the new one 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.300
 console in action 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.280
 personally I guess it's microsoft 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.770
 that sony will point to a presentation 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.660
 during e3 of this year for later 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.330
 market their new products 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.790
 towards the beginning of 2014 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.620
 now it's your turn to let us know 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.260
 your opinions in this regard 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.540
 comments and as always do not forget 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.640
 to sign up to act as a network if still 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.770
 you didn't follow us on facebook 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.170
 twitter and why not leave me a lot 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.920
 like the video here it was all at digg ai 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.920
 to the next
