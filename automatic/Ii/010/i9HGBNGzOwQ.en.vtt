00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
Illustrated folding paper found in the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.460 
Illustrated folding paper found in the
back<00:00:17.179> of<00:00:17.329> the<00:00:17.390> book<00:00:17.539> so<00:00:18.230> let's<00:00:18.259> get<00:00:18.529> started

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
back of the book so let's get started

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.169 
back of the book so let's get started
the<00:00:21.470> first<00:00:21.710> step<00:00:21.919> is<00:00:22.339> to<00:00:22.490> fold<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.789> paper<00:00:22.970> in

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:23.179 
the first step is to fold the paper in

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:32.340 
the first step is to fold the paper in
half<00:00:23.619> corner<00:00:24.619> to<00:00:24.710> corner<00:00:24.939> in<00:00:25.939> both<00:00:26.449> directions

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:32.350 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.660 

you<00:00:33.350> want<00:00:33.500> to<00:00:33.590> make<00:00:33.680> sure<00:00:33.710> your<00:00:34.070> corners<00:00:34.460> line

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
you want to make sure your corners line

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.750 
you want to make sure your corners line
up<00:00:34.850> as<00:00:35.630> perfectly<00:00:36.050> as<00:00:36.170> possible<00:00:36.430> and<00:00:37.430> that<00:00:37.610> you

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
up as perfectly as possible and that you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.700 
up as perfectly as possible and that you
make<00:00:37.940> your<00:00:38.090> creases<00:00:38.650> nice<00:00:39.650> and<00:00:39.860> firm<00:00:44.620> do<00:00:45.620> you

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
make your creases nice and firm do you

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.950 
make your creases nice and firm do you
unfolded<00:00:46.310> then<00:00:46.670> we're<00:00:46.820> going<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:46.970> fold<00:00:47.240> the

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
unfolded then we're going to fold the

00:00:47.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
unfolded then we're going to fold the
left<00:00:48.470> top<00:00:49.430> and<00:00:49.700> right<00:00:50.240> corners<00:00:50.540> to<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:51.410> center

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.700 

next<00:01:04.030> we're<00:01:04.180> going<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.360> fold<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.750> left<00:01:05.409> and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
next we're going to fold the left and

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:17.440 
next we're going to fold the left and
right<00:01:05.890> corners<00:01:06.190> to<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.700> outer<00:01:06.850> edges

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.420 

once<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.170> corners<00:01:18.530> are<00:01:18.680> folded<00:01:19.040> we're<00:01:19.310> going

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
once the corners are folded we're going

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.219 
once the corners are folded we're going
to<00:01:19.490> unfold<00:01:19.700> everything<00:01:20.210> back<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.990> where<00:01:21.110> we

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
to unfold everything back to where we

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.420 
to unfold everything back to where we
started<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:23.270> next<00:01:23.360> step<00:01:23.600> is<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:23.750> little<00:01:23.960> tricky

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
started the next step is a little tricky

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.800 
started the next step is a little tricky
but<00:01:25.430> not<00:01:25.580> too<00:01:25.759> bad<00:01:25.909> we're<00:01:26.119> going<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.330> fold<00:01:26.570> a

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
but not too bad we're going to fold a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.929 
but not too bad we're going to fold a
diagonal<00:01:27.490> mark<00:01:28.490> fold<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:29.570> starts<00:01:29.990> at<00:01:30.530> this

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
diagonal mark fold that starts at this

the<00:03:18.550> bottom<00:03:18.700> edge<00:03:19.030> of<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.360> paper<00:03:22.620> okay<00:03:23.620> the

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
the bottom edge of the paper okay the

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.250 
the bottom edge of the paper okay the
next<00:03:24.670> step<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:25.300> probably<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.780> trickiest<00:03:25.900> of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
next step is probably the trickiest of

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.900 
next step is probably the trickiest of
the<00:03:26.350> model<00:03:27.840> we're<00:03:28.840> going<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.080> unlock<00:03:29.910> this

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
the model we're going to unlock this

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.680 
the model we're going to unlock this
area<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.780> paper<00:03:32.050> and<00:03:32.700> fold<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.790> behind<00:03:33.940> what

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
area of paper and fold it behind what

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.790 
area of paper and fold it behind what
will<00:03:34.810> become<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:36.310> head<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:37.330> bat<00:03:37.480> symbol

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.430 

like<00:03:41.800> so<00:03:42.570> once<00:03:43.570> you've<00:03:43.750> completed<00:03:44.050> it<00:03:44.200> on<00:03:44.290> that

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
like so once you've completed it on that

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.600 
like so once you've completed it on that
side<00:03:45.120> repeat<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.240> on<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.870> opposite<00:03:47.680> side<00:03:50.610> all

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
side repeat it on the opposite side all

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.920 
side repeat it on the opposite side all
right<00:03:54.510> next<00:03:55.510> we're<00:03:56.350> going<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.500> unfold<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:58.720> two

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
right next we're going to unfold the two

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.640 
right next we're going to unfold the two
points<00:03:59.680> in<00:03:59.800> the<00:03:59.890> center<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:01.080> then<00:04:02.080> we're

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
points in the center and then we're

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.390 
points in the center and then we're
going<00:04:02.740> to<00:04:02.800> fold<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.580> top<00:04:03.610> point<00:04:04.090> down<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:06.370> the

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
going to fold the top point down to the

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.840 
going to fold the top point down to the
hork

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
hork

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.440 
hork
horizontal<00:04:07.450> crease<00:04:07.660> just<00:04:07.930> below<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:09.450> the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
horizontal crease just below it and the

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.010 
horizontal crease just below it and the
second<00:04:10.840> point<00:04:11.020> down<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:13.450> its<00:04:13.600> horizontal

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
second point down to its horizontal

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.039 
second point down to its horizontal
crease

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.980 

next<00:04:20.049> we'll<00:04:20.440> fold<00:04:20.709> this<00:04:20.859> top<00:04:21.070> flap<00:04:21.310> down<00:04:21.990> and

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
next we'll fold this top flap down and

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.249 
next we'll fold this top flap down and
we'll<00:04:23.889> unfold<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.820> second<00:04:25.180> point<00:04:25.360> part<00:04:26.110> way

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
we'll unfold the second point part way

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:32.460 
we'll unfold the second point part way
and<00:04:26.560> pleat<00:04:27.490> fold<00:04:27.729> it<00:04:28.740> back<00:04:29.740> up<00:04:31.320> next<00:04:32.320> we're

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
and pleat fold it back up next we're

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.550 
and pleat fold it back up next we're
going<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.800> fold<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:34.330> tips<00:04:34.600> of<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.900> wings

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.390 

underneath<00:04:39.479> try<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.539> make<00:04:40.780> them<00:04:40.990> as<00:04:41.889> even<00:04:42.310> as

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
underneath try to make them as even as

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.230 
underneath try to make them as even as
possible<00:04:43.800> sometimes<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:44.949> helps<00:04:45.039> to<00:04:45.310> flip<00:04:45.490> the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
possible sometimes it helps to flip the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.790 
possible sometimes it helps to flip the
wing<00:04:46.389> over<00:04:48.060> our<00:04:49.060> final<00:04:49.449> step<00:04:49.630> is<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:49.870> shape<00:04:50.169> the

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
wing over our final step is to shape the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.129 
wing over our final step is to shape the
outside<00:04:51.160> edges<00:04:51.370> of<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.639> model<00:04:51.880> to<00:04:52.840> do<00:04:52.960> that

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
outside edges of the model to do that

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.249 
outside edges of the model to do that
we're<00:04:53.349> just<00:04:53.380> going<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.710> fold<00:04:53.919> the<00:04:54.070> corners

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
we're just going to fold the corners

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.540 
we're just going to fold the corners
behind<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:58.090> trick<00:04:58.330> to<00:04:58.449> this<00:04:58.570> step<00:04:58.870> is<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.830> try

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
behind the trick to this step is to try

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.820 
behind the trick to this step is to try
to<00:05:00.580> make<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.690> space<00:05:01.960> between<00:05:02.199> the<00:05:03.190> symbol<00:05:03.610> and

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
to make the space between the symbol and

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:21.020 
to make the space between the symbol and
the<00:05:05.830> edge<00:05:06.000> equal<00:05:07.000> on<00:05:07.150> all<00:05:07.270> four<00:05:07.539> sides

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.140 

and<00:05:22.030> finally<00:05:22.510> we<00:05:23.199> have<00:05:23.320> this<00:05:23.560> edge<00:05:23.740> left<00:05:24.150> we're

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
and finally we have this edge left we're

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:33.120 
and finally we have this edge left we're
just<00:05:25.300> going<00:05:25.479> to<00:05:25.540> fold<00:05:25.750> that<00:05:25.870> behind<00:05:31.919> and<00:05:32.919> there

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
just going to fold that behind and there

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.650 
just going to fold that behind and there
you<00:05:33.220> have<00:05:33.400> it<00:05:33.550> your<00:05:34.419> origami<00:05:34.960> bat<00:05:35.260> symbol<00:05:36.660> now

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
you have it your origami bat symbol now

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.120 
you have it your origami bat symbol now
