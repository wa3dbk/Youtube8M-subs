something<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:50.539> alright<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:53.539> don't<00:00:54.539> use

the zombie dragon zombie dragon is weak

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.479 
the zombie dragon zombie dragon is weak
against<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:57.690> lightning<00:00:58.050> or<00:00:58.410> electric<00:00:59.010> so

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
against I think lightning or electric so

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.000 
against I think lightning or electric so
that<00:00:59.640> means<00:00:59.910> but<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.870> think<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> biggest<00:01:01.680> thing

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that means but I think the biggest thing

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.210 
that means but I think the biggest thing
that<00:01:02.250> made<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.210> battle<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.260> ensure<00:01:04.979> this

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
that made this battle or ensure this

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.670 
that made this battle or ensure this
battle<00:01:05.580> was<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> win<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.320> luck

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
battle was going to win is that the luck

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.210 
battle was going to win is that the luck
of<00:01:07.920> being<00:01:08.330> first<00:01:09.470> being<00:01:10.470> first<00:01:10.860> we'll<00:01:11.100> give

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
of being first being first we'll give

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.039 
of being first being first we'll give
you<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> higher<00:01:11.549> chance<00:01:11.580> at<00:01:12.180> winning<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.810> I

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you a higher chance at winning so I

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.990 
you a higher chance at winning so I
don't<00:01:13.619> recommend<00:01:13.950> using<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.460> zombie<00:01:14.820> dragon

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
don't recommend using a zombie dragon

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.580 
don't recommend using a zombie dragon
because<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> zombie<00:01:15.840> dragon<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.320> weak

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
because the zombie dragon is weak

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.120 
because the zombie dragon is weak
against<00:01:17.390> electric<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.409> need<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.770> find<00:01:19.950> a

against electric so you need to find a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.670 
against electric so you need to find a
dragon<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.549> has<00:01:20.759> metal<00:01:21.299> attacks<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.500> is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
that is pretty much it i believe for

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.040 
that is pretty much it i believe for
metal<00:02:20.459> type<00:02:20.670> dragons<00:02:21.209> if<00:02:21.360> we<00:02:21.540> scroll<00:02:21.870> around

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
metal type dragons if we scroll around

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.199 
metal type dragons if we scroll around
and<00:02:22.470> see<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:22.590> we<00:02:22.800> have<00:02:22.950> any<00:02:23.100> more<00:02:23.310> metal<00:02:23.970> type

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
and see if we have any more metal type

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.080 
and see if we have any more metal type
dragons<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.740> is<00:02:25.980> strong<00:02:26.490> against<00:02:26.880> electric

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090

it has no weakness against electric you

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.080 
it has no weakness against electric you
want<00:02:46.380> might<00:02:46.709> want<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.070> try<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.580> if<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.910> have

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
want might want to try that if you have

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.760 
want might want to try that if you have
that<00:02:48.270> dragon<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.050> if<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.350> don't<00:02:49.500> have<00:02:49.620> the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
that dragon and if you don't have the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.890 
that dragon and if you don't have the
mercury<00:02:50.160> dragon<00:02:50.520> but<00:02:50.970> my<00:02:51.239> most<00:02:51.540> recommended

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
mercury dragon but my most recommended

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.470 
mercury dragon but my most recommended
combination<00:02:52.830> is<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.489> mercury<00:02:53.730> dragon

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
combination is the mercury dragon

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.830 
combination is the mercury dragon
because<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.470> seems<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.390> strong

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
because it seems that it is strong

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.030 
because it seems that it is strong
against<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:59.090> guess<00:03:00.230> electric<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.380> Terra<00:03:01.650> also

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
against I guess electric and Terra also

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.140 
against I guess electric and Terra also
the<00:03:02.160> battery<00:03:02.640> dragon<00:03:03.120> strong<00:03:03.750> against<00:03:04.110> terra

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
the battery dragon strong against terra

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.940 
the battery dragon strong against terra
