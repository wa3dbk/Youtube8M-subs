up dropping a 30 bomb which is a which
is<00:02:02.640> not<00:02:02.880> bad<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> couple<00:02:03.509> reasons<00:02:03.540> number

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
is not bad for a couple reasons number

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.630 
is not bad for a couple reasons number
one<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.770> exactly<00:02:05.340> easy<00:02:05.460> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
one it's just it's not exactly easy to

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.670 
one it's just it's not exactly easy to
get<00:02:05.820> 30<00:02:06.000> kills<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.360> TDM<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.380> number<00:02:07.560> two

even I can't remember if Kaos silencers
on<00:02:15.439> the<00:02:15.500> other<00:02:15.650> team<00:02:15.829> too<00:02:16.040> but<00:02:16.280> there<00:02:16.760> were

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
on the other team too but there were

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:17.860 
on the other team too but there were
some<00:02:17.000> there<00:02:17.299> were<00:02:17.359> some<00:02:17.510> stiff<00:02:17.689> competition

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
some there were some stiff competition

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.330 
some there were some stiff competition
going<00:02:18.469> on<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:20.530> then<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.680> second<00:02:22.010> reason<00:02:22.099> is

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
going on and then the second reason is

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.339 
going on and then the second reason is
this<00:02:22.609> is<00:02:22.790> my<00:02:22.909> favorite<00:02:23.269> map<00:02:23.420> in<00:02:23.629> the<00:02:23.659> dlc<00:02:24.140> I

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
this is my favorite map in the dlc I

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.440 
this is my favorite map in the dlc I
liked<00:02:24.859> all<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.099> them<00:02:25.189> core<00:02:25.609> was<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.239> wasn't

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
liked all of them core was it I wasn't

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.000 
liked all of them core was it I wasn't
the<00:02:26.629> biggest<00:02:26.719> fan<00:02:26.930> but<00:02:27.379> i<00:02:27.439> only<00:02:27.620> played<00:02:27.829> it<00:02:27.950> a

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
the biggest fan but i only played it a

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.800 
the biggest fan but i only played it a
few<00:02:28.040> times<00:02:28.189> and<00:02:28.549> I<00:02:28.640> didn't<00:02:28.909> really<00:02:29.120> do<00:02:29.389> well<00:02:29.599> on

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
few times and I didn't really do well on

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.660 
few times and I didn't really do well on
any<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.139> them<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:30.799> maybe<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.099> just<00:02:31.310> need<00:02:31.489> more

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
any of them so maybe I just need more

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.770 
any of them so maybe I just need more
time<00:02:31.730> with<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.239> but<00:02:33.139> sideshow<00:02:33.680> urban<00:02:34.189> and<00:02:34.780> and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
time with it but sideshow urban and and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.690 
time with it but sideshow urban and and
drift<00:02:36.200> like<00:02:36.349> urban<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:36.859> drip<00:02:37.069> for<00:02:37.219> both<00:02:37.430> like

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
drift like urban and drip for both like

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.509 
drift like urban and drip for both like
super<00:02:38.299> super<00:02:38.620> solid<00:02:39.620> maps<00:02:39.829> in<00:02:40.099> my<00:02:40.250> opinion

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
super super solid maps in my opinion

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.490 
super super solid maps in my opinion
they're<00:02:41.060> very<00:02:41.209> similar<00:02:41.510> maps<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.200> there<00:02:42.379> was

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
they're very similar maps to there was

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.920 
they're very similar maps to there was
like<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.620> central<00:02:43.099> area<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.819> it's<00:02:44.599> they're

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
like a central area and it's they're

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.259 
like a central area and it's they're
very<00:02:45.139> like<00:02:45.439> linear<00:02:45.829> maps<00:02:46.189> there's<00:02:46.609> not<00:02:46.790> too

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
very like linear maps there's not too

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.929 
very like linear maps there's not too
much<00:02:47.510> like<00:02:48.220> there's<00:02:49.220> not<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.430> not<00:02:49.819> too<00:02:49.909> many

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
much like there's not that not too many

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.610 
much like there's not that not too many
like<00:02:50.209> secret<00:02:50.629> passageways<00:02:51.169> or<00:02:51.319> anything<00:02:51.590> like

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
like secret passageways or anything like

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.190 
like secret passageways or anything like
that<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.129> all<00:02:52.760> these<00:02:53.120> maps<00:02:53.389> just<00:02:53.870> on<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:53.989> side

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
that and all these maps just on a side

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.159 
that and all these maps just on a side
note<00:02:54.260> here<00:02:54.470> we're<00:02:54.799> all<00:02:54.980> very<00:02:55.280> open<00:02:55.879> and<00:02:56.750> I

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
note here we're all very open and I

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.110 
note here we're all very open and I
found<00:02:57.379> that<00:02:57.620> like<00:02:57.799> any<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.579> guns<00:02:58.760> you

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
found that like any of the guns you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.909 
found that like any of the guns you
could<00:02:59.269> do<00:02:59.389> well<00:02:59.599> like<00:02:59.840> sniping<00:03:00.349> was<00:03:00.680> a<00:03:00.709> lot

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
could do well like sniping was a lot

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.069 
could do well like sniping was a lot
less<00:03:01.639> tricky<00:03:02.150> because<00:03:02.329> there<00:03:02.510> was<00:03:02.599> less<00:03:02.810> close

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
less tricky because there was less close

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.140 
less tricky because there was less close
quarters<00:03:03.530> assault<00:03:04.430> rifles<00:03:04.819> are<00:03:04.939> fine

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
quarters assault rifles are fine

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.240 
quarters assault rifles are fine
submachine<00:03:05.930> guns<00:03:06.109> are<00:03:06.230> fine<00:03:06.439> like<00:03:07.129> I<00:03:07.219> feel

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
submachine guns are fine like I feel

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.770 
submachine guns are fine like I feel
like<00:03:07.489> all<00:03:07.639> these<00:03:07.790> maps<00:03:08.030> were<00:03:08.269> pretty<00:03:08.540> well

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
like all these maps were pretty well

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.089 
like all these maps were pretty well
rounded<00:03:09.079> and<00:03:09.349> I<00:03:09.500> don't<00:03:09.680> know<00:03:09.739> if<00:03:09.859> that<00:03:09.980> was

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
rounded and I don't know if that was

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.740 
rounded and I don't know if that was
intentional<00:03:10.250> but<00:03:10.849> they<00:03:11.150> all<00:03:11.299> just<00:03:11.480> kind<00:03:11.689> of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
intentional but they all just kind of

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.099 
intentional but they all just kind of
work<00:03:12.049> for<00:03:12.950> pretty<00:03:13.310> much<00:03:13.370> any<00:03:13.849> class<00:03:14.780> that<00:03:14.810> you

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
work for pretty much any class that you

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.289 
work for pretty much any class that you
want<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.349> use<00:03:15.409> apart<00:03:16.310> from<00:03:16.459> maybe<00:03:16.669> shotguns

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
tell you why sometimes these things are

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.429 
tell you why sometimes these things are
just<00:03:39.470> sort<00:03:39.709> of<00:03:39.769> intangible<00:03:40.870> but<00:03:41.870> all<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.229> maps

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 
just sort of intangible but all the maps

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.409 
just sort of intangible but all the maps
were<00:03:42.590> pretty<00:03:43.099> good<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.549> like<00:03:43.819> for<00:03:44.150> all<00:03:44.269> the

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
were pretty good and like for all the

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.439 
were pretty good and like for all the
ghosts<00:03:45.379> faults<00:03:46.370> i<00:03:46.579> thought<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.180> dlc

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
ghosts faults i thought that dlc

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.199 
ghosts faults i thought that dlc
packages<00:03:48.349> like<00:03:48.650> all<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:49.009> maps<00:03:49.189> were<00:03:49.430> really

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
packages like all the maps were really

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.479 
packages like all the maps were really
good<00:03:50.359> night<00:03:50.569> if<00:03:51.229> the<00:03:51.530> game<00:03:51.949> had<00:03:51.979> launched

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
good night if the game had launched

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:53.710 
good night if the game had launched
those<00:03:52.729> maps<00:03:52.970> i<00:03:53.150> think<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:53.389> would<00:03:53.479> have<00:03:53.569> been<00:03:53.629> a

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
those maps i think it would have been a

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.629 
those maps i think it would have been a
different<00:03:53.840> story<00:03:54.169> all<00:03:54.349> together<00:03:54.639> and

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
different story all together and

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.490 
different story all together and
hopefully<00:03:55.909> aw<00:03:56.870> is<00:03:56.930> going<00:03:57.049> to<00:03:57.109> go<00:03:57.229> down<00:03:57.259> the

hopefully aw is going to go down the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.339 
hopefully aw is going to go down the
same<00:03:57.680> road<00:03:58.599> thankfully<00:03:59.599> they<00:03:59.900> started<00:04:00.290> off
