00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.470
 ah 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.090
 this time we are globetrotters 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.840
 in the mayan riviera and we come to enjoy 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.780
 the fis ethnic group 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.600
 something very good was waiting for us because 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:34.210
 behind this place is a very chef 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.750
 talented and fun sure know him 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:43.360
 you know who I mean good and 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.360
 very dear friend achilles 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.920
 you lie 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.219
 we set out to enjoy these flavors 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.850
 of sea with tabasqueÃ±os touches and until 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.519
 assign it the letter that simulates a 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.730
 newspaper gave us to select the 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:09.330
 store and while it arrived 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:12.060
 a good Mexican wine santo tomÃ¡s 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.720
 our feast started with a 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.590
 saucer of chef's inspiration here 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.340
 you call them combining two classics a 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.490
 ceviche and clamato tell us the chef 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.620
 very in charge of the place here the idea 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.980
 is that instead of coming to heal 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.480
 the raw with more alcohol the better 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.480
 with good food 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.179
 We continue with a drowned seafood that 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.200
 it's a mixed chilean shrimp water 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:49.020
 fish and octopus with puritito style 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.670
 sinaloa that also takes as a touch 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.420
 additional a sauce of the huichol is 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.420
 ambient 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.550
 and I will apologize to walk them 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.100
 talking about these intimacies but I had 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.950
 I went to the bathroom and of course they gave me 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.080
 I want to share this because little by little 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.530
 it does not seem like I'm under a 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.130
 Pool and even his stairway has to 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.000
 leave it 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.720
 followed a trio of toast that included 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.440
 the traditional tuna one of salpicÃ³n 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.040
 of beef and octopus in love that we 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.410
 count this recipe came out a 14 of 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.780
 February and well then we put ourselves 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.780
 romantic and enjoy it 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.900
 finally came the main course 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.910
 fishing of the day with yucca with garlic sauce 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.090

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:53.599
 delicious capers 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.170
 we were preparing for the end and here the 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.930
 chef moses kings shared a great 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.530
 sentence and that we should take as 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.860
 philosophy life is so uncertain that it 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.410
 must start with the dessert and well no 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.739
 we could do it this time but what 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.980
 we will consider for the future here 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.280
 he presented us three delicious desserts that 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.920
 one of them included chocolate 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.739
 Tabasco in a cake and also the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:30.670
 cake three milks with a sorbet 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.670
 strawberries really very good 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.560
 and it was time to say goodbye 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:42.950

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.950
