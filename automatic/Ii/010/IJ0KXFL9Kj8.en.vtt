amplifier has all the features of the

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.840 
amplifier has all the features of the
old<00:00:34.930> amplifier<00:00:35.590> except<00:00:36.040> it's<00:00:36.670> a<00:00:36.730> little

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
old amplifier except it's a little

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.030 
old amplifier except it's a little
smaller<00:00:37.270> it's<00:00:37.719> a<00:00:37.870> little<00:00:38.079> lighter<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:38.590> it's

package that's what we were shooting for
with<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.690> jazz<00:00:58.899> can<00:00:59.200> amplifier<00:00:59.680> you<00:00:59.890> can

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
with the jazz can amplifier you can

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.430 
with the jazz can amplifier you can
carry<00:01:00.399> around<00:01:00.520> town<00:01:01.000> and<00:01:01.270> get<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:01.989> great<00:01:02.230> sound
