and modern anyway that court needs to be
reprinted<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.720> called<00:01:49.189> visions<00:01:50.189> of

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
reprinted I think it's called visions of

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.200 
reprinted I think it's called visions of
something<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.770> draw<00:01:53.130> cards<00:01:53.640> fried<00:01:53.939> too

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
something and it's draw cards fried too

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.260 
something and it's draw cards fried too
it's<00:01:54.720> very<00:01:54.869> good<00:01:55.140> card<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.850> cards<00:01:57.180> like

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it's very good card but that cards like

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.530 
it's very good card but that cards like
five<00:01:57.540> bucks<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.469> comment<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.579> maybe

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
five bucks for a comment so I maybe

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.899 
five bucks for a comment so I maybe
expect<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> few<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.829> those<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.219> cunning

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
expect to see a few of those and cunning

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.550 
expect to see a few of those and cunning
so<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> believe<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:03.990> going<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.259> be<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> great

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
so I believe it's going to be a great

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.479 
so I believe it's going to be a great
value<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.520> because<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.030> mono<00:02:06.210> blue
