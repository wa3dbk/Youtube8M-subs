really<00:00:35.920> make<00:00:36.129> sense<00:00:36.420> without<00:00:37.420> mastering<00:00:37.960> the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
really make sense without mastering the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.600 
really make sense without mastering the
basics<00:00:38.140> and<00:00:38.620> i<00:00:38.739> think<00:00:38.980> what<00:00:39.219> you're<00:00:39.370> saying

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
basics and i think what you're saying

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.150 
basics and i think what you're saying
josh<00:00:39.879> that<00:00:40.059> bill<00:00:40.270> evans<00:00:40.450> is<00:00:40.719> right<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.440> what

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
josh that bill evans is right and what

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.889 
josh that bill evans is right and what
you've<00:00:42.340> been<00:00:42.550> doing<00:00:42.910> is<00:00:43.120> kind<00:00:43.480> of<00:00:43.690> right

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
you've been doing is kind of right

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.840 
you've been doing is kind of right
basically<00:00:44.320> what<00:00:44.530> you're<00:00:44.680> saying<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:45.129> you're

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
basically what you're saying is you're

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.069 
basically what you're saying is you're
trying<00:00:46.090> to<00:00:46.360> find<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:47.079> notes<00:00:47.350> 1<00:00:47.710> 3<00:00:47.980> 5<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.399> 7<00:00:49.079> for

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
trying to find the notes 1 3 5 and 7 for

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.900 
trying to find the notes 1 3 5 and 7 for
every<00:00:50.620> chord<00:00:50.890> at<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.219> tune<00:00:51.399> all<00:00:51.579> the<00:00:51.730> things

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
every chord at the tune all the things

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.420 
every chord at the tune all the things
you<00:00:52.030> are<00:00:52.059> for<00:00:52.449> instance<00:00:52.750> and<00:00:53.620> although<00:00:54.250> this

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
you are for instance and although this

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.869 
you are for instance and although this
relationship<00:00:55.059> is<00:00:55.180> strong<00:00:55.449> in<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:56.879> analysis

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
relationship is strong in the analysis

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.869 
relationship is strong in the analysis
like<00:00:58.149> the<00:00:58.329> brain<00:00:59.609> gymnastics<00:01:00.609> that<00:01:00.730> you're

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
like the brain gymnastics that you're

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.509 
like the brain gymnastics that you're
going<00:01:01.149> through<00:01:01.359> is<00:01:01.510> a<00:01:01.539> good<00:01:01.899> idea<00:01:02.440> I<00:01:02.679> think<00:01:03.340> you

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
going through is a good idea I think you

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.090 
going through is a good idea I think you
may<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.600> may<00:01:04.629> as<00:01:04.870> well<00:01:04.900> use<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.410> same<00:01:05.650> method

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
may you may as well use the same method

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.999 
may you may as well use the same method
you're<00:01:06.250> using<00:01:06.310> now<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:07.119> wind<00:01:07.750> up<00:01:07.930> playing<00:01:08.799> a

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
you're using now and wind up playing a

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.310 
you're using now and wind up playing a
bunch<00:01:09.159> of<00:01:09.340> stuff<00:01:09.580> anyways<00:01:10.090> because<00:01:10.659> I<00:01:10.990> believe

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
bunch of stuff anyways because I believe

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.530 
bunch of stuff anyways because I believe
what<00:01:11.500> you're<00:01:11.650> missing<00:01:12.100> in<00:01:12.310> your<00:01:12.670> approach<00:01:13.119> is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
what you're missing in your approach is

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.590 
what you're missing in your approach is
a<00:01:14.020> way<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.380> tell<00:01:14.740> what<00:01:15.280> happens<00:01:15.729> with<00:01:16.360> those

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
a way to tell what happens with those

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.920 
a way to tell what happens with those
notes<00:01:16.930> because<00:01:17.530> there<00:01:17.740> are<00:01:17.860> not<00:01:18.040> alone<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.939> as

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
notes because there are not alone and as

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.170 
notes because there are not alone and as
in<00:01:20.500> if<00:01:20.829> you<00:01:20.979> play<00:01:21.189> just<00:01:21.460> stirred<00:01:21.640> at<00:01:21.820> seven

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
in if you play just stirred at seven

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.390 
in if you play just stirred at seven
sand<00:01:22.570> fist<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.590> rules<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.070> stuff<00:01:24.159> like<00:01:24.340> that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
sand fist and rules and stuff like that

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.130 
sand fist and rules and stuff like that
you<00:01:25.030> won't<00:01:25.180> necessarily<00:01:25.360> get<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.930> big

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
you won't necessarily get the big

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.109 
you won't necessarily get the big
melodic<00:01:26.650> picture<00:01:27.070> of<00:01:27.280> what<00:01:27.549> you're<00:01:27.700> trying<00:01:27.970> to

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
melodic picture of what you're trying to

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.780 
melodic picture of what you're trying to
say<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:30.460> hard<00:01:30.579> to<00:01:31.350> split<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:33.100> foundation

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
say so it's hard to split the foundation

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.760 
say so it's hard to split the foundation
from<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.240> ornaments<00:01:34.899> that<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.320> around<00:01:35.649> the

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
from the ornaments that is around the

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.560 
from the ornaments that is around the
foundation<00:01:36.250> because<00:01:36.399> your<00:01:37.090> animals<00:01:37.420> are

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
foundation because your animals are

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.810 
foundation because your animals are
really<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.869> big<00:01:38.079> part<00:01:38.110> of<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.500> vocabulary<00:01:38.890> so

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
really a big part of the vocabulary so

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.810 
really a big part of the vocabulary so
here's<00:01:40.030> my<00:01:40.180> thing<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:41.770> it's<00:01:42.040> not<00:01:42.250> connecting

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
here's my thing if it's not connecting

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.600 
here's my thing if it's not connecting
to<00:01:43.090> hearing<00:01:43.720> what's<00:01:44.380> happening<00:01:44.860> I<00:01:45.040> mean<00:01:45.460> what

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
to hearing what's happening I mean what

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.950 
to hearing what's happening I mean what
you're<00:01:45.759> describing<00:01:46.030> your<00:01:46.329> question<00:01:46.659> is<00:01:46.780> your

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
you're describing your question is your

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.789 
yeah don't on the guitar and you just
think<00:01:49.329> of<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.540> position<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.229> in<00:01:50.770> that

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
think of the position and in that

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.130 
think of the position and in that
position<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.729> see<00:01:51.939> a<00:01:51.969> flat<00:01:52.360> G<00:01:52.540> flat<00:01:52.570> okay<00:01:52.990> this

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
position you see a flat G flat okay this

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.780 
position you see a flat G flat okay this
is<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.439> third<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.860> score<00:01:53.979> this<00:01:54.340> is<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.579> fifth

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
is the third the score this is the fifth

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.020 
is the third the score this is the fifth
although<00:01:55.450> this<00:01:55.600> is<00:01:55.780> good<00:01:56.020> for<00:01:56.259> your<00:01:56.350> brains<00:01:56.649> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
although this is good for your brains it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.789 
although this is good for your brains it
won't<00:01:58.030> necessarily<00:01:58.390> give<00:01:59.049> you<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> results

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
won't necessarily give you the results

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.980 
won't necessarily give you the results
that<00:01:59.829> you're<00:02:00.039> looking<00:02:00.280> for<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:01.090> what<00:02:01.930> I

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
that you're looking for and what I

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.709 
that you're looking for and what I
meaning<00:02:02.439> there<00:02:02.649> is<00:02:02.860> what<00:02:03.729> does<00:02:03.969> it<00:02:04.149> mean<00:02:04.450> to

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
meaning there is what does it mean to

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.889 
meaning there is what does it mean to
play<00:02:04.930> on<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.439> fifth<00:02:05.969> degree<00:02:06.969> of<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.689> third

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
play on the fifth degree of the third

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.690 
play on the fifth degree of the third
quarter<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.410> tune<00:02:08.590> how<00:02:08.950> does<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.399> sound

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
quarter of the tune how does it sound

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.950 
quarter of the tune how does it sound
and<00:02:10.680> what<00:02:11.680> are<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.550> melodic<00:02:13.150> implication

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
and what are the melodic implication

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.410 
and what are the melodic implication
does<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.380> not<00:02:14.620> want<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.040> stay<00:02:15.550> right<00:02:15.730> there

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
does this not want to stay right there

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.660 
does this not want to stay right there
or<00:02:16.510> does<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:16.930> doesn't<00:02:17.740> have<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.890> melodic<00:02:18.490> and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
or does it doesn't have a melodic and

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.070 
or does it doesn't have a melodic and

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
are you have to play around with the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.830 
are you have to play around with the
melody<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.730> melody<00:02:55.090> are<00:02:55.209> all<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.600> Third's

melody the melody are all the Third's

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:28.050 
melody the melody are all the Third's
right<00:02:56.110> so<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:26.380> if<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:26.530> cannot<00:03:26.799> play<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.700> what

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
right so so if you cannot play and what

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.729 
right so so if you cannot play and what
I<00:03:28.120> was<00:03:28.329> trying<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.600> do<00:03:28.780> here<00:03:29.049> is<00:03:29.079> just<00:03:29.200> play<00:03:29.620> all

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
I was trying to do here is just play all

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.979 
I was trying to do here is just play all
the<00:03:29.829> thirds<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:30.310> add<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:30.940> melody<00:03:31.450> around<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:31.930> if

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
the thirds and add a melody around so if

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.470 
the thirds and add a melody around so if
you<00:03:32.140> cannot<00:03:32.350> just<00:03:32.590> use<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.070> thirds<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.700> make

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
you cannot just use the thirds and make

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.569 
you cannot just use the thirds and make
sense<00:03:34.810> out<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.049> it<00:03:35.230> within<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.920> key<00:03:36.280> setter

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
sense out of it within the key setter

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.060 
sense out of it within the key setter
now<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.840> need<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.109> blow<00:03:38.320> just<00:03:38.590> in<00:03:38.709> a<00:03:38.799> flat

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
now that you need to blow just in a flat

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.310 
now that you need to blow just in a flat
and<00:03:39.310> then<00:03:39.370> move<00:03:39.700> keys<00:03:40.030> or<00:03:40.239> whatever<00:03:40.510> but<00:03:41.109> if

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
and then move keys or whatever but if

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.289 
and then move keys or whatever but if
you<00:03:41.530> cannot<00:03:41.739> make<00:03:41.799> sense<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.310> this<00:03:42.489> melody<00:03:43.030> and

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
you cannot make sense of this melody and

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.930 
you cannot make sense of this melody and
how<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.660> relates<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:44.230> what<00:03:45.070> you<00:03:45.220> feel<00:03:45.519> about<00:03:45.670> it

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
and there's no way that visualizing the

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.270 
and there's no way that visualizing the
front<00:03:50.170> board<00:03:50.350> in<00:03:50.440> your<00:03:50.560> mind<00:03:50.769> will<00:03:50.950> help<00:03:51.130> you

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
front board in your mind will help you

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.920 
front board in your mind will help you
make<00:03:51.430> better<00:03:51.459> music<00:03:51.880> out<00:03:52.180> of<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.390> that's<00:03:52.780> my

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
play I'll try to play using the ninth of

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:07.300 
play I'll try to play using the ninth of
of<00:04:00.100> F<00:04:00.700> minor<00:04:00.970> 7

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.050 

okay<00:04:08.270> so<00:04:08.330> what<00:04:08.569> I'm<00:04:08.690> thinking<00:04:09.140> here's<00:04:11.380> I

cannot expect this to come from a

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.879 
cannot expect this to come from a
digital<00:04:45.979> standpoint<00:04:46.669> that<00:04:47.120> that<00:04:47.840> is<00:04:48.050> my<00:04:48.260> big

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
digital standpoint that that is my big

what<00:04:57.169> I'm<00:04:57.290> trying<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:57.680> do<00:04:57.860> here<00:04:58.150> inefficient

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
what I'm trying to do here inefficient

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.060 
what I'm trying to do here inefficient
but<00:04:59.660> I<00:04:59.720> don't<00:05:00.020> think<00:05:00.110> it's<00:05:00.320> inefficient<00:05:00.830> I

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
but I don't think it's inefficient I

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.000 
but I don't think it's inefficient I
think<00:05:01.280> it's<00:05:01.400> part<00:05:01.729> of<00:05:02.050> anybody's<00:05:03.050> learning
