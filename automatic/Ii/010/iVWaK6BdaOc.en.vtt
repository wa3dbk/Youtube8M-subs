00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
think that that's beginning to change I

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.639 
think that that's beginning to change I
think<00:01:13.609> the<00:01:13.880> population<00:01:14.060> is<00:01:14.960> getting<00:01:15.200> older

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.289 
think the population is getting older
and<00:01:15.770> they're<00:01:16.429> beginning<00:01:16.579> to<00:01:16.939> think<00:01:17.149> about

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
and they're beginning to think about

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.959 
and they're beginning to think about
these<00:01:18.079> things<00:01:18.139> and<00:01:19.450> what<00:01:20.450> I'm<00:01:20.600> seeing<00:01:21.020> is
