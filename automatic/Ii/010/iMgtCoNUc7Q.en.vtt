there's still a lot of cool motherboards

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.850 
there's still a lot of cool motherboards
here<00:00:26.000> -<00:00:26.210> again<00:00:26.780> we've<00:00:26.990> gone<00:00:27.170> with<00:00:27.410> that<00:00:27.440> black

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
here - again we've gone with that black

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.640 
here - again we've gone with that black
and<00:00:28.070> red<00:00:28.190> color<00:00:28.400> scheme<00:00:28.670> that<00:00:28.700> everyone<00:00:29.270> loves

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
and red color scheme that everyone loves

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.019 
and red color scheme that everyone loves
we've<00:00:30.650> added<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:31.039> little<00:00:31.190> splash<00:00:31.550> of<00:00:31.700> white

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
we've added a little splash of white

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.760 
we've added a little splash of white
just<00:00:32.329> to<00:00:32.480> make<00:00:32.599> that<00:00:32.780> red<00:00:32.989> stand<00:00:33.320> out<00:00:33.530> it's<00:00:33.710> a

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
just to make that red stand out it's a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.500 
just to make that red stand out it's a
more<00:00:33.950> aggressive<00:00:34.190> look<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:34.760> we<00:00:35.270> feel<00:00:35.480> that

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
more aggressive look and we feel that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.750 
more aggressive look and we feel that
users<00:00:36.199> and<00:00:36.440> gamers<00:00:36.860> actually<00:00:37.070> like<00:00:37.520> that

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
users and gamers actually like that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.030 
users and gamers actually like that
feeling<00:00:38.060> with<00:00:38.900> out<00:00:39.140> of<00:00:39.260> lights<00:00:39.530> that<00:00:39.770> we'll<00:00:39.920> be

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
feeling with out of lights that we'll be

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.590 
feeling with out of lights that we'll be
having<00:00:40.190> on<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:40.520> board<00:00:40.730> as<00:00:40.820> well<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.390> remember

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
having on the board as well and remember

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.319 
having on the board as well and remember
this<00:00:41.900> is<00:00:42.050> a<00:00:42.140> socket<00:00:42.380> 1151<00:00:43.280> board<00:00:43.610> which<00:00:44.060> means

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
this is a socket 1151 board which means

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:45.340 
this is a socket 1151 board which means
that<00:00:44.570> you<00:00:44.690> need<00:00:44.810> to<00:00:44.899> have<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.110> correct

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
that you need to have the correct

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.990 
that you need to have the correct
processor<00:00:45.950> for<00:00:46.160> it<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.460> you'll<00:00:46.640> need<00:00:46.790> the

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
processor for it and you'll need the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.479 
processor for it and you'll need the
Intel<00:00:47.329> 6<00:00:47.630> gen<00:00:47.899> processor<00:00:48.410> not<00:00:48.950> only<00:00:49.160> with<00:00:49.280> that

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
Intel 6 gen processor not only with that

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.190 
Intel 6 gen processor not only with that
new<00:00:49.910> technology<00:00:50.450> there<00:00:50.630> we<00:00:50.809> are<00:00:50.960> actually

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
new technology there we are actually

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.880 
new technology there we are actually
bringing<00:00:51.620> ddr4<00:00:52.399> over<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.930> z170<00:00:54.590> ex-gay

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
bringing ddr4 over to the z170 ex-gay

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.979 
bringing ddr4 over to the z170 ex-gay
mning<00:00:55.070> g1<00:00:55.460> here<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:55.910> make<00:00:56.719> sure<00:00:56.750> you're

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
mning g1 here so make sure you're

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.470 
mning g1 here so make sure you're
getting<00:00:57.020> the<00:00:57.320> right<00:00:57.350> DDR<00:00:57.860> as<00:00:58.040> well<00:00:58.399> aside<00:00:59.329> from

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
getting the right DDR as well aside from

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.790 
getting the right DDR as well aside from
that<00:00:59.540> you<00:00:59.780> can<00:00:59.870> actually<00:01:00.170> see<00:01:00.350> on<00:01:00.440> that<00:01:00.559> white

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
that you can actually see on that white

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.290 
that you can actually see on that white
casing<00:01:01.190> we<00:01:01.309> were<00:01:01.399> talking<00:01:01.790> about<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:02.030> little

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
casing we were talking about a little

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.359 
casing we were talking about a little
bit<00:01:02.450> earlier<00:01:02.809> it<00:01:02.989> has<00:01:03.260> threaded<00:01:03.739> Barb's<00:01:04.159> for

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
bit earlier it has threaded Barb's for

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:05.709 
bit earlier it has threaded Barb's for
water<00:01:04.549> cooling<00:01:04.879> so<00:01:05.329> if<00:01:05.390> you<00:01:05.509> guys<00:01:05.659> are

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:05.719 
water cooling so if you guys are

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.450 
water cooling so if you guys are
enthusiast<00:01:06.409> I'd<00:01:06.560> like<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:06.829> customize<00:01:07.040> your

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
enthusiast I'd like to customize your

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.889 
enthusiast I'd like to customize your
system<00:01:07.880> you<00:01:07.969> guys<00:01:08.119> want<00:01:08.329> to<00:01:08.420> do<00:01:08.509> something<00:01:08.840> a

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
system you guys want to do something a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.300 
system you guys want to do something a
little<00:01:08.930> bit<00:01:09.289> different<00:01:10.009> from<00:01:10.159> your

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
little bit different from your

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.340 
little bit different from your
closed-loop<00:01:10.700> setups<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:11.689> can<00:01:11.840> actually<00:01:12.139> use

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
closed-loop setups you can actually use

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.529 
closed-loop setups you can actually use
these<00:01:12.590> and<00:01:12.920> buy<00:01:13.069> the<00:01:13.130> threaded<00:01:13.639> Barb's<00:01:13.969> and<00:01:14.149> do

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:14.539 
these and buy the threaded Barb's and do

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:15.699 
these and buy the threaded Barb's and do
your<00:01:14.659> liquid<00:01:14.929> cooling<00:01:15.139> setup<00:01:15.409> through<00:01:15.560> that

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:15.709 
your liquid cooling setup through that

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:19.120 
your liquid cooling setup through that
so<00:01:16.609> I've<00:01:17.179> noticed<00:01:17.450> some<00:01:17.899> casing<00:01:18.619> over<00:01:18.920> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
so I've noticed some casing over the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.330 
so I've noticed some casing over the
PCIe<00:01:19.969> slots<00:01:20.389> yes<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.319> definitely<00:01:21.829> moving<00:01:22.130> down

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
PCIe slots yes so definitely moving down

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.709 
PCIe slots yes so definitely moving down
one<00:01:22.609> of<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.819> other<00:01:22.939> features<00:01:23.209> that<00:01:23.450> we've

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
one of the other features that we've

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.510 
one of the other features that we've
added<00:01:23.959> to<00:01:24.139> this<00:01:24.350> board<00:01:24.619> is<00:01:24.770> actually<00:01:25.219> this

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
added to this board is actually this

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.789 
added to this board is actually this
metal<00:01:25.909> casing<00:01:26.329> right<00:01:26.479> here<00:01:26.779> now<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.229> see<00:01:27.649> the

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
metal casing right here now you see the

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.349 
metal casing right here now you see the
red<00:01:27.979> underneath<00:01:28.340> that's<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.909> color<00:01:29.149> of<00:01:29.209> the

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
red underneath that's the color of the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.230 
red underneath that's the color of the
PCI<00:01:29.719> slot<00:01:30.079> that<00:01:30.499> metal<00:01:30.950> shielding<00:01:31.520> actually

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
PCI slot that metal shielding actually

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.239 
PCI slot that metal shielding actually
helps<00:01:32.689> support<00:01:33.289> your<00:01:33.409> graphics<00:01:33.829> cards<00:01:34.099> when

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.249 
helps support your graphics cards when

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:35.859 
helps support your graphics cards when
it's<00:01:34.369> slotted<00:01:34.789> into<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.060> board<00:01:35.329> it<00:01:35.479> prevents

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
it's slotted into the board it prevents

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.839 
it's slotted into the board it prevents
heavy<00:01:36.079> cards<00:01:36.499> from<00:01:36.619> falling<00:01:37.069> or<00:01:37.399> ripping<00:01:37.759> out

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
heavy cards from falling or ripping out

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:39.760 
heavy cards from falling or ripping out
that<00:01:38.029> PCI<00:01:38.450> slot<00:01:38.719> and<00:01:38.899> at<00:01:38.959> the<00:01:39.079> same<00:01:39.319> time<00:01:39.619> it

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
that PCI slot and at the same time it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.370 
that PCI slot and at the same time it
also<00:01:39.979> helps<00:01:40.490> with<00:01:40.639> any<00:01:41.090> EMI<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:41.840> might<00:01:42.139> come

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
also helps with any EMI that might come

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.989 
also helps with any EMI that might come
from<00:01:42.499> using<00:01:42.829> different<00:01:43.279> accessories<00:01:43.849> or
