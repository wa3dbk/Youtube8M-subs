00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.009
 and sport 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.839
 that has the decision Back to the Roots show what we can show XII 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:14.299
 and on Facebook 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.380
 that has spoken alongside Fonda grant Clermont and Bacteria fashion magazines 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.699
 to look at leaves is now itself 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.669
 in the first place but also very clearly Sporting is also best says choice 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.970
 For example, the number of beds would be explained 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.339
 that now has a club of something is not allowed to happen 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.480
 why then anyway 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.550
 around this path 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.690
 is open and the more and above all the cooperation with the superstars 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.790
 from the sports world 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.210
 "First of all, I have to say that with the issues whether the money is almost just the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.429
 Tore Bergheim is 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:46.320
 Punch offensively to the outside 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.819
 but that in France form of treasures 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.050
 because nowhere like that 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.180
 big treasures »family to 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.370
 and do what I give out to the outside everything fully occupied 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.260
 they support us 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.870
 stressed for fun 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.700
 to the sport 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.700
 as we said we will eventually 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.570
 ponders what are really the courage of the company adapts to the nw 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.610
 of the company and the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.920
 Ben Ali from the skidoo reaching many over the years 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.260
 just forget 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.130
 and that also has the collaboration with up to pasta sauces sports 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.030
 one of them is the Lindsey Vonn 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.270
 but the Lindsey Vonn around with the new cooperation nine new ones 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.720
 Enter into cooperation and which place knows what to say 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.800
 and then by bike the biggest formula 1 driver ever 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.890
 Seven times world champion and I have to say 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.710
 not a top athlete but a very fine person 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.130
 in fact and if this cooperation the club then passes with painters 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.730
 us basin the sevenfold world champion 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.730
 Michael Schumacher has a very good morning 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.750
 Erika Brunken Hammer as currently 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.940
 so nice 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.590
 Of course, we gladly give Michael Reuter not been submitted yet 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.170
 that's a class bizarre explanation why they are here today 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.760
 It can not be that I do it for Sebastian what actually 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.669
 yesterday should have happened 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:17.149
 and what did they come this way his last information 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:21.499
 The slalom in Zwiesel was continued but also this morning 9 o'clock 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.709
 from nine o'clock to ten from ten to twelve and from 11 to 12 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:29.449
 we assume that our North will take place but I believe so 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:30.819
 certain constraints 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.169
 but around the lake can not come to us at the fair 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.009
 and then the race will take place at the same time but subsidiary company all 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.190
 Understanding yes, too bad but he has Michael Schumacher continues here 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.869
 For a year now the cooperation is now running third 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:48.199
 Six something all told us about this time saying this 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:49.930
 It was a very interesting time 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.709
 Boyle «We are victims 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.709
 just got together with Zattoo com Unit 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:56.709
 Percent his partners 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.879
 in front of a picture in the box of the bull quivering earth itself and other departure 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:01.789
 develop 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.339
 between Geneva and percent 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:07.339
 Zurich on the way and were stopped more who has the most important 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:09.129
 Task the collection is spoken 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.930
 So that was very harmonious, of course, also discussed the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.010
 one or the other thing but very goal oriented and will that 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.219
 US companies wear and you see at the start is in the morning too pretend that 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.840
 Also interesting the collection discussed and discussed it is not 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.859
 simply that the name Michael Schumacher on it skin but they are 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.499
 hopefully actively involved 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.289
 it was from both sides 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:33.669
 Renault building the outer building is also very important to me 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.859
 Of course, I have practiced this before in the past 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.909
 but I also want to leave office behind and be honest 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.589
 Thing stand the products 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.619
 that's what the offender does with his team who is really fed up with valuables 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:46.969
 develop together 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:48.729
 and I want to go well 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.470
 EuroMold I believe that I stand for these character traits 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.539
 and of course I want to go again 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.389
 it is called so how does this also from Taiwan the 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.789
 Characteristics about Michael Schumacher also with collection 

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:02.719
 transmits particularly thick steadily 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.509
 especially fast 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.959
 «This is all unreal life in technical nature 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:08.849
 because I mean 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.839
 the moderately Brummer reduced itself for it stands z the jet set 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.579
 the package is out 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:15.560
 also the cities 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.609
 but of course technology and development 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.900
 the violence responds there it does not matter who asked it far in butt and percent 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.580
 of course my experience what the train has to go on 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.479
 now the left can not be here today because she is also in Kiev 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.520
 the next days skiers still mountain starts the ski-wm in Garmisch 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.470
 is it all together 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.039
 as a ice dance 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.830
 This time then one has to prepare for a new one and become one 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.699
 maybe even to a sporting highlight offers to sit down and 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.699
 Again from the television look at that 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.759
 this is just enough for the current time almost prescribed 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.469
 Keep Prosper fit 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:58.949
 Preparing in winter is a bit more difficult that means 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.559
 that at a gym 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:04.939
 now has tv-view is so far there is the possibility 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:08.929
 As the time of day Abas Business Software offers to watch some people get up 

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:10.580
 and of course, too 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.879
 just the duel he was not quantifying dollars 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.909
 Of course you will be provided with the scrapping is yes that is 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.449
 also their sender rowing machine or on the treadmill Martens on the bond market what 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.460
 but always fun 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.770
 more than a quarter of its members are actively involved 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.879
 Good footballers are an even better driver I know for example 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.839
 Sebastian Vettel that again 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.499
 In the pit against each other had Chambery complained that we never against 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:37.809
 she won 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:40.969
 now somewhat uneasy 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.929
 that should be so in Hamburg so I can not suffer creates we discuss 

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:45.520
 especially with the positive 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.680
 Herrmann said, "One already has 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.910
 give the impression that they are 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.630
 As the American says, the fit ones are incredible in some ways 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.500
 percent 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.300
 the Garden of Eden in many sports 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.800
 first doubt 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.360
 we would say 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.850
 Keith Warner could have reached quite a good level here as well 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.259
 not at all like Bastian Schweinsteiger, for example 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.939
 Maybe one or the other spell says Dirk half way through 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:10.979
 Reasonable level reach the boy with security because I think 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.039
 Living with dreamy can 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.099
 arrived at the software for mainframe evening west point where I have myself 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.759
 completely dry out or slower than expected is more open and therefore 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.629
 we continue to work hard, which of course makes us very happy 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:27.270
 We also had our fingers crossed for the upcoming season 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.639
 as seven times world champion Stephan Balkenhol 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.529
 the point reaches where you 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:33.770
 they let you be so fast 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.520
 or is the excitement still as big as the first time? 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.169
 because the tension and percent 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:44.560
 Excitement in one's tension and concentration and focus this 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.080
 are 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.110
 over as motor comes for i live i love to see the sport 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:52.460
 that is too important to me 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.569
 it's fun and fun 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:55.789
 Of course, then also good ground again
