not<00:03:55.079> what<00:03:55.319> are<00:03:55.409> we<00:03:55.500> use<00:03:55.680> pads<00:03:55.980> because<00:03:56.280> that

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
not what are we use pads because that

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.910 
not what are we use pads because that

you use to put it on wash that every day

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.500 
you use to put it on wash that every day
it's<00:04:05.159> important<00:04:05.549> to<00:04:05.609> keep<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.879> clean<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.269> the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
it's important to keep it clean it the

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.849 
it's important to keep it clean it the
next<00:04:06.720> time<00:04:06.840> we<00:04:07.019> need<00:04:07.290> be<00:04:07.439> using<00:04:07.739> as<00:04:07.829> their

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
next time we need be using as their

next time we need be using as their
apparent<00:04:08.280> treatment<00:04:08.629> and<00:04:09.629> this<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:10.650> step

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
apparent treatment and this is step

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.399 
apparent treatment and this is step
