00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.690
 well enough in japan in april 2014 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.609
 in Japan and well basically the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.039
 protagonist of this June series arcu 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.300
 bbva 6 llull up here the truth is 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.039
 that we have worked hard on the name already 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.810
 let's remember that the previous yugioh 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.820
 July Caesar the protagonist is called 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.519
 giulia yes basically they have changed the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.279
 ball and I was given more go more rain 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.770
 get out here well I'll read you a little bit 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.960
 the argument of this youtube as 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.420
 says july art focuses on the life of 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.270
 rains here here who tries to escape 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.440
 of the harsh reality with a smile but 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.329
 a duel leads him to act a 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.280
 determination to deal with 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.620
 difficulties and get the power that you 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.149
 gives infinite possibilities the subject 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.120
 The main purpose of the program is to take a step 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.469
 courageously forward well and good 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.120
 here in the description I will leave you the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.550
 official teler that they have brought out about this 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.530
 new series obviously I can not put in 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.270
 this video because they would copyright like this 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.549
 as you paint it in the description in the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.600
 link that I will leave the description and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.200
 you can see 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.729
 the trailer of this new youtube and I'm going to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.850
 tell a little bit my theory about what 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.799
 happen with this rain good to give my 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.990
 theory I have to remember the old 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.409
 honor series way that protagonist 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.850
 it was mutual yuki we did not get it up 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.430
 is where simply all the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.100
 letters both from our defects the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.630
 our normal magic cards 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.700
 traps you do not have to be clear the game what 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.590
 that is still the game as soon as 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.850
 We went to rain or gx doubt the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.979
 protagonist was Mr. hayden 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.020
 remember that this man who is 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.670
 Specializes basically in merging 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.060
 he was continuously working with his 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.860
 twists and well they were based that 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.590
 they implemented the Christmas Eve merger u 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.750
 another way in this me in this forgiveness 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.149
 this since the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.550
 mergers and well the next one is the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.799
 yours 5 d the protagonist was you say 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.630
 football and its misfortune basically in 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.009
 synchronize to that they implemented a new 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.610
 kind of letters that had never been seen 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.990
 in the fives well and in the last blond 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.229
 that has yielded in the yoke to exsal 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.030
 because the protagonist was yuma and of 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.170
 It was about warriors that you know species 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.780
 basically in extra 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.050
 in x and accept implemented in this a 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.330
 new yoke since the letters xyz do not 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.730
 they are going to implement in this new blonde 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.310
 they go to a new kind of letters like 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.750
 kind of monsters I believe and good as 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.330
 we could see in the trailer it seems 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.640
 be that the gentleman then some gentlemen 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.230
 when they go to fight they will have to 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.720
 climb a kind of mosquito animal 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.420
 move the dream you already pull out here in a 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.430
 pink hippopotamus species very strange and 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.480
 about four of you there's a kind of is 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.610
 that I do not know how to explain it is like 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.870
 kind of elemental chiefs so I 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.970
 I think it's basically going to be based 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.050
 in invoking in some way they are going to draw 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.610
 a new type of cards that we are 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.560
 elementary thirds have something to do 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.540
 with that because because it seems to be going to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.280
 complement of fire is elemental of 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.660
 water to my point of view then you have 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.420
 other different I guess but that's what 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.340
 I think everything I based on the page 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.140
 I think La Gomera we have to 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.750
 banish water-type monsters for 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.519
 invoke the head of water mental and not 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.430
 I know I think it's based on something like that is the 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.580
 new type of letters not maybe if it's 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.190
 of level 5 the elementary water chief 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.860
 we have to banish letters of 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.190
 type water level 5 attribute water 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.920
 level 5 I suppose it is almost not 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.680
 believe or not tell them this is very much to me 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.390
 opinion and nothing because this is news
