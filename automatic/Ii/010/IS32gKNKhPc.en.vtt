front panel switches and connections and

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.070 
front panel switches and connections and
I've<00:01:09.869> had<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> bit<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.439> proper<00:01:11.010> regard<00:01:11.280> sex

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
I've had a bit of a proper regard sex

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.140 
I've had a bit of a proper regard sex
insofar<00:01:13.080> as<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.729> front<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.030> this

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
insofar as on the front of this

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.530 
insofar as on the front of this
particular<00:01:15.390> case<00:01:15.689> there<00:01:15.990> are<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.380> us<00:01:16.650> beans

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
particular case there are for us beans

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.969 
particular case there are for us beans
so<00:01:18.540> there<00:01:18.780> are<00:01:19.280> two<00:01:20.280> links<00:01:21.350> each<00:01:22.350> feeding<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so there are two links each feeding a

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.840 
so there are two links each feeding a
pair<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.460> us<00:01:23.759> beans<00:01:24.060> each<00:01:25.250> unfortunately<00:01:26.250> this

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
pair of us beans each unfortunately this

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.300 
pair of us beans each unfortunately this
particular<00:01:27.240> motherboard<00:01:27.960> only<00:01:28.710> has<00:01:28.920> one

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
particular motherboard only has one

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.560 
particular motherboard only has one
internal<00:01:30.299> connection<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> USB<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.210> two<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
internal connection for a USB so two of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
internal connection for a USB so two of
those<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:39.090> USB<00:01:39.479> connections<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.170> Front's

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
those the USB connections on the Front's

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.520 
those the USB connections on the Front's
are<00:01:40.799> currently<00:01:41.990> redundant<00:01:42.990> which<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> shame

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
are currently redundant which is a shame

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.700 
are currently redundant which is a shame
so<00:01:46.530> I've<00:01:47.009> been<00:01:47.189> looking<00:01:47.549> around<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.780> USB

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
so I've been looking around for a USB

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.240 
so I've been looking around for a USB
expansion<00:01:50.670> card<00:01:50.960> which<00:01:51.960> i<00:01:52.170> could<00:01:52.409> put<00:01:52.829> inside

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
expansion card which i could put inside

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.660 
expansion card which i could put inside
the<00:01:53.549> computer<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.829> would<00:01:56.070> then<00:01:56.280> allow

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the computer and that would then allow

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.429 
the computer and that would then allow
me<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.799> connect<00:01:58.799> up<00:01:59.009> as<00:01:59.509> their<00:02:00.509> second<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.110> us

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
me to connect up as their second to us

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.800 
me to connect up as their second to us
beads<00:02:01.710> front<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.820> found<00:02:03.030> one<00:02:03.299> by<00:02:03.780> a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
also if they can really take price so

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.500 
also if they can really take price so
got<00:02:20.040> my<00:02:20.160> fingers<00:02:20.489> crossed<00:02:20.550> regarding<00:02:21.330> that

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
got my fingers crossed regarding that

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.150 
got my fingers crossed regarding that
because<00:02:21.720> at<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> mouth<00:02:22.080> otherwise<00:02:22.470> those<00:02:22.860> two

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
because at the mouth otherwise those two

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.000 
because at the mouth otherwise those two
USBs<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:23.970> front<00:02:24.239> will<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.569> or<00:02:24.690> two<00:02:24.900> will<00:02:25.860> be

USBs of the front will be or two will be

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.710 
USBs of the front will be or two will be
redundant<00:02:27.080> other<00:02:28.080> things<00:02:28.620> which<00:02:29.280> i<00:02:29.880> came

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
redundant other things which i came

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.740 
redundant other things which i came
across<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:31.170> guess<00:02:31.760> one<00:02:32.760> side<00:02:33.000> connected<00:02:33.450> up<00:02:33.569> or

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
switched the computer on and idly went

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.770 
switched the computer on and idly went
through<00:02:44.940> its<00:02:45.030> normal<00:02:45.450> post<00:02:46.819> set<00:02:47.819> up<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.450> then

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
through its normal post set up and then

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.830 
through its normal post set up and then
it<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:50.519> booted<00:02:50.910> into<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.540> bias<00:02:53.510> however<00:02:54.510> when

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
it it booted into the bias however when

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.620 
it it booted into the bias however when
I<00:02:54.989> actually<00:02:55.140> got<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.620> bias<00:02:55.860> screen<00:02:56.489> up<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:57.360> was

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
I actually got the bias screen up it was

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.780 
I actually got the bias screen up it was
only<00:02:57.870> reading<00:02:58.110> three<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.130> four<00:02:59.400> hard

only reading three of the four hard

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.970 
only reading three of the four hard
drives<00:03:03.500> it<00:03:04.500> was<00:03:04.709> not<00:03:05.340> reading<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:06.810> hard<00:03:07.650> drive

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
drives it was not reading the hard drive

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.000 
drives it was not reading the hard drive
in<00:03:08.250> day<00:03:08.519> one<00:03:10.310> this<00:03:11.310> flow<00:03:11.670> nicely<00:03:11.820> quite<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.299> bit

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
in day one this flow nicely quite a bit

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.350 
in day one this flow nicely quite a bit
at<00:03:14.010> first<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.579> thought<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.850> could<00:03:15.120> have<00:03:15.209> been<00:03:15.299> a

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
at first I thought it could have been a

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.580 
at first I thought it could have been a
faulty<00:03:15.840> connection<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.459> height<00:03:17.670> here<00:03:18.440> then<00:03:19.440> I

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
faulty connection the height here then I

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.140 
faulty connection the height here then I
thought<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.890> could<00:03:20.040> be<00:03:20.070> a<00:03:20.160> faulty<00:03:20.489> connection

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
thought it could be a faulty connection

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.170 
thought it could be a faulty connection
on<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.360> motherboard<00:03:21.660> itself<00:03:22.970> then<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.000> also

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
on the motherboard itself then I also

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.670 
on the motherboard itself then I also
wonder<00:03:24.570> what<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.989> might<00:03:25.140> have<00:03:25.260> been<00:03:25.320> hard

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
wonder what it might have been hard

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.699 
wonder what it might have been hard
drive<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.519> was<00:03:26.640> faulty<00:03:27.260> there's<00:03:28.260> no<00:03:28.410> this

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
through all those usual chairs it

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.430

what<00:04:19.419> was<00:04:19.449> going<00:04:19.720> on<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:20.109> was<00:04:20.709> able<00:04:20.919> to<00:04:21.100> identify

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
what was going on I was able to identify

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.490 
what was going on I was able to identify
the<00:04:22.180> problem<00:04:22.660> this<00:04:23.440> meant<00:04:23.740> then<00:04:23.949> I<00:04:24.100> had<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.370> get

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
the problem this meant then I had to get

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.200 
the problem this meant then I had to get
a<00:04:26.500> screwdriver<00:04:27.100> in<00:04:27.520> there<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.910> leave<00:04:28.180> early

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
a screwdriver in there and leave early

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.650 
a screwdriver in there and leave early
connection<00:04:28.990> down<00:04:30.210> fortunately<00:04:31.210> it's<00:04:31.360> quite

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
connection down fortunately it's quite

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.529 
connection down fortunately it's quite
pliable<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.880> laughter<00:04:33.880> i<00:04:33.910> looped<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.300> down

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
pliable and laughter i looped it down

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.110 
pliable and laughter i looped it down
and<00:04:34.870> then<00:04:34.960> married<00:04:35.740> up<00:04:35.860> correctly<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.669> I'm

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
and then married up correctly and I'm

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.879 
and then married up correctly and I'm
interested<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.720> work<00:04:38.190> so<00:04:40.080> like<00:04:41.080> most<00:04:41.289> bills<00:04:41.710> I

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
interested to work so like most bills I

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.770 
interested to work so like most bills I
suppose<00:04:42.190> not<00:04:42.460> without<00:04:42.729> its<00:04:42.970> team<00:04:43.210> problems

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
suppose not without its team problems

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.950 
suppose not without its team problems
but<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:44.530> has<00:04:44.710> booted<00:04:45.220> up<00:04:45.400> to<00:04:45.580> the<00:04:45.669> bias<00:04:45.960> without

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
but it has booted up to the bias without

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.219 
but it has booted up to the bias without
any<00:04:47.199> problems<00:04:47.650> now<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:49.660> other<00:04:49.750> thing<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:50.020> need

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
any problems now the other thing I need

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.050 
any problems now the other thing I need
to<00:04:50.410> be<00:04:50.530> considering<00:04:51.220> is<00:04:51.400> whether<00:04:51.610> i<00:04:51.669> need<00:04:51.880> to

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
to be considering is whether i need to

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.950 
to be considering is whether i need to
update<00:04:52.389> the<00:04:53.110> bias<00:04:54.000> it's<00:04:55.000> not<00:04:55.210> necessary<00:04:55.780> but

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
update the bias it's not necessary but

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.290 
update the bias it's not necessary but
there<00:04:56.110> are<00:04:56.229> later<00:04:56.470> biases<00:04:57.130> on<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.850> internet

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
there are later biases on the internet

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.390 
there are later biases on the internet
for<00:04:58.539> this<00:04:58.780> particular<00:04:58.930> motherboard<00:04:59.889> so<00:05:00.130> i<00:05:00.160> may

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
for this particular motherboard so i may

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.710 
for this particular motherboard so i may
do<00:05:00.460> that<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.990> then<00:05:02.080> once<00:05:02.289> that's<00:05:02.470> a<00:05:02.740> dumb<00:05:03.370> and

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
do that and then once that's a dumb and

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.939 
do that and then once that's a dumb and
achieve<00:05:04.720> their<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.349> next<00:05:05.650> step<00:05:05.910> will<00:05:06.910> be<00:05:06.940> to

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
achieve their the next step will be to

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.719 
achieve their the next step will be to
install<00:05:08.949> the<00:05:09.810> operating<00:05:10.810> system<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:11.740> this

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
install the operating system and this

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.240 
install the operating system and this
particular<00:05:12.940> server<00:05:13.539> is<00:05:13.840> going<00:05:13.930> to<00:05:14.199> have<00:05:14.380> small

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
particular server is going to have small

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.620 
particular server is going to have small
business<00:05:15.610> server<00:05:15.849> 2008<00:05:16.810> installed<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:18.630> for

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
business server 2008 installed and for

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.760 
business server 2008 installed and for
my<00:05:19.750> final<00:05:23.430> youtube<00:05:24.430> video<00:05:24.760> i<00:05:25.360> will<00:05:26.139> actually

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
my final youtube video i will actually

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:33.029 
my final youtube video i will actually
run<00:05:27.340> through<00:05:27.849> and<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:28.930> basic<00:05:29.590> install<00:05:30.010> of<00:05:32.039> SBS

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
run through and a basic install of SBS

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.890 
run through and a basic install of SBS
2008<00:05:35.010> there<00:05:36.010> are<00:05:36.159> a<00:05:36.880> number<00:05:37.150> of<00:05:37.479> those<00:05:37.659> already

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
2008 there are a number of those already

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.740 
2008 there are a number of those already
on<00:05:38.139> youtube<00:05:38.710> so<00:05:39.639> i'm<00:05:39.849> going<00:05:40.060> to<00:05:40.150> be<00:05:40.270> picking<00:05:40.510> up

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
on youtube so i'm going to be picking up

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.939

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
but this that concludes this this setup

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.180

as<00:06:10.180> far<00:06:10.419> as<00:06:10.510> I<00:06:10.630> can<00:06:10.690> as<00:06:10.900> far<00:06:11.409> as<00:06:11.530> I<00:06:11.620> can<00:06:11.680> say<00:06:11.949> now

another<00:06:16.120> fan<00:06:16.479> I<00:06:16.750> got<00:06:17.680> to<00:06:18.150> consider<00:06:19.380> how<00:06:20.380> the

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
another fan I got to consider how the

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.040 
another fan I got to consider how the
temperatures<00:06:21.039> stuck<00:06:21.310> up<00:06:21.520> in<00:06:22.120> a<00:06:22.779> real-life

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
temperatures stuck up in a real-life

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.270 
temperatures stuck up in a real-life
environment

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
environment

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.520 
environment
this<00:06:24.400> thing's<00:06:24.639> working<00:06:24.910> on<00:06:25.180> full<00:06:25.660> load<00:06:25.900> it

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
this thing's working on full load it

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.220 
this thing's working on full load it
would<00:06:26.770> be<00:06:26.980> a<00:06:27.010> very<00:06:27.100> simple<00:06:27.900> secure<00:06:28.900> the<00:06:29.020> case

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
would be a very simple secure the case

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.960 
would be a very simple secure the case
of<00:06:29.470> just<00:06:29.680> installing<00:06:30.670> a<00:06:30.820> fan<00:06:31.000> down<00:06:31.240> here<00:06:31.510> and

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:32.970 
of just installing a fan down here and

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.150 
of just installing a fan down here and
hardly<00:06:33.970> any<00:06:34.090> effort<00:06:34.180> at<00:06:34.480> all<00:06:34.660> involved<00:06:35.320> so<00:06:36.130> I

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 
hardly any effort at all involved so I

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.770 
hardly any effort at all involved so I
might<00:06:36.639> leave<00:06:36.880> that<00:06:37.060> for<00:06:37.270> the<00:06:37.300> time<00:06:37.480> being

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
might leave that for the time being

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.320 
might leave that for the time being
anyway<00:06:38.470> thank<00:06:38.950> you<00:06:39.010> very<00:06:39.040> much<00:06:39.310> for<00:06:39.340> for
