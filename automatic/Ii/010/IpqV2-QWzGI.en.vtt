00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.349
 Hello everyone in this video I will tell you 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.939
 Pro progressive rendering method 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.669
 this is one of the algorithms that can 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.529
 use the beasts now like you 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.230
 remember in the main course our where we are 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.489
 create interior we use algorithms 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.409
 which is called adaptive I told them 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.200
 already in one of the lessons he completely 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:37.050
 adapts in here switches 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.020
 antialiasing image sampler we were with 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.120
 you consider another algorithm 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.090
 progressive what is it first 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.740
 I'll show you a scene as such 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.990
 unpretentious as you see completely 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.990
 consists of primitive in standard 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.420
 the only thing with this box is i 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.360
 applied a chanter that is smoothing the chamfer 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.950
 the rest all standard primitives will 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.890
 use a vertical camera to 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.670
 render but she and unchecked 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.990
 xp 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 in order not to suffer with the settings 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.649
 shutter speed aperture and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.380
 film sensitivity by turning off this 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.719
 tick we do so to faith and not 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.869
 I calculated these parameters 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.909
 exposure and so as a source 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.869
 of the world I used this 2 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.740
 Raif source 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.899
 faith light type his house it is such 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.119
 bought light source to this 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:34.139
 light source i applied texture 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.639
 she is here represents 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:37.859
 a warrant and a card 

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:40.710
 thanks to this map our light source 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.369
 will not evenly illuminates our 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.549
 objects 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:50.249
 and on this map it looks like this 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.030
 the brightest areas will be the brightest 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.189
 lighting 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.909
 that is, these windows will be cast away 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.429
 light on our object and at the same time objects 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.469
 will all cast shadows now i'm 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.439
 switch to the installed camera 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:08.689
 take physics and someone and go into settings 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.280
 render rendering setup f10 keys 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:12.900
 go to the scroll and majd sampler 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.740
 which is on the faith tab and 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.220
 choose 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.110
 the progressive algorithm is now ours 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.880
 sampling antialiasing will 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.240
 happen thanks to this 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.310
 the algorithm to go to its settings 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.700
 need to open progressive scroll and sword 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.590
 sampler the first two parameters i think 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.410
 no need to explain minimum partitioning 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.420
 we will not change the maximum value 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.690
 because for maximum splitting 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.560
 100 is quite enough the next parameter 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.880
 render time is the render time in minutes 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.460
 if we set the value to 60 minutes to 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.880
 our render will last exactly 60 minutes 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.350
 the quality of the resulting picture 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.260
 will depend on your power 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.380
 computer what does it mean you why so 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.660
 will happen with this algorithm take 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.600
 Renders our image by 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.630
 a certain passage that is 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.490
 pass by pass 1 2 3 and with each 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.130
 new pass quality picture all 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.570
 getting better and getting better 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.040
 is improving and you should understand that what 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.010
 more pass in the final 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.800
 the image will get better on the weak 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.100
 computer may be suppose 20 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.560
 60 minutes of powerful passes 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.480
 the computer will have time to make 200 passes in 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.100
 same time 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.280
 naturally on a powerful computer 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.500
 the quality of the final will be better if 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.370
 we put a value equal to zero this 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.560
 means what 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.400
 faith is the trend of speech is the picture while we 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.970
 let's not stop it let's substitute 0 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.120
 next parameter 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.960
 but out come off means threshold 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.630
 the default noise is 0 better 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.360
 put one thousandth in fact 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.730
 no need to touch anything anymore 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.740
 just render 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.800
 as you can see here are very simple settings 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.660
 few of them and they understood me now 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.760
 as secondary bounces worth 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.280
 light cache algorithm 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.520
 so the first thing that happens to me when 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.350
 Render is rendering a light map like 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.310
 only the miscalculation will end will begin 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.200
 already directly rand now we 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.950
 we see the process itself already 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.750
 rendering our picture 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:36.160
 in brackets we write the current passage 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.900
 now here it is 8 9 will be 10 and so on with 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.400
 every new passage you will be in 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.290
 real time watch how 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.230
 improving the quality of your picture 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.750
 now she is pretty bad as well 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.210
 seen when approaching a lot of noise and 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.770
 a lot of things not read about 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.990
 one hundredth of our miscalculation 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.320
 You will see that the quality will be very 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.570
 good note on the background 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.570
 in my scene I really am 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.600
 used without even connecting the card to 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.950
 our surroundings kangaroo us that 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.500
 as you remember it is generally done here 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.920
 here in the rendering environment menu and there 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.560
 we indicate the card now I have not there 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.340
 No card is indicated here 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.020
 background is just my hd paradise 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.470
 the map that I showed 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:27.570
 tuned to its source of light dome 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.870
 texture view 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:34.810
 that is, this texture card 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.780
 now as if stretched on our dome on 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.380
 light source if you are interested in it 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.730
 and you do not know how it is done then I tell you 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.400
 I will gladly take off a separate 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.490
 lesson about this 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:54.430
 now pay attention I'm already coming 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:58.720
 31 pass already 32 and in the amount of time 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.700
 it took five and a half minutes now 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.300
 Suppose we are tired of waiting for our 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.240
 render either we donâ€™t have time at all 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.730
 either we are completely satisfied with the result 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.210
 we press the consol button to 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.110
 to cancel 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:16.150
 our render it stops exactly on 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.610
 that moment to what counted 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.440
 due to the fact that the render is not a block 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.110
 not by small squares but entirely 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.810
 right the whole picture is improving by 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.240
 quality, then you see that we do not have 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:32.080
 no unnecessary squares so 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.800
 we can safely keep pushing this image 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.120
 that is, save the picture and enter it 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.699
 title 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.780
 here you can immediately select quickly and 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:44.260
 name by type 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.180
 Germans plate that is for example the name 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.770
 the scene will be used this is our 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.889
 saved project saved 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:55.360
 project name or you can choose 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:59.080
 immediately scene plus camera view scene 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:02.050
 camera + date is generally very convenient 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.979
 Immediately select the type you want to not 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.810
 enter manually click save well and 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:11.530
 pharmacy answer we need jay 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:15.130
 pack for example click ok 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:18.639
 all picture saved render ready for 

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.680
 the stage at which he was stopped 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:22.570
 very convenient this algorithm will remind you 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.940
 you can use it often well 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.039
 the only thing in the interiors is he probably 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.500
 less commonly used in scenes 

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:32.229
 exterior in the subject visualization of it 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:36.270
 you can use a very handy thing on 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:36.270
 that's all thanks for watching everyone bye
