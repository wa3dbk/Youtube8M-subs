I didn't want to do a full unboxing
because<00:00:18.090> frankly<00:00:18.660> there's<00:00:19.080> nothing<00:00:19.470> inside

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650

both<00:01:37.950> these<00:01:38.130> systems<00:01:38.340> will<00:01:38.670> play<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
both these systems will play all the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.469 
both these systems will play all the
same<00:01:39.420> games<00:01:39.619> but<00:01:40.939> there's<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.360> know<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479

little<00:01:42.600> bit<00:01:42.780> more<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
little bit more that you can do with the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.260 
little bit more that you can do with the
new<00:01:44.159> 3ds<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.840> other<00:01:46.229> major<00:01:46.740> thing<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.490> that

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
new 3ds the other major thing is that

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.749 
new 3ds the other major thing is that
the<00:01:48.450> 3d<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.350> system<00:01:49.680> has<00:01:49.890> been<00:01:49.920> improved

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the 3d on this system has been improved

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.410 
the 3d on this system has been improved
dramatically

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
dramatically

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.160 
dramatically
so<00:01:52.070> this<00:01:53.070> 3ds<00:01:53.549> slider<00:01:54.240> you're<00:01:54.840> not<00:01:54.960> gonna<00:01:55.049> be

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
so this 3ds slider you're not gonna be

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.870 
so this 3ds slider you're not gonna be
able<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> 3d<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> video<00:01:56.520> it's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
able to see the 3d on the video it's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.609 
able to see the 3d on the video it's
probably<00:01:57.060> gonna<00:01:57.329> make<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:57.990> top<00:01:58.200> screen<00:01:58.409> look

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
probably gonna make this top screen look

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.359 
probably gonna make this top screen look
really<00:01:58.829> wonky<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> original

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
really wonky but if with the original

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.050 
really wonky but if with the original
3ds<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:03.570> could<00:02:04.189> stare<00:02:05.189> at<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.460> at<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> very

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
3ds you could stare at it at a very

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.719 
3ds you could stare at it at a very
specific<00:02:06.360> angle<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.469> could<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> what

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
specific angle so you could have a what

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.400 
specific angle so you could have a what
they<00:02:08.819> called<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> sweet<00:02:09.360> spot<00:02:09.599> or<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:10.259> at

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
they called the sweet spot or that's at

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.270 
they called the sweet spot or that's at
least<00:02:10.440> what<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> lot<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.069> people<00:02:11.190> knew<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.610> adds

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
least what a lot of people knew it adds

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.000 
least what a lot of people knew it adds
you<00:02:12.550> know<00:02:12.640> three<00:02:12.850> 3ds<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.870> had<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.260> keep<00:02:14.620> the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
you know three 3ds you had to keep the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.670 
you know three 3ds you had to keep the
system<00:02:15.730> at<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.850> very<00:02:16.150> specific<00:02:16.510> spot<00:02:16.990> right

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
system at a very specific spot right

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.640 
system at a very specific spot right
about<00:02:18.130> here<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.910> if<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.120> moved<00:02:19.390> up<00:02:20.020> down<00:02:20.350> left

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
about here and if you moved up down left

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.040 
about here and if you moved up down left
right<00:02:20.770> at<00:02:21.130> all<00:02:21.300> say<00:02:22.300> if<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.510> were<00:02:22.600> in<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.840> car

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
right at all say if you were in the car

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.770 
right at all say if you were in the car
and<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:23.560> hit<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:23.740> bump<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:25.120> system<00:02:25.600> moved

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
and you hit a bump and the system moved

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.220 
and you hit a bump and the system moved
you<00:02:26.110> would<00:02:26.260> lose<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.830> 3d<00:02:27.160> image<00:02:27.520> with<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.780> new

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
you would lose the 3d image with the new

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.500 
you would lose the 3d image with the new
3ds<00:02:29.620> they<00:02:30.010> actually<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.760> face<00:02:31.120> tracking

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
3ds they actually have a face tracking

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.780 
3ds they actually have a face tracking
3d<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:32.470> there's<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.010> little<00:02:33.220> eye<00:02:33.370> our<00:02:33.520> since

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
3d so there's a little eye our since

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.160 
3d so there's a little eye our since
here<00:02:33.940> at<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> at<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.690> front<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.020> screen

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
here at the at the front of the screen

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.949 
here at the at the front of the screen
that<00:02:36.130> will<00:02:36.489> track<00:02:36.819> where<00:02:37.030> your<00:02:37.209> face<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.420> and

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
that will track where your face is and

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.170 
that will track where your face is and
where<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.680> are<00:02:38.860> looking<00:02:39.430> at<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.670> screen<00:02:39.910> from

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
where you are looking at the screen from

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.290 
where you are looking at the screen from
so<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.810> can<00:02:41.020> actually<00:02:41.290> tilt<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:42.310> screen<00:02:42.580> quite

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
so I can actually tilt the screen quite

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.020 
so I can actually tilt the screen quite
a<00:02:43.330> bit<00:02:43.690> move<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.620> up<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:44.950> down<00:02:45.100> move<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.730> around

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
a bit move it up and down move it around

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.199 
a bit move it up and down move it around
and<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.750> still<00:02:47.170> see<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.590> 3d<00:02:47.920> image<00:02:48.280> which<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.120> a

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
and I still see the 3d image which is a

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.449 
and I still see the 3d image which is a
monumental<00:02:50.010> improvement<00:02:51.010> over<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.430> original

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
monumental improvement over the original

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.740 
monumental improvement over the original
