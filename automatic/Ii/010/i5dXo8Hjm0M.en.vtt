00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.410
 with Alejandro solga to see how is a 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.510
 compression measurement process in the 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.730
 tc engines good engineers first 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.559
 it starts to cool down the engine is like this 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.210
 the procedures follow the manuals 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.250
 that we have defined in the technique of 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.020
 According to the 9001 edition we have 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.970
 defined that the engine is first cooled 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.769
 without removing any item no 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.260
 peripheral is simply done 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.000
 circulate water with external help from 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.460
 an electric motor spins the pump and 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.440
 well, it is then cooled down to then 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.390
 move to the site I have and do the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.940
 compression ratio measurement 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.610
 well the cooling issue is a very hot topic 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.090
 simple something very very easy to perform 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.300
 then if you already need a device 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.370
 that is regulated that is measured and that 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.289
 good is the official parameter of the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.930
 category if we have a machine 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.760
 measurement of American origin that is the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.250
 that allows us to measure the relationship of 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.230
 compression 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.380
 now let's proceed to measure in the 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.560
 car of emiliano lopez the compression of the 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.530
 engine is already prepared in cylinder 2 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.950
 to do the measurement is all ready 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.500
 how to do the procedure 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.420
 well there we see is how it cools a 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.940
 little bit more all this procedure is 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.430
 even written in the manual where it 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.500
 must ventilate and remove gases 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.300
 residuals within the chamber so that 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.590
 do not interfere with the measurement once 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.740
 done that 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.420
 proceed to put the pipette to 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.219
 measuring the compression ratio turns 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.590
 the engine and automatically the machines 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:39.909
 tell us what the value is now measured 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.909
 the temperature to make the correction 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.359
 the chamber temperature is measured 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.310
 combustion that parameter is entered in 

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:50.130
 the machine and proceeds to do the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.560
 measurement but always the data of the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.240
 Temperature is loaded on the machine 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.670
 just measuring the compression yes 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.780
 because the machine is designed to 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.939
 measure at a certain temperature 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.560
 when this different temperature has to be 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.289
 enter the parameter to be done 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.360
 the internal correction of the machine for 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.489
 adjust the actual value that is inside 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.289
 the bed basically at what temperature 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.810
 measures the compression ratio in 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.340
 tesc drivers tc track 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.920
 initially it is in the order of 20 25 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.410
 degrees in case we have the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.120
 very limited measurement what is done is 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.950
 cool to the actual room temperature 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.800
 that today should be in 10 degrees here in 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.620
 ovarian 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.600
 and we proceed to the prediction well the 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.260
 alternative work in which we have is 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.420
 when the relationship gives different value 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.100
 stipulated maximum is to allow to start 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.900
 the engine for doubt that is not 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.030
 contaminated the chamber with some fluid 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.740
 it can be fuel or oil the last 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.120
 there will be an evaluation for the brand 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.950
 There may be some change in the 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.420
 regulation we are working 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.370
 we put in all the races the 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.110
 acquisitions data what we do have is 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.300
 a work plan for the brand that 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.450
 let's define surely tomorrow with 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.700
 the users 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.980
 so good in principle what is going 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.260
 to do is to work and determine if 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.870
 really the brand is going through a 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.849
 unfavorable technical moment or not that 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.500
 we will evaluate and make the corrections and 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.480
 you have to know the engineer's word 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.940
 solga the maximum responsible for the 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.099
 road tourism technique very well 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.080
 after everything that was talked about in the 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.300
 rafaela technique with matias rossi 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.190
 we explained and observed how it was 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.739
 checking a test engine at 17 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.110
 hours was defined the race javier the no 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.940
 at no to 14 as I do not see by 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.670
 television but to the cnog to north the and 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.310
 then no no no but hard I repeat 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.280
 more than a few grew alive 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.319
 how much action but the race was finished 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.140
 there is no doubt more no doubt more 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.940
 confirmed rociero and won well rossi in 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.829
 the race gained fantastic value a car 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.870
 superior to the rest clear what was the doubt 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:51.310
 then the technique the compression of the 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.340
 engine did not give him how many in the third 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.180
 he gave 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.159
 so if I measured it at one time 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.840
 not what happens that you never have to 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.280
 set exactly to cool 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.140
 all the elements so that the 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.640
 measurement by Alberto in the regulation 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.680
 it says walk until I measure it when I 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.260
 they gave to Castilian and when they came to 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.680
 ortelli third and second ok yes before 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.530
 what rossi 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.150
 the measurement gave good and we were the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.680
 hot engines and then when I 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.660
 Called Rossi did not hit two cylinders 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.269
 then it was very fair I was so 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.709
 just that they put it in motion they did 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.660
 turn fuel to clean the camera 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.789
 it was re-measured by those regulations of 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.530
 neither gave nor did it give expected that it 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.960
 cool or they had patience 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.479
 that's why at 5 o'clock he says roberto 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.669
 confirmed the victory of matias rossi and 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.680
 not at 1430 as it would have been if 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.330
 that now they may have waited until 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.650
 to cool down as good finally the 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.949
 function cold water and others and good 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.599
 finally gave the values ​​that this 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.849
 set the average contraction 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:48.280
 if not that by a single compression 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.080
 is left out an average is made and if 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.880
 is within the parameters then 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.990
 that average of course there already 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.419
 validates the triumph in this case or not 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.830
 because so many people say that rossi be 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.090
 outside the regulation because there's a lot of 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.130
 sentence with the system 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.930
 the machine this is used to measure the 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.669
 compression is a North American machine 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.770
 which requires you to put a parameter 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.419
 of the ambient temperature that parameter 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.790
 the machine is set the machine is calibrated 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.080
 and the compression in the camera is measured if 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.900
 it does not work well because it is not a 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.190
 very precise system the correct thing is 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.750
 wait for the engine to cool down or 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.389
 cool it artificially with water as 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.590
 happened and then later with no 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.150
 need to correct the 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.460
 machine measure again if there does not 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.470
 It was already been outside what is happening 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.970
 there's a lot of background talk that 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.770
 angelina and when they make a walker they 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.630
 pint buenos aires had been celebrated 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.310
 with water they wet the engine inside water in 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.139
 the camera they measured it did not give and did not 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.580
 they gave the possibility of averaging 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.500
 the regulation of that time allowed us 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.479
 averaging after that episode so 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.860
 sorry four years ago here not 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.180
 you know who you have allowed 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.220
 average then any is a 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.530
 bad cylinder or two cylinders wrong of the 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.450
 six you can average with the others 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.130
 four if you have a star you are not already 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.860
 outside before it was not like that before it was not like that 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:59.710
 with werner two years ago they win river 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.389
 fourth and laborito was the preparer the 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.970
 crosses because the first measurement does not 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.250
 gave and did not give and did not achieve it and not a 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.670
 option to measure it later and why 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.320
 what 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.350
 the decision was arbitrary in that 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.790
 moment then what was generated today 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.110
 it was many comments a lot 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.920
 accessibility because there were cases 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.270
 different 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.740
 one day is measured twice once three times 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.140
 goal at the end of last year with another 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.320
 champion and a half twice the second time 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:27.160
 cooling the conagua gave and was much the 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.990
 noise that measurement and transit that 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.150
 measurement is also done with others 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.580
 preparers as witnesses the second 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.140
 action some witnesses and those who 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.060
 they were just having turned out 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.100
 they said it's a soldier worth a 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.990
 clarification is also power the 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.270
 technical commissioner give a second or a 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.280
 third option if the value of measures 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.170
 very very very small is very easy mistake 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.910
 is very small maybe werner in river 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.680
 fourth was two years ago 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.180
 was too much compression not 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.920
 it was worth making a measurement 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.300
 new stop in this case the so small 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.300
 who gave him three supports
