of baseball people don't take us enough
but<00:04:56.440> I<00:04:56.470> think<00:04:56.800> in<00:04:56.950> attrition<00:04:57.370> and<00:04:57.550> it's

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.520 
but I think in attrition and it's
something<00:04:58.300> that<00:04:58.450> you<00:04:58.630> can<00:04:58.780> upgrade<00:04:58.990> really
