00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.620
 my hometrainer is short cilia 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:57.460

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:59.710
 not so I because I fun at the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.030
 because my parents have me because of movement 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.370
 when I was still small 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.839
 was and since then I do that and me 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.229
 I can not help it and I can 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.789
 also do not imagine sport 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.190
 yes, this year was for me 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.960
 competitively very successful in the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.700
 I have German youth championships 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.399
 to get a title if once 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.229
 become vice-champion 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.880
 After that, the first agreement was for lead 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.210
 a country fight for me it was very 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.659
 great success that we become second 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.909
 behind Austria unfortunately and now 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.729
 Germany was German 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.860
 association cup maybe also some of 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.720
 Present to them and here I am sixth 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.360
 in the individual ranking 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.340
 and that's why I would now to 18 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.330

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.330

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.890
 Already on this country fight me 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.930

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.480

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.270

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.860
 can qualify 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.720
 and exactly otherwise it is actually up 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.300
 the new parts learn around too 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.160
 Next year the competition show to 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.540

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.250

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.540
 Massengut stimulates you that this 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.580
 performance of marcel der to the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.820
 So the world's best belongs in any case 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.770
 motivates me that I've seen 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.150
 you have already done it once before 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.010
 maybe two times, maybe not 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.400

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.330
 Team and I'm definitely 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.739
 very motivated and always try my 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.959
 to obey and do everything 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.950
 what he said what are you doing when you 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.239
 not art much scholastic because I 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.390
 I'm not at a gymnasium 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.530
 That's why I have to get to know a lot 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.300
 or do homework otherwise 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.670

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.849
