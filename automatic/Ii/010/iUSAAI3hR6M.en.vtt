00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you guys see you could get a pet there's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.499 
you guys see you could get a pet there's
a<00:01:34.710> contract<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.640> that's<00:01:35.820> only<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.090> thousand

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
a contract and so that's only a thousand

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.030 
a contract and so that's only a thousand
of<00:01:36.540> Nexus<00:01:36.869> crystals<00:01:37.200> that's<00:01:37.380> really<00:01:37.590> nice<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
of Nexus crystals that's really nice and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.010 
of Nexus crystals that's really nice and
you<00:01:38.820> know<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.000> got<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> corrupted<00:01:39.630> red<00:01:39.840> wing

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
you know we got the corrupted red wing

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.510 
you know we got the corrupted red wing
and<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.590> mean<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.950> would<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.070> nice<00:01:41.280> if<00:01:41.310> we

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
and so I mean it would be nice if we

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.830 
and so I mean it would be nice if we
could<00:01:41.549> fly<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.880> around<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.390> hey<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.750> know

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
could fly it around but hey you know

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.090 
could fly it around but hey you know
let's<00:01:42.869> not<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.320> ahead<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.530> ourselves<00:01:43.680> here

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
let's not get ahead of ourselves here

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.560 
let's not get ahead of ourselves here
but<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.060> show<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.270> guys<00:01:45.329> what<00:01:45.509> it

it<00:01:48.890> 150,000<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.950> hexose<00:01:50.250> crystals<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> know

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
it 150,000 of hexose crystals and I know

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.700 
it 150,000 of hexose crystals and I know
I<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.570> there's<00:01:51.780> no<00:01:51.840> flying<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.350> drain<00:01:52.560> or

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
I know that there's no flying a drain or

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.170 
I know that there's no flying a drain or
but<00:01:53.159> let<00:01:53.280> me<00:01:53.310> tell<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.610> guys<00:01:53.729> something<00:01:53.790> right

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
now I've already got almost 60,000

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.319 
now I've already got almost 60,000
effects<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.219> crystals<00:01:56.610> saved<00:01:56.850> up<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.210> this

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
effects of crystals saved up for this

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.580 
effects of crystals saved up for this
thing<00:01:57.540> I'm<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:57.960> looking<00:01:58.259> forward<00:01:58.290> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
getting in even if I won't be able to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270 
getting in even if I won't be able to
fly<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.390> Draenor<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.439> make<00:02:01.890> sure<00:02:01.920> because

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
fly in Draenor and so make sure because

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.149 
fly in Draenor and so make sure because
you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.610> cap<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:03.030> right<00:02:03.270> now<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:04.100> 60,000<00:02:05.100> of

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
you can cap out right now it's 60,000 of

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.590 
you can cap out right now it's 60,000 of
Texas<00:02:05.460> crystals<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.240> if<00:02:06.450> you're

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
Texas crystals and so if you're

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.749 
Texas crystals and so if you're
interested<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.140> getting<00:02:07.229> that<00:02:07.530> mount<00:02:07.770> cap<00:02:08.550> out

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
interested in getting that mount cap out

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.270 
interested in getting that mount cap out
as<00:02:09.000> much<00:02:09.569> as<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:09.989> now<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.619> then<00:02:11.129> whenever

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
as much as you can now and then whenever

as much as you can now and then whenever
6.2<00:02:11.910> comes<00:02:12.150> out<00:02:12.300> you're<00:02:12.540> only<00:02:12.569> going<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.810> have

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
6.2 comes out you're only going to have

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.220 
6.2 comes out you're only going to have
to

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
have I don't know I guess 90,000 more to

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.170 
have I don't know I guess 90,000 more to
go<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.470> find<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:16.920> pet<00:02:17.129> in<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.489> pet<00:02:17.819> journal

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
go I can find a pet in the pet journal

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.610 
go I can find a pet in the pet journal
it<00:02:18.299> might<00:02:18.420> not<00:02:18.540> be<00:02:18.599> active<00:02:19.049> yet<00:02:19.200> that's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
it might not be active yet that's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.809 
it might not be active yet that's
probably<00:02:19.830> going<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.069> some<00:02:20.280> sort<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.519> a<00:02:20.580> fire

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
probably going to be some sort of a fire

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.820 
probably going to be some sort of a fire
thing<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:22.170> anyway<00:02:22.409> i'm<00:02:22.500> going<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.680> show

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
of eternity and what it's going to do is

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
of eternity and what it's going to do is
it's<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.060> upgrade<00:02:30.239> one<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.629> your

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
it's going to upgrade one of your

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
expansion uh like a Texas crystals would

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.740 
expansion uh like a Texas crystals would
have<00:04:52.949> been<00:04:53.069> a<00:04:53.099> hardcore<00:04:53.669> grind<00:04:53.940> for<00:04:54.240> Korean

worthwhile rewards for a good price the
rewards<00:05:19.590> were<00:05:19.740> not<00:05:19.949> worthwhile<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.729> they

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
rewards were not worthwhile and they

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.089 
rewards were not worthwhile and they
were<00:05:20.970> too<00:05:21.120> expensive<00:05:21.389> and<00:05:22.080> now<00:05:22.259> the<00:05:22.319> rewards

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
were too expensive and now the rewards

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.100 
were too expensive and now the rewards
are<00:05:23.280> both<00:05:23.550> worthwhile<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.479> not<00:05:24.780> expensive

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
are both worthwhile and not expensive

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.960 
are both worthwhile and not expensive
they're<00:05:25.740> still<00:05:26.009> like<00:05:26.190> it<00:05:26.310> takes<00:05:26.520> time<00:05:26.729> to<00:05:26.880> get

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
they're still like it takes time to get

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.700 
they're still like it takes time to get
these<00:05:27.180> right<00:05:27.389> but<00:05:27.930> it's<00:05:28.110> not<00:05:28.319> going<00:05:28.470> to<00:05:28.560> take

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
these right but it's not going to take

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.620 
these right but it's not going to take
forever<00:05:28.889> and<00:05:29.370> so<00:05:29.580> I'm<00:05:29.789> really<00:05:30.060> glad<00:05:30.180> they've

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
forever and so I'm really glad they've

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.089 
forever and so I'm really glad they've
kind<00:05:30.870> of<00:05:30.900> changed<00:05:31.289> the<00:05:31.380> apexes<00:05:31.740> crystal

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
kind of changed the apexes crystal

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.520 
kind of changed the apexes crystal
system<00:05:32.460> and<00:05:32.669> giving<00:05:33.360> people<00:05:33.630> this<00:05:33.750> option<00:05:34.259> and

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
system and giving people this option and

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.959 
system and giving people this option and
a<00:05:34.680> way<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:34.919> gear<00:05:35.250> up<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.400> characters<00:05:35.820> very

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 
a way to gear up the characters very

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:37.430 
a way to gear up the characters very
very<00:05:36.210> easily<00:05:36.419> I've<00:05:36.780> never<00:05:36.990> really<00:05:37.259> thought

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
very easily I've never really thought

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.560 
very easily I've never really thought
that<00:05:37.650> giving<00:05:38.130> players<00:05:38.490> decent<00:05:39.000> gear<00:05:39.120> is<00:05:39.270> a<00:05:39.300> bad

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
that giving players decent gear is a bad

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.390 
that giving players decent gear is a bad
thing<00:05:39.599> the<00:05:40.380> only<00:05:40.560> thing<00:05:40.710> that<00:05:40.860> could<00:05:41.009> maybe<00:05:41.159> be

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
thing the only thing that could maybe be

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.860 
thing the only thing that could maybe be
a<00:05:41.430> little<00:05:41.580> bit<00:05:41.880> of<00:05:41.940> a<00:05:41.969> negative<00:05:42.120> about<00:05:42.479> this<00:05:42.690> is

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
a little bit of a negative about this is

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.499 
a little bit of a negative about this is
it<00:05:43.740> does<00:05:43.919> give<00:05:44.099> players<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.490> same<00:05:44.820> item<00:05:45.150> gear

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
it does give players the same item gear

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.360 
it does give players the same item gear
as<00:05:45.750> um<00:05:46.080> I<00:05:46.349> guess<00:05:46.590> I<00:05:46.680> actually<00:05:46.860> no<00:05:47.130> you<00:05:47.340> know

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
as um I guess I actually no you know

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.159 
as um I guess I actually no you know
what<00:05:47.550> guys<00:05:47.759> I'm<00:05:48.030> glad<00:05:48.509> about<00:05:48.690> this<00:05:48.960> because

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
what guys I'm glad about this because

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:50.959 
what guys I'm glad about this because
for<00:05:49.530> one<00:05:50.039> it's<00:05:50.070> going<00:05:50.400> to<00:05:50.460> allow<00:05:50.520> people<00:05:50.580> to

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
for one it's going to allow people to

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:53.810 
for one it's going to allow people to
kind<00:05:51.120> of<00:05:51.240> gear<00:05:51.509> up<00:05:51.630> around<00:05:51.930> LFR<00:05:52.469> and<00:05:52.740> so<00:05:52.860> LFR<00:05:53.639> is

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
kind of gear up around LFR and so LFR is

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.459 
kind of gear up around LFR and so LFR is
for<00:05:54.090> sure<00:05:54.330> not<00:05:54.570> going<00:05:54.810> to<00:05:54.930> be<00:05:55.020> an<00:05:55.199> integral

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
for sure not going to be an integral

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:58.100 
for sure not going to be an integral
step<00:05:55.830> in<00:05:55.979> the<00:05:56.069> gearing<00:05:56.280> process<00:05:56.759> and<00:05:56.969> 6.2<00:05:57.449> on

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
step in the gearing process and 6.2 on

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.089 
step in the gearing process and 6.2 on
top<00:05:58.349> of<00:05:58.530> that<00:05:58.650> it's<00:05:58.800> going<00:05:58.889> to<00:05:58.949> allow<00:05:59.039> people

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
top of that it's going to allow people

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:00.890 
top of that it's going to allow people
to<00:05:59.490> kind<00:05:59.580> of<00:05:59.669> get<00:05:59.819> ready<00:06:00.060> and<00:06:00.300> prepared<00:06:00.630> up<00:06:00.780> to

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
to kind of get ready and prepared up to

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.420 
to kind of get ready and prepared up to
go<00:06:01.020> into<00:06:01.139> normal<00:06:01.500> mode<00:06:01.530> hellfire<00:06:02.400> citadel

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
go into normal mode hellfire citadel

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.969 
go into normal mode hellfire citadel
maybe<00:06:03.360> even<00:06:03.539> go<00:06:03.690> back<00:06:03.870> into<00:06:04.110> mythic<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:04.680> RF

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
maybe even go back into mythic the RF

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.230 
maybe even go back into mythic the RF
and<00:06:05.130> i<00:06:05.159> don't<00:06:05.370> really<00:06:05.550> know<00:06:05.729> why<00:06:05.880> they<00:06:06.030> would

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
and i don't really know why they would

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.820 
and i don't really know why they would
do<00:06:06.360> that<00:06:06.539> but<00:06:06.960> I<00:06:07.020> maybe<00:06:07.229> to<00:06:07.380> fill<00:06:07.560> out<00:06:07.650> some

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
do that but I maybe to fill out some

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.200 
do that but I maybe to fill out some
slots<00:06:08.159> with<00:06:08.370> tier<00:06:08.580> here<00:06:08.789> or<00:06:08.880> something<00:06:09.120> like

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
slots with tier here or something like

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.149 
slots with tier here or something like
that<00:06:09.270> and<00:06:09.539> so<00:06:10.050> there's<00:06:10.229> really<00:06:10.650> really<00:06:11.069> a<00:06:11.099> lot

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:11.159 
that and so there's really really a lot

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:13.159 
that and so there's really really a lot
of<00:06:11.400> good<00:06:11.520> things<00:06:11.669> happening<00:06:11.819> in<00:06:12.240> patch<00:06:12.449> 6.2

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
of good things happening in patch 6.2

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.200 
of good things happening in patch 6.2
