00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.399
 You make fun of it just like that 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.409

 we also see what that is which does not come as it is for me that is 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:01.699
 a little weird but no matter 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.699

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.349
 century 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.989
 Pipe around the cowboy last year so you can do it too 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.089

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.690
 Of course you can do that here as well 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.779

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.080
 at some point deodorant like that 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.139
 but no matter if you're creative, you can do it all 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.710
 and i hope i have 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.819
 Paris Kubica adequately explained 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.800
