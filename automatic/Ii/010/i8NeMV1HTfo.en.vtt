hello<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:00.989> Samir<00:00:01.500> and<00:00:01.530> today<00:00:02.190> I'll<00:00:02.460> be

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hello this is Samir and today I'll be

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.190 
hello this is Samir and today I'll be
providing<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:03.389> with<00:00:03.419> information<00:00:03.689> about

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
providing you with information about

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.309 
providing you with information about
some<00:00:04.680> specific<00:00:05.339> elements<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.210> interface<00:00:06.990> of

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
some specific elements in a interface of

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.850 
some specific elements in a interface of
effects<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:08.599> these<00:00:09.599> are<00:00:09.990> kind<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.590> different

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
effects and these are kind of different

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.249 
effects and these are kind of different
from<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.429> usual<00:00:11.610> cinema<00:00:12.240> 4d<00:00:12.480> elements<00:00:13.170> you

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
from the usual cinema 4d elements you

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.379 
from the usual cinema 4d elements you
find<00:00:13.530> any<00:00:13.710> attribute<00:00:14.219> manager<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.150> just

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
find any attribute manager so I just

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.170 
find any attribute manager so I just
wanted<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.990> talk<00:00:16.650> about<00:00:16.859> them<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.460> tell<00:00:18.000> you

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
wanted to talk about them and tell you

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.050 
wanted to talk about them and tell you
what<00:00:18.330> they<00:00:18.449> exactly<00:00:18.900> do<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:20.460> effects<00:00:20.820> scene

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
what they exactly do the effects scene

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.939 
what they exactly do the effects scene
is<00:00:21.240> kind<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.810> different<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.320> any<00:00:22.470> other<00:00:22.650> node

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
is kind of different from any other node

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.189 
is kind of different from any other node
in<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.160> framework<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.210> had<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.539> custom

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
in the framework so I had a custom

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.009 
in the framework so I had a custom
interface<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:26.039> with<00:00:26.460> global<00:00:26.849> settings<00:00:27.210> but

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
interface here with global settings but

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.099 
interface here with global settings but
let's<00:00:28.320> take<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> look<00:00:28.830> at<00:00:29.010> notes<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
let's take a look at notes and here the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.100 
let's take a look at notes and here the
first<00:00:31.410> thing<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:31.949> find<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.210> quick<00:00:33.450> tab<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
first thing we find is the quick tab and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.620 
first thing we find is the quick tab and
this<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.309> holds<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:35.760> many<00:00:35.850> setups<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.420> thought

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
this one holds so many setups I thought

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.690 
this one holds so many setups I thought
I've<00:00:36.750> explained<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.890> previous<00:00:37.920> training

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
I've explained in a previous training

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.540 
I've explained in a previous training
material<00:00:39.239> already<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.840> no<00:00:40.530> matter<00:00:40.710> which<00:00:41.040> tab

directly beside a setting but then it's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
a set this is another very common tab

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.490 
a set this is another very common tab

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
mostly used in operators or emitters or

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.800 
mostly used in operators or emitters or
delegates<00:01:41.070> which<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.939> called<00:01:42.180> constraints

delegates which is called constraints

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.889 
delegates which is called constraints
and<00:01:42.960> which<00:01:43.470> takes<00:01:44.009> well<00:01:44.579> all<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.360> constraints

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899

of<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.020> framework<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:47.060> course<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.270> are

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
of the framework of course there are

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.450 
of the framework of course there are
also<00:01:48.479> some<00:01:48.780> custom<00:01:49.170> tabs<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.890> note<00:01:50.070> but

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
also some custom tabs in a note but

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.840 
also some custom tabs in a note but
these<00:01:51.119> three<00:01:51.390> are<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.720> most<00:01:52.020> common<00:01:52.590> ones

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
these three are the most common ones

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.490 
these three are the most common ones
then<00:01:53.850> we<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.240> candidate<00:01:54.750> button<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
then we have this candidate button and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.580 
then we have this candidate button and
you<00:01:56.430> can<00:01:56.579> always<00:01:56.759> find<00:01:57.210> beside<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> link<00:01:58.320> field

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
you can always find beside a link field

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.980 
you can always find beside a link field
or<00:01:58.979> an<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.579> out<00:01:59.759> port<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
or an in or out port and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.560 
or an in or out port and
this<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.680> one<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.040> most<00:02:03.340> useful<00:02:03.700> things<00:02:04.000> in

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
this is one of the most useful things in

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.649 
this is one of the most useful things in
the<00:02:05.079> effects<00:02:05.560> interface<00:02:06.159> so<00:02:07.030> clicking<00:02:07.270> on<00:02:07.479> it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
the effects interface so clicking on it

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.370 
the effects interface so clicking on it
gives<00:02:07.990> us<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.590> menu<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:10.090> compatible<00:02:10.869> objects

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
gives us a menu with compatible objects

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.059 
gives us a menu with compatible objects
that<00:02:11.980> fit<00:02:12.370> exactly<00:02:13.000> into<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.840> link<00:02:14.080> field<00:02:14.319> so

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
that fit exactly into this link field so

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.130 
that fit exactly into this link field so
once<00:02:15.250> we<00:02:15.400> select<00:02:15.819> an<00:02:15.970> object<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.599> will<00:02:16.780> create

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
once we select an object it will create

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.620 
once we select an object it will create
the<00:02:18.040> object<00:02:18.459> in<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.700> object<00:02:19.060> manager<00:02:19.209> and

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
the object in the object manager and

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.229 
the object in the object manager and
link<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.560> in<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.769> link<00:02:21.099> field<00:02:21.340> automatically

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
link it in the link field automatically

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.390 
link it in the link field automatically
making<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.260> very<00:02:23.470> easy<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.980> straightforward

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
making it very easy and straightforward

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.180 
making it very easy and straightforward
to<00:02:24.790> build<00:02:25.150> up<00:02:25.330> new<00:02:25.569> setups<00:02:26.050> but<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.010> also

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
to build up new setups but it also

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.120 
to build up new setups but it also
serves<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.760> second<00:02:28.120> purpose<00:02:28.569> let's<00:02:29.319> just<00:02:29.620> take

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
serves a second purpose let's just take

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.850 
serves a second purpose let's just take
a<00:02:30.160> look<00:02:30.430> at<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:30.730> one<00:02:31.000> if<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.110> click<00:02:32.380> on<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.560> and

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
a look at this one if I click on it and

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.550 
a look at this one if I click on it and
a<00:02:33.430> compatible<00:02:34.060> object<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.600> already<00:02:35.140> in<00:02:35.380> the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
a compatible object is already in the

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.490 
a compatible object is already in the
scene<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:36.160> will<00:02:36.459> provide<00:02:36.880> me<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.420> list<00:02:37.959> of<00:02:38.170> these

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
scene it will provide me a list of these

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.220 
scene it will provide me a list of these
objects<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.700> releases<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.540> user<00:02:40.780> from

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
objects this releases the user from

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.500 
objects this releases the user from
browsing<00:02:41.530> complex<00:02:42.400> hierarchies<00:02:43.030> just<00:02:43.360> to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
browsing complex hierarchies just to

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.559 
browsing complex hierarchies just to
find<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.930> compatible<00:02:44.319> object<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:46.120> course<00:02:46.390> it

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
find a compatible object of course it

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.020 
find a compatible object of course it
works<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:47.110> all<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.860> other<00:02:48.040> camp<00:02:48.340> buttons<00:02:48.819> the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
works for all the other camp buttons the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.530 
works for all the other camp buttons the
same

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
same

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.620 
same
then<00:02:51.540> we<00:02:51.660> have<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.250> special<00:02:53.250> interface<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
then we have this special interface in a

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.630 
then we have this special interface in a
linked<00:02:54.840> list<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.680> we<00:02:56.010> have<00:02:56.130> four<00:02:56.430> options

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
linked list and we have four options

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.410 
linked list and we have four options
here<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.810> let<00:02:57.990> us<00:02:58.020> choose<00:02:58.590> which<00:02:59.520> subgroup

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
here that let us choose which subgroup

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.980 
here that let us choose which subgroup
of<00:03:00.630> this<00:03:00.840> part<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.260> group<00:03:01.500> we'll<00:03:01.680> use<00:03:02.990> like

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
of this part of the group we'll use like

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.800 
of this part of the group we'll use like
this<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.770> this<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.610> can<00:03:05.850> see<00:03:06.150> the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
this like this you can see the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.410 
this like this you can see the
parallelism<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.700> particle<00:03:09.270> group

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
parallelism to the particle group

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.000 
parallelism to the particle group
settings<00:03:09.870> where<00:03:10.140> we<00:03:10.170> have<00:03:10.470> four<00:03:10.830> different

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
settings where we have four different

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.260 
settings where we have four different
types<00:03:11.460> passive<00:03:12.180> liquid<00:03:12.660> or<00:03:12.840> tissa<00:03:13.170> t<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:14.270> the

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
types passive liquid or tissa t and the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.800 
types passive liquid or tissa t and the
diffuse<00:03:15.660> particle<00:03:16.200> subgroups<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:18.630> can

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
diffuse particle subgroups and we can

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.170 
diffuse particle subgroups and we can
choose<00:03:19.020> them<00:03:19.200> here<00:03:19.440> like<00:03:19.650> passive<00:03:20.400> liquid

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
choose them here like passive liquid

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.000 
choose them here like passive liquid
vorticity<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.380> diffuse<00:03:23.070> particles

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
vorticity and diffuse particles

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.490 
vorticity and diffuse particles
and<00:03:25.269> this<00:03:26.269> is<00:03:26.390> especially<00:03:26.750> important<00:03:27.470> for

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
and this is especially important for

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.300 
and this is especially important for
notes<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.580> operate<00:03:29.569> on<00:03:29.780> several<00:03:30.739> particle

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
notes that operate on several particle

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.190 
notes that operate on several particle
groups<00:03:31.519> so<00:03:31.819> let's<00:03:32.060> just<00:03:32.390> create<00:03:32.629> a<00:03:32.780> new<00:03:33.019> one

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
groups so let's just create a new one

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.100 
groups so let's just create a new one
and<00:03:33.790> we<00:03:34.790> can<00:03:34.970> see<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.269> purpose<00:03:35.629> now<00:03:35.780> here<00:03:36.079> I

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
and we can see the purpose now here I

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.259 
and we can see the purpose now here I
could<00:03:36.439> choose<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.709> different<00:03:37.250> subtype<00:03:37.970> for

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
could choose a different subtype for

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.869 
could choose a different subtype for
this<00:03:38.750> part<00:03:39.019> of<00:03:39.110> your<00:03:39.260> group<00:03:39.470> then<00:03:39.769> for<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.549> top

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
this part of your group then for the top

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.039 
this part of your group then for the top
one<00:03:42.370> all<00:03:43.370> right<00:03:43.670> these<00:03:43.909> were<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.480> interface

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
one all right these were the interface

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.750 
one all right these were the interface
elements<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:46.069> should<00:03:46.280> be<00:03:46.430> aware<00:03:46.549> of

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
elements that you should be aware of

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.819 
elements that you should be aware of
when<00:03:47.060> working<00:03:47.329> in<00:03:47.659> the<00:03:47.780> effects<00:03:48.079> framework<00:03:48.590> I

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
when working in the effects framework I

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.580 
when working in the effects framework I
hope<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:49.970> it<00:03:50.030> was<00:03:50.150> helpful<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:50.780> as<00:03:51.349> always

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
hope that it was helpful and as always

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.400 
hope that it was helpful and as always
