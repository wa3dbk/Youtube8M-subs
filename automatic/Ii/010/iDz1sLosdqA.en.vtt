00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.229

 anyway I'm not so orange it is 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:54.519
 because I set the camper to make in 

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:58.329
 so that I was a little more orange 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.850
 but in reality they are not as they are 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.859
 greater or inspiration came because 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.009

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:41.950
 I will make video of the cabbage and then I have 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.770
 thought to make this video for 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.259
 to show this Arabic trick is seen 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.640
 who did the tutorial I explain 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.530
 here thought since he didn't do the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.179
 tutorial I'll explain how I did this 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:02:00.819
 makeup and then the necklace goes well 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:07.599
 you have already seen it is super cool and 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:10.379
 hi now i have so super cool with 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:15.489
 the butterflies lion the snakes 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:19.090
 the trick then the trick to do 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.709
 this trick was arabian and not why 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.370
 can run has put too much of Arabic 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.280
 does not inspire an Arabic makeup Arabic makeup 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.240
 what I did keep in mind that 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.390
 perfect and you will now tell me but do a 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.160
 tutorial redo the same it is not so 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.060
 simple because they always come shitty 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.230
 if you have the beginner's luck 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.830
 where have I ever done a trick and anger 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:52.050
 and if sometimes a very good first time 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:55.760
 and anyway I did the 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.690
 eyebrows so I didn't 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.260
 specific that I was not inspired 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.120
 no make-up I just made up to 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.920
 case here is lunch for what I don't have 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.989
 I did the pound tutorial makeup case 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.070
 then I get cool 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.920
 then anyway it is absolutely not 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.120
 perfect reason why they have us 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.940
 done in five minutes of clock 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.580
 so keep in mind the eyebrow 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.280
 I did it a bit like that then does with the 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:27.030
 straight up and then I simply did 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.590
 a line of black eyeliner that does so 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.329
 what goes to another here of the 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.150
 very simple line of her in black that 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.400
 you are able to do all I believe that 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.100
 maybe not but oh well it is very easy 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.799
 very easy and then with the pencil 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.660
 brown a brown pencil the 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.310
 soccer scandal eyes of the other rhyme mi 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.890
 like is liking a lot then 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.209
 I'll take other pencils like this 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.130
 and oh well I basically oh well rehearsed 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.810
 in short, you see what I did 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.850
 I made the whole line the whole line 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.330
 so and then 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.450
 I pulled sonata towards the other I did 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.380
 I don't know how to call it a curl 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.470
 becomes the name year has a name 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.780
 specifically this thing done so to us 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.950
 specific I don't get the same thing I have 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.020
 done below with with the same pencil 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.150
 brown did not come very well below 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.930
 is actually a Venetian goods is well into 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.600
 complex but ok and then here in the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.110
 buchetti here I put some pencil 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.510
 arancina keep in mind that I did not 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.360
 to show it to you I'm showing it 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.510
 now just because I got it, though 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.600
 I do not know what to do today 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.090
 ispiration and then I took this case 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.380
 front as I did 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:58.100
 so meanwhile to do this thing I know 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:00.600
 what's your name of a diadem ? 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.400
 you would still like the brillantino here 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.880
 I don't know if it has a specific name 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.460
 however I made a linen circle with the 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.810
 purple pencil that I don't know if it's perfect and 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.670
 in the middle attached three purple glitter 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.720
 with false eyelash glue almost here 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.660
 are the glitter 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.880
 I do not tell you that she died only because of them 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.640
 I had taken in Germany years ago were 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:28.680
 no brand in those 50 stores 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.330
 cents per piece of yourself are for nails 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.220
 to make nail art so you can 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.560
 I never use them to tune to mourinho 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.810
 why then remove them a delirium e 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.510
 measured that I had given her I take 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:44.499
 two or three to put on the course the 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:47.719
 pallino there is ok there 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:49.219
 and then nothing natural lips indeed 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.029
 I'm put absolutely nothing on 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:52.419
 lips 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:54.529
 I put only a little lion says in the o 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.869
 neutralized to make sure you 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:00.020
 they only saw the eyes and that 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:02.240
 precisely gave blue color of the 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.490
 eyes then like hairdo photo I'm so 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.369
 which with the tail of the eldo put precisely 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:12.110
 these gloves part of ends are made 

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:18.889
 so here's pretty much to make you 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:19.490
 understand and this is the glove this is 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:31.009
 how much 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:32.990
 so it's so cool because I can do all this 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:38.479
 do the dance to raise the 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:40.819
 snake or so called so it sounds 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:43.389
 really badly 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:46.879
 said so it sounds really bad 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:49.219
 however you have understood what I must do 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:50.899
