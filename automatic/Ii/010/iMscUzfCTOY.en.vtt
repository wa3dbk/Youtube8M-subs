00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi my youtube people as they have been 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.910
 I hope you are very good 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.770
 nothing welcome to this new video 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.610
 of minecraft and good today I come to 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.230
 bring a little tutorial on how to have 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.809
 question or a conversion generator 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.420
 infinite for this we are going to need or 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.470
 require three small items that 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.619
 would come being google water and bucket with 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.140
 lava and a peak can be any peak 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.699
 not necessarily diamond and good a 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.050
 once they have to have us then the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.450
 three more than the three materials 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.219
 required let's start first that 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.239
 everything will put me on steel server 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.129
 perfect 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.399
 let's finish with zero and well let's do 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.850
 what I'm going to do, I urge year, let's try 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.519
 two blocks 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.250
 well just as I do and in the 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.379
 second broken block let's make a 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.870
 challenge more for low and that as a 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.180
 sort of ladder from a block here 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.730
 and two down here now what 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.729
 let's do is just leave a 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.250
 block count 1 and in the second do 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.289
 another gap here we would already have what it is 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.299
 itself the basic mechanism to generate 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.890
 the cob is now we're just going to 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.560
 place in the juice here 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.420
 the hub for the cow who gave it 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.159
 the one of water since the one of now 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.740
 we're just going to break this block 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.720
 here and if you want you can make a 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.729
 here to break and how can they 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.650
 see here the mechanism is already done and 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.740
 we would have cobos toni min and is now 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.329
 it simply remains to apply 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.040
 how can you see if it is generating 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.500
 they have to be careful that they do not 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.640
 go nothing 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.640
 so perfect 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.979
 so and so only simply up 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.500
 that they in a state of shock good this one 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.190
 It serves mainly and helps a lot in the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.200
 espai blog 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.180
 to do the basic structures and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.520
 all this but this is the mechanism 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.570
 simple good indeed all those who 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.370
 I'm going to do in this video are they all are 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.680
 simple but this is the mechanism that 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.290
 He gives a cover, he wants to do more 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.360
 can do this mechanism that is 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.460
 the same that I have here but obviously 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.050
 more elongated so this time I'll get 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:18.230
 in creative and we will do the same 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.410
 all one below we leave one two 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.010
 and I'm staying here 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.010
 A) Yes 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.440
 let's do over here let's do the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.200
 block 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.200
 and the games with labaque 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.159
 but good to continue 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.290
 that would be the cost the general of 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.310
 more elongated co-management and now what 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.800
 we have to do is remove these from 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.170
 here as you can see we are already general 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.020
 the conversion like this until we have 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.490
 infinities until he's good friends 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.110
 this has been all I hope you have 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.180
 liked anything that I have not 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.820
 explained well just leave it here 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.030
 down in the description your question or 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.200
 comment and sorry for my absence is 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.790
 that I have many jobs in the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.130
 university then I could not 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.420
 spend a lot of time on the computer but 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.430
 well I'll be back with my 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.040
 good tutorial videos look out for 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.930
 channel do not forget to like the video and 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.550
 that would help me a lot to come back and 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.680
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.680
 it was entertaining and even another
