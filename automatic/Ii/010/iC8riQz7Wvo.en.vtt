I've<00:00:03.959> been<00:00:04.140> sick<00:00:04.500> with<00:00:05.839> look<00:00:06.839> at<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.020> flu<00:00:07.379> so

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
I've been sick with look at that flu so

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.220 
I've been sick with look at that flu so
I<00:00:08.069> mean<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.429> really<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> chance<00:00:09.179> even<00:00:09.510> if<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.840> could

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
I mean I really a chance even if I could

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.320 
I mean I really a chance even if I could
update<00:00:10.469> because<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.130> couldn't<00:00:11.429> talk<00:00:11.940> for<00:00:12.000> a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
update because I couldn't talk for a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.390 
update because I couldn't talk for a
couple<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.660> days<00:00:12.809> they're<00:00:13.849> cut<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.000> chase

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
couple of days they're cut to the chase

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:27.580 
couple of days they're cut to the chase
sweet<00:00:17.400> sweet<00:00:18.320> mercy<00:00:19.320> looking<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:22.880> start<00:00:24.710> so<00:00:25.710> I

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
sweet sweet mercy looking a start so I

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.580 
sweet sweet mercy looking a start so I
actually<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.830> got<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:30.320> few<00:00:31.320> minutes

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
actually just got this in a few minutes

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.840 
actually just got this in a few minutes
ago<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:33.270> little<00:00:33.540> recap<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.850> everything

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
ago but a little recap on everything

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.600 
ago but a little recap on everything
that<00:00:35.969> happened

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
that happened

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.410 
that happened
crank<00:00:38.610> mains<00:00:38.879> all<00:00:39.510> came<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.489> right<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.149> I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
crank mains all came in right on like I

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.290 
crank mains all came in right on like I
think<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.960> difference<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.559> one<00:00:43.860> tenth<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.760> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
think the difference is one tenth of a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.750 
think the difference is one tenth of a

seven<00:00:50.420> that<00:00:51.420> was<00:00:51.570> super<00:00:51.899> awesome<00:00:53.030> expected

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
seven that was super awesome expected

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.209 
seven that was super awesome expected
though<00:00:54.180> from<00:00:54.510> optimizer<00:00:55.410> crank<00:00:55.770> anyways<00:00:58.219> and

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
though from optimizer crank anyways and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
though from optimizer crank anyways and
then<00:00:59.399> the<00:01:00.359> bearings<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.890> main<00:01:02.239> bearing

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
then the bearings the main bearing

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.170 
then the bearings the main bearing
clearance<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:06.869> after<00:01:07.500> measuring<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.430> mains

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
clearance and after measuring the mains

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.230 
clearance and after measuring the mains
with<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.689> bearings<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.590> them<00:01:10.830> and

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.050 

subtracting<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> crank<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.229> came<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.920> with

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.490 

larger<00:01:21.060> measurements<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> plastic<00:01:22.290> gauge

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
larger measurements in the plastic gauge

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.080 
larger measurements in the plastic gauge
or<00:01:22.890> more<00:01:23.430> clearance<00:01:23.850> than<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.119> plasti<00:01:24.509> gauge

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
or more clearance than the plasti gauge

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.399 
or more clearance than the plasti gauge
it's<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.240> really<00:01:27.479> be<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.630> mean<00:01:28.189> calls<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:30.380> 0<00:01:31.380> 0

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it's not really be I mean calls for 0 0

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.840 
it's not really be I mean calls for 0 0
3<00:01:31.890> 5<00:01:32.479> between<00:01:33.479> 2<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.079> 0<00:01:34.650> 0<00:01:34.710> 2<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.100> over<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:35.520> 35

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
3 5 between 2 and 0 0 2 is over there 35

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.490 
3 5 between 2 and 0 0 2 is over there 35
is<00:01:36.710> max<00:01:37.710> clearance<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:39.840> anything<00:01:40.229> on

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
is max clearance and so if anything on

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
is max clearance and so if anything on

I'm<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> cusp<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.820> it's

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
I'm not on the cusp of it but it's

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.450 
I'm not on the cusp of it but it's
within<00:01:45.930> range<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:48.049> you<00:01:49.049> know<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.770> 3<00:01:50.430> 0

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
within range and you know the one is 3 0

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.130 
within range and you know the one is 3 0
&amp;<00:01:51.090> 5<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.960> 3<00:01:52.170> 0<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:53.430> then

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
&amp; 5 is 3 0 and then

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.740 
&amp; 5 is 3 0 and then
-<00:01:54.740> is<00:01:54.950> 3<00:01:55.250> -<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:57.070> it's<00:01:58.070> I<00:01:58.430> mean<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:59.030> guess<00:01:59.360> if<00:01:59.510> I<00:01:59.630> was

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
- is 3 - so it's I mean I guess if I was

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.930 
- is 3 - so it's I mean I guess if I was
going<00:02:00.080> Jeff<00:02:00.350> stuff<00:02:00.590> this<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:01.070> might<00:02:01.370> be<00:02:01.400> a

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
going Jeff stuff this it might be a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.750 
going Jeff stuff this it might be a
little<00:02:02.630> loose<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.410> then<00:02:04.190> again<00:02:04.310> when<00:02:04.580> the

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
little loose but then again when the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.710 
little loose but then again when the
plastic<00:02:05.120> edge<00:02:05.300> olcay<00:02:05.720> me<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:05.990> ride<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.380> -<00:02:06.830> I

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
plastic edge olcay me and ride it - I

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.350 
plastic edge olcay me and ride it - I
don't<00:02:08.720> know<00:02:08.920> how<00:02:09.920> accurate<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.850> plastic<00:02:11.210> edge

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
don't know how accurate the plastic edge

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.110 
don't know how accurate the plastic edge
should<00:02:11.660> be<00:02:11.900> or<00:02:12.230> shouldn't<00:02:13.160> be<00:02:13.280> in<00:02:13.460> comparison

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
should be or shouldn't be in comparison

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.400 
should be or shouldn't be in comparison
but<00:02:15.080> at<00:02:15.560> any<00:02:15.770> rate<00:02:16.330> if<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.750> took<00:02:17.930> either

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
but at any rate if I took either

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.400 
but at any rate if I took either
measurement<00:02:19.070> I<00:02:19.160> am<00:02:19.490> within<00:02:19.790> range<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.720> I'm

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
measurement I am within range so I'm

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.460 
measurement I am within range so I'm
gonna<00:02:21.620> run<00:02:21.860> with<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.270> it<00:02:23.270> yeah<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:24.320> feels

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
gonna run with it and it yeah it feels

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.620 
gonna run with it and it yeah it feels
to<00:02:24.709> me<00:02:24.770> it<00:02:24.950> feels<00:02:25.220> really<00:02:25.640> nice<00:02:25.760> it's<00:02:26.180> it's

of that I did I did the employ they call
for<00:02:38.050> three<00:02:39.050> thousand<00:02:39.500> between<00:02:40.010> three<00:02:40.310> and

for three thousand between three and
nine<00:02:40.489> thousands<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:42.050> landed<00:02:42.770> up<00:02:42.860> for<00:02:43.330> which<00:02:44.330> was

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
nine thousands I landed up for which was

all the costing flash the machine show

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.690 
all the costing flash the machine show
originally<00:03:20.860> caught<00:03:21.860> all<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.100> flashing<00:03:22.549> off

this one

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.500 
this one
I<00:03:27.650> didn't<00:03:27.920> ask<00:03:27.980> nothing<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:29.090> do<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:29.360> on<00:03:29.450> the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
I didn't ask nothing to do it on the

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.550 
I didn't ask nothing to do it on the
four<00:03:29.720> five<00:03:30.170> eight<00:03:30.350> it<00:03:30.500> but<00:03:32.019> yeah<00:03:33.019> at<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.320> time

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
four five eight it but yeah at the time

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.910 
four five eight it but yeah at the time
or<00:03:33.739> whatever<00:03:33.890> and<00:03:34.340> he<00:03:34.549> sees<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:36.680> by

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
or whatever and he sees that by

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.240 
or whatever and he sees that by
compressing<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:39.530> compress<00:03:39.769> for<00:03:40.010> anything

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
compressing it to compress for anything

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.789 
compressing it to compress for anything
so<00:03:41.110> it's<00:03:42.110> usually<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:42.860> piece<00:03:43.070> of<00:03:43.250> crap<00:03:43.489> like

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.490 
all identical so I'm going to do
roadside<00:04:46.130> clearance<00:04:46.700> maybe<00:04:47.660> tomorrow<00:04:47.990> I'll

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
roadside clearance maybe tomorrow I'll

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.000 
roadside clearance maybe tomorrow I'll
measure<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:48.980> and<00:04:49.790> then<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:52.720> just<00:04:53.720> got<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:54.010> I'm

the point of this whole exercise anyway
so<00:05:07.100> yeah<00:05:08.030> tomorrow<00:05:08.390> this<00:05:08.600> ring<00:05:08.900> gap<00:05:09.140> and<00:05:10.750> maybe

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
so yeah tomorrow this ring gap and maybe

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.159 
so yeah tomorrow this ring gap and maybe
do<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:12.740> side<00:05:12.979> clearance<00:05:13.340> for<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.150> crank<00:05:14.419> come

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
do the side clearance for the crank come

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.190 
do the side clearance for the crank come
in<00:05:15.320> with<00:05:15.440> that<00:05:15.470> but<00:05:16.010> at<00:05:16.820> any<00:05:17.030> rate<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:18.669> things

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.270 
plastic edge unless unless I'm just
blind<00:05:32.090> and<00:05:32.750> I<00:05:33.200> was<00:05:33.350> reading<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:33.800> plastic<00:05:34.160> edge

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
blind and I was reading the plastic edge

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.610 
blind and I was reading the plastic edge
at<00:05:34.490> two<00:05:34.760> and<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:35.810> should<00:05:35.990> have<00:05:36.080> been<00:05:36.140> reading<00:05:36.500> at

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
at two and I should have been reading at

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.930 
at two and I should have been reading at
three<00:05:36.979> that<00:05:37.250> would<00:05:37.370> make<00:05:37.520> a<00:05:37.550> lot<00:05:37.790> more<00:05:37.940> sense

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
three that would make a lot more sense

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.860 
three that would make a lot more sense
if<00:05:40.940> it<00:05:41.270> was<00:05:42.010> if<00:05:43.010> it<00:05:43.220> was<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.490> earth<00:05:43.790> 40<00:05:44.210> you

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
if it was if it was the earth 40 you

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.650 
if it was if it was the earth 40 you
know<00:05:45.050> as<00:05:45.890> opposed<00:05:46.220> to<00:05:46.280> cause<00:05:46.430> when<00:05:46.790> I<00:05:46.820> did<00:05:47.600> the

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
know as opposed to cause when I did the

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.240 
know as opposed to cause when I did the
last<00:05:47.780> video<00:05:48.050> or<00:05:48.410> shell<00:05:48.650> but<00:05:48.890> it<00:05:48.979> wasn't

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
last video or shell but it wasn't

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.030 
last video or shell but it wasn't
focusing<00:05:49.970> but<00:05:50.150> I<00:05:50.410> mean<00:05:51.410> there's<00:05:51.590> no<00:05:51.710> much<00:05:51.860> of<00:05:51.979> a

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
focusing but I mean there's no much of a

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.300 
focusing but I mean there's no much of a
difference<00:05:52.400> on<00:05:52.700> the<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:54.620> page<00:05:54.860> and<00:05:55.190> that's

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
difference on the the page and that's

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.430 
difference on the the page and that's
for<00:05:55.460> sure

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
for sure

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.830 
for sure
of<00:05:57.360> on<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:58.450> paper<00:05:58.660> between<00:05:58.950> 2030<00:05:59.950> thousands

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
of on the paper between 2030 thousands

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.540 
of on the paper between 2030 thousands
maybe<00:06:01.840> that's<00:06:02.230> that<00:06:02.650> would<00:06:03.130> make<00:06:03.310> more<00:06:03.490> sense

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
maybe that's that would make more sense

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.340 
maybe that's that would make more sense
if<00:06:04.150> I<00:06:04.600> just<00:06:04.780> socked<00:06:05.680> it<00:06:05.860> I<00:06:06.010> bowling<00:06:06.460> stuff<00:06:07.350> and

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
if I just socked it I bowling stuff and

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.650 
if I just socked it I bowling stuff and
then<00:06:09.220> that<00:06:09.430> if<00:06:09.610> the<00:06:09.790> plastic<00:06:10.180> edge<00:06:10.300> can<00:06:10.570> you

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
then that if the plastic edge can you

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.220 
then that if the plastic edge can you
mean<00:06:10.810> at<00:06:10.960> three<00:06:11.200> thousand<00:06:11.620> seven<00:06:11.830> inch<00:06:11.980> and<00:06:13.230> I

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
mean at three thousand seven inch and I

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.850 
mean at three thousand seven inch and I
just<00:06:14.500> screwed<00:06:15.130> that<00:06:15.280> up<00:06:16.170> I'm<00:06:17.170> totally<00:06:17.560> happy

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
with that as well because that's

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.120 
with that as well because that's
