00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.480
 with as product the twins therefore find themselves on the two-point circuit 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.669
 Furthermore 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:23.310
 champion of France the very last one brand new is a second and is a 

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:24.030
 place of life 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.699
 and then for them 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.109
 in 2009 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.859
 it starts to get old no it's not true it's good if laurent our friend 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.230
 e marc laboulle 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.780
 she acquired the file filed to the first question simply 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.649
 already marked which heads could rather take for you to be able 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:40.260
 like that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 entrust us with the popular car develop more possible 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.390
 but a dramatic twist when he proposed this idea 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.070
 finally ended up being told banco the next day right at 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.790
 wedding and calendars everyone was available 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.190
 this is the pleasure for me to have tons tons I entrust my car today 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.740
 so this break developed by marc throughout the season 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.580
 next season it's a nice reward to be for the pilot too 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.420
 telly we are told by the new champion of France lunch he has 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.710
 to face a championship that we know well on motors tv is 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.940
 the draft championship bravo of road notice and then already the 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.940
 look to the future from the very first rounds they also went 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.150
 with a good osmosis in the car missing that's a 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.900
 as for my first job 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.480
 a good warm up for next year 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.810
 meanwhile perhaps other successes and were signed in France are also the 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.810
 result of a partnership become over time galtier 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.760
 I am actually taken with both passion 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.560
 for for enthusiasts 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 lyon for this sport but for that she had also 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.380
 2 a friendship story it's true that in friendship contest the 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.870
 opportunity to share passions for that that 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.870
 a real nation to be made 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 we want to stay together we always want to go further and 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.840
 and have a stroke of advancement 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.359
 for next season again in the european championship the paddock of all 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.680
 they still live from the presence of many teams 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.059
 on this monday morning which of course m technological 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.489
 it is true it is necessary to raise the mechanical temperature and each 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.639
 of the five members of this structure is at work designing this 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.939
 gap stéphane orré presents us the beast this car 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.819
 we left line as original 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.849
 the citroen 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.599
 but we made to feel less car 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.009
 so because of 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.989
 the wheel arch 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.099
 where is the worst so all the trains running so it's really 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.289
 it's not a basic wrc many were 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:40.579
 you can go beyond taking a sign a strong technical partnership 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:43.569
 but it was done internally 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.299
 particularity is that this car is to keep the engine 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.759
 the amount on stage there too 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.919
 mississippi the complete study of a dune must he continue to stick a 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.309
 signage of gaulle but we were getting closer 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:59.419
 of the society according m who today to work with them decide on 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.309
 the question wrc actions 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:06.180
 and we wanted to keep this position of the author to be able to work on the 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:07.759
 unemployment metrics 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.759
 get closer percent and better upset 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.619
 the moment there it was also a driving base that we knew for a hundred 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:17.099
 voice that we could develop with them 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.999
 the day before today 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.290
 this is his cross-bike car 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.889
 francfort ali cross 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.889
 and to be forgiven 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.849
 m when 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.370
 now imagine some evocative figures 520 horsepower 90 vehicles of 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:55.669
 more but 300 km 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.829
 this c4 without contact with him 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.879
 it's time to check it out on the ground 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.039
 West of Paris 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:05.049
 the passengers marc laboulle hoping that we will not have 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.610
 winnower 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.610
 as a reminder 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.409
 Already registered 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.979
 the schoolboy that even to ride the first three reports try not to 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.979
 not be held in turns you jump in the face 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.819
 and then pdt the errors otherwise 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.150
 do not accelerate he regretted in Morocco we were afraid 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.050
 second in a series of three days before spending more than an hour 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:24.689
 the transmission 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:25.789
 but on the other hand 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.599
 enough to appreciate how one's feet the car rolls on its axis to 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.999
 ready to burst forth from the bend under the devastating effects of 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.999
 overeating 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.710
 all of this formulates devoted his stroller and five reports of the trees 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.639
 yes braking too 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.860
 is impressive 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.719
 on this circuit we do not know how to accelerate it like a dragster and 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:56.020
 supported braking but frankly it's the c4 that the eu 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.059
 I could only glimpse the capabilities of this name 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:00.279
 but that his drivers have talent
