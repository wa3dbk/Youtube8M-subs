00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.200
 I am the márcio Werneck consultant 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.099
 development of goodness products 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.869
 diver with more than 30 years of 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.210
 experience and I'm here today to 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.330
 explain the concept behind the 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.099
 development of our equipment 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.189
 today the concept of dry clothes to 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.050
 out of this vision that is a drought can only 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.120
 be used by divers and technicians 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.699
 Cave diver or divers 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.480
 who were diving in the gil even in 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.400
 weapons 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.620
 there twenty-five degrees of 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.300
 has a longer duration time if 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.440
 you are one of a folder if you are a 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.690
 diving subject 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.949
 if you are a biologist who will expose yourself 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.489
 more time 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.559
 is to this condition its function of 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.600
 diver your work will stay 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.299
 much better and more comfortable than 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.150
 you will get the thermal protection 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:03.879
 better even safer 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.659
 based on this, we decided to invest 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.890
 in a unique outfit because the investment 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.680
 or partner 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.260
 she was usually way above the clothes 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.330
 again or we can work on 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.399
 a very cost effective tone 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.189
 of dry clothes is based on the 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.929
 mainly in the sealants could 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.909
 clarify which water should not 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:33.700
 enter thanks to your high - end skills and 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:35.679
 and the admission of gas that can 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.460
 can be made by means of the 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:44.170
 admission and exhaustion hour 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.569
 besides we have protection 12 perceb 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.520
 which is another important point is that 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.609
 we have a completely true zip for 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.799
 that does not enter water and 1 on the team 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:56.590
 to protect this many 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.170
 divers had problems in 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.479
 about making a trip to invest 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.990
 in a dry suit suddenly a sealant of 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.850
 if you tear the sealant exchange with glue 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.800
 until very recently it was something 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.459
 that lasted two or three days you had 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.690
 difficulties places to do what 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.640
 often made it impossible to 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.790
 use of this outfit on a trip 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.990
 now first point differential nexe 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.700
 drive is that we invest in a 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.180
 where you can exchange 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.810
 the sealant easily to a 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.050
 diving 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.459
 both the wrist sealants and the 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.400
 sealants for neck 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.410
 ah ah ah ah the quality of this land 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.930
 normally oscillating in most cases. 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.750
 clothing and a latex sealant and sealants 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.239
 are less resistant are less 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.030
 flexible we are placing before 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.280
 silicone on this street and oscillating silicone 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.180
 silicone is more resistant 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.230
 he is more flexible and first of all he 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.660
 is antiallergic 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.370
 this brought a great differential then 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.190
 the quality of ceilândia 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.400
 but the condition of being able to change 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.530
 sealants at any dive site 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.650
 makes the dry clothes he takes out is 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.160
 has a great differential because 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.329
 the diver will not miss diving 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:22.150
 besides we made a cut 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:25.450
 differentiated from most of the people who 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.090
 I started with the swim in my clothes 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.280
 has a difficulty that is the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.950
 equilibrium of the state since not only it 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.400
 will have to deal with at bc in high school 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.560
 how is he going to have to deal with the clothes is 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.489
 necessary to inject a new measure 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.150
 10 and control and it is during the ascent 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.579
 through the balls or the clothes that 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.139
 they are usually wider waist 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:55.209
 tend to accumulate air in this part of the 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.069
 causing the diver to have more 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.510
 difficulty to balance 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:04.060
 is a drawing that lowers the volume of the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.730
 clothes decrease the drag for swimming 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.769
 and decreasing the chance of this air 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.690
 to locate in the legs then it is much more 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.880
 even easy for the beginner diver 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.650
 maintain the position of the training and maintain the 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.019
 swimming position keep the balance 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.180
 state 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.039
 thanks to this desire to quality 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.700
 valve exposure 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:27.400
 we have a perfect flow between the 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.950
 the speed of admission and the 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.530
 exhaustion that make you wear these clothes 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.870
 has a very good balance control 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.720
 best 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.090
 the clothes on the market it is made of 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.030
 tri-laminated material which is a 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.760
 is not understandable then it does not 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:49.620
 there is no impact not if the control of 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:52.710
 buoyancy and reinforced with sanity 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:57.600
 where we can get bigger 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:00.630
 feel that even then they do not 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.860
 were placed where there is need of 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.250
 mobility as in the case of the points of 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.560
 knee and yes only at the point where you sit 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.110
 where you can drag in the case up to a 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.470
 service where the belts of your 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.110
 your pc's equipment can generate trio 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.480
 one of the points is extremely important 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.240
 for comfort this clothing mainly 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.730
 to put investing is what we people 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.290
 call everyone by the school that is this 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:33.690
 that we will see here in the region. 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.590
 of abdomen victory 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:41.100
 the diver has to take put 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:45.900
 this condition and then it can adjust 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:47.730
 this clothes in a way that all of this 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.080
 has completely adjusted in what 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.600
 drag him 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.670
 another point is also fine tune 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.830
 that it exists is internally a 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.780
 elastic that can be adjusted to 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.200
 prevent clothing from remaining too 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.390
 that the waist to the back 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.140
 ex drae clothing has its seams 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:10.200
 vulcanized with polymer which increases 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.990
 resistance to the durability and 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.270
 safety of this mouth is that it also extracts 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.820
 was designed with two velcro pockets 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.160
 side panels for accessories that are 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.340
 easily accessible using only one 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.340
 year 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:30.580
 the dry front design zipper to the 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:33.020
 contrary to the clothes they wear on their backs 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:36.259
 facilitates the diver to remove and 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.690
 put the blame alone this lightning has gone 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:40.699
 designed with neoprene boots 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.620
 consolated rigid coupled 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:45.440
 this kind of boot gives more comfort 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.900
 during a dive and more resistance 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.759
 not only to use open fins but 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.970
 especially if the diver has to 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:55.850
 walking in environment of cave in environment 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.650
 where the soles will be more 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.690
 required 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.910
 is important to emphasize that the project 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.620
 ex bryan was not only made for 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.139
 technical divers or scuba diver 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.419
 cave many divers will power 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:11.600
 take advantage of this equipment and 

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:14.479
 because mainly because of this 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:18.380
 the quality of the valves of the 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:21.500
 ceilândia rapid exchange system will 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.000
 be much easier and cheaper 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.460
 keep a dive site 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.949
 it will be much easier to learn how to use 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.460
 this clothing and take advantage of all this 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:34.220
 comfort learn to wear dry clothes 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.470
 it is something that you easily learn your 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.500
 instructor with his diving school at a 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.810
 course that usually lasts two days 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.120
 do not miss this opportunity you will 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.460
 know another level of diving a 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.740
 another level of comfort from diving to 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:52.310
 From the moment you turn out to be 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:55.000
 The diver who wears dry clothes feels 

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.000
 sex drive
