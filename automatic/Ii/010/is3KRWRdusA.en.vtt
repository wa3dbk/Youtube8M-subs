00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.570
 since last October 20 the new expected is already on sale in Spain 

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:19.919
 delivery of the saga patel fin which on this occasion puts us in the year 2149 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.900
 his argument tells us how a new glacial era brings the earth 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.589
 Arming most of the planet's resources 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.359
 and beginning then a war for survival will face 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.479
 to the European Union against the police an Asian bread the latter led 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:42.479
 mainly by the powerful Russia 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.330
 m 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.990
 p 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.100
 to recompose our layout a total of ten battle maps being 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.460
 well all of them 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.710
 play is from europe and north africa and presenting a larger size 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 these goalless draw 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.880
 during the game we can choose one of the four used equipment 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.350
 specifically wearable the knowledge soldier he is tall 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.130
 engineer and the support 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.619
 each endowed with some exclusive ability that differentiates us 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.140
 there is also the possibility of customizing them askatasuna 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 which we have to unlock 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.520
 as far as your busy alibi is not too many news 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.109
 we are before a super first person thought to be judged by 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.580
 teams 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.050
 when the truth comes 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.050
 64 players 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.690
 calama little of being players 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.750
 modalities 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.020
 the claim we have conquered, we comply with the catches and protect the flags of the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.819
 different 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.020
 control points and the new titanic wall where the goal consists of 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:16.969
 destroy 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.849
 the titan of the team 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.849
 a powerful heavily protected airship 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.629
 At the time of moving around the stage we can make use of pariah classes of 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.189
 both aerial and ground vehicles 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.189
 we are divided these basically into two groups 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:44.739
 apart and those of transport although all will always be equipped with some 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.739
 type of weapon 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.159
 One of the improvements that we have appreciated in this regard is that now 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.620
 difference of what happened in batel fifths the handling of the vehicles 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.509
 aerial result 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:03.689
 it was easier 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.179
 being able to be dominated 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:08.929
 to any player with only a few practical games 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.059
 already last year 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.059
 while compacted technically 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.859
 because we will especially appreciate if we have a team that 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.739
 although still the jump of quality with respect to paper film all has not been 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.219
 as high as you would expect since both titles 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.219
 share the same engine 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.750
 in conclusion for 600 thousand 142 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.870
 goes a step further in the series so a new futuristic design that to our 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.090
 seems to be quite a success unchecked in this way gave another 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.640
 super multiplayer 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.269
 set in real conflict of the past 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.269
 or the present 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.589
 on the contrary as a more than attractive detail we believe that we have known 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:11.359
 innovate enough 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.019
 said technical section comes to play him being basically the same ones that already 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.900
 had but seen from another perspective 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.460
 although now its fun is still almost insurmountable 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.469
 resulting therefore one of the most recommended titles of the genre
