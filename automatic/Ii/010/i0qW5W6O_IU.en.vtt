00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 a good speaker for traveling 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.600
 Today I want to give you the boom of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.220
 logitech once more detail what 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.780
 I think of this speaker and whether 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.519
 it is worth buying from my side 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.519
 after the intro, you will experience a lot of fun 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.940
 I have here the olive blue variant 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.530
 which in my opinion something like one 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.180
 fishing net from the sheaths of the 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.310
 booms is kept green here 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.900
 the blue piece face also the yellow one 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.820
 loud and soft keys and the one 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.920
 The switch is completely off 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.480
 rubber made by the mix of these 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.629
 two different materials is the 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.250
 Exercise even protected against water and dust 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.140
 the boom are operated by a battery 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.940
 there is still something on the bottom 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.320
 a micro usb input to the battery after 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.040
 about ten hours of use again 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.930
 recharge 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.600
 furthermore, we will find one another 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.670
 3.5mm jack for the for this 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.860
 type of mp3 player can be used 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.360
 the above no bluetooth has to 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.010
 good last down then a little more 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.650
 Hook around, for example, a carabiner 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.570
 there hook the logitech extreme 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.760
 handy he is eight inches high and 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.220
 has a diameter of 65 centimeters 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.270
 since the blue rubber is made of rubber 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.310
 speakers not slippery 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.330
 also from the processing in the for 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.460
 positively pleased 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.390
 there are no survivals and everything 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.520
 fits as it should 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.290
 but the most important thing is of course 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.600
 Sounded and this has me completely 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.700
 It really convinces everyone 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.350
 kind of music so that the heights and 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.150
 in the middle are really well balanced 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.100
 but also the bassist is not too strong and 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.780
 not so weak that he is for very 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.640
 watery music a bit weak though 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.820
 normal the songs from the charts 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.200
 which sounds really wonderful 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.690
 All in all, I can exercise in 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.310
 logitech competitions not only recommend 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.330
 because he sounded great but because you 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.810
 take them with you almost everywhere 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.150
 can 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.740
 The easiest way is always again 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.780
 to go the electronics market of his choice 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.790
 and the speaker to hear there sample 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.530
 I would really appreciate it from you 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.120
 in the comments listen to which 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.070
 speakers can you recommend me 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.460
 then I thank you in time to foot 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.960
 see 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.530
 I hope he plays the next video too 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.530
