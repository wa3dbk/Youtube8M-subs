00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
somewhere on the internet and then stick

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.170

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you can basically just do the same by

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.700 
you can basically just do the same by
copying<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.579> files<00:00:44.910> over<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.510> whatnot<00:00:45.870> well

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.030 
the shotgun but yeah guys that's pretty
much<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.140> can<00:03:43.260> do<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:43.590> with<00:03:43.769> any

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
much it you can do this with any

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.509 
much it you can do this with any
character<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.640> want<00:03:44.850> at<00:03:45.060> any<00:03:45.420> level<00:03:45.900> and

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
character you want at any level and

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.220 
character you want at any level and
until<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.610> gets<00:03:47.760> patched<00:03:48.000> it's<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.630> best<00:03:49.019> way

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
until it gets patched it's the best way

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.350 
until it gets patched it's the best way
for<00:03:49.260> getting<00:03:49.560> moonstones<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.489> think<00:03:50.820> it's

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
for getting moonstones I think it's

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.539 
for getting moonstones I think it's
thirty<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.870> time<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.440> if<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.980> just<00:03:53.250> want<00:03:53.459> to

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
thirty a time and if you just want to

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.310 
thirty a time and if you just want to
rush<00:03:53.700> through<00:03:53.940> like<00:03:54.600> without<00:03:54.750> siling<00:03:55.260> the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
rush through like without siling the

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.020 
rush through like without siling the
weapons<00:03:55.590> straight<00:03:55.830> away<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.640> can<00:03:56.790> pretty

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
weapons straight away you can pretty

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.229 
weapons straight away you can pretty
much<00:03:57.150> do<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.810> full<00:03:58.260> lap<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.860> about<00:03:59.239> 30

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239
