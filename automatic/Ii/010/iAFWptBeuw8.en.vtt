Oh

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.190 
Oh
sprout<00:02:40.150> coming<00:02:40.420> out<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.689> that's<00:02:40.810> going<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.079> be

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
sprout coming out and that's going to be

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.250 
sprout coming out and that's going to be
a<00:02:41.230> new<00:02:41.680> fruit<00:02:42.310> tree<00:02:42.519> oh<00:02:42.870> yeah<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.079> we<00:02:44.170> can

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
a new fruit tree oh yeah so we can

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.809 
a new fruit tree oh yeah so we can
assess<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.709> over<00:02:44.859> there<00:02:45.040> toss<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.549> over<00:02:45.670> there

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
assess it over there toss it over there

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.929 
assess it over there toss it over there
and<00:02:46.390> how<00:02:46.510> long<00:02:46.569> will<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.840> take<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.230> be<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.349> tree

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
and how long will it take to be a tree

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.280 
and how long will it take to be a tree
it'll<00:02:48.939> actually<00:02:49.120> these<00:02:49.510> trees<00:02:49.870> are<00:02:49.900> only

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
it'll actually these trees are only

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.420 
it'll actually these trees are only
about<00:02:50.799> four<00:02:51.760> years<00:02:51.879> old<00:02:52.090> oh<00:02:52.390> my<00:02:52.689> gosh<00:02:53.430> and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
about four years old oh my gosh and

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.550 
about four years old oh my gosh and
they're<00:02:54.579> already<00:02:54.790> yielding<00:02:55.269> this<00:02:55.420> cool<00:02:55.810> so

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
they're already yielding this cool so

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.720 
they're already yielding this cool so
what<00:02:56.709> happens<00:02:57.010> what<00:02:57.189> has<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.400> happen<00:02:57.430> before

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
what happens what has to happen before

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.550 
what happens what has to happen before
this<00:02:58.060> can<00:02:58.120> become<00:02:58.420> chocolate<00:02:59.140> like<00:02:59.230> we<00:02:59.409> know

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
this can become chocolate like we know

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.190 
this can become chocolate like we know
okay<00:03:00.099> people<00:03:00.939> do<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.299> they<00:03:01.599> do<00:03:01.659> it<00:03:01.870> different

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
okay people do is they do it different

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.309 
okay people do is they do it different
ways<00:03:02.549> actually<00:03:03.549> david<00:03:04.540> wolfe<00:03:04.659> his<00:03:04.840> credit<00:03:05.170> can

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
ways actually david wolfe his credit can

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.440 
ways actually david wolfe his credit can
come<00:03:05.530> up<00:03:05.650> with<00:03:05.739> this<00:03:05.799> new<00:03:06.010> method<00:03:06.159> of<00:03:06.450> actually

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
come up with this new method of actually

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.300 
come up with this new method of actually
not<00:03:07.659> fermenting<00:03:08.230> them<00:03:08.379> drawing<00:03:08.799> them<00:03:09.099> and

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
makers ferment them but they call it a

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.390 
makers ferment them but they call it a
hundred<00:03:16.569> percent<00:03:16.750> or<00:03:17.109> ninety<00:03:17.409> percent<00:03:17.560> one
