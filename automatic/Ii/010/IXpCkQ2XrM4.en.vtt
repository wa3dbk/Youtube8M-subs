00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.170
 now today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:09.150
 same as the birthday composed by 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.030
 pennants that have letters and some 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.530
 boy yes I hope you like it today 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.840
 We will teach the step by step 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.910
 to make our pennants we are going to 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.550
 need cards of the colors that 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.490
 more we like a rope to tie the 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.220
 at the end a rule one meter one 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.920
 tool to make holes a 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.870
 compass scissors and a pencil 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.920
 according to the size that we want them to have 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.829
 our flags we will mark in the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.570
 I want it to be more or less like that 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.109
 what I'm going to do is going to divide the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.250
 cardboard of 12 in 12 centimeters what 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:50.660
 I will simply be mark 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.660
 of 12 in 12 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.719
 once not all the marks made 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.719
 we will open the compass 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.930
 and we will place 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.460
 and in it 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.909
 we have to make a 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.450
 he also has it 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.990
 A) Yes 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.990
 why 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.400
 then once we have done all 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.890
 our own brands have to unite 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.930
 helping us with the rule the center of 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.200
 reel with the sides that we had 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.200
 marked 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.290
 we started by joining the sides to 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.810
 center and at the end of joining them all 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.790
 we have also joined the two peaks of 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.250
 up this way we would have a 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.140
 pennant here and another here now what 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.140
 let's do is cut the two 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.270
 Well, as you can see we would have 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.070
 our first pennants if any 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.560
 has some mark of the act simply 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.180
 we will have to erase it now we have the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.040
 same process with all the cards 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.170
 of the colors that we want to have 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.180
 our flags we are going to 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.670
 do in these other three because 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.310
 we want the beautiful shades of blue and 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.640
 the white combine 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.860
 we would have our pennants of the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.930
 colors that we have chosen in this case 3 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.050
 because no longer would come out quite the number 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.599
 of pennants now the next step is 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.599
 optional we will do it and 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.420
 is to draw some letters from another 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.880
 color preferably that stands out 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.709
 the initial tones in which we write 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.840
 a message we are going to make happy 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.730
 birthday 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.860
 to make the letters that will go inside 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.160
 the pennants more or less of this 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.620
 We have made some guides in which 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.540
 let's draw inside the letters 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.780
 so that all are more or less the same 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.780
 size 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.610
 once we have the letters done let's 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.610
 to cut them 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.240
 as you can see we have already trimmed 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.700
 our flags all our 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.940
 letters and we have trimmed some whiskers in 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.800
 black cardboard so it stays a little 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.840
 more fun the final result 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.450
 now let's create the composition 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.180
 choosing the range of colors that 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.060
 more we like and pasting the letters and the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.220
 mustaches on the pennants 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.959
 as you see we had already formed our 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.300
 pennants that we have been alternating 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.760
 colors and spaces we have placed a 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.610
 mustache now what we are going to do is 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.340
 take the device to make holes and 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.200
 let's go making a hole in each 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.480
 end of each pennant to 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.170
 later to be able to pass the rope through 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.390
 they 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.950
 finally we just have to take the 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.050
 rope that we have chosen for 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.340
 hang your pennants and go 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.340
 through the holes 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.800
 once for the rope but we'll have to 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.050
 hang them where we like and like 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.510
 you see this would be the final result 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.370
