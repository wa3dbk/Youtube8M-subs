00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
review of my laptop but I'm just gonna

review of my laptop but I'm just gonna
look<00:00:22.260> at<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.439> again<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.670> case<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.880> didn't

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
look at it again just in case you didn't

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.380 
look at it again just in case you didn't
see<00:00:24.119> there<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:25.070> we<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.820> volume

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
see there and we have just volume

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.120 
see there and we have just volume
controls<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.189> for<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> speakers<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.420> just

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
controls and for the speakers and just

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.240 
controls and for the speakers and just
microphones<00:00:32.719> that<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.260> boost<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.010> input

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
microphones that I can boost the input

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.650 
microphones that I can boost the input
from<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> microphone<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:37.010> then<00:00:38.010> you've<00:00:38.399> got

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
from the microphone and then you've got

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.150 
from the microphone and then you've got
graphic<00:00:39.660> equalizers<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.770> make<00:00:40.920> sure

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
graphic equalizers so you can make sure

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.220 
graphic equalizers so you can make sure
you<00:00:41.430> don't<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.120> too<00:00:42.300> much<00:00:42.360> bass<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:42.989> less

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
you don't have too much bass or less

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.279 
you don't have too much bass or less
bass<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.980> actually<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:45.289> patrols

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
bass and then you actually have patrols

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.240 
bass and then you actually have patrols
and<00:00:46.590> I'd<00:00:47.520> leave<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.000> as<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.570> as<00:00:48.930> SRS<00:00:49.860> had<00:00:50.100> it

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
and I'd leave it as it as SRS had it

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.010 
and I'd leave it as it as SRS had it
before<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.030> put<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> base<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.750> certain

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
before but just put the base of certain

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.630 
before but just put the base of certain
max<00:00:52.260> an<00:00:53.190> action<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.180> sounds<00:00:54.570> pretty<00:00:54.840> good

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
max an action so that sounds pretty good

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.700 
max an action so that sounds pretty good
I'm<00:00:56.640> recording<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.449> even<00:00:58.140> has<00:00:58.350> nice

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
I'm recording it even has nice

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.420 
I'm recording it even has nice
compensation<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.609> microphone<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
compensation for the microphone and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.280 
compensation for the microphone and
acoustic<00:01:02.430> echo<00:01:02.760> cancellation<00:01:03.019> which<00:01:04.019> means

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
acoustic echo cancellation which means

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.840 
acoustic echo cancellation which means
that<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.860> music<00:01:05.220> playing<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that if you have music playing on the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.179 
that if you have music playing on the
speakers<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.930> laptop<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.650> will<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.950> cancel

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
speakers of laptop it will just cancel

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:08.810 
speakers of laptop it will just cancel
out

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
out

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.200 
out
you<00:01:09.210> won't<00:01:09.390> hear<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.810> microphone

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
you won't hear that on the microphone

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.550 
you won't hear that on the microphone
and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.750> shortcuts<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and then you just have shortcuts for the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.770 
and then you just have shortcuts for the
windows<00:01:14.130> sample<00:01:14.520> 50<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.330> less<00:01:15.630> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
windows sample 50 so you can less of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.280 
windows sample 50 so you can less of
that<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:16.020> well<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.630> reset<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.200> as

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that as well and you can reset it as

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.060 
that as well and you can reset it as
well<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.170> choice<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.560> music<00:01:22.680> here

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
well so I for the choice of music here

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.859 
well so I for the choice of music here
but<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.520> chose<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.970> song<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.720> was<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
but I chose this song because it was the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
but I chose this song because it was the
best<00:01:25.110> quality<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.040> had<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.270> best

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
best quality that I had do the best

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.420 
best quality that I had do the best
chance<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.110> we're<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> show<00:01:29.369> you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
chance and we're just going to show you

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.819 
chance and we're just going to show you
what<00:01:29.700> SRS<00:01:30.360> sounds<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.930> turned<00:01:31.229> off<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.710> then

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
what SRS sounds is turned off and then

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:52.860 
what SRS sounds is turned off and then
back<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.310> again<00:01:32.369> okay<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.390> went<00:01:33.570> off

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:01.720 

okay<00:01:53.870> and<00:01:54.110> then<00:01:54.230> this<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.650> turned<00:01:55.100> on

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:09.739 

I<00:02:04.630> know

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:09.749 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.360 

so<00:02:10.749> it<00:02:10.810> really<00:02:11.019> does<00:02:11.260> make<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.469> huge<00:02:11.590> difference

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
so it really does make a huge difference

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.020 
so it really does make a huge difference
in<00:02:12.670> bass<00:02:13.209> deafness<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.260> space<00:02:15.040> around<00:02:15.400> the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
in bass deafness and space around the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.119 
in bass deafness and space around the
ears<00:02:16.239> now<00:02:16.780> I've<00:02:16.870> got<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.049> song<00:02:17.260> here<00:02:17.499> most<00:02:17.680> basis

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
ears now I've got a song here most basis

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.709 
ears now I've got a song here most basis
because<00:02:18.340> produces<00:02:18.879> obviously<00:02:19.269> won't<00:02:19.389> be<00:02:19.540> that

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:19.719 
because produces obviously won't be that

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.569 
because produces obviously won't be that
much<00:02:19.900> because<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:20.650> little<00:02:20.920> nervous<00:02:21.370> because

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
much because just little nervous because

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:31.490 
much because just little nervous because
it's<00:02:21.999> worth<00:02:22.209> looking<00:02:22.540> at<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.870> is<00:02:26.109> SRS<00:02:26.680> off
